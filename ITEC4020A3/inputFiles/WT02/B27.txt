Virology, Wisconsin Character Absent-minded, impulsive, driven, too gentle, never loses temper Favorite music Mozart Piano Sonata #331 Other interests tennis, golf The Story Tommy T-Cell is a biodetective. His job is to patrol the human bodyinvestigating suspicious characters. Think of the cells in your bodyas shops on a city street. Billions and trillions of police detectiveslike Tommy T-Cell are driving by all the time looking in all the shopwindows for something unusual going on. Each T-Cell is trained to findone and only one type of criminal. Tommy is also known as a HelperT-Cell, part of the body's immune system, but you can think of him asa cop. As Tommy cruises through blood and tissue he meets a macrophage--aspecialized cell that's like a garbage truck in the body. Macrophagesgo around collecting bits of your own living and dead cells. They findparts of invading viruses and bacteria, dust, pollen and any junkthat's floating around. They stick pieces of this garbage on theiroutside surfaces in special places where detectives like Tommy can seethem. Tommy has unique Y-shaped spikes all over his surface calledreceptor sites that recognize one kind of garbage. (In 1983 Tak Makdiscovered these T-Cell receptors.) Tommy's got about 5000 of them andeach one is exactly the same. No other T-Cell has spikes like Tommy's.His are specially designed to fit a tiny bit of protein from a virusthat causes colds. Tommy tries his receptors on the macrophage, butnothing happens, so he moves on. The whole thing takes less than asecond. As Tommy floats along he remembers his days years ago at the body'sPolice Academy, the Thymus, where he learned how to tell foreigninvaders from good cells that belong to the body. Your thymus is afist sized gland located just above your heart. It is bigger and moreactive when you are a baby. That's when it gives all the T-Celldetectives in your body their life-long assignments. T-Cells start outin the thymus as police cadets. They get trained by specialmacrophages that show new T-cells every possible little bit of garbagethat your normal healthy body produces. These bits of you are called"self". T-Cells whose receptors recognize self are killed in thethymus before they can leave. If they ever got out they would becomebad cops that attack good cells instead of invaders. Tommy finally cruises up to a macrophage that shows him a piece of acold virus. He checks it with his receptors. It's a match. Right awayTommy leaps into action. The virus has only been in the body for 5minutes. First Tommy sends out chemicals that signal regular policeofficers in the body--B cells--to make antibodies. Antibodies are likeheat-seeking missiles that zero in on a particular virus and kill it.Tommy also calls in a SWAT team of killer T-Cells and together they goout in search of the invader. They also start dividing rapidly;doubling in number about every 6 hours. It takes 4 days beforemillions of T-Cells, B-Cells and Killer T-Cells are mobilized to killall the virus in the body. They are some of the fastest dividing cellsin the body. One day Tommy is cruising the body on his usual rounds when he meets athug in a black leather jacket, an AIDS virus. He decides to check himout with his receptors, but before he can do anything, the littlecreep gets right inside Tommy through a tiny hole near the handle thatTommy uses when he visits macrophages. Viruses don't usually attackT-Cells but AIDS does. That's what makes AIDS so bad. Now that Tommyhas the AIDS virus, little bits of AIDS proteins will appear on hissurface. This makes Tommy look very bad to other cells in the immunesystem. Tommy sees a Killer T-Cell coming and says his prayers. Thisguy is trained to kill anything that looks foreign. The Killer T-Cellsees that bit of AIDS on Tommy and without a second thought he killshis boss. That's the end of Tommy. The tragedy of AIDS is that T-Cells are the mastermind detectives ofthe body's defence system, the ones who organize the other cops. OnceAIDS is inside a T-Cell they look like spies to the rest of the immunesystem. So the body kills off its best cops which then makes it harderto fight AIDS and any other infection. Most people with AIDS actuallydie of a common bug that would never kill someone with a healthyimmune system. History As a twelve year old in Hong Kong, Mak came from an upper middle classfamily in a predominantly white district. Mak is playing marbles inthe dirt outside their family villa. He is surrounded by Dutch andBritish boys. He is the only oriental. Mak's dad is a successful business man in Hong Kong and they live next door to the Consulates from Norway and Denmark. Tak liked to kick soccer balls and play. He wasn't particularly goodat school but his mother insisted that he do well and study hard. Hegot by partly because he was in a very bright group of about 20 kids.Most of them went to universities all over the world. Mak went to theUniversity of Wisconsin, then received a PhD from the University ofAlberta. In the early 70s Tak Mak began his research at the OntarioCancer Institute in Toronto where he is today. In 1983 he discoveredthe T-Cell receptor and since then has become a university professorat the U of Toronto and is also the Director of the Amgen ResearchInstitute in Toronto. The Science Tak Mak is an immunologist and a molecular biologist. He examines thestructure and function of molecules and cells in the human immune system,the way your body protects you from dirt and disease. His researchis also leading to cures of many auto-immune diseases where thebody's immune systems malfunctions. Diseases like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, myesthenia gravis, and others. Ever since Tak Mak discovered the genes for the T-Cell receptor he hasbeen using this knowledge to create "knock-out" mice. These are micewith missing DNA instructions for making just one protein in theimmune system. To Mak, the immune system is like a huge corporation that's so big andcomplicated you can't tell how it functions. But there is a systematicway you can find out. One day you take "John Smith" out of thebuilding and see what stops functioning. Maybe it's the mailroom. Nowyou know what John Smith does. Then you put John Smith back and youtry the same thing with another person. Eventually you find out howthe whole company works. Mak, along with many other researchers aroundthe world, is using a similar process to understand how the immunesystem works. The human immune system is very complicated and the following is just avery simple explanation of one major part. 1. Macrophages are like garbage collectors. They get bits of moleculesfrom invaders and present them to T-Cells for identification. 2. Helper T-Cells are the "masterminds" of the immune system. They usetheir receptors to identify invaders and send signals to B-Cells andKiller T-Cells to start the attack. Each T-Cell receptor recognizes oneshort piece of a protein molecule about 8 amino acids long. There aretrillions of unique T-Cells in your body. Enough so that you canrecognize any foreign molecule that nature throws at you. 3. Killer T-Cells are better at killing viruses. They can recognize a virus and then release a toxin that kills it and any others in the vicinity. 4. B-Cells are particularly good at destroying bacteria. They makeantibodies which glom onto bacteria and make them easy to kill.B-Cells can also trigger Mast cells which act as a kind of longterm memory for the immune system so a defence can be mounted fasterthe next time. Activity One of the greatest mysteries of the human immune system is how our100,000 genes can contain enough instructions to create not only us, but also several trillion differentT-Cells? In just the last ten years researchers have discovered the cleverway it works. Try to calculate the number of possible different T-cellreceptors that your body's immune system can make from just the few hundredprotein chains encoded in your immune system DNA. You need a calculator and these facts: T-cell receptors consist of two protein chains called alpha and beta.These are chains of amino acids. All proteins are made of these.Each chain has a bottom part that is constant like the trunk of atree. The tops of the chains are divided into three major sectionscalled Variable, Diversity, and Joining. Your DNA has the genetic codeto make 109 different protein segments for the variable portion of theAlpha chain. Similarly the alpha chain can have 61 different Joiningsegments. (The alpha chain has no Diversity segment.)It has only one constant trunk segment, so to calculate the number of possible different alpha chains just multiply 109 x 61 x 1 = 6649 Here is a table to help you: Variable Diversity Joining Constant Alpha 109 0 61 1 Beta 64 2 13 2 Now try to calculate the total possible number of T-Cell receptorsthat your immune system can make. (Hint: multiply everything together.)How big is your number? Is it in the millions, billions, or trillions? Now add this fact. A special enzyme randomly puts a fewextra amino acids between the Variable and Diversity chains. Theseare chosen randomly from our 21 amino acids, so you need tomultiply again by 21 three or four times for each chain.Now how many possibilities are there? Mystery Mak believes that in the future scientists will use the immune systemto clean out residual cancer cells after tumors are removed surgicallyor killed with chemotherapy. He also believes that much bettervaccines can be developed; vaccines for malaria and other diseasesthat are currently difficult to control. He also thinks that a curewill be found for juvenile diabetes. But for Mak the biggest unsolvedmystery of all is the way the immune system distinguishes betweenforeign invaders and "self". He says the thymus is only half the storybecause many new antigens (or foreign molecules) attack our bodieslong after the thymus has finished the bulk of its work trainingT-Cells.

Steacie Character: Busy, boyish, enthusiastic, helpful Favourite Music: Tchaikovsky Other Interests: skiing, walking, art, literature, poetry The Story At about 8 o'clock on a Thursday night John Polanyi walked into thejanitorial closet he called a laboratory. It was 1956. The young U. ofToronto lecturer couldn't expect much more. He wasn't even anassistant professor yet. Polanyi's first graduate student, KenCashion, wearing his regulation short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt said,"Well, I think we're ready for another run." "Did you check the seals on the 'Stokes'?" said Polanyi, glancing at the giantvacuum pump thwapping away in the corner. "Yes. They're not great, but I think she'll hold for one moreexperiment," said Cashion. The 'fresh-air' scent of ozone caught Polanyi's nose as Cashion openedthe hydrogen valve and flicked a switch. For this experiment theyneeded to break hydrogen gas (which occurs naturally in pairs ofhydrogen molecules) into single atoms. Ken had scrounged theelectrical discharge unit from a neon sign. By jolting the flow ofhydrogen with 6000 Volts of electricity, they could break the gas intosinglet hydrogen. Polanyi always liked the soft pinky neon glow itmade but he worried about hydrogen's explosive power. Some hastycalculations the day before had shown the lab would not blow up, butthey weren't entirely sure. As it turned out, the experiment was a success andthey recorded a spectrum that no one had ever seenbefore. Because Polanyi understood the source of the feeble lightemissions in his experiment, he was able to predict exactly whatkind of energy needed to be applied to make this chemical reactiontake place. His work helped to answer the question: How do you geta chemical reaction to go? Do you tickle the molecules or do youslam them together? It turns out that in some cases tickling works,in others you just have to slam them against each other. As Polanyisays, "The importance of this work was that we had a picture ofreacting atoms in the transition state."This understanding eventually resulted in Polanyi's Nobel prize. History: When Polanyi was 11 years old his father who was auniversity professor at U. of Manchester in England, sent him toCanada so that he would not be hurt during World War II. John stayedwith a U. of T. family in Toronto for 3 years. He remembers goingon a bicycle camping trip and reading the "Count of Monte Cristo". Hewas not interested in science much, though his dad was a chemistryprofessor. He was more interested in sociology and literature. The Science: 1. The Nobel prize winning experiment When Polanyi arrived at the University of Toronto in 1956 he decided to study this reaction. A lot of energyis given off when hydrogen and chlorine react to form hydrogen chloride, but nobody knew much about the energy.Little did Polanyi realize that this little reactionwould lead to a Nobel prize 30 years later. 2. Transition state For a brief instant at the moment of reaction, themolecules are in a transition state as they turn into newchemicals. Polanyi's experiments led to a picture of the arrangementof atoms in the transition state. Knowing this, he could predict what kind of vibrational and rotational energies would result in a chemicalreaction. 3. Chemiluminescence Polanyi used an infra-red spectrometer to measure thelight energy emitted by the new-born reaction products.The product molecules "chemiluminesce".From this very feeble emission of light, Polanyi was able to distinguish between vibrational and rotational energies in the molecule.Because he understood the source of this light he was able to propose vibrational and chemical lasers, the most powerful sources of infraredradiation ever developed. 4. The "Lab" Polanyi's graduate student assistant Ken Cashion set up the Nobel Prize winning apparatus and was the first to seethe result of the experiment. The two researchers had to "borrow"the spectrometer from others. If anyone had realized how they haddismantled it and modified it for their experiment, they would have been furious. Mystery for future generation: The molecular basis of life,devices of molecular dimension, observations of chemical reactionsunder much more widely varying conditions than currently possible.

The Story When you meet Michael Smith on an ordinary day he is likely to bewearing a shabby old sweater and trousers that long ago should havebeen sent to a charity like the Salvation Army. The Nobel laureate hascertainly not allowed success to go to his head--or his wardrobe. Maybeit's because of his working class origins in the Northern town of Blackpool,England. Shortly after the Nobel announcement in October 1993, he saidto his administrator Darlene Crowe, "If you ever see my behaviourstart to change and I get a swelled head with all this attention, Iwant you to give me a good swift kick." Darlene calls her boss "Mike". She remembers only one occasion on whichshe had to "kick" him. Mostly, he behaved himself. Smith didn't evenkeep the half million dollar Nobel prize money. He gave half of it toresearchers working on the genetics of schizophrenia, a widespreadmental disorder for which research money is scarce. The otherhalf he gave to Science World BC and to the Society for Canadian Womenin Science and Technology. As if that was not generous enough, Smithinvited 12 colleagues to come to Stockholm with him, all expenses paidby Smith, to share in the glory of the Nobel awards ceremony. He tookall his research assistants, post-doctoral fellows, and graduatestudents who had done the experiments leading to the prize. Maybe it's because Smith could afford it. He made a small fortune in1988 when he sold his share of Zymogenetics Inc., a Seattle-basedbiotechnology company that he co-founded in 1981. Smith's Nobelprize-winning genetic engineering techniques were used by Zymogenetics todevelop a strain of yeast implanted with the human gene for insulin.Together with the drug giant, Novo-Nordisk, they commercialized a betterprocess for the production of human insulin using yeast. Even then, Smith was generous with his profits. He bought a cabinin Whistler, a ski resort near Vancouver. He furnished it, and said it was for the use of his coworkers,staff, colleagues, friends and children. A sign up sheet hangsin his laboratory where people simply write in which weeks they'd liketo use the cabin. Smith didn't become successful by accident. He's a very hard worker,some say a workaholic. His office is of medium size, modestly furnishedwith a cluttered, lived-in look. He has a beautiful picture-window viewlooking out onto the treed UBC campus and the coast mountains in thedistance. One wall of the office is made of shallow shelves jammed fullof medals, awards and plaques for prizes he has won. Obviously proudof his accomplishments, Smith doesn't boast about them. Things did not always come easy for Smith. When he first submitted his great discoveryfor publication in Cell, a leading academic journal, it was rejected.The editors said that, "it was not of general interest,"but he never stopped trying, and above all, he was always prepared tochange directions and do what he calls, "follow-your-nose research." The original idea for site-directed mutagenesis came to Smith while in discussion with an American scientist named Clyde Hutchison over coffeeat a Cambridge, England research lab. Smith was spending a year'ssabbatical in 1976 at Fred Sanger's Lab, which was in the famous institutewhere DNA was first explained by Watson and Crick. Smith had gone thereto learn how to sequence genes--how todetermine the order of the thousands of links that make up a chain ofDNA. He was explaining to Hutchison in the cafeteria how they weremaking short chains of nucleotides--the chain links in DNA--for use inseparation and purification of DNA fragments. Their technique was basedon the natural affinity of one DNA chain to link up with its mirror image (see The Science below). It didn't take much of a leap to realizethe same technique might be used to induce mutations, but it meantchanging directions again, and not for the first time. It took Smithand his team several years to perfect the method. In the processthey had to learn new techniques, and develop new procedures. History Michael Smith was born into a working-class family in Blackpool,England. His mother and father both had to work from their early teensonward, she in the holiday boarding house of her mother and he in hisfather's market garden. In those days, English working-class schoolchildren had to take an exam called the "Eleven-Plus" when they wereeleven years old to see if they would go on to a private school (andprobably university) or just continue in the public school system wherethey would learn a trade and finish at the age of 16. Smith did verywell in his Eleven Plus and was offered a scholarship to a localprivate school called Arnold School, but he didn't want to go becausethe students there were considered snobs and he thought his friends wouldmake fun of him. Luckily, his mother insisted that he go. It was not a very happy time in Smith's life. He lost most of his old friends. Hehad homework to do every night and they didn't. He did not like the food atArnold School but was forced to eat it by strict teachers. He was not very goodat sports which were very important in English private schools. He hadfew friends at the new school. His big front teeth stuck outso he was teased by his schoolmates. Fortunately he wassent to a dentist to see about his overbite and the dentist introduced himto the world of Boy Scouts, where he made friends and learned aboutcamping and the outdoors. It's partly because of this love of natureand camping that Smith decided to settle in Vancouver, Canada. Smith was 7 when World War II broke out, and though they lived prettyfar North in England, he does remember one time when German bombs fell oneither side of their house, just barely missing him and his brother, Robin.His mom and dad were not home. Smith did not go to a prestigious English University like Oxford, butdid get into the honours chemistry program at Manchester University. Hehoped to get a first class Bachelor of Science degree, but alas, hewas a B student. He was very disappointed, but he still got a statescholarship and managed to complete a PhD. Smith wanted to do post-doctorate research on the West coast of the USA,and he wrote to many universities, but was rejected by them all. Thenin 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver, Canada, GobindKhorana, who had a position available to work on biologically importantmolecules. This was not the chemistry in which he hadbeen trained, and it was much harder, but he went to Vancouver anyway.It turned out to be a very good decision, because in Khorana's labSmith began learning the chemistry that would lead to the Nobel Prize.Khorana himself received a Nobel Prize in 1968 for work on the geneticcode--work that Smith was involved in during the late 50s atUBC. (Smith moved with Khorana's group to Wisconsin in the USA in 1960,but in 1961 he moved back to Vancouver). For years Smith worked at the Fisheries Research Board of CanadaLaboratory in Vancouver, and published many papers about crabs, salmon,and marine mollusks, but he managed to sustain his research in DNAchemistry with outside grants. The lab was located on the UBC campus,and because he was collaborating so much with professors inbiochemistry and medicine, in 1966 he was appointed a UBC professorof biochemistry in the Faculty of Medicine where he remains today. The Science Molecular Biology is the study of biological systems at the level ofindividual chemicals and molecules. Michael Smith is an expert on theDNA molecule and the smaller molecules the body uses to make DNA--themolecule that makes up your genes, the instructionsrequired to create every part of an organism. DNA is a large moleculethat is like a twisting chain. Actually it is two chains twistedtogether. 1. A small portion of a long DNA molecule showing the backbone (in lightgray) made of deoxyribose--a type of sugar. The backbone sugar segmentsare all the same but they can have one of 4 different basic groups, Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine. Adenine on onesugar chain always matches up with Thymine on the other. SimilarlyCytosine always matches up with Guanine. In this way one chain of DNAis a mirror image of the other. In real DNA the chain would continue upfor thousands of nucleic acids and down for thousands, too. 2. The nucleotide Guanine. The phosphate sugar is on the left and thebasic group is on the right. Note the two hydrogen atoms and oneoxygen atom poking out on the extreme right that form the bond withCytosine on the sister chain. 3. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slip asynthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into someDNA on one side. Synthetic means it was created in a test-tube, not bynature. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standardchemicals for breaking and reforming DNA chains. But there is one thingwrong with the synthetic oligonucleotide: it has an Adenine where thereshould be a Guanine. This is done on purpose to create a mutation. The4 nucleotides below and above the Adenine act as a kind of address thatcauses this stretch on DNA to match up to a particular part of a longDNA strand. (In humans you need only 17 nucleotides to define a uniquematch somewhere among our 100,000 genes.) 4. When this new altered DNA is put back into an organism, say abacterium, and it divides in the normal process of growth andreproduction, one half of the DNA will recombine normally and you willget a correct copy of the original gene--a normal bacterium. The otherside with the synthetic oligonucleotide will create a mutation becausea Thymine is where there should be a Cytosine. The resulting mutantbacterium might have some new appearance or function that it never hadbefore. 5. Three kinds of site specific mutations are possible with Smith'stechnique: 1. Substitution of one nucleotide for another as shown here,2. Deletion of a nucleotide, and 3. Addition of an extra nucleotide.Before Smith's technique there was no way to create specific mutations.You had to expose a bunch of organisms to radiation or chemicals thatwould create all sorts of mutants, then you had to select the one thatyou wanted. It was all by random chance. Mystery Soon the total sequence of the DNA in all the genes for a human being willbe known--the human genome. Smith believes this will change how people do biology research. Those genes have the code or "recipe" for each of the100,000 proteins that make up a human being, but we currently only know ofabout 5,000. The hard part will be discovering what part of the human genomedoes what, picking out what is crucial, discriminating the important bitsof DNA from all the rest.

Character Shy, positive, laughs a lot Favorite music Turandot, Puccini, end of Act I Other interests Traveling, eating, basketball, drawing The Story Richard Rozmahel passes the time by reading the bulletin board hangingabove the wheezing printer attached to the DNA sequencer. There's anad from a company selling genetic research chemicals. They're offeringa free t-shirt sporting the words: "Ultra Pure Human Being". At thebottom he reads, "Send 6 peel-off seals from any GIBCO BRL Enzymes andreceive an 'I make my living manipulating DNA' briefcase free." "Aint it the truth," thinks Richard to himself as he pulls yet anothervariation of the same tedious experiment from the printer. He looks atthe printout absently as he makes his way back to his desk in thecorner of the crowded genetics lab. People and equipment take up everypossible space. Shelves groan with bottles, dishes and jars. He passesa friend staring into a microscope. A big humming refrigerator jutsout into the passageway. Another student wears gloves while sheputs hundreds of precisely measured portions of various liquids intotiny test tubes. Richard stops suddenly just before he gets to his desk. Something iswrong with these traces. There it is: a three-base pair deletion--atype of genetic mutation in a DNA sequence. The genetic informationrequired to describe one amino acid in a protein chain is missing, asif one bead had fallen from a precious necklace. Instead of sittingdown, Richard rushes to show his supervisor Dr. Tsui (pronounced"Choy"). It's almost 6:00pm, most people have left for the night, butTsui is still working. Tsui's office is small. When Richard arrives, Tsui is hunched over thedesk poring over some other experimental results. The shelves areloaded with books. Piles of paper cover every horizontal surface.Richard looks at the shabby green rug while he waits. "What is it Richard?", says Tsui with a happy Hong Kong accent. "I'm pretty sure I've found a 3-base pair deletion. Look here." Heindicates the two traces; one from a normal person's genes and onefrom a person with cystic fibrosis--a fatal disease that kills aboutone out of every 2000 Canadians, mostly children. Cystic fibrosis isthe most common genetic disease among white people. Kids who havecystic fibrosis are born with it. Half of them will die before theyare 25 and few make it past 30. It affects all the parts of the bodythat secrete mucous; places like your lungs, your stomach, your noseand mouth. The mucous of kids with cystic fibrosis is so thicksometimes they cannot breath. Tsui looks at the printout and says, "This is very good Richard. Nowshow me that it's real." Tsui doesn't seem excited at all but he knowsthis is a solid clue, a major hint that they have found what they arelooking for: the gene for cystic fibrosis, the cause of that terribledisease. But he has had false hopes before, so he is not going tocelebrate until they check this out carefully. Maybe the differencebetween the two gene sequences is just the normal variation betweenindividuals. If you take any two normal people and compare 1000 DNAbases, you have a good chance of finding the same thing Richard justfound. There are plenty of little variations between individuals. But Tsui remembers that day, May 9, 1989, as the day they discoveredthe gene for cystic fibrosis. He and his team spent the next 5 months making it real. "The processof scientific discovery is not a simple thing. It takes months ofrepetitive tests to prove something without a doubt," says Tsui. Theyidentified a "signature" pattern of DNA on either side of thebase-pair deletion, and using that as a marker they compared 100normal people's genes with the identical DNA sequence from 100 cysticfibrosis patients. By September 1989 they were sure they had thecystic fibrosis gene. Then they had to figure out exactly what that gene did. After severalmore years Tsui and his team discovered that the DNA sequence with themutation was part of the instructions for making a special protein calledCFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator), a part ofthe cell membrane in certain special epithelial (surface) cells thatgenerate mucous. This protein regulates a channel through the cellwall for chloride ions. Proteins are made of long chains of aminoacids. The CFTR protein has 1480 amino acids. Kids with cystic fibrosis aremissing one single amino acid in their CFTR. Because of this theirmucous ends up being too thick and all sorts of things becomedifficult for them. Thanks to Tsui's research, scientists now have amuch better idea of how the disease works. We can now easily predictwhen a couple will produce a child with cystic fibrosis. Withincreasing understanding, scientists may also be able to deviseimproved treatments for children born with the disease. Why do 1 in 25 caucasians carry the mutation for CF? Tsui thinks thatpeople who carry it may also have linked beneficial mutations thatmight, for instance, give them more resistance to diahrea-likediseases. History Lap Chee Tsui grew up in a little village on the Kowloon side of HongKong called Dai Goon Yu. It was near the Kai Tak airport. Hewould hang out with a group of kids, mostly boys, and they would goexploring in ponds, catching tadpoles and fish to do simpleexperiments. One favourite project was to go to the market and buysilkworms. They would bring home the silkworms and pick leaves off themulberry bushes to feed them. Tsui remembers one day he and hisfriends picked almost all the leaves off a mulberry bush in aneighbour's yard. The furious fellow came out and chased the kidsaway. As a boy Tsui dreamed of being an architect. (He still draws all hisown diagrams and slides). Tsui did not take up genetics until afterhis PhD. He was more interested in studying the nature of diseases. The Science Molecular geneticists try to understand the structure and functionof genes. Lap Chee Tsui is particularly interested in the genefor cystic fibrosis and other genes on human chromosome number 7. 1. Human chromosome 7 The cystic fibrosis gene sits on the long arm of chromosome 7. One outof every 25 people in the caucasian population carry the geneticmutation for CF in this gene. Chromosome 7 has 150,000,000 base pairsor units of DNA. 2. The cystic fibrosis gene Using microbiological techniques, Tsui first localised the CF geneproduct to a region of the chromosome. The region has 230,000 DNA basepairs which spell out a series 1480 amino acids that curl up to makethe Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator protein. Thelittle triangle shows the location of the 3-base-pair deletionmutation that Tsui discovered. 3. Model of CFTR protein in cell membrane A normal gene makes this protein that regulates the passage ofchloride ions and hense the secretion of mucous in epithelial(surface) cells lining the gut, lungs, etc. One missing protein atthis spot causes CF. There are also 450 other kinds of mutationsassociated with CF. Activity You'll Need: Your mom's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) Your dad's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) What to do: Knowing that you get one chromosome from your mom and onefrom your dad, can you figure out what your possible blood type is?You need to know that people with blood type A can have either two Achromosomes (AA), or one A and one O chromosome (AO). Similarly peoplewith type B blood have chromosomes in the form of BB or BO. Type ABpeople have one A and one B chromosome (AB) and type O people musthave two O chromosomes (OO). So if a type AA person is the mother andthe father is type BO, there are two chances for an AB child and twochances for an AO child. Try to figure out what blood type you (andany of your brothers or sisters) might have. Mystery The genes of a monkey and a human are almost identical, varying byonly about 2%. How can such a small difference result in suchdifferent animals? Why do humans develop into humans and monkeys intomonkeys? It has to do with the regulation of gene expression which isvery poorly understood. Tsui likens the situation to two orchestras,each having exactly the same instruments, and the same music to play.Yet the two orchestras can sound entirely different, especially ifthey have different conductors.

The Story Tulving is standing at the blackboard before a 4th year cognitivepsychology class at the U of T. They're on the fourth floor of thenewly built Sidney Smith building. It's a long unfriendly room with nowindows. A blackboard stretches the lenght of one wall. Everyone is sittingaround a big table. There's a smell of fresh paint. Tulving isespousing his theory that memory is two part: laying down the memoriesand retrieving them are separate functions. "Just because a personcannot recall a word seen only a minute ago does not mean that the wordis not in memory," says Tulving. A student says, "Well, do you have any evidence for this." Tulving says, "But this is self evident," nevertheless noting thedoubtful expression on the student's face. They break for coffee andTulving goes to his office around the corner. Deep in thought andtroubled about the situation in the classroom he comes up with anexperiment to demonstrate his point to the class. He conducts theexperiment, using the class as subjects.He tells everyone to concentrate and listen carefully while he saysabout twenty words: "Yellow", "Rifle", "Beethoven", "Violin", etc.After he is finished he asks the class to write down as many as theycan remember. Most can get about 8 or 10. After they are done he picks up a student's paper and notices that she did notremember the word "Yellow". He says, "Do you remember a colour?"Instantly the student remembers "Yellow". He repeats thisfor the other missed words with the same miraculous result. Finally, thedoubting student reluctantly admits, "Perhaps you have a point." History: Tulving grew up in urban Estonia, the son of a judge, but enjoyedsummers at the family farm. His passion was sports, especially trackand field. "I was not at all interested in science--not one bit." Someof his teenage thoughts: When did time begin, what was before time,where does the universe end, ESP--is it possible? etc. BasicallyTulving was a good student, but spent most of his time pursuingsports. His friends were fascinated by crystal radios, but he was not."I found it boring because it was totally predictable whereas I wasconcentrating on trying to run one hundred meters in under 12seconds." Tulving built himself a track on the family farm andpracticed everything there from the 100 meter dash to javelinthrowing. Tulving went to Gymnasium, a type of high school in Estonia although because of the war he finished gymnasium in Germany at age 19.The only subject he found interesting was psychology, because it was totallyincomplete--he thought everything else was already known. Tulving left Estonia when he was 17. Because of the war and the Sovietoccupation of his country, Tulving was separated from his parents for the next 20years without knowing what had happened to them. From 1945-49 hespent 4 years in Germany. After the war ended he worked for the Americans as a translator and spent one year as a medical student at Heidelberg. The Science Cognitive psychologists study the human mind. They ask "How do we knowanything?" or "What is a memory?" To Tulving, the human mind is thebiggest unsolved mystery in the universe. He uses brain scanners tofigure out how memory works. 1. Encoding memories Tulving showed that memory is a two-stage process. First, memories are laid down. The front left part of the brain plays an important role in layingdown memories for specific events which occur only once (episodic memory). 2. PET Scan A PET scanner is a machine that shows what parts of your brain are especiallyactive while you are doing or thinking something. PET stands for Positron Emission Tomography. 3. Retrieving memories In the second stage of memory according to Tulving, memories are retrieved.The right front and rear of the brain appear to be important for the retrieval of episodic memories. Scientists don't know why some parts of the brain encode memories and other parts retrieve them. The Activity: Ask a friend to name all the months of the year and time the response.Most people can do this in about 8 seconds. Now ask the person to namethem in alphabetical order. Almost no one can do this correctly inless than two minutes. Both questions ask you to use your memory toretrieve something from your mind that you already know. Tulving's research shows why one is so much easier than the other. Mystery for Future Generations: Human memory is still a big mystery. How do we travel back into our own personal past using only our minds?

It's around 1960. She's talking about thesymptoms of trisomy of the 18th chromosome--having three #18 chromosomes instead of the normal two--when a doctor named JackSinclair raises his hand and says, "Hey, I think we have one of thoseon the 4th floor." He takes her up to the ward right away and they geta blood sample and add some anticlotting agent. She immediately goesto work to identify the chromosomes. This was something very new, and hadnever been done by anybody in Winnipeg. First she lets the red bloodcells settle in the vial, then she takes the white blood cells off thetop with a pipette. She puts them in a glass container about 1" by 2.5"long containing a medium where they grow and multiply for threedays inside an incubator. Then she takes out the liquid andcentrifuges it down, then fixes the cells with acetic acid solution, then drops themonto a glass slide so the cells break and spill out their chromosomes.She stains this and looks for the chromosomes under the microscope. The room she's in has the vinegary smell of acetic acid. Low tables bythe windows have lots of microscopes with technicians in white labcoats seated at most of them. High benches where they make theirpreparations are over along the opposite wall. Uchida was able toidentify the chromosomes that day as being 18 trisomy and this was afirst for Winnipeg and Canada. History: Irene Uchida was born in Vancouver, BC. Her father, who was brought toCanada as a young man, ran a Japanese stationery and book store and waschairman of the board of the Alexander Language School. She joined Canadian Girls in Training at the Powell Street UnitedChurch. She served as organist for services and choir work, and wasalso in demand as pianist for meetings as she could play any requestby ear. At UBC she was a member of the Japanese Students Club, CosmopolitanClub and a violinist in the UBC orchestra which provided the music fortheir annual productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. She alsoserved as a reporter for The New Canadian, a weekly JapaneseCanadian newspaper in Vancouver. During WWII, she was very active inthe Japanese Canadian Citizens for Democracy which played a vital rolefor the Japanese community in Toronto and nationally as well. This wasa period of great anxiety for all the Japanese who were uprooted fromtheir homes in BC by an Order-in-Council of the Federal Government. In 1942 she was evacuated from her comfortable home in Vancouver toChristina Lake, a self-supporting centre of the Japanese, but wascalled shortly afterward to act as principal of the largest Japanesecamp school in the Kootenays at Lemon Creek. Her innovative ideasdeveloped unusual programs for extracurricular activities which didmuch to stimulate the youth in creative pastimes. Two years later she moved to continue her education at Victoria College (University of Toronto), graduating in 1946 with a BA and also winning the RamsayWright Scholarship. Although she had planned to take up Social Work,she was persuaded by one of her professors to enter the field ofgenetics. In 1951 Dr. Uchida received her PhD in Zoology from the U of T andbegan her career as a Research Associate at the Hospital for SickChildren in Toronto. Her work in genetics involved the study of twins,mongolism, children with congenital heart diseases and those with avariety of other abnormalities. The studies on twins are stillongoing. In 1959, while working with Drosophila fruit flies at the U ofWisconsin on a Rockefeller Fellowship, she turned her attention tohuman chromosomes. When scientists in France discovered thatmongoloids had an extra chromosome (47 instead of 46), Dr. Uchidadecided to try to learn the cause of the extra chromosome. She wasappointed Director of the Dept of Medical Genetics at the ChildrensHospital, Winnipeg, in 1960. In her first study of human chromosomes, Dr. Uchida found that thereappeared to be an association between maternal radiation and Downsyndrome (mongolism). Then in 1969 with a Medical Research Council grant shewent as a visiting scientist to the University of London andHarwell, England, to study the technique for analyzing thechromosomes of mouse ova. Dr. Uchida continued her research on the effects of radiation onhumans and mice at the McMaster University Medical Centre, as well ascarrying out her teaching duties as a professor. As Director of theCytongenetics Laboratory, she had responsibilities which included thediagnosis of chromosome abnormalities in patients with congenitalabnormalities, mental retardation and other genetic diseases as wellas prenatal diagnosis of chromosome anomalies. She was thegeneticist who worked with doctors on the Genetic Counseling Programthat she initiated at the McMaster Medical Centre. She has publishedpapers on the effects of radiation, abnormalities in chromosomes, etc.She has been invited to speak in many countries and is a member ofvarious provincial, national and international scientificorganizations. The Science Cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes in cells. It concentrates on thebehaviour and identification of chromosomes. 1. Banding Our 23 pairs of chromosomes have tens of thousands of genes that carry the informationneeded to create a unique person. For each pair, one comes fromyour Dad, the other from your Mom. The bands indicate different types of DNA.Geneticists use the bands to match the pairs. 2. X & Y chromosomes You can tell by Jodi's two X chromosomes that she is a girl. Boys haveone X and one Y chromosome. 3. Chromosome 21 About 1 child in 700 is born with Down syndrome. It's caused by theaccidental tripling of chromosome 21 during conception. Normally youhave 23 pairs of chromosomes. Other genetic diseases are caused bytripling of number 13 or 18. This is called "trisomy". People withtrisomy of chromosomes 13 or 18 usually die as fetuses, resultingin miscarriages. Those who are born alive do not usually live morethan a year. To find out more about human genetic diseases visit theWebPathdatabase of cytogenetic diseases. 4. Jodi Special Olympics champion and actor Jodi Kaczur with actor ArnoldSchwarzenegger. Down syndrome people are not so handicapped aspeople think. They are very happy, generally affectionate and alwaysnice people. Activity: This is a typical chromosome spread that cytogeneticists routinely examine and sort under a microscope. Try to pair up the chromosomesand see if you can discover if this person has Down Syndrome or someother form of trisomy. You can print out this page and cut the chromosomesout with scissors, then move them around and match them up. Mystery for Next Generation: Find out how to inactivate one of the chromosomes in a 'tri'individual. Since this happens naturally in all women--one of their Xchromosomes is always inactivated--this technique might "cure" some ofthese genetic diseases in the parent or at an early embrionic stage.

Modern society promotes theideal of the rugged individual. For men you have the Clint Eastwoodpersona--the Marlborough Man. For women you have single moms raisingtheir kids alone. The ideal Western male rides into town, fights thebad guys, falls in love, and then heads off into the sunset. He isstrong and solitary just like an orangutan but he represents anevolutionary dead-end. Many of today's problems are a result ofabandoning our human biological roots. We must look to ourdistinctive gregarious human heritage; living and working in familygroups and communities if we want to be successful. Otherwise we arejust stressed out 'orangutans' in an urban setting." The Person Birthdate May 10, 1946 Birthplace Galdikas was born in Germany while her parentswere enroute from Lithuania to Canada.

She feels thirsty, not so much hungry.Swatting at mosquitoes, Dr. Birute Galdikas balances on a slipperylog--"The logs are always slippery. I don't know why, but they alwaysare"--trying to avoid the thorn vines and toxic bark in the dark dankrainforest. She stands waist-deep in tea-coloured swamp water, herjoggers and jeans soaking wet. Two pairs of socks, one tucked underand one over the jeans keep out leeches and other unspeakable menacesof the bog. She's wearing a khaki long sleeved shirt with lots ofpockets and a cotton jungle hat she bought at an army surplus store. Catching her breath, she spots two magnificent humongous maleorangutans standing face to face, glaring at each other's massivecheek pads. They are ready to fight for the chance to mate with thefemale that Galdikas has been tracking for days. Actually, she canonly glimpse their shifting shadowy forms in the dense foliage. Thesounds are horrific: snarling, grunting, loud and frightening. Theywrestle and tumble, smashing through the brush, trying to bite eachother on the head and shoulders until one flees into the bush. Movingforward to see, Galdikas snaps a twig distracting the other one.Suddenly, he grabs two thick vines, swings down until he hangs only ametre above her head and stares into her eyes, so close that hernostrils tingle from the stale odour of orangutan sweat. In 22 years of jungle observations, she's had only a handful of suchclose encounters, so rare are orangutan's meetings with humans or eventheir fellow apes. But this fellow's message was clear: "Leave mealone." Galdikas has learned more than any other human being about what itmeans to be an orangutan, and the cardinal fact is that they like tobe left alone. An adult male's range is at least 40 square kilometresand he can spend weeks loping slowly from tree to tree eating fruits,nuts, insects, leaves and bark without ever meeting any of his kin. "I've always wanted to study the one primate who never left the Gardenof Eden," says Galdikas. "I want to know what we left behind." Her conclusion: our biologically recent developments of complextool-making, language, and social institutions have removed us fromthe slow paced, isolated but extremely stable lifestyle of ourprehistoric ancestors in the 'garden'. And we must not forsake theseevolutionary roots, for it is only our distinctly human social tiesthat can keep our natural animal greed in check, preserve ourenvironment and maintain our mental well being. History When Birute was 12 years old she loved to go into the wilder sectionsof High Park in Toronto and pretend she was a Huron or Iroquois nativeslipping through the woods, at one with nature. She would spend hourslike this, quietly and secretly observing the wild animals in thepark. Ever since she was 5, Birute wondered where human beings camefrom. She knew they evolved from a common ancestor of monkeys andapes but she wanted to know more. She Got university degrees in psychology and anthropology. Went to meet Louis Leakey and got his support to set up an orangutanresearch station in Borneo. Lived in the jungle observing orangutans for 23 years. Founded orangutan support groups all over the world. Became a professor at Simon Fraser University. Wrote articles for National Geographic, Science and other journalsand has just finished a book. The Science Birute Galdikas is the world's leading expert on orangutans, the greatapes that live in the rain-forests of Borneo. She is anAnthropologist. Anthropology is the study of human beings, butGaldikas is looking to the great apes who decended from a commonancestor to help understand the mysteries of human nature. When she was 22, Galdikas met Dr. Louis Leakey who is famous fordiscovering fossils of early humans in Africa. Leakey and the NationalGeographic Society helped Galdikas set up a research camp in Borneo tostudy orangutans. Although she grew up in Toronto and spends severalmonths a year teaching in Vancouver at SFU, Galdikas has been livingin the rainforest among the orangutans for the last 23 years. 1. The Rainforest The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable ecosystems on theplanet. A huge variety of plants and animals thrive there, and nothinghas changed for millions of years. This is why the common ancestor forall apes including humans may have been somewhat like an orangutan.Orangutans have no serious predators except humans. Their dietaryknowledge of the irregular fruiting patterns of tropical plantshighlights their intelligence. It also explains their solitarylifestyle and the eight-year interval between births. A big animalneeds a lot of foraging territory without too many others around. 2. Structural Brachiators Orangutans are structural brachiators which means they are built toswing from branches with their upper limbs, but they have become tooheavy to move quickly like this. Adult orangutans are the largesttree-dwelling animals on earth, averaging about 100 kilograms formales. 3. Food Collecting The mother is collecting sweet habu-habu bark for her baby, one of over400 types of food orangutans enjoy in the rainforest. Galdikas hastried many herself. One way she has learned to spot orangutans in thedense foliage is by the sound of dropping fruit peels and pits. 4. The baby is reaching for the food. Through the repeated transfer of food between mother and baby, youngorangutans learn to process food. They watch and imitate. They learnby trial and error. 5. Babies Baby orangutans cling to their mother's fur until they are 4 years old.They are very dependent and remain with the mother for nine years.Females have perhaps 4 offspring in a lifetime. Orangutan males livesolitary lives, appearing briefly to mate. The orangutan's naturallife-span is unknown, but in zoos they have lived for up to 60 years. Activity Try being a physical anthropologist and make an activity budget for ananimal you can observe. You'll Need: A focal animal. It could be a pet, a human being or a squirrel in the park. A notebook, a pencil and a watch. What to do: Observe your focal animal for at least one hour noting the time andduration of every activity. Note what he/she does, how he/she holdsthings, posture, utterances, everything. Make two columns: one for theexact time and one for the activity. For instance 11:02 Left hand picks up cup 11:02:05 Sips about 5 millilitres Afterwards, break down the activities into categories like Eating,Moving, or Resting, and add up how much time the subject spent oneach. Categories can be divided further. For eating, show time spenton each type of food. Finally draw a graph.

For instance,for politically correct reasons, certain research is nowfrowned upon as it might offend certain groups (like fatpeople or women). Also I do not like the emphasis oncollaborative research. Both these trends kill the creativefreedom of the individual. You just have to go ahead andfind things out for yourself. This is the mark of a goodscientist." The Story The room is dimly lit, quiet and small. It's in the bigmodern psychology building at the University of WesternOntario. A young university student sits at a table readyfor the test. There are no windows. The ventilation systemis the only sound. A slightly older graduate studentadministers the test from the other side of the table. She places asheet of paper with rows and rows of little pictures infront of the subject and starts a stopwatch. The fellowtaking the test is getting $10 dollars to sit for a halfhour checking off pictures that match. As soon as hefinishes one page, she puts another one in front of himuntil two minutes are up. It's kind of fun at first but itgets a little bit boring after a while; especially for theolder student who has given this test almost a hundred timesalready. The stopwatch sets the pace of the action in twominute intervals as different subjects come into the room todo the test. Later, the graduate student tabulates theresults to see how many rows of pictures men matchedcorrectly compared to how many rows the women got right.Doreen Kimura comes in and takes a look at the raw data.Right away she can see they are onto something and a subtlesmile crosses her face. History: Kimura grew up and went to school in a small town inSaskatchewan (Neudorf, near Yorkton), where facilities to doscience were almost non-existent; so her interests were inwriting, languages, and algebra. Before finishing HighSchool, at the age of 17 Kimura dropped out to teach in one-roomed rural schoolhouses in Saskatchewan and NorthernManitoba. While in Manitoba she saw an ad in a teacher'smagazine for an admission scholarship to McGill, applied forthe fun of it, and got it! At McGill she became interested in Psychology as a result ofhearing Donald O. Hebblecture in the introductory course. She got a BA, MA and PhDat McGill, the latter in Psycho-biology, and then spent twoyears as a post-doctoral Fellow at the Montreal NeurologicalInstitute, before sojourns at UCLA Medical Center and theZurich Kantonsspital in Switzerland. She became a professorin Psychology at UWO in 1967. She also has a smallconsulting business which sells neuropsychological teststhat she developed. The Science Behavioural psychologists study how brains work tounderstand how people differ from each other. They do thisby giving people psychological tests. For instance you mightbe shown a series of pictures where you have to match theones that are the same. The test is timed and the faster youdo it the higher your score. 1. Mental Rotation Test: On average, men can pick outmatching rotated objects faster than women. Women are betterat matching objects based on their surroundings. 2. Aphasias: Aphasias, or speech disorders, occur most oftenin women when they have brain damage in the front of thebrain. In men, these disorders occur when the damage is inthe back of the brain. 3. Finger Ridge Counts: Kimura counts the number of fingerridges between two specific points on a person's fingerprint. Peoplewith high ridge counts on the left hand are better at"feminine" tasks. On average any sample group of people will havemore ridges on their right hands. But Kimura has found thaton average, sample groups of women and groups of homosexual men havea higher incidence of individuals with more ridges ontheir left hands. Activity: Find someone you can watch for five minutes while they aretalking. They don't need to be talking to you. They could bein a restaurant or a bus or they could be talking to someoneelse with you. They should have nothing in their hands. Theidea is to record their hand movements while they talk forfive minutes. Make a table to record your data. The tablehas three columns: one for right and one for left hands, andone for both hands. It also has two rows so you can recordself-touching movements as well as free movements. After doing several different people, count up the totals of handmovements for each individual. Did you record more right hand movementsor left hand movements? While people are talking they use speech centreson the left side of the brain. Which side of the brain controls the movementsof the right hand? Your experiment might help answer this question. If youpool your observations with dozens of others at your school you may have enough datato calculate a left and right hand movement average for men and anaverage for women. Which sex uses their right hand the most while they aretalking? Mystery: Kimura offered no mystery for future generations to solve,saying that it's the unpredictability of science that makesit interesting.

The Story The aroma of antiseptic and crisp sheets mingles with the sooty smell of a small coal-burning fireplace at the end of the infirmary room."Coxeter, how do you imagine time-travel would work?" says John Petrie. "You mean as in H.G. Wells?" says Coxeter. The two 14-year-old boys are inside-by-side beds recovering from the flu in their private school's sick-room.H.G. Wells's classic science fiction storyThe Time Machine is a popular topic of conversation. Both boys are very bright andbelieve time travel will eventually be possible. "I suppose one might findit necessary to pass into the fourth dimension," says Coxeter. That is the moment when Coxeter began forming ideas of hyperdimensionalgeometries. The boys had some books and games by their beds. They startedplaying around with ideas of higher dimensional space. Eventually theseearly musings lead Coxeter to his discoveries and books about regularpolytopes--geometric shapes that extend into the fourth dimension andbeyond. History: Discovered new regular polyhedron having six hexagonal facesat each vertex, 1926; enumerated the n-dimensional kaleidoscopes, 1933; Coxetergroups; inversive distance between two disjoint circles (or spheres).Author of 6 books on geometry including "Introduction to Geometry" (1961),"Projective Geometry" (1964), "Twelve Geometric Essays" (1968), "RegularComplex Polytopes" 1974. Co-author and editor of numerous other booksincluding "M.C. Escher: Art and Science" (1986). "Kaleidoscopes" (1995) isa collection of 26 of his papers on polytopes, etc. The Young Scientist: Because of a school essay Coxeter wrote at the age of about 14 on the idea of projecting geometric shapes into higher dimensions, Coxeter'sfather, who was a pacifist and friend of Bertrand Russell, took him to seethe brilliant philosopher. Russell helped the Coxeters find an excellent math tutor and Coxeter was formallytrained and fast-tracked for Cambridge University. The Science Coxeter's major contribution was in the area of Dimensional Analogy. Regular Polytope: Coxeter is famous for his work on Regular Polytopes. The process of stretching geometrical shapes into higher dimensions is called "Dimensional Analogy". These shapes are called "Polytopes". When they involve coordinates made of complex numbers they are called "Complex Polytopes". Hypercube: If you pull a cube into the fourth dimension you get ahypercube. Eight cubes make a hypercube. Cube: A square is flat. If you pull it up into the thirddimension you have a cube. Six squares make a cube. Line: A line is a one dimensional shape. If you pull it in thesecond dimension you have a square. Four lines make asquare. Experiment: Try making some rhombus tiles. A rhombus is a squashed square. Maketwo diamond shaped rhombuses, each having four equal sides. One rhombus hastwo angles of 36 degrees and two of 144 degrees. The other one has twoangles of 72 degrees and two angles of 108 degrees. Measure, draw and cut several dozen of these out of heavy card stock andmove them around on a table to make patterns and shapes. Roger Penrose has shown that these shapes can be used to make an aperiodic tiling of the plane. Try it. Try to make 3d shapes from these 2d rhomboids. How many can you make? Consider 36 x 2 = 72. 36 x 3 = 108. 36 x 4 = 144. 1, 2, 3, and 4 multiplesof the same angle make up all the angles in the two shapes! If you love this and it gets you thinking and dreaming, you may have afuture in geometry. Mystery For FutureGeneration: 4-colour map problem. Although a controversial computer proof hasrecently been shown, Coxeter believes that a more elegant proof may stillbe possible.

The Story Standing on a thin ledge of rock, just below Hell's Gate falls on theFraser River, William Ricker dips his net into the eddy at his feet.He brings up a six pound sockeye salmon for tagging. This one is freshand strong, not like the tired ones who are having trouble with therapids. Again and again the weak ones find their way into his net.From a pocket, Ricker pulls out two little red and white metal disksand a 5 cm pin. He wipes his brow and waves to his partner who isalso tagging fish a few meters away. The sun is hot. A steady hot windblows up the narrow canyon. "Of course there was no road down to 'The Gate' in those days," saysRicker. "Only a steep trail actually, but nothing youcouldn't handle if you were young and skookum." Ricker was 30. It was the summer of 1938, the first time he had workedon the big river and he was enjoying himself. It was also the first year of the Canadian Salmon Commission's studyof Fraser sockeye. While his partner held a fish down, Ricker used a pair of pliers to attach the bright tag through the fish'sbody just below the dorsal fin. Then he threw the wild sockeyeback into the water to fight its way upriver. Theroar of the rapids, the cool water swirling around his feetand the hot wind made a perfect combination for Ricker. The team of four men managed to catch and tag up to20 fish per hour, several thousand in all. Enough toaccomplish the goals of the study: "We wanted to find whatfraction of the fish went to each of a dozen or so spawning regionsto mate and lay eggs at different seasons. Observers in those regions were on the lookout for the salmon and were making estimates of the numbers on each spawning ground," says Ricker. Knowing the number of spawners is crucial if you want topredict how many fish will be available for future harvest. Ricker knows salmon runs like some people know World Series baseball statistics. He has kept track of the Commission's estimates of the FraserRiver sockeye ever since that day in 1938. Each year different numbers of salmon return to spawn depending on thespecies. Also, they go through cycles. For example, the big salmon run of 1993 is the same "line" or "cycle" as the record run of 1913 which was around 100 million fish. Forsockeye, such huge numbers occur only every 4 years. So thenext big run should be 1997. Off years are one tenth asnumerous or less. Ricker was the first to suggest several possible reasonsfor the cyclic variation in returning salmon stocks. Biologistsare still collecting evidence to determine the correctexplanation. The Fraser sockeye are on a 4-year cyclepossibly because most of the fish mature at 4 years of age.Farther north age 5 is also common. Pink salmon have a 2-yearlife cycle. For cohos it's usually 3 years, while chinook or"spring" salmon return at any age from 2 to 7 years. The mostpowerful and largest of all salmon, a chinook holds the worldrecord, weighing in at over 57kg. History: When he was eleven years old William Ricker began studying his dad'sstar charts. Eventually he could name all the constellations and thebrightest stars. All through high school Springtime found Ricker upmost mornings at 5:00 am. For three hours before breakfast he wouldride his bike into the woods or along the shoreline near North Bay,Ontario looking for birds. Then he... Got a BA & PhD in Biology. Had summer jobs working for the Ontario Fisheries Research Laboratoy mainly on trout. Studied salmon life history and enhancement at Cultus Lake, BC. Became a professor of Zoology at Indiana State University. Became Editor of Publications for the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, andthen Chief Scientist. Wrote the "Green Book" on the computation of fish population statistics. Identified 90 new species of stoneflies. Wrote a Russian/English dictionary of fisheries terms. Kept fit with hiking, and played violin and bass viol. The Science 1. The Ricker Curve, developed in the 50s, is still used all over the worldto determine average maximum catches for regional fisheries. Each coloured curverepresents a different type of fish population. 2. Line of natural replacement. Along this line, spawners are replaced by anequal number of adult progeny 3. Salmon are interesting because their Ricker curve looks more like this.At this point you have reduced the population to 40%, but some fish,like salmon, produce many more mature progeny when spawning grounds areless crowded. 4. Natural Equilibrium. At this point, spawners equal progeny. You can'tcatch any fish, if you want to maintain the population at this level.Fish don't naturally go much beyond this level because they get too crowded.Spawning beds get messed up and many eggs die. 5. When you catch fish, say 20%, you move back here on the green Rickercurve. You have less progeny, but enough to sustain a catch of20%--a surplus. 6. The point of maximum sustainable catch isactually a bit to the left of the maximum point on the curve. This isbecause the distance between the curve and the replacementline is the greatest at this point. Anywhere to the left of thisline you are overfishing and will reduce the next generation's harvest. Activity Sockeye Salmon                    Pink Salmon Biologists must be able to tell the difference between many differentspecies. You can try it too: You'll Need: A library book with good pictures and descriptions of fish local to your area.Try cod or salmon. A trip to a big fish market or your favourite fishing spot. What to do: At the market: Take your book to the fish market and try to find the distinguishing featureof each type of salmon, or cod that is available. Write down their proper Latin names See if you can find any fish that are mislabeled in the market.If you go fishing: Try to identify everything you catch. Note the depth, water temperature andtime of day. Keeping records like this is not only scientific, it will help you catch morefish!

The People Funding sources Great Canadian Scientists Backgrounder Introduction The Great Canadian Scientists project was started toincrease Canadian's awareness of the great scientists that our countryproduces. Over the last five years with the help of several grants the projecthas developed a website, book and CD-ROM to meet this goal. The idea Barry Shell is a science writer at SFU responsible for publishinga newsletter that profiles the work of SFU scientists. One day in the hallwayan Engineering professor named Jamal Deen suggested that Shell might apply thesame techniques he was using in the newsletter to a book on the greatestCanadian scientists. Figuring therealready must be many books like this, Shellwent to the public library expecting to bring home an armload. Imagine hissurprise when the science librarian at the main branch of the Vancouver publiclibrary told him that no such book existed. The librarian said there was astrong need for such a book, especially for school-aged kids who wereconstantly coming into the library with assignments to write about Canadianscientists. Thus the project began. Three Definitions Everyone asks, "What do you mean by Great? How do you defineCanadian? And what about the word Scientist?" It's difficult to compare the sumof great people's lives. Any listing like the one in the GCS project is boundto generate debate. When Isaac Asimov wrote his Biographical Encyclopedia ofScience and Technology in the 60s he did not even let an assistant type it. Inthis way he felt the responsibility for the scientists chosen for thatcompendium rested with him alone. In a similar way, Shell takes fullresponsibility for the choices in the list of scientists for the GCS project.There is no committee, just him. How can you define greatness? Shell starts with Nobel laureates, but also looksfor Canadian winners of the King Faisal prize, the Albert Einstein Award of theWorld Cultural Council, the Wolfe prize from Israel, the Welch foundation inTexas and of course Canada's own Killam, Gairdner, Manning, Herzberg andSteacie prize winners. As much as possible, he tries to check with peers as towhether a particular scientist's work was considered to be the best in theirfield. He also attempts to select scientists from all parts of Canada, and awide variety of disciplines. There have been many inconsistencies and Shell welcomes ideas for improving theproject. From time to time he receives mail from people who suggest, forexample, that Roberta Bondar (first Canadian woman in space) or David Suzuki(popular environmentalist) should not really be included. Shell's response:"Maybe so if you just look at their scientific achievements, but I figure ifyou can make it into orbit, or get your science messages on national TV everyweek, that's definitely great." He defines Canadian scientists as researchers who held Canadian citizenshipwhen they made their most outstanding scientific discoveries. That's it. Thatmeans many of the people in the project were not born in Canada, and some wereborn here but do not live in Canada any more. Scientist is hard to define. At first the project began with researchers inPhysics, Chemistry and Biology and most of the people in the project do work inthese three core disciplines. But the boundaries have blurred a bit and a fewdoctors, engineers, computer scientists, and psychologists have joined thelist. There is no good reason for this. It just seems like a good idea and itmakes the project more interesting. Women Scientists No product evolves in isolation. A purely "objective" commitmentto scientific achievement ignores other equally important factors that gobeyond science and that indirectly affect the process of science and who doesthat science. Historically and currently, women face barriers to entering ascientific career. It became a project goal to encourage girls and young womento enter science by including many women scientists whose achievements areworthy of acknowledgement and can serve as inspiration to women interested inbecoming scientists. Hence the percentage of women in the project is about 20%while in reality the percentage of practicing woman scientists in Canada issomewhere around 5%. Born, Bred, Matured and First Published on theInternet The content of Great Canadian Scientists began in June 1991 witha posting in several Internet discussion groups (Usenet) that called fornominations. A list of about 70 scientists was quickly generated. As the monthsand years went by, the list was refined and rebroadcast to the newsgroups andmore nominations were solicited. Several responders helped verify somenominees' citizenship or career achievements. Email was used to contact manyscientists, too. Once, upon receiving an email query from me about a nomineeand colleague, a researcher at AT&T Bell labs simply walked down the hallto ask Brian Kernighan (one of the creators of the C programming language) ifhe was a Canadian citizen. The answer came back in just a few minutes. He is. With poor prospects for conventional book publication, early drafts of theinformation were first published on the World Wide Web beginning in May 1995.Many thousands of "visitors" later that original manuscript has been muchimproved and the book, a website and a CD-ROM are the results. Publication of three formats Great Canadian Scientists is the first product available toCanadians that integrates and utilizes new and traditional media for learningabout Canadian men and women of science. The product synergistically combinesthe book with a website and a companion CD-ROM. Each medium delivers thematerial in a different way and each has strengths that the others do not. Theywork together, not against each other. With the CD-ROM students can hear andsee the scientists talk about themselves and their work in their own words.Scientific principles can be hammered home through fun-to-play interactivecomputer games. With the website, they can send email directly to livingscientists and ask questions. They can play the quiz and try to beat other kidsall across the country (and the rest of the world) playing at the same time.The book lets them go home and read more about the scientists on the livingroom couch or do activities at the kitchen table. 100% Canadian Focus and Content! GCS has a pure and single-minded Canadian slant. Other availableproducts, though perhaps made in Canada, often try to target the more lucrativeAmerican market so they must be watered down or altered to fit American schoolcurricula. Great Canadian Scientists fits the mandate of the Information Highway Advisorycouncil to protect Canadians from the potential for a loss of Canadian identitydue to the American slant of the Internet. It also fits with a new Pan-CanadianInstructional Resource Profile that emphasizes curriculum content about theprocess of science. Canadians need to tell the world that we are particularlygreat at science. Canada has a great reputation in the world of science. GreatCanadian Scientists shows you why.

Charles Krebs is an expert on: 1. Why bears hibernate,2. Why male penguins hatch the egg, 3. Why lemmings commit masssuicide or 4. Why birds migrate to the Arctic?* On October 18, to start off Canada's National Science and Technology Week,hundreds of people puzzled over such questions. About 40 registered totrack their scores on the quiz at the Great Canadian Scientists website(www.science.ca). The six top scorers got Great Canadian Scientistst-shirts and CD-ROMs. The winners were: 1. Ashleigh Cheung (13, Vancouver, BC), 2. Scott MacIntyre (39, Dartmouth,Nova Scotia), 3. Roger Leeman (~25, Zurich, Switzerland), 4. NancyBroughton (~25, Chicago, Illinois), 5. Micheline Villeneuve (~30, Orleans,Ontario), and 6. Louis Moreau (27, Quebec, Quebec) Barry Shell, the project's creator says, "I think it's great that people inSwitzerland and Chicago could play alongside Canadians at home." The GCSQuiz and website show that the Internet is a very effective medium for thepromotion of Canadian excellence abroad. Several things about the winners are of interest. They are from sea toshining sea; Nova Scotia to BC. There was an even 50/50 split of male andfemale winners. A Chinese Canadian was the top scorer. Two French Canadiansare in the winners list. Of the two outside Canada, one is a Canadian PhDstudent studying in Chicago. The other is a Swiss fellow who just likesCanada. Interestingly, the age range of the winners shows that the site ismainly being used by adults; often to assist children with learning, butusually for their own interest. The results are particularly striking because they show that theInternet is becoming more open and accessible. No longer is it solelythe domain of male nerds and hackers. Instead a cross section ofCanadians was represented in the winners circle. They *are* allcertainly predisposed to science and technology, however, with ascience wiz kid in Vancouver, a professional engineer in Nova Scotia,a Chemistry PhD student in Chicago, and an Industry Canada employee inOttawa. The quiz was programmed by Gordon Ross, a 4th year Communication student atSimon Fraser University where the Great Canadian Scientists website makesits home. By the way, anyone in the world can play the quiz at anytime by goingto www.science.ca. Find out onceand for all if lemmings really do throw themselves off cliffs. *ANSWER: Charles Krebs is one of the world's leading Ecologists. He wrote the most widely used textbook, "Ecology", and he is an expert on why lemmings commit mass suicide.

Award, 1990 Mentor Leonard Lerman, at U. of Colorado Character Modest, quiet, loyal. Favorite music Mozart's Clarinet Concerto Other interests ??? The Story Altman is worried. He has no job prospects and he has little to show for a year of work in Francis Crick's laboratoryin Cambridge, England. Crick was the co-discoverer of DNA, themolecule that encodes the genetic information that tellscells how to function and grow. It's an incredible honour forAltman to be invited to this famous laboratory. The year is 1970, an unusually warm June day. At the moment, this laboratoryis probably the best place in the world for geneticresearch, but Altman has only two weeks left before he mustleave. And he has no idea where he will go or what he will do next. Altman is working on mutant cellswith malfunctioning t-RNA (transfer Ribonucleic Acid)--asubstance that is part of the machinery in a cell that decodesinstructions in DNA. For about the thousandth time, Altmanpicks up a thin layer of gel on a glass plate. But this one is special. Altman was trying a new experiment, something no one hadever tried before. If he could just isolate a special type of RNAcalled precursor-RNA it would explain everything else. After putting a few drops of material prepared fromthe mutant cells onto the gel, Altman places the plate intoa strong electric field--a standard technique for separatingchemical compounds called electrophoresis. Different compoundsmove across the gel at different speeds because of the electricfield. Altman waits several hours, and then lays photographicfilm on top of the gel. Tiny amounts of radioactive tracer atomsin the RNA emit X-rays that will leave characteristic bands on thefilm. With a friend, Altman takes this latest piece of film into thedarkroom to develop it. Within minutes the two young scientistsboth see it. It's just a white splotch on the negativebut it gives Altman one overwhelming thought, "Now I know I canultimately get a job." He had taken the first step in a long series of experiments that would ultimately lead to thediscovery of catalytic RNA. Altman was hired for one more year in Crick's lab, then became abiology professor at Yale University in USA. His discoveries over the next two decades have resulted in a Nobel prizeand could possibly even lead to a cure for the common cold. He is still working on aspects of the same molecular biologysystem today. HistorySidney Altman grew up in the NDG suburb of Montreal.As a boy he loved books. He liked sports and writing, too, butthe library was one of hisfavourite places. He read everything: novels, sports books, andscience. His parents could always find the money if he wantedto buy books. "I read everything I could get my hands on," says Altman. He spent a lot of time alone in his room reading. When he was 12 years old someone gave him a book called "ExplainingThe Atom" by Selig Hecht. The book showed Altman thepower of science to predict things. From then on he was a confirmed scientist. "I wasn't interested in Biology at the time. I liked nuclear physics,"says Altman. One saturday afternoon while Altman was still in high-school afriend of his said, "Why don't you come with me to McGill. I'mgoing to take the American SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests)." These tests are a required part of any application to an Americanuniversity. Altman always thought he would go to McGill forUniversity, but on a whim he wrote the SAT tests that afternoonwith his friend. They both applied to MIT (Massachusetts Instituteof Technology) and as it turned out, Altman got in but his frienddid not. Altman's family had to scramble to get the money together to send him to this great American school, and he wasn't even surehe wanted to go. There was a big debate in the Altman household. But Altman says, "Within three weeks at MIT I knewI wanted to stay." He was impressed by the high caliber of theother students and he really enjoyed living away from home.At MIT he received a BSc. Then he: Went to the University of Colorado medical school where he gota PhD in Molecular Biology and met Leonard Lerman. Lerman introduced Altman to Francis Crick & S. Brenner in England. Altman won a fellowship to work in Crick & Brenner's lab. There, he made early discoveries that lead to the principle of Catalytic RNA. Came back to USA and became a professor at Yale University. The Science Molecular biologists study the thousands of chemical reactionsthat go on inside cells to create and sustain life. Altman specializes in thechemical processes involved in copying information from DNA andusing it to make proteins, the building blocks of cells. Information is copied from DNA (Deoxy-riboNucleic Acid) by a molecule called RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). DNA and RNA are long twisty chain-like molecules. Actually, there are about six different types of RNAinvolved in the transcription process. In Crick's lab, around 1970, Altman was investigating part of this complex process. He discovered an enzyme called "RNase P"that chops a little "tail" off the end of an intermediate molecule of RNA called "precursor-tRNA". Enzymes are special protein moleculesthat make chemical reactions go faster--a process called "catalysis".They usually do this by holding orbending a target molecule in a certain way so that one of itschemical bonds breaks more easily. It took about a decade, butAltman eventually discovered that the enzyme he was after was not youraverage enzyme. Instead of being a protein likeall other enzymes, it was made of two parts--one strand of RNA and one protein. Furthermore it was the RNA portion that provided the catalysis. This was a significant discovery because RNA molecules are muchmore primitive than protein molecules. Besides offering an explanation for how life might have begun billions of years agobefore proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesomeprimitive life form: the virus for the common cold. It may bepossible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill coldviruses by chopping up the RNA on which they are based. A 3D model of M1 RNA, the catalytic RNA molecule that Altman discovered. 1. The t-RNA precursor molecule whose "tail" is chopped off by the catalytic RNA. 2. The arrow points to the site of cleavage where the t-RNA moleculeis severed. (Model produced with DRAWNA software by Eric Westhof, Institut de BiologieMol�culaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Strasbourg, France.) Mystery Altman feels that perhaps the biggest mystery to be solved by the nextgeneration will be the understanding of the human brain.

The Story On an ordinary Wednesday morning in October 1994 Bert Brockhousegets out of bed at his usual time--about 6:45. He stretches a bitto loosen the overnight aches of his 76-year-old body when he seesthe little red light blinking on the answering machine on the FAX line. Who could have called in the middle of the night, he thinks, as hegoes over to press the play button. He listens to a voice announcingitself from Stockholm saying, "B. N. Brockhouse and C. G. Shull havebeen selected as recipients of the 1994 Nobel prize for physics."Brockhouse is stunned. For a moment he thinks, "Oh that's interesting,"but then he realizes, "I AM B. N. Brockhouse," and he calls his wifeDorrie, to listen the tape again with him. The rest of the day is filled with phone calls, telegrams and interviews.The next year, one of travel, awards, banquets, and lectures. In short Brockhouse had come out of retirement. In his annual Christmas letter to friends that year, after describing all thefestivities in Stockholm, Brockhouse says, "If anyone cares,we got a new car in the Summer, a Chrysler Neon." Brockhouse's Nobel prize can be traced back to 1951. Fresh out ofthe University of Toronto with a PhD in Physics, Brockhouse satat his desk in a faded blue-shingled wartimehut at Chalk River, Ontario, home of Canada's Atomic EnergyProject for the National Research Council. He gazed out the window at the snow. It was Winter, but hefelt warm inside the hut. He just sat there thinking, mullingthings over in his mind. The other night he had been athis boss's house, Donald Hurst, head of the Neutron Spectrometersection. They had been reading a 1944 paper about neutrons--subatomic particles with no electric charge that, together withprotons made up the nucleus of an atom. The existence of neutronshad only been verified about 20 years before. Not much wasknown about them. Brockhouse didn't quite understand the theoriesin the paper, but he felt it had a lot of interesting ideas.He was supposed to be working on something else, but couldn't stop thinking about the concepts in the paper and how hecould do experiments at Chalk River to try out some of the newtheories in the laboratory. He fiddled with some math on his notepad for a while and thenwent to the coffee room. As he passed the lab that housedthe radioactive nuclear pile, one of the most powerful sourcesof neutrons in the world at the time, he wondered how hecould use the tools at hand, or if he'd have to make new tools.In the coffee room he met Hurst. Brockhouse went up to the blackboard and said, "Don there's something I'd like to showyou." He sketched out some equations on the blackboard.The math described a device they couldbuild that would use a neutron beam as a kind of flashlightthat could look into the mysteries of crystalline structuresand other solids. Metals, minerals, gems, and rocks. Brockhouse went on to solve problems of controlling the sourceof the neutron beam; limiting it to neutrons of only one energy;eliminating background radiation from other experiments in thelab; and problems with the sensitivity of the detectors.The resulting Triple-Axis Neutron Spectrometer is now used worldwide to investigate crystal structures. History Bert Brockhouse was born in Lethbridge, Alberta in 1918, but in the 1920sthe family moved to Vancouver. They operated a rooming housein Vancouver's West End. Bert had a paper route to help supplementthe family income. He liked fishing and went withhis buddies to catch cod and salmon off the pier at English Bay. Hefooled around with radios a lot, hanging out at radio repair shops andmaking home-made radios from designs in popular electronicsmagazines. After high-school, instead of going to University,Brockhouse worked as a radio repair man. Then World War II came alongand his radio skills came in handy as an electronics technician inthe Canadian Naval Reserve. Brockhouse went to the University of BritishColumbia after the war, majored in Math and Physics, gettinga BSc with honours (1947). He then did his PhD at the Universityof Toronto (1950), moving to Chalk River shortly afterwards.Brockhouse spent his working life as a researcher at Chalk Riverperfecting neutron spectroscopes and their applications. Regarding his current work, he speaks cryptically of "The Grand Atlas", a sort of rulebookfor nature incorporating theories both physical and metaphysical. The Science Brockhouse is an experimentalist in the Physics of Solids like metalsand crystals. It's called Solid State Physics. As his tool he uses aNeutron Spectrometer that he developed at Chalk River. According to Brockhouse, the virtue of neutrons is you can say a greatdeal about a material by using a neutron beam. Imagine shining the beamof a flashlight on an object. Your concept of that object is based onthe light reflected from it. But when the object gets down to theatomic level, the light from the flashlight's beam is "too big". Thewavelength (or energy) of ordinary light is about 7000 Angstroms (oneAngstrom is the width of a hydrogen nucleus), while the wavelength of aneutron beam is around 1 - 4 Angstroms. In other words, your beam ofneutron "light" can penetrate to see details thousands of timesfiner. 1. The original triple axis spectrometer (1959). The bank of 52 rotaryswitches in the upper centre of the picture could be preset to gothrough an energy scan of up to 26 points. A feature of Brockhouse'sspectrometer was the way you could vary three angles: the direction ofthe neutron beam, the position of the specimen, and the angle of thedetector. Add to this the ability to vary the energy of the incomingneutrons and the sensitivity of the detector and you have a Nobel prizewinning creation. (Photo, courtesy of AECL) 2. Monochromating Crystal. A special crystal of salt (NaCl) was used toseparate out neutrons of a particular energy. The beam was then aimedand collimated (straightened out) before being sent on to the target. 3. Specimen. The position of the target metal or crystal can be variedon two axes. The beam of neutrons bounces off the target in different directions that can tell us something about the atomic structure of thematerial if we can detect them. 4. Detector. Another crystal, similar to the monochromating crystal,can be tuned to pick up particular energies which are then passed onto the detector which counts incoming neutrons. Activity Objective: To set up a crude spectrometer You'll Need: A laser light source (preferred), or flashlight/penlight. A crystal like quartz or amethyst A dark box Optional frequency detector to measure shift in light frequency. What to do: Inside the box, set up the laser light source and the target crystal. By rotating the crystal and measuring the anglesof refraction of the light beam, you can infer things aboutthe internal crystalline structure of the material. If you have a frequency detector, you can measure shifts inlight frequency before and after passing through the target.Theoretically this represents a change in the energy of the light which can tell you other things about the material. Mystery Like many physicists, Bert Brockhouse likes to explore metaphysicalideas as well--the spirit world. He is a religious man. His belief in physics theory coexists with his belief in religion. "Scienceis an act of faith," he says. Without faith, how can understandingthe existence of a neutron help with the larger moral issues in life? Brockhouse's example of a moral problem is "Kantian Doom" -- the idea that we are doomed because even though weknow that something is bad for us, we do it anyway becauseeveryone else is doing it. Examples might be driving cars, using computers, or watching television. Brockhouse would like to seea solution to this social problem.

The Story Roger Daley received a bachelors degree in physics, but decided tobecome a weatherman. "I wanted to do something practical with myeducation, something that would help people in ordinary life," saysDaley. The physics of weather seemed more practical to him thannuclear physics, for instance. Canada educates weathermen for free, butafterwards you "pay it back" by going where ever they send you. Rogerwas posted to the remote Goose Bay weather station in Labrador(actually a U.S. airforce base at the time). This was part of hisapprenticeship in the Canadian Weather Service. Goose Bay, Labrador 1996.Daley is lonely, spending a lot of time alone in his humble room in thearmy barracks. It's cold and there's not much to do. The smell of jetfuel is all pervasive and the Delta Dagger Interceptors and KC 135tankers roar overhead at all hours of day and night. Theysupport and refuel B52 bombers in flight. Daley decides to try an experiment. Working alone in his room at night,he makes up little blue cards for all the American airmen to fill outwhile flying missions in the area. From these cards Daley works out alocal theory for the behaviour of atmospheric turbulence in the area.He spends a lot of time pouring over maps spread out on his bed lateat night, entering the data from the cards onto the maps. The pilotsare very interested and cooperative because ultimately knowing thepatterns of upper level turbulence along the Labrador coast will helpthem fly better. They start hanging around his room and talking aboutthe air in which they fly. Daley realizes he loves this research anddecides to go back to university to get a degree in meteorology. History: 1966-67 served as weather forecaster at Goose Bay Air Base (USAF), in Goose Bay, Labrador. 1971-1992 Amanuensis, Copenhagen U., Denmark 1972-78 Canadian Meterological Centre, Montreal, developing forecast models 1978-85 National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, CO as senior scientist 1985-present: Canadian Climate Centre, Downsview, ON Chief Scientist Wrote the book on atmospheric data analysis (1991) The Young Scientist:Daley grew up in West Vancouver and the North shore mountains were hisbackyard. He climbed, skied and boated a lot. His best subject inhigh-school was history but he was always good in math. He saw math asa doorway to science, but he never wanted to be a research scientist.He always wanted to do something that related to "normal" life. Ingrade 12 he had no intention of studying science. The Science Meteorology is the study of the earth's atmosphere and weather. 1. Real Earth The Earth's weather is a very complex system affected byocean currents, temperature, pressure, wind, and manyother things. 2. Weather Satellite Several Canadian weather satellites detect many of thefactors that create weather. They send this informationback to Earth. 3. Super computer A supercomputer in Montreal (Programmed in part by RogerDaley) records and interprets information fromthe satellite and other sources. 4. Model Earth The weather computer constructs a model of the earthbased on very complicated mathematical formulas. This model can be usedto help predict the weather. Activity:You need: a cup of black coffee a little bit of milk or cream a ruler a watch or stopwatch. Imagine that the whirling coffee represents the motion of air in theatmosphere. The whitish milk represents a trace gas. By following themotion of the milk, knowing the size of the cup and using a stopwatchto measure the passage of time, you can determine the velocity of themoving coffee. How good are your velocity measurements when the milkand coffee become well mixed? The idea is to stir the coffee very very slowly, then drop milk in slowly.Note how the milk mixes and measure the speed of its rotation. Dothis by using the radius (r) (measure the distance from the center towhere the drop fell) and formula 2*pi*r to get the distance the milktravels in one rotation. Use the watch to time how long one rotationtakes. The speed of the whirling mixture is the distance/time. This ishow meteorologists work out speed of moving clouds and storms in theupper atmosphere. They have satellites that can "see" certainnaturally occurring gasses in the atmosphere, like methane from bogs.They "track" this methane as it moves about in the atmosphere, justlike the milk in the coffee cup and figure out wind speeds in theexactly the same way you did in the experiment. Mystery:Daley hopes future generations will help develop a hugecomputer system that will be able to model all the geophysical systemsin the world. Among other things, such a system would allow us toaccurately predict the formation of ozone holes and trends in globalwarming.

The Story Gerhard Herzberg was feeling a bit overwhelmed bent over the piles ofpaper on his big desk. As Director of pure physics at Canada'sNational Research Council, he was very busy in the Fall of 1959. JackShoesmith his research technician had come into the sun filled office. Hewalked up to the tall windows overlooking the Ottawa River and said,"I have an interesting spectrum to show you." Herzberg thought of all the meetings and conferences he had to organize, the paper he was writing, presentations he was preparing and thebook he was trying to finish (the third volume of his series"Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure"). He didn't have timefor this. "It's good," said Jack. Reluctantly, Herzberg got up from his chair and followed the youngtechnician down a flight of stairs to the lab below. It was a largehigh dimly lit room smelling of ammonia, ozone and hot electricwiring. They walked past the special spectrograph that Shoesmith hadbuilt--a long steel tube about 50cm high and 3m long. Vacuum tubes andwires snaked around the base of the aparatus, but the pumps andelectricity were turned off. The big room was quiet except for amurmuring crowd that had gathered in the corner. Herzberg hurried over to see what they were looking at. A long thinstrip of glass lay on a viewing screen with a seemingly random patternof vertical lines blackening its surface--a spectrogram. Recognizingit at once, Herzberg picked it up for a closer look. Instantly heshouted, "That's it!" and broke out laughing. "Eighteen years," hethought. "I've been looking for you for eighteen years." What Herzberg held that day was the first spectrogram of a simplechemical called methylene--a molecule having a carbon with a hydrogenon either side, written CH2. What was special about this? CH2 is avery unstable compound, a "free radical", very reactive; a fleetingtransition species in many chemical reactions. But its spectrum wasthe key to proving many theories of chemical structure. In addition,by training their spectrographs on the stars scientists could use thenew spectrum to identify CH2 in nebulae and other interstellarobjects. That particular spectrum Herzberg was looking at in theFall of 1959 eventually resulted in a Nobel prize in 1972. History: As a twelve year old in Hamburg, Herzberg and a friend named Alfredschulz made a home-made telescope. They patiently ground the lenses,and set them in hand-made mounts in a metal tube. On clear nights theyused to take the streetcar to the city park and set it up to look atthe moon and planets. Herzberg's mother was a vegetarian, and Herzberg has always been one himself. The Science 1. A spectrogram is created with a machine called a spectrograph. It worksby focusing a beam of light with a lens, then passing it through a prismto break it into its component parts. The light source is created by burningor photolysing a compound that you wish to investigate. 2. A spectrogram is a plate made of glass coated with photographicchemicals. When they are developed the plates have dark vertical lines.By measuring the spacing and thickness of the lines and groups of linesyou can apply mathematical formulas and determine some of the energystates of the molecules in the light source. 3. The distance between the larger lines in the spectrum is proportionalto the molecule's "vibrational" energy. The small groups clustered aroundthe major lines represent the "rotational" energy of the molecule. Theselines and their mathematical relationships are called "Balmer" lines after the Swiss high-school teacher who figured them out in 1885. 4. The molecule CH2 or Methylene. Methylene is a "free radical" whichmeans it has an extra pair of electrons that it tries to share withanother molecule. Activity: You need: a revolving chair or stool Sit in the revolving chair or stool. Now, holding your arms stretchedout at your sides, spin yourself around, or have someone else spinyou. As you spin, quickly bring your arms in. You should notice achange in your rate of rotation. Is it faster or slower? This changeyou feel is caused by the conservation of angular momentum,a principle of physics that affects the rotational energy in amolecule when electrons fall from higher orbital levels to lower ones.

The Story Story about going to get his hair cut and describing cosmologyto the hairdresser. Hairdresser calls it "cosmosis". The Young Scientist Remembers the encylopedia his dad gave him. memories of sitting on the beach in Cape Town reading "Calculus Made Easy". "What one fool can do, another can." The Science Cosmology is the study of stars and other heavenly bodies. How was the universe created, and when will it end? What happens to things that fallinto black holes? What are black holes? Israel's recent theoretical discoveries about the interior of black holes. Left:- Ground Based Composite Visual/Radio View: The giant ellipticalgalaxy NGC 4261 is one of the twelve brightest galaxies in the Virgocluster, located 45 million light-years away. Photographed in visiblelight (white) the galaxy appears as a fuzzy disk of hundreds ofbillions of stars. A radio image (orange) shows a pair of opposed jetsemanating from the nucleus and spanning a distance of 88,000light-years. Right:- Hubble Space Telescope Image of NGC 4261: A giant disk of cold gas and dustfuels a possible black hole at the core of the galaxy. Estimated to be 300light-years across, the disk provides astronomers with a clear view of thebright hub, whichpresumably harbors the black hole. The dark, dusty ring of the hub is acold outer region which extends inwards to an ultra-hot areaa few hundred million miles from the suspected black hole. Thisarea of dense stars feeds matter into the black hole, where gravity compresses andheats the material. Hot gas rushes from the vicinity of the blackhole creating the radio jets. The jets are aligned perpendicular tothe disk, like an axel through a wheel. This provides strongcircumstantial evidence for the existence of a black hole "centralengine" in NGC 4261. 1. The Hubble space telescope has now provided fairly convincingevidence (like the image above) for black holes at the centre of every galaxy. 2. As an astronaut falls into a black hole he first passes the "Event Horizon".At this point he can no longer send signals back out of the black hole. However,he can still receive messages from outside. 3. The Inner Horizon. 4. Nobody knows what happens in the inner regions of a black hole. Ultimately, theblack hole becomes a "singularity"--an infinitely massive point in space Activity Objective: To calculate the mass of a typical black hole. You'll Need: A calculator The following information. If gas and stars can be observed orbiting ablack hole at a velocity of v kilometers per second and if the orbiting objectsare at a distance of r light years from the black hole, then the mass of theblack hole in units of solar masses (m) can be calculated with the formula: What to do: In a nearby active spiral galaxy (NGC 4258), 21 million light yearsaway from Earth, there is an object called a "maser" made partly ofwater molecules that can be observed orbiting something at the centreof the galaxy that is probably a black hole. The maser is 0.3 lightyears from the black hole (r) and is orbiting it at a speed of 900Km/sec (v). Calculate the size (i.e.: mass) of the black hole at the centre of thisgalaxy. (NOTE: you can look up more about this system in Nature #373,p. 103, 12 Jan 1996) In the giant galaxy M87 in the centre of the Virgo cluster65 million light years from Earth, similar observations and calculationsshow a black hole at the centre of M87 with a mass oftwo billion suns!! Mystery Nobody knows what happens inside a black hole or where things go when theyfall into one. Einstein's theory of relativity explains most things inthe universe, until you get inside a black hole. Israel feels that a quantumtheory of gravity will need to be developed to explain what happens insidea black hole. Though people have been working towards this goal since Einstein'stime, the quantum theory of gravity has remained elusive.

The Story Krebs sits at the back of the sled, tired and happy to be pulledalong by the noisy snowmobile. Its high-pitched whine breaks the serenity of the frozen lake in Canada's North. But Krebs loves it,the crisp quiet cold, the wide open whiteness. Wind and snow sprayhis face as they plow through a snow drift. For Krebs it's a childhood dream come true. As a kid in Illinois, he read every book in the library about exploring the North Pole. He was fascinatedby the mysteries of the North. Did lemmings really commit masssuicide jumping off cliffs? Now here he was, findingout for himself. Krebs thinks about the morning as the sled swooshes alongover bumps and cracks in the ice. With him are four ecology studentsfrom UBC, two riding in front of him on the sled loadedwith research equipment, and two up front on the snowmobile.They are returning from a 6 hour session tagging snowshoe hareson a remote island in Kluane Lake in South West Yukon Territory.It's early May, 1980. Working in teams, they had just finished checking traps on a grid covering the island. These traps don'thurt the rabbits. Every rabbit was weighed, sexed, andif they didn't already have one, they got an ID tag in their ears.The researchers kept meticulous notes on clipboards. Krebs is satisfied. He's thinking about how this new data fits into apaper he's working on when suddenly the student driving the snowmobileyells, "Hold on guys," and revs the engine to jump across a crackin the ice. The lake is starting to break up with the Spring thawand they have crossed a few of these cracks already. The snowmobilemakes it across, but it opens the crack too much. Beforehe knows it, Krebs, the sled, and the two other students are sinkingfast in icy water. It doesn't help that they're all wearing winterparkas and heavy snow boots, either. Krebs treads water with one handand holds the data notebooks up with the other yelling, "Save thedata! Save the data!!" They did save the data, and themselves, fortunately, but his studentsnever let Krebs forget that day.Data's hard to come by when you are a wildlife biologist like Krebs. You don�t do much work in a comfortable laboratory. Your lab is thegreat outdoors and since animal life cycles take years, you needdecades of observations and data collection to understand a particularanimal. Even after about 50 years of research, we still don't know exactly why populations of lemmings in the North seem to disappear about everyfour years. But one thing for sure, we know they do not jump off cliffs. History Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis,Missouri. As a kid he remembers fishing for catfish in local rivers withhis grandfather. Charley admired his grandfather and his tales of naturaladventures and wildlife. In particular Krebs was drawn to the Canadian Arctic.At 8 years old he wanted to be a forest ranger. Even then, he was readingbooks about basic ecology and the science of wild animals. All throughhis high school years, Krebs had the most amazing summer job. He workedfor a St. Louis fur trading company harvesting seals in the Berring Sea.Each Summer he went by train 3 days to Seattle, then by boat 7 days upthe coast to these uninhabited Northern islands. Krebs loved it, and hewas curious about all the wildlife on the islands. It's probably becauseof these teenage trips that he has become one of the world experts onNorthern animals like lemmings and snowshoe hares. After getting his bachelors degree from the U. of Minnesota (1957), Krebscame to Vancouver, BC to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) theworld expert on lemmings. Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a PhD (62) in Zoologyfrom UBC. Then, after a 2-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back hometo teach Zoology at the of Indiana University. But in 1970 Krebs returned to Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC. Krebs' textbook called "Ecology" published by Harper-Collins andnow in its fourth edition is used worldwide as the standard teachingtext for ecology courses. The Science Zoology is the study of animals. Krebs is an animal ecologist. Ecology is a combination of physiology--the study of the internalworkings of an animal's body--genetics, evolution, and behaviour.Krebs has spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery oflemmings and other small Northern mammals whose populations crashregularly every four to ten years. Hudson's Bay fur trading recordsshow these fluctuations stretching back for hundreds of years. In 1965 Krebs tried a simple experiment in an Indiana pasture. He simply fenced in an area of grassland the size of a soccer field to seewhat would happen to the population of voles living inside the fence.(The fence extends down into the soil several inches to stop tunneling.)Amazingly, within a year, he found the populationof voles increased about 5 times. Krebs has spent his working lifetrying to explain the "Krebs effect". He says, "You just put a fence up.You don't do anything to the animals. So what is the fence doing?" 1. Lemmings are small rodents that look like guinea pigs. They livethroughout the world in Northern latitudes. Every 4 years theirpopulation increases up to 500 times and then crashes to almost nothing. 2. The "Fence Effect" also known as the "Krebs Effect" demonstratedhere on Westham Island, BC. A population explosion on the left sidefenced in area has occurred and the voles have eaten everything exceptthe thistles. 3. Graph showing the population explosion and crash caused by the fence.The gray line is for voles in a similar unfenced area. The black lineshows the number of voles over time in the fenced area. 4. Aggression in voles. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminatedpossible reasons for the Fence Effect. Food is not a factor. You can supplythe fenced in area with unlimited food, and the effect is still observed.Predators are not the answer. You can make the fence low enough to keep thevoles in but let predators like foxes in. The fence is never a deterrentfor birds of prey like hawks, yet you still see the Fence Effect. Krebs nowbelieves that the effect is due to social behaviour among the voles. Thisincludes the natural genetic selection for more aggressive individuals overthe time as living conditions become more crowded. The final crashseems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babiesin neighbouring nests. Activity Objective: To learn about animals by following their tracks You'll Need: A trip to the countryside A notebook What to do: Summer: Go to any large grassy field such as those outside most airports,and literally put your nose to the ground. Part the grass and inchalong parting it in a straight line for at least 10 meters or untilyou find a vole runway. It will be an unmistakable runway about2 or 3 cm wide like the inside of a toilet paper roll. They are likecurving tubes at the bottoms of the grass stems right near where thestems join the roots. If you don't find one on the first try, try again, maybe in a different field.The runways curve and branch in all directions. Try to draw a mapof the vole runs in a small area of the field. Winter: If you are in Canada, you probably live somewhere near a spruce forest.Go cross country skiing or hiking in the forest looking for snowshoehare tracks. They look like this:Once you learn to spot the tracks, follow a set and try to determinewhat the hare is eating. You can examine their droppings or lookfor bits of food the hare dropped while eating. Is there lots of food?Where is it located? Where do snowshoe hares like to hang out? Howdo they avoid predators like lynx and other wildcats? If you want to get a feeling for what Charles Krebs does, try to count the number of hare tracks that cross your path in a set distance, say about 100 meters. Write this in your notebook andreturn to the exact same 100 meter stretch next year to count thenumber of tracks that cross the path. Repeat this for at least 10years. Can you see a cycle begin to emerge? Mystery Krebs has still not figured out the mystery of the fence effect entirely, butone thing he would like to know is: how big does a fenced in area have to beuntil the Fence Effect dissappears?

The Story It was 1986 and Julia Levy was giving a talk in Waterloo, Ontario. Shemet the people who were doing photodynamic therapy. "For the firsttime, I became aware that we were talking about real patients beingtreated for real cancer, says Levy. The doctors were very upset withJohnson & Johnson for closing down their Photofrin research program.So many people were being helped by this technology but soon theywould not be able to get the drug. " That was a very upsettingexperience for me," says Levy. But it was also very exciting. That night on the plane flying back to Vancouver she began thinking,"We're in the business of photodynamic therapy. We should get intothis at the first level and we should maybe start making Photofrin atleast for the Canadian investigators." She sat pondering this thewhole way home and became very excited. She got off the plane inVancouver and called her business partner, Jim Miller and said "We'vegot to do something." Levy wasn't thinking about big financial take-overs. She just wanted to help those cancer sufferers. "Let's make theproduct. We know how to make it," she said. But Miller replied, "We'lltake over the company." They partnered with the pharmaceutical giant,American Cyanamid, raised $15 million and did it. That was a majorturning point for Quadra Logic. "Being in business--in commercial science--focuses your science," saysLevy. "The big difference between University and commercial science,is not the quality of the research. It's your awareness that as youmove a drug forward towards getting it into a patient, towards gettinga treatment perfected, every step costs about 10 times as much, andtherefore you cannot afford to make mistakes. Maybe that's why itsuits my personality because I don't like retracing my steps anyway. Ilike to do it right the first time. You can't afford too many goofswhen a single experiment costs $50,000." In April of 1993 the Canadian government approved photofrin for thetreatment of bladder cancer. Other cancers of the skin, lung, stomachand cervix are also treatable. Levy is now starting a fantastic new program to treat auto-immunediseases such as arthritis, psoriasis (a skin disease), and multiplesclerosis with a second generation photodynamic drug called BPD. "It'sway beyond cancer," says Levy. She and her team are curing arthriticmice by injecting them with BPD and placing them in a red-light box afew hours later to activate the drug. "We're the only people in theworld doing this," says Levy. "The exciting thing is that everythingwe've touched our hands to has turned out positively." The Young Scientist: Levy grew up in Vancouver. Even as a little girl, she was interested inbiology. On weekends she would come home from Queen's Hall boardingschool in Vancouver and go for walks with her mother in the woodsbelow 41st avenue. Their dog would romp along collecting stray dogswho would stay at their house for up to several days. Sometimes Juliawould take a sieve and a jar to bring back frog's eggs so that she andher sister could grow tadpoles in the basement wash basins. Later: She enjoyed mathematics in high school, and had a particularlyinspiring woman biology teacher in grade 11. She got a degree in microbiology from UBC. She got a PhD at University College in London, Eng. Became a professor of microbiology at UBC. Founded her own drug company, Quadra Logic Technologies Inc., withseveral other university professors. The Science 1. Photodynamic drug injected into the blood stream. 2. Lipoproteins in blood carry the drug to all parts of the body. 3. BPD (BenzoPorphyrin Derivative) drug developed by Levy and company is transported in the blood inside lipoprotein, a complex protein that carries fatty material. 4. BPD brought inside cancer cell by lipoprotein. 5. Cancer Cell. Several hours after the injection, cancer cells, which grow faster than normal cells accumulate ten times more BPD than normal cells in the body. 6. Fibre-optic Laser Into Lung. Using a fibre optic scope, doctors can enter the lung and find the cancer tissue. Then red laser light with the wavelength of 690nm is sent down the fibre optic probe. The light activates the BPD molecules creating free oxygen molecules which react with the cancer cell and effectively "burn" it up. 7. Cancer tumour in lung being destroyed by photodynamic therapy. Activity:To understand why Levy and her team use red laser light toactivate their photodynamic drugs, try this experiment. You'll Need: A good flashlight. What to do: Turn on the flashlight and put your hand over it, or putyour mouth around the bright end. What colour is the light that you see through your hand orcheeks? Why it works:Our bodies are mostly transparent to red light. The red laser light at690 nanometer wavelength that Levy uses to activate photodynamic drugspasses right through skin and flesh. Even hemoglobin, the protein thatmakes blood red, does not absorb red light at that wavelength. Why do you think red light passes through our bodies?

The Story Holding his half full gourd of "chicha", Walter Lewis smiles, wishinghedidn't have to drink another drop. It tastes so sour, like acombinationof yoghurt, warm beer and mashed potatoes. But the headman--theapu of the AchuarJivura village in the Amazonian jungle--is looking him right inthe eye. To refuse this friendship ceremony drink would be an insultto his hosts. Lewis takes another look at the yellowish liquid in his gourd. Heknows that Achuar women make chicha by chewing a kind of tapiocaroot andspitting it into a huge bowl to ferment in their own saliva. The airin the open hut is wet and hot. Lewis feels his shirt stick to thesweat on his back as he turns to see his wife sitting among the womenjustoutside the men's circle. A smoldering cooking fire gives everythingthesmell of smoked fish. The forest outside is alive with shriekingjungle birds while pet parrots, monkeys and dogs squawk and bark,leaping among the crowd of gawking naked children surrounding Lewisand his wife Memory Elvin-Lewis. "We are the zoo," thinks Lewis as hetakes a final sip of the sour tasting brew like a good ethnobotanist. Mariano the headman is telling Lewis about the healing powers of acertain plant whose roots are used to help women through the finalstages of childbirth. The Lewis's have travelled to the Peruvianjungle in search of new plants that might yield new drugs. They areethnobotanists and they specialize in communicating with nativepeoples around the world to learn of previously undocumentedtraditional medicines. While Walter is talking to the headman, Memory notices a big grin onthe face of an old woman in the back row. (In Achuar culture women donot sit with the men, but have their own special area within thehut.) Memory quietly goes to talk to the old woman who turns out tobe Mariano's aunty. She takes memory outside to show her the plantMariano is talking about, all the while telling her how men don'tknow much about this medicine, since it's strictly used by women.When Memory sees the plant she realizes immediately that it's notthe root the Achuar use, but rather the leaf. On closer inspectionlater, Walter discovers that it's not the leaf that has the medicinalquality, but a fungus which grows on the topmost leaves of the plant. The Lewis's credit many of their discoveries to the way they work asateam. If Walter had been in the jungle on his own perhaps he neverwould have discovered this medicine, since as a man, he wouldprobablynot talk to the women of the tribe, and he would have embarked on afutile search looking for the active ingredient in the roots of theplant. The Lewis's have collected thousands of plants and found dozens oftraditional medicines which require authentication by modern biomedicaland chemical analytical techniques. These include a wound healing sap that makes cuts and scrapes heal30% faster, various antimalarial plants, anti-arthritis plants, andmore. Three quarters of all drugs come directly or indirectly from plants used infolk medicine and the Lewis's are trying deperately to catalog thethousands of plants used by tropical rain-forest culturesbefore the forests are chopped down. History Walter Lewis When Walter was 12 his dad asked him what he wanted for his birthday.The Lewis family lived in Victoria, BC and Walter was fascinated byanuncle who had a nursery where he grew plants in the countryside.Walter told his dad he'd like a greenhouse for his birthday and hisfather gave him one. It was made of wood and glass and was about 3mlong and 2m wide with planting benches on each long wall. Walter'suncletaught him how to grow roses from cuttings. The next summer Walterbegan selling his roses in Victoria. His mom and dad wanted him to become a dentist. Walter went toVictoria College (which later became the University of Victoria) tostudy towards dentistry, but he took extra botany courses on the sideto satisfy his curiousity about plants. After second year universityhe announced to his parents that he would become a botanist, not adentist. Memory Elvin-Lewis When Memory was a girl her father, who was a physician, took her withhim on his house calls and as a teenager she helped in his office. She was fascinatedby all things scientific and her father encouraged her by helpingher understand what he did.She was not like other girls at Queens Hall school for girls and wanted to goto public school (Prince of Wales) where she believed she would get a better education. In high-school she always topped the class in science. As a teenager she volunteeredin the St. John Ambulance Brigade and became a sargent. At the University of British Columbia when she took her firstmicrobiology course she remembers thinking, "This is it!" In the mid-60s Memory and her co-workers recorded a case of ayoung boy dying of strange natural causes. Nobody could understandthe boy's case history or understand why he died, so blood specimens were put away and frozen. Twentyyears later when the disease of AIDS was characterized, Memory recognizedthe symptoms and had the boy's frozen blood analysed. The case is nowrecognized as the first recorded case of AIDS in America. The Science Ethnobotany is the study of plants by obtaining information frompeople around the world. The Lewis's specialize in discovering newdrugs from plants used in folk medicine by native tribes in SouthAmerica and other tropical parts of the world. The tropical jungles which make up the primary source for such plantsare disappearing. At the same time the people who know how to usethese plants are becoming "acculturated", that is they are becomingmore Westernized and they are losing their traditional culture andknowledge of the forest.The Lewis's and people like them are tryingdesperately to catalogue as many medicinal plants as they can beforeit is too late. 1. The Hut The Achuar hut sits in a clearing in the forest. Inside severalfamilies live together. Unmarried and widowed women live at one end. Meetings are held at the otheraround a Snake Stool where the headman or apu sits. Open firesburn on the floor and the smoke goes out a hole in the roof. 2. A Achuar Elder Now dead, this wise elder taught the Lewis's much about the medicinalplants of the Achuar. 3. Gourd with Holly leaves Each morning before dawn the Achuar men drink guayus, a very strongcaffeine containing drink made from these leaves. Each man usuallydrinks about a litre (4 cups). Within 45 minutes they vomit about half of it backup. The vomiting is not caused by the guayus but is a custom of thetribe. When boys reach maturity they join the men in the morningritual of drinking and regurgitating guayus. 4. Methylergonovine A chemical structure similar to the active ingredient in the ergotfungus the Lewis's found growing on a plant used byAchuar women to aid in childbirth. Activity To get a feeling for what it's like to be an ethnobotanist lookaroundyour house for six different things made out of wood. Try to identifywhat type of wood was used, where the wood came from and how it wasmade into the final product. Can you ask your "tribal elders" (yourparents or teachers) if they know where the wood came from? What doesthe origin of the wood tell you about you and your family? Another place to be like an ethnobotanist is the grocery store.Try to find out where certain produce comes from. Ethnic grocerystores like Chinese, East Indian, or West Indian stores are good places to look. Seeif you can find an unfamiliar fruit or vegetable and get somebody in the store to explain how to prepare it. Remember to watch for non-verbal clues and tricks of language. Where does the vegetable grow? How is itused? We depend on people from other cultures around the world becausethe knowledge they have about preparingfoods and medicines enriches our lives every day. Mystery In the Peruvian jungle the Achuar have shown the Lewis's aplant that they use to treat "the frightened people". TheLewis's do not know what the Achuar people mean by this, but theyfeel if this mystery could be solved then a new drug foranxiety or mental illness might be discovered.

His job is to patrol the human bodyinvestigating suspicious characters. Think of the cells in your bodyas shops on a city street. Billions and trillions of police detectiveslike Tommy T-Cell are driving by all the time looking in all the shopwindows for something unusual going on. Each T-Cell is trained to findone and only one type of criminal. Tommy is also known as a HelperT-Cell, part of the body's immune system, but you can think of him asa cop. As Tommy cruises through blood and tissue he meets a macrophage--aspecialized cell that's like a garbage truck in the body. Macrophagesgo around collecting bits of your own living and dead cells. They findparts of invading viruses and bacteria, dust, pollen and any junkthat's floating around. They stick pieces of this garbage on theiroutside surfaces in special places where detectives like Tommy can seethem. Tommy has unique Y-shaped spikes all over his surface calledreceptor sites that recognize one kind of garbage. (In 1983 Tak Makdiscovered these T-Cell receptors.) Tommy's got about 5000 of them andeach one is exactly the same. No other T-Cell has spikes like Tommy's.His are specially designed to fit a tiny bit of protein from a virusthat causes colds. Tommy tries his receptors on the macrophage, butnothing happens, so he moves on. The whole thing takes less than asecond. As Tommy floats along he remembers his days years ago at the body'sPolice Academy, the Thymus, where he learned how to tell foreigninvaders from good cells that belong to the body. Your thymus is afist sized gland located just above your heart. It is bigger and moreactive when you are a baby. That's when it gives all the T-Celldetectives in your body their life-long assignments. T-Cells start outin the thymus as police cadets. They get trained by specialmacrophages that show new T-cells every possible little bit of garbagethat your normal healthy body produces. These bits of you are called"self". T-Cells whose receptors recognize self are killed in thethymus before they can leave. If they ever got out they would becomebad cops that attack good cells instead of invaders. Tommy finally cruises up to a macrophage that shows him a piece of acold virus. He checks it with his receptors. It's a match. Right awayTommy leaps into action. The virus has only been in the body for 5minutes. First Tommy sends out chemicals that signal regular policeofficers in the body--B cells--to make antibodies. Antibodies are likeheat-seeking missiles that zero in on a particular virus and kill it.Tommy also calls in a SWAT team of killer T-Cells and together they goout in search of the invader. They also start dividing rapidly;doubling in number about every 6 hours. It takes 4 days beforemillions of T-Cells, B-Cells and Killer T-Cells are mobilized to killall the virus in the body. They are some of the fastest dividing cellsin the body. One day Tommy is cruising the body on his usual rounds when he meets athug in a black leather jacket, an AIDS virus. He decides to check himout with his receptors, but before he can do anything, the littlecreep gets right inside Tommy through a tiny hole near the handle thatTommy uses when he visits macrophages. Viruses don't usually attackT-Cells but AIDS does. That's what makes AIDS so bad. Now that Tommyhas the AIDS virus, little bits of AIDS proteins will appear on hissurface. This makes Tommy look very bad to other cells in the immunesystem. Tommy sees a Killer T-Cell coming and says his prayers. Thisguy is trained to kill anything that looks foreign. The Killer T-Cellsees that bit of AIDS on Tommy and without a second thought he killshis boss. That's the end of Tommy. The tragedy of AIDS is that T-Cells are the mastermind detectives ofthe body's defence system, the ones who organize the other cops. OnceAIDS is inside a T-Cell they look like spies to the rest of the immunesystem. So the body kills off its best cops which then makes it harderto fight AIDS and any other infection. Most people with AIDS actuallydie of a common bug that would never kill someone with a healthyimmune system. History As a twelve year old in Hong Kong, Mak came from an upper middle classfamily in a predominantly white district. Mak is playing marbles inthe dirt outside their family villa. He is surrounded by Dutch andBritish boys. He is the only oriental. Mak's dad is a successful business man in Hong Kong and they live next door to the Consulates from Norway and Denmark. Tak liked to kick soccer balls and play. He wasn't particularly goodat school but his mother insisted that he do well and study hard. Hegot by partly because he was in a very bright group of about 20 kids.Most of them went to universities all over the world. Mak went to theUniversity of Wisconsin, then received a PhD from the University ofAlberta. In the early 70s Tak Mak began his research at the OntarioCancer Institute in Toronto where he is today. In 1983 he discoveredthe T-Cell receptor and since then has become a university professorat the U of Toronto and is also the Director of the Amgen ResearchInstitute in Toronto. The Science Tak Mak is an immunologist and a molecular biologist. He examines thestructure and function of molecules and cells in the human immune system,the way your body protects you from dirt and disease. His researchis also leading to cures of many auto-immune diseases where thebody's immune systems malfunctions. Diseases like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, myesthenia gravis, and others. Ever since Tak Mak discovered the genes for the T-Cell receptor he hasbeen using this knowledge to create "knock-out" mice. These are micewith missing DNA instructions for making just one protein in theimmune system. To Mak, the immune system is like a huge corporation that's so big andcomplicated you can't tell how it functions. But there is a systematicway you can find out. One day you take "John Smith" out of thebuilding and see what stops functioning. Maybe it's the mailroom. Nowyou know what John Smith does. Then you put John Smith back and youtry the same thing with another person. Eventually you find out howthe whole company works. Mak, along with many other researchers aroundthe world, is using a similar process to understand how the immunesystem works. The human immune system is very complicated and the following is just avery simple explanation of one major part. 1. Macrophages are like garbage collectors. They get bits of moleculesfrom invaders and present them to T-Cells for identification. 2. Helper T-Cells are the "masterminds" of the immune system. They usetheir receptors to identify invaders and send signals to B-Cells andKiller T-Cells to start the attack. Each T-Cell receptor recognizes oneshort piece of a protein molecule about 8 amino acids long. There aretrillions of unique T-Cells in your body. Enough so that you canrecognize any foreign molecule that nature throws at you. 3. Killer T-Cells are better at killing viruses. They can recognize a virus and then release a toxin that kills it and any others in the vicinity. 4. B-Cells are particularly good at destroying bacteria. They makeantibodies which glom onto bacteria and make them easy to kill.B-Cells can also trigger Mast cells which act as a kind of longterm memory for the immune system so a defence can be mounted fasterthe next time. Activity One of the greatest mysteries of the human immune system is how our100,000 genes can contain enough instructions to create not only us, but also several trillion differentT-Cells? In just the last ten years researchers have discovered the cleverway it works. Try to calculate the number of possible different T-cellreceptors that your body's immune system can make from just the few hundredprotein chains encoded in your immune system DNA. You need a calculator and these facts: T-cell receptors consist of two protein chains called alpha and beta.These are chains of amino acids. All proteins are made of these.Each chain has a bottom part that is constant like the trunk of atree. The tops of the chains are divided into three major sectionscalled Variable, Diversity, and Joining. Your DNA has the genetic codeto make 109 different protein segments for the variable portion of theAlpha chain. Similarly the alpha chain can have 61 different Joiningsegments. (The alpha chain has no Diversity segment.)It has only one constant trunk segment, so to calculate the number of possible different alpha chains just multiply 109 x 61 x 1 = 6649 Here is a table to help you: Variable Diversity Joining Constant Alpha 109 0 61 1 Beta 64 2 13 2 Now try to calculate the total possible number of T-Cell receptorsthat your immune system can make. (Hint: multiply everything together.)How big is your number? Is it in the millions, billions, or trillions? Now add this fact. A special enzyme randomly puts a fewextra amino acids between the Variable and Diversity chains. Theseare chosen randomly from our 21 amino acids, so you need tomultiply again by 21 three or four times for each chain.Now how many possibilities are there? Mystery Mak believes that in the future scientists will use the immune systemto clean out residual cancer cells after tumors are removed surgicallyor killed with chemotherapy. He also believes that much bettervaccines can be developed; vaccines for malaria and other diseasesthat are currently difficult to control. He also thinks that a curewill be found for juvenile diabetes. But for Mak the biggest unsolvedmystery of all is the way the immune system distinguishes betweenforeign invaders and "self". He says the thymus is only half the storybecause many new antigens (or foreign molecules) attack our bodieslong after the thymus has finished the bulk of its work trainingT-Cells.

Steacie Character: Busy, boyish, enthusiastic, helpful Favourite Music: Tchaikovsky Other Interests: skiing, walking, art, literature, poetry The Story At about 8 o'clock on a Thursday night John Polanyi walked into thejanitorial closet he called a laboratory. It was 1956. The young U. ofToronto lecturer couldn't expect much more. He wasn't even anassistant professor yet. Polanyi's first graduate student, KenCashion, wearing his regulation short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt said,"Well, I think we're ready for another run." "Did you check the seals on the 'Stokes'?" said Polanyi, glancing at the giantvacuum pump thwapping away in the corner. "Yes. They're not great, but I think she'll hold for one moreexperiment," said Cashion. The 'fresh-air' scent of ozone caught Polanyi's nose as Cashion openedthe hydrogen valve and flicked a switch. For this experiment theyneeded to break hydrogen gas (which occurs naturally in pairs ofhydrogen molecules) into single atoms. Ken had scrounged theelectrical discharge unit from a neon sign. By jolting the flow ofhydrogen with 6000 Volts of electricity, they could break the gas intosinglet hydrogen. Polanyi always liked the soft pinky neon glow itmade but he worried about hydrogen's explosive power. Some hastycalculations the day before had shown the lab would not blow up, butthey weren't entirely sure. As it turned out, the experiment was a success andthey recorded a spectrum that no one had ever seenbefore. Because Polanyi understood the source of the feeble lightemissions in his experiment, he was able to predict exactly whatkind of energy needed to be applied to make this chemical reactiontake place. His work helped to answer the question: How do you geta chemical reaction to go? Do you tickle the molecules or do youslam them together? It turns out that in some cases tickling works,in others you just have to slam them against each other. As Polanyisays, "The importance of this work was that we had a picture ofreacting atoms in the transition state."This understanding eventually resulted in Polanyi's Nobel prize. History: When Polanyi was 11 years old his father who was auniversity professor at U. of Manchester in England, sent him toCanada so that he would not be hurt during World War II. John stayedwith a U. of T. family in Toronto for 3 years. He remembers goingon a bicycle camping trip and reading the "Count of Monte Cristo". Hewas not interested in science much, though his dad was a chemistryprofessor. He was more interested in sociology and literature. The Science: 1. The Nobel prize winning experiment When Polanyi arrived at the University of Toronto in 1956 he decided to study this reaction. A lot of energyis given off when hydrogen and chlorine react to form hydrogen chloride, but nobody knew much about the energy.Little did Polanyi realize that this little reactionwould lead to a Nobel prize 30 years later. 2. Transition state For a brief instant at the moment of reaction, themolecules are in a transition state as they turn into newchemicals. Polanyi's experiments led to a picture of the arrangementof atoms in the transition state. Knowing this, he could predict what kind of vibrational and rotational energies would result in a chemicalreaction. 3. Chemiluminescence Polanyi used an infra-red spectrometer to measure thelight energy emitted by the new-born reaction products.The product molecules "chemiluminesce".From this very feeble emission of light, Polanyi was able to distinguish between vibrational and rotational energies in the molecule.Because he understood the source of this light he was able to propose vibrational and chemical lasers, the most powerful sources of infraredradiation ever developed. 4. The "Lab" Polanyi's graduate student assistant Ken Cashion set up the Nobel Prize winning apparatus and was the first to seethe result of the experiment. The two researchers had to "borrow"the spectrometer from others. If anyone had realized how they haddismantled it and modified it for their experiment, they would have been furious. Mystery for future generation: The molecular basis of life,devices of molecular dimension, observations of chemical reactionsunder much more widely varying conditions than currently possible.

The Story When you meet Michael Smith on an ordinary day he is likely to bewearing a shabby old sweater and trousers that long ago should havebeen sent to a charity like the Salvation Army. The Nobel laureate hascertainly not allowed success to go to his head--or his wardrobe. Maybeit's because of his working class origins in the Northern town of Blackpool,England. Shortly after the Nobel announcement in October 1993, he saidto his administrator Darlene Crowe, "If you ever see my behaviourstart to change and I get a swelled head with all this attention, Iwant you to give me a good swift kick." Darlene calls her boss "Mike". She remembers only one occasion on whichshe had to "kick" him. Mostly, he behaved himself. Smith didn't evenkeep the half million dollar Nobel prize money. He gave half of it toresearchers working on the genetics of schizophrenia, a widespreadmental disorder for which research money is scarce. The otherhalf he gave to Science World BC and to the Society for Canadian Womenin Science and Technology. As if that was not generous enough, Smithinvited 12 colleagues to come to Stockholm with him, all expenses paidby Smith, to share in the glory of the Nobel awards ceremony. He tookall his research assistants, post-doctoral fellows, and graduatestudents who had done the experiments leading to the prize. Maybe it's because Smith could afford it. He made a small fortune in1988 when he sold his share of Zymogenetics Inc., a Seattle-basedbiotechnology company that he co-founded in 1981. Smith's Nobelprize-winning genetic engineering techniques were used by Zymogenetics todevelop a strain of yeast implanted with the human gene for insulin.Together with the drug giant, Novo-Nordisk, they commercialized a betterprocess for the production of human insulin using yeast. Even then, Smith was generous with his profits. He bought a cabinin Whistler, a ski resort near Vancouver. He furnished it, and said it was for the use of his coworkers,staff, colleagues, friends and children. A sign up sheet hangsin his laboratory where people simply write in which weeks they'd liketo use the cabin. Smith didn't become successful by accident. He's a very hard worker,some say a workaholic. His office is of medium size, modestly furnishedwith a cluttered, lived-in look. He has a beautiful picture-window viewlooking out onto the treed UBC campus and the coast mountains in thedistance. One wall of the office is made of shallow shelves jammed fullof medals, awards and plaques for prizes he has won. Obviously proudof his accomplishments, Smith doesn't boast about them. Things did not always come easy for Smith. When he first submitted his great discoveryfor publication in Cell, a leading academic journal, it was rejected.The editors said that, "it was not of general interest,"but he never stopped trying, and above all, he was always prepared tochange directions and do what he calls, "follow-your-nose research." The original idea for site-directed mutagenesis came to Smith while in discussion with an American scientist named Clyde Hutchison over coffeeat a Cambridge, England research lab. Smith was spending a year'ssabbatical in 1976 at Fred Sanger's Lab, which was in the famous institutewhere DNA was first explained by Watson and Crick. Smith had gone thereto learn how to sequence genes--how todetermine the order of the thousands of links that make up a chain ofDNA. He was explaining to Hutchison in the cafeteria how they weremaking short chains of nucleotides--the chain links in DNA--for use inseparation and purification of DNA fragments. Their technique was basedon the natural affinity of one DNA chain to link up with its mirror image (see The Science below). It didn't take much of a leap to realizethe same technique might be used to induce mutations, but it meantchanging directions again, and not for the first time. It took Smithand his team several years to perfect the method. In the processthey had to learn new techniques, and develop new procedures. History Michael Smith was born into a working-class family in Blackpool,England. His mother and father both had to work from their early teensonward, she in the holiday boarding house of her mother and he in hisfather's market garden. In those days, English working-class schoolchildren had to take an exam called the "Eleven-Plus" when they wereeleven years old to see if they would go on to a private school (andprobably university) or just continue in the public school system wherethey would learn a trade and finish at the age of 16. Smith did verywell in his Eleven Plus and was offered a scholarship to a localprivate school called Arnold School, but he didn't want to go becausethe students there were considered snobs and he thought his friends wouldmake fun of him. Luckily, his mother insisted that he go. It was not a very happy time in Smith's life. He lost most of his old friends. Hehad homework to do every night and they didn't. He did not like the food atArnold School but was forced to eat it by strict teachers. He was not very goodat sports which were very important in English private schools. He hadfew friends at the new school. His big front teeth stuck outso he was teased by his schoolmates. Fortunately he wassent to a dentist to see about his overbite and the dentist introduced himto the world of Boy Scouts, where he made friends and learned aboutcamping and the outdoors. It's partly because of this love of natureand camping that Smith decided to settle in Vancouver, Canada. Smith was 7 when World War II broke out, and though they lived prettyfar North in England, he does remember one time when German bombs fell oneither side of their house, just barely missing him and his brother, Robin.His mom and dad were not home. Smith did not go to a prestigious English University like Oxford, butdid get into the honours chemistry program at Manchester University. Hehoped to get a first class Bachelor of Science degree, but alas, hewas a B student. He was very disappointed, but he still got a statescholarship and managed to complete a PhD. Smith wanted to do post-doctorate research on the West coast of the USA,and he wrote to many universities, but was rejected by them all. Thenin 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver, Canada, GobindKhorana, who had a position available to work on biologically importantmolecules. This was not the chemistry in which he hadbeen trained, and it was much harder, but he went to Vancouver anyway.It turned out to be a very good decision, because in Khorana's labSmith began learning the chemistry that would lead to the Nobel Prize.Khorana himself received a Nobel Prize in 1968 for work on the geneticcode--work that Smith was involved in during the late 50s atUBC. (Smith moved with Khorana's group to Wisconsin in the USA in 1960,but in 1961 he moved back to Vancouver). For years Smith worked at the Fisheries Research Board of CanadaLaboratory in Vancouver, and published many papers about crabs, salmon,and marine mollusks, but he managed to sustain his research in DNAchemistry with outside grants. The lab was located on the UBC campus,and because he was collaborating so much with professors inbiochemistry and medicine, in 1966 he was appointed a UBC professorof biochemistry in the Faculty of Medicine where he remains today. The Science Molecular Biology is the study of biological systems at the level ofindividual chemicals and molecules. Michael Smith is an expert on theDNA molecule and the smaller molecules the body uses to make DNA--themolecule that makes up your genes, the instructionsrequired to create every part of an organism. DNA is a large moleculethat is like a twisting chain. Actually it is two chains twistedtogether. 1. A small portion of a long DNA molecule showing the backbone (in lightgray) made of deoxyribose--a type of sugar. The backbone sugar segmentsare all the same but they can have one of 4 different basic groups, Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine. Adenine on onesugar chain always matches up with Thymine on the other. SimilarlyCytosine always matches up with Guanine. In this way one chain of DNAis a mirror image of the other. In real DNA the chain would continue upfor thousands of nucleic acids and down for thousands, too. 2. The nucleotide Guanine. The phosphate sugar is on the left and thebasic group is on the right. Note the two hydrogen atoms and oneoxygen atom poking out on the extreme right that form the bond withCytosine on the sister chain. 3. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slip asynthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into someDNA on one side. Synthetic means it was created in a test-tube, not bynature. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standardchemicals for breaking and reforming DNA chains. But there is one thingwrong with the synthetic oligonucleotide: it has an Adenine where thereshould be a Guanine. This is done on purpose to create a mutation. The4 nucleotides below and above the Adenine act as a kind of address thatcauses this stretch on DNA to match up to a particular part of a longDNA strand. (In humans you need only 17 nucleotides to define a uniquematch somewhere among our 100,000 genes.) 4. When this new altered DNA is put back into an organism, say abacterium, and it divides in the normal process of growth andreproduction, one half of the DNA will recombine normally and you willget a correct copy of the original gene--a normal bacterium. The otherside with the synthetic oligonucleotide will create a mutation becausea Thymine is where there should be a Cytosine. The resulting mutantbacterium might have some new appearance or function that it never hadbefore. 5. Three kinds of site specific mutations are possible with Smith'stechnique: 1. Substitution of one nucleotide for another as shown here,2. Deletion of a nucleotide, and 3. Addition of an extra nucleotide.Before Smith's technique there was no way to create specific mutations.You had to expose a bunch of organisms to radiation or chemicals thatwould create all sorts of mutants, then you had to select the one thatyou wanted. It was all by random chance. Mystery Soon the total sequence of the DNA in all the genes for a human being willbe known--the human genome. Smith believes this will change how people do biology research. Those genes have the code or "recipe" for each of the100,000 proteins that make up a human being, but we currently only know ofabout 5,000. The hard part will be discovering what part of the human genomedoes what, picking out what is crucial, discriminating the important bitsof DNA from all the rest.

Shelves groan with bottles, dishes and jars. He passesa friend staring into a microscope. A big humming refrigerator jutsout into the passageway. Another student wears gloves while sheputs hundreds of precisely measured portions of various liquids intotiny test tubes. Richard stops suddenly just before he gets to his desk. Something iswrong with these traces. There it is: a three-base pair deletion--atype of genetic mutation in a DNA sequence. The genetic informationrequired to describe one amino acid in a protein chain is missing, asif one bead had fallen from a precious necklace. Instead of sittingdown, Richard rushes to show his supervisor Dr. Tsui (pronounced"Choy"). It's almost 6:00pm, most people have left for the night, butTsui is still working. Tsui's office is small. When Richard arrives, Tsui is hunched over thedesk poring over some other experimental results. The shelves areloaded with books. Piles of paper cover every horizontal surface.Richard looks at the shabby green rug while he waits. "What is it Richard?", says Tsui with a happy Hong Kong accent. "I'm pretty sure I've found a 3-base pair deletion. Look here." Heindicates the two traces; one from a normal person's genes and onefrom a person with cystic fibrosis--a fatal disease that kills aboutone out of every 2000 Canadians, mostly children. Cystic fibrosis isthe most common genetic disease among white people. Kids who havecystic fibrosis are born with it. Half of them will die before theyare 25 and few make it past 30. It affects all the parts of the bodythat secrete mucous; places like your lungs, your stomach, your noseand mouth. The mucous of kids with cystic fibrosis is so thicksometimes they cannot breath. Tsui looks at the printout and says, "This is very good Richard. Nowshow me that it's real." Tsui doesn't seem excited at all but he knowsthis is a solid clue, a major hint that they have found what they arelooking for: the gene for cystic fibrosis, the cause of that terribledisease. But he has had false hopes before, so he is not going tocelebrate until they check this out carefully. Maybe the differencebetween the two gene sequences is just the normal variation betweenindividuals. If you take any two normal people and compare 1000 DNAbases, you have a good chance of finding the same thing Richard justfound. There are plenty of little variations between individuals. But Tsui remembers that day, May 9, 1989, as the day they discoveredthe gene for cystic fibrosis. He and his team spent the next 5 months making it real. "The processof scientific discovery is not a simple thing. It takes months ofrepetitive tests to prove something without a doubt," says Tsui. Theyidentified a "signature" pattern of DNA on either side of thebase-pair deletion, and using that as a marker they compared 100normal people's genes with the identical DNA sequence from 100 cysticfibrosis patients. By September 1989 they were sure they had thecystic fibrosis gene. Then they had to figure out exactly what that gene did. After severalmore years Tsui and his team discovered that the DNA sequence with themutation was part of the instructions for making a special protein calledCFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator), a part ofthe cell membrane in certain special epithelial (surface) cells thatgenerate mucous. This protein regulates a channel through the cellwall for chloride ions. Proteins are made of long chains of aminoacids. The CFTR protein has 1480 amino acids. Kids with cystic fibrosis aremissing one single amino acid in their CFTR. Because of this theirmucous ends up being too thick and all sorts of things becomedifficult for them. Thanks to Tsui's research, scientists now have amuch better idea of how the disease works. We can now easily predictwhen a couple will produce a child with cystic fibrosis. Withincreasing understanding, scientists may also be able to deviseimproved treatments for children born with the disease. Why do 1 in 25 caucasians carry the mutation for CF? Tsui thinks thatpeople who carry it may also have linked beneficial mutations thatmight, for instance, give them more resistance to diahrea-likediseases. History Lap Chee Tsui grew up in a little village on the Kowloon side of HongKong called Dai Goon Yu. It was near the Kai Tak airport. Hewould hang out with a group of kids, mostly boys, and they would goexploring in ponds, catching tadpoles and fish to do simpleexperiments. One favourite project was to go to the market and buysilkworms. They would bring home the silkworms and pick leaves off themulberry bushes to feed them. Tsui remembers one day he and hisfriends picked almost all the leaves off a mulberry bush in aneighbour's yard. The furious fellow came out and chased the kidsaway. As a boy Tsui dreamed of being an architect. (He still draws all hisown diagrams and slides). Tsui did not take up genetics until afterhis PhD. He was more interested in studying the nature of diseases. The Science Molecular geneticists try to understand the structure and functionof genes. Lap Chee Tsui is particularly interested in the genefor cystic fibrosis and other genes on human chromosome number 7. 1. Human chromosome 7 The cystic fibrosis gene sits on the long arm of chromosome 7. One outof every 25 people in the caucasian population carry the geneticmutation for CF in this gene. Chromosome 7 has 150,000,000 base pairsor units of DNA. 2. The cystic fibrosis gene Using microbiological techniques, Tsui first localised the CF geneproduct to a region of the chromosome. The region has 230,000 DNA basepairs which spell out a series 1480 amino acids that curl up to makethe Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator protein. Thelittle triangle shows the location of the 3-base-pair deletionmutation that Tsui discovered. 3. Model of CFTR protein in cell membrane A normal gene makes this protein that regulates the passage ofchloride ions and hense the secretion of mucous in epithelial(surface) cells lining the gut, lungs, etc. One missing protein atthis spot causes CF. There are also 450 other kinds of mutationsassociated with CF. Activity You'll Need: Your mom's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) Your dad's blood type (A, B, AB, or O) What to do: Knowing that you get one chromosome from your mom and onefrom your dad, can you figure out what your possible blood type is?You need to know that people with blood type A can have either two Achromosomes (AA), or one A and one O chromosome (AO). Similarly peoplewith type B blood have chromosomes in the form of BB or BO. Type ABpeople have one A and one B chromosome (AB) and type O people musthave two O chromosomes (OO). So if a type AA person is the mother andthe father is type BO, there are two chances for an AB child and twochances for an AO child. Try to figure out what blood type you (andany of your brothers or sisters) might have. Mystery The genes of a monkey and a human are almost identical, varying byonly about 2%. How can such a small difference result in suchdifferent animals? Why do humans develop into humans and monkeys intomonkeys? It has to do with the regulation of gene expression which isvery poorly understood. Tsui likens the situation to two orchestras,each having exactly the same instruments, and the same music to play.Yet the two orchestras can sound entirely different, especially ifthey have different conductors.

The Story Tulving is standing at the blackboard before a 4th year cognitivepsychology class at the U of T. They're on the fourth floor of thenewly built Sidney Smith building. It's a long unfriendly room with nowindows. A blackboard stretches the lenght of one wall. Everyone is sittingaround a big table. There's a smell of fresh paint. Tulving isespousing his theory that memory is two part: laying down the memoriesand retrieving them are separate functions. "Just because a personcannot recall a word seen only a minute ago does not mean that the wordis not in memory," says Tulving. A student says, "Well, do you have any evidence for this." Tulving says, "But this is self evident," nevertheless noting thedoubtful expression on the student's face. They break for coffee andTulving goes to his office around the corner. Deep in thought andtroubled about the situation in the classroom he comes up with anexperiment to demonstrate his point to the class. He conducts theexperiment, using the class as subjects.He tells everyone to concentrate and listen carefully while he saysabout twenty words: "Yellow", "Rifle", "Beethoven", "Violin", etc.After he is finished he asks the class to write down as many as theycan remember. Most can get about 8 or 10. After they are done he picks up a student's paper and notices that she did notremember the word "Yellow". He says, "Do you remember a colour?"Instantly the student remembers "Yellow". He repeats thisfor the other missed words with the same miraculous result. Finally, thedoubting student reluctantly admits, "Perhaps you have a point." History: Tulving grew up in urban Estonia, the son of a judge, but enjoyedsummers at the family farm. His passion was sports, especially trackand field. "I was not at all interested in science--not one bit." Someof his teenage thoughts: When did time begin, what was before time,where does the universe end, ESP--is it possible? etc. BasicallyTulving was a good student, but spent most of his time pursuingsports. His friends were fascinated by crystal radios, but he was not."I found it boring because it was totally predictable whereas I wasconcentrating on trying to run one hundred meters in under 12seconds." Tulving built himself a track on the family farm andpracticed everything there from the 100 meter dash to javelinthrowing. Tulving went to Gymnasium, a type of high school in Estonia although because of the war he finished gymnasium in Germany at age 19.The only subject he found interesting was psychology, because it was totallyincomplete--he thought everything else was already known. Tulving left Estonia when he was 17. Because of the war and the Sovietoccupation of his country, Tulving was separated from his parents for the next 20years without knowing what had happened to them. From 1945-49 hespent 4 years in Germany. After the war ended he worked for the Americans as a translator and spent one year as a medical student at Heidelberg. The Science Cognitive psychologists study the human mind. They ask "How do we knowanything?" or "What is a memory?" To Tulving, the human mind is thebiggest unsolved mystery in the universe. He uses brain scanners tofigure out how memory works. 1. Encoding memories Tulving showed that memory is a two-stage process. First, memories are laid down. The front left part of the brain plays an important role in layingdown memories for specific events which occur only once (episodic memory). 2. PET Scan A PET scanner is a machine that shows what parts of your brain are especiallyactive while you are doing or thinking something. PET stands for Positron Emission Tomography. 3. Retrieving memories In the second stage of memory according to Tulving, memories are retrieved.The right front and rear of the brain appear to be important for the retrieval of episodic memories. Scientists don't know why some parts of the brain encode memories and other parts retrieve them. The Activity: Ask a friend to name all the months of the year and time the response.Most people can do this in about 8 seconds. Now ask the person to namethem in alphabetical order. Almost no one can do this correctly inless than two minutes. Both questions ask you to use your memory toretrieve something from your mind that you already know. Tulving's research shows why one is so much easier than the other. Mystery for Future Generations: Human memory is still a big mystery. How do we travel back into our own personal past using only our minds?

It's around 1960. She's talking about thesymptoms of trisomy of the 18th chromosome--having three #18 chromosomes instead of the normal two--when a doctor named JackSinclair raises his hand and says, "Hey, I think we have one of thoseon the 4th floor." He takes her up to the ward right away and they geta blood sample and add some anticlotting agent. She immediately goesto work to identify the chromosomes. This was something very new, and hadnever been done by anybody in Winnipeg. First she lets the red bloodcells settle in the vial, then she takes the white blood cells off thetop with a pipette. She puts them in a glass container about 1" by 2.5"long containing a medium where they grow and multiply for threedays inside an incubator. Then she takes out the liquid andcentrifuges it down, then fixes the cells with acetic acid solution, then drops themonto a glass slide so the cells break and spill out their chromosomes.She stains this and looks for the chromosomes under the microscope. The room she's in has the vinegary smell of acetic acid. Low tables bythe windows have lots of microscopes with technicians in white labcoats seated at most of them. High benches where they make theirpreparations are over along the opposite wall. Uchida was able toidentify the chromosomes that day as being 18 trisomy and this was afirst for Winnipeg and Canada. History: Irene Uchida was born in Vancouver, BC. Her father, who was brought toCanada as a young man, ran a Japanese stationery and book store and waschairman of the board of the Alexander Language School. She joined Canadian Girls in Training at the Powell Street UnitedChurch. She served as organist for services and choir work, and wasalso in demand as pianist for meetings as she could play any requestby ear. At UBC she was a member of the Japanese Students Club, CosmopolitanClub and a violinist in the UBC orchestra which provided the music fortheir annual productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. She alsoserved as a reporter for The New Canadian, a weekly JapaneseCanadian newspaper in Vancouver. During WWII, she was very active inthe Japanese Canadian Citizens for Democracy which played a vital rolefor the Japanese community in Toronto and nationally as well. This wasa period of great anxiety for all the Japanese who were uprooted fromtheir homes in BC by an Order-in-Council of the Federal Government. In 1942 she was evacuated from her comfortable home in Vancouver toChristina Lake, a self-supporting centre of the Japanese, but wascalled shortly afterward to act as principal of the largest Japanesecamp school in the Kootenays at Lemon Creek. Her innovative ideasdeveloped unusual programs for extracurricular activities which didmuch to stimulate the youth in creative pastimes. Two years later she moved to continue her education at Victoria College (University of Toronto), graduating in 1946 with a BA and also winning the RamsayWright Scholarship. Although she had planned to take up Social Work,she was persuaded by one of her professors to enter the field ofgenetics. In 1951 Dr. Uchida received her PhD in Zoology from the U of T andbegan her career as a Research Associate at the Hospital for SickChildren in Toronto. Her work in genetics involved the study of twins,mongolism, children with congenital heart diseases and those with avariety of other abnormalities. The studies on twins are stillongoing. In 1959, while working with Drosophila fruit flies at the U ofWisconsin on a Rockefeller Fellowship, she turned her attention tohuman chromosomes. When scientists in France discovered thatmongoloids had an extra chromosome (47 instead of 46), Dr. Uchidadecided to try to learn the cause of the extra chromosome. She wasappointed Director of the Dept of Medical Genetics at the ChildrensHospital, Winnipeg, in 1960. In her first study of human chromosomes, Dr. Uchida found that thereappeared to be an association between maternal radiation and Downsyndrome (mongolism). Then in 1969 with a Medical Research Council grant shewent as a visiting scientist to the University of London andHarwell, England, to study the technique for analyzing thechromosomes of mouse ova. Dr. Uchida continued her research on the effects of radiation onhumans and mice at the McMaster University Medical Centre, as well ascarrying out her teaching duties as a professor. As Director of theCytongenetics Laboratory, she had responsibilities which included thediagnosis of chromosome abnormalities in patients with congenitalabnormalities, mental retardation and other genetic diseases as wellas prenatal diagnosis of chromosome anomalies. She was thegeneticist who worked with doctors on the Genetic Counseling Programthat she initiated at the McMaster Medical Centre. She has publishedpapers on the effects of radiation, abnormalities in chromosomes, etc.She has been invited to speak in many countries and is a member ofvarious provincial, national and international scientificorganizations. The Science Cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes in cells. It concentrates on thebehaviour and identification of chromosomes. 1. Banding Our 23 pairs of chromosomes have tens of thousands of genes that carry the informationneeded to create a unique person. For each pair, one comes fromyour Dad, the other from your Mom. The bands indicate different types of DNA.Geneticists use the bands to match the pairs. 2. X & Y chromosomes You can tell by Jodi's two X chromosomes that she is a girl. Boys haveone X and one Y chromosome. 3. Chromosome 21 About 1 child in 700 is born with Down syndrome. It's caused by theaccidental tripling of chromosome 21 during conception. Normally youhave 23 pairs of chromosomes. Other genetic diseases are caused bytripling of number 13 or 18. This is called "trisomy". People withtrisomy of chromosomes 13 or 18 usually die as fetuses, resultingin miscarriages. Those who are born alive do not usually live morethan a year. To find out more about human genetic diseases visit theWebPathdatabase of cytogenetic diseases. 4. Jodi Special Olympics champion and actor Jodi Kaczur with actor ArnoldSchwarzenegger. Down syndrome people are not so handicapped aspeople think. They are very happy, generally affectionate and alwaysnice people. Activity: This is a typical chromosome spread that cytogeneticists routinely examine and sort under a microscope. Try to pair up the chromosomesand see if you can discover if this person has Down Syndrome or someother form of trisomy. You can print out this page and cut the chromosomesout with scissors, then move them around and match them up. Mystery for Next Generation: Find out how to inactivate one of the chromosomes in a 'tri'individual. Since this happens naturally in all women--one of their Xchromosomes is always inactivated--this technique might "cure" some ofthese genetic diseases in the parent or at an early embrionic stage.

Admission to BRIET is a fairly involved process and is selective. I have been asked for advice to provide mathematics majors beginning the Mathematics Departments' TC program in preparation for applying to BRIET for Secondary Mathematics certification. Well, here it is: PREPARING TO BE MATHEMATICS TEACHER Here are some ideas to share with Mathematics majors in the TC program to prepare themselves for entrance into BRIET and to strenghten their chances of getting employed. 1. Take seriously every opportunity to improve your writing and public speaking skills. 2. Join the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Association of Mathematics Teachers in New York State. Read the journals/newsletters you receive and other NCTM and AMTNYS publications. 3. Become proficient with graphing calculators and computer software used in mathematics and the teaching of mathematics. 4. Read about and think about current issues in education (start with those you hear about in the news). Formulate at least an initial reaction to these issues. 5. Find opportunities to work with children and adults in educational settings. 6. Be able to talk generally about current issues and advances in the field of mathematics and important applications to other fields. 7. Think about your classes from a pedagogical standpoint and consider keeping a journal. Ask questions like: What was difficult about a class/topic? What made the topic difficult? What helped you learn the concepts? What instructional aspects of the course was beneficial to you and/or other students? What would you want to be different?

Its overall goal is to provide a source of information relevant to this topic and to encourage thinking about practical, theoretical, and research issues related to effective teaching. The site was developed as a class project by students in a graduate seminar on Research on Teaching (CEP 572) at the State University of New York at Buffalo during Fall 1996. The students' analyses and critiques of selected topics related to the site's theme are included, as are links to other Web sites and print resources that are relevant to this theme. This site is still in the process of being developed. Your comments and suggestions on how it might be improved, or other material that might be included in or linked to the site, would be helpful in our attempts to make the site as useful as possible. The site was last updated on December 16, 1996. A box for comments is available at the bottom of each page. Copies of any comments you send will go to the person who developed the page and to the instructor of the course, Tom Shuell. Comments on the site in general can be sent to Tom Shuell either by clicking here or by e-mailing your comments to shuell@acsu.buffalo.edu. THANKS for you help! Scope and Organization The concerns and issues related to effective teaching are vast. Obviously, it is not possible to deal with all the relevant topics in this initial effort. Nevertheless, as a framework for the current vision of this web site, a number of general concerns have been identified. These are listed below in the hope they will helpful in integrating and giving structure to our efforts. Links to electronic resources are listed, as well as citations of at least a sampling of relevant print resources (journal articles, book, etc.). Suggestions of additional resources (both print and electronic) that might be included are welcome. General Topical Areas and Issues The concern for effective teaching for learning can be characterized in a number of ways. Theoretical, practical, and empirical issues are all involved in understanding the relationship between teaching and learning. The following outline identifies some of the topics and issues considered relevant to theme of this web site. Those that have have been developed appear as links; the remaining may provide a context for the types of issues considered important. The reciprocal relationship between theory and practice. Historical perspectives -- in most cases, this concern has been integrated into the various sections. Guidelines for practice -- typically, these will not be guidelines we have developed; rather existing guidelines will be identified, when appropriate. Tradtitional research on teaching, such as process-product research. Current models of teaching and learning and their implications for effective teaching.

In this course, students will be required to keep a journaland to add to it weekly. In some cases topics for the journal entries willbe assigned, but more frequently the choice will be left to you. The purposeof the journal is to provide a forum for individual critical reflectionon topics and issues raised in classes or in readings. Your journal entriesshould not be merely a summary of class discussions or readings, but shoulddeal with personal reactions and concerns, applications of ideas you haveencountered, connections you have noted, reflections on your past experienceas a student or teacher, musings, and so on. The entries should demonstrateyour ability to reflect and expand on issues related to the course whichconcern you personally. Self-analysis and growth should be evident. Thejournals will be collected periodically for feedback from the instructorand will be evaluated at the end of the course on the basis of their thoughtfulnessand the contribution to your individual engagement with the content ofthe course. Each weekly entry should be at least two hand-written pageslong. * Journals * * Course Info * * Portfolio * MAJOR PROJECT The major project for the course should be focused on a specific, well-definedtopic related to the teaching of mathematics in the secondary or middleschool. Topics could include the teaching of a particular mathematicalcontent area (e.g., the Pythagorean Theorem), a particular pedagogicaltechnique (e.g., cooperative learning), or an educational issue relatedto curriculum (e.g., What are basic skills?), instruction (e.g. When shouldstudents use calculators?), or assessment (e.g., How do you assess problemsolving ability?) in secondary school mathematics. Other topics could includethe connection of broader educational issues to mathematics (e.g., equityand bias issues). The project will include a paper, a set of lesson plans, and a classroompresentation. Introductory Paper The introductory paper should describe in approximately 10 double-spacedtyped pages: the topic to be addressed research and theory related to the topic how the NCTM Standards relate to the topic methodological issues motivating your lessons introduction to your lessons-What should we see? What do your lessonsexemplify? How do they address the issues described earlier in the paper? Lesson Plans Develop five lessons (do not have to be five consecutive days). Theselesson plans should illustrate the issues raised in the introductory paperand how you would deal with these issues. For each lesson describe: CONTENT and AUDIENCE: Describe the mathematical content you plan tohave the students investigate and the audience intended. Include your objectivesfor the students. TEACHER'S ACTIVITY: Describe what the teacher would do or say. ACTIVITY: Describe what you would have the students do and includeany written instructions or materials you would provide the students. ASSESSMENT: Describe how you would determine if the students had metyour expectations. What instruments would you use and what would you lookfor? ANTICIPATIONS: What difficulties do you anticipate the students having?How would you deal with these difficulties? Classroom Presentation You will be responsible for 30 minutes of class time. During this timeyou should provide an overview of your topic. A significant portion ofthe time should involve your classmates and professor in an activity thatillustrates the issues addressed in your project so that we can understandyour topic through our own experience rather than by simply being told.You should also distribute a four-page hand-out to the class. * Journals * * Project * * Course Info * PORTFOLIO The portfolio is your demonstration of your development understandingrelated to the course content.

The term was introduced by Allan Collins of BBN Laboratories and John Seely Brown and Susan E. Newman of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (ref). It refers to a general model for teaching that has been adapted to specific content areas and programs. There has been a good deal of reserach examining the utility of the technique, much of it overwhelmingly positive. In addition, many specific teaching programs which do not profess to be modeled after cognitive apprenticeships, do embody the principles of the method. One such example, LOGO, is discussed in this web site. This section of the Teaching for Learning web site includes the following: A general overview of cognitive apprenticeship. A glossary with more detailed discussion of specific features of cognitive apprenticeships.

Reciprocal Teaching -- Reading Comprehension Reciprocal teaching is a technique developed by Annemarie Sullivan Palinscar and Ann L. Brown for increasing reading comprehension. In many ways, it is a tool to instill metacognitive strategies in students. These authors identified three factors which affect one's ability to comprehend text: (1) the clarity of presentation -- syntax, style, grammar, and the like, (2) compatibility of reader's knowledge and content, (3) reader's use of strategies to increase comprehension and retention. They then developed an instructional method focusing on the third factor -- metacognitive skills .The technique exemplifies the principles of the cognitive apprenticeship model. It involves four concrete strategies which the novice reader employs while reading: (1) summarizing (a form of self-review), (2) questioning, (3) clarifying, and (4) predicting. The method involves the expert teacher first modeling the strategies for all of the students. Then, each student plays the role of the teacher and leads the discussion. As in other cognitive apprenticeship models, the teacher guides and scaffolds the students as they need it. He or she gradually reduces this support as the students become more proficient. Click here for an annotated list of recipricoal teaching references related to reciprocal teaching Problems Solving in Mathematics Alan H. Schoenfeld, professor of mathematics and science technology at Berkeley, has extensively researched metacognition in mathematics and science. He has developed an instructional method of problem solving in small groups that exemplifies the theoretical basis of cognitive apprenticeships. The principles involved in this "scaffolded knowledge instruction" are (1) making expert thinking visible through modeling (2) building on prior knowledge, (3) scaffolded instruction, and (4) cooperative learning utilizing real world problems. Dr. Schoenfeld has a website which details his work. It includes two descriptions of research projects that employ these principles. One project is the Computer as Learning Partner (CLP) which is developed to improve middle school science instruction. In addition to the theoretical rationale, this site also includes several specific curriculum examples for teaching light, sound, and thermodynamics. The Knowledge Integration Environment (KIE) project is designed for middle and high school students, and involves using the Internet to develop and test scientific theories. In addition to a theoretical rationale, details on 8 ready-to-use group projects are given. Teaching for Conceptual Change No one enters into a learning situation (or any situation, for that matter) without having some expectations or preconceived notions. Students, for example, have naive ideas of speed and acceleration before they are introduced to them formally in a physics classroom. These initial understandings of a process or concept are based on the learner's prior knowledge gained from experience and interactions with individuals and the social world. Furthermore, these misconceptions are often resistant to change -- despite the fact that they are also often incorrect or at least incomplete. Individuals must be confronted with some sort of cognitive conflict which spurs them to adapt and reconstruct their knowledge based. Teaching for conceptual change, as discussed by Anderson and Roth, is based on these principles of the structure (misconceptions) and construction (social interactions) of knowledge. This approach to instruction fits within the framework of the cognitive apprenticeship model, and is one in which the teacher plays a vital role throughout. Initially, the instructor presents students with a problem or question and queries them to ascertain initial degrees of understanding and to become aware of commonly held misconceptions. A teacher could begin a discussion of probability by talking about the lottery, for example. Through this discussion, it might become apparent that some students think that certain numbers are more likely than others to be drawn. The teacher then works from these "starting points," developing tasks, posing new questions and revisiting the old to create the cognitive conflict in students. He or she usually presents these ideas and questions via modeling, coaching, and scaffolded dialogue. As students progress, teachers gradually lessen their overt assistance. Because all decisions regarding the manner in which content is presented are based on teachers' assessments of student misconceptions, it is important for these evaluations to be accurate. On the surface this may not seem a difficult task, but this is not necessarily the case. Often, once we understand a concept or gain a skill, it is difficult to transport ourselves back to a time in which we were naive about the subject. The research literature documenting misconceptions could prove very beneficial in this regard.

W., & Gainen, J. (1995). Reenvisioning statistics: A cognitive apprenticeship approach. In J. Gainen & E. W. Willemsen (Eds.), Fostering student success in quantitative gateway courses, (pp. 99-108). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers. The authors examine seven aspects of active learning -- experiential learning, collaboration, discovery, authentic problems, planning before doing, risk taking, and integrative learning. They are discussed in the context of three principles of cognitive apprenticeship: authentic activity, scaffolding, and expert practice. An example of a cognitive apprenticeship model for teaching elementary statistics is detailed. Weather http://www.covis.nwu.edu/Papers/Fishman&D'Amico.html Which Way Will the Wind Blow? Details a project developed for a unit on weather for a high school level earth science course. The plan for this unit is part of a larger project, The Learning Through Collaborative Visualization (CoVis) project conduced at Northwestern University. CoVis utilizes a computer network providing students with access to satellite maps and other weather related and scientific information. The ultimate task for the students is to create their own weather maps and to use them in predicting weather forecasts. The manner in which this is accomplished highlights several aspects of cognitive apprenticeships including authentic practice of real world science, a contextualized task, collaborative work, testing prior conceptions (intuitions), teacher as scaffolder (not dispenser), and observation of expert systems (professional weather maps on-line). Included in the document at this web site it a pedagogical rationale for the program and unit, a fairly detailed description of the actual computer program utilized, and a list of references. Minerals http://www.uq.edu.au/~zzredcol/V.T.Proj.html "The Virtual Tutor Project" This document describes the HyperCard program, Virtual Tutor-Minerals, currently under development. The program is designed to foster an understanding in the students of the process of systematic identification which is involved in classifying minerals. The process is one in which expertise is developed over time and through concentrated effort, and therefore the cognitive apprenticeship model is the model for this program. This document describes the underlying rationale for Virtual Tutor-Minerals, discusses the software briefly, and indicates areas for further development.

Each one is defined by the behaviors of students and teachers, and by the instructional objectives. In the cooperative structure, students work collectively to achieve a common goal. Situations are contrived that enable students to rely on one another to accomplish a goal. The teacher's role in cooperative learning is multidimensional. Thus, this section will specifically deal with several aspects of cooperative learning (see below) as it relates to effective teaching. In other words, the different sections will discuss how cooperative learning can effectively be incorporated in our classes, and how can students get the most out of this experience. The literature review and previous research has shown the benefits that implementing cooperative learning can offer. Through working together to learn complex conceptual information and master knowledge and skills, students' achievement is increased creating positive relationships among the students, students have more fun, and develop many other skills, such as learning how to work with one another.

There is an increasing diversity of students in the classroom, including cultural diversity, language diversity, socioeconomic diversity, and ability diversity. The classroom teacher is faced with a group that is comprised of students with varying degrees of prior knowledge, conceptions and misconceptions about various topics, experiences, and abilities. Each of these factors has been shown to be associated with student learning. This reality may pose problems for the classroom teacher as he or she attempts to engage in the most effective teaching possible. This web page will focus on classrooms with students of varying ability, particularly those with students who have some type of disability, and on ways to implement effective teaching in these environments. The questions of whether inclusion is beneficial to the child with a disability, the classmates without disabilities, the teacher(s) involved, or the families of the children involved remain controversial. One thing that is not controversial, however, is that inclusion is on the rise in the United States, as well as in other countries. (Putnam, Spiegel, & Bruninks, 1991) Although teacher preparation programs are responding to this change, the general education teachers who are practicing have, in many cases, received little basic training in how to negotiate the dynamics necessary for effective teaching in this type of setting. Some ways of dealing with this issue have been discovered and reported by teachers who have been faced with the situation, and have developed strategies on a trial and error basis. Some strategies have been proposed by special education teachers, who have also had to modify their method of service delivery to adapt to the new settings. Finally, some methods have been proposed as organized systems of teaching that have been developed by faculty members at Universities, or other "think tanks" that have been working to address these issues. This web page will draw from each of these resources, as well as from information in effective teaching in general education to develop ideas for effective teaching in inclusion settings.

The main emphasis will be on understanding the problems and issues associated with conducting and interpreting this research, including its relevance to the improvement of educational practices. The topics will be approached primarily from a psychological perspective with a heavy emphasis on how teaching relates to the psychology of human learning. A general overview of the course will be distributed during the first class. The course is designed for doctoral students in all departments who wish to study various issues related to theory and research on teaching -- master's students may enroll with permission of the instructor. A basic knowledge of the psychology of human learning is assumed -- e.g., CEP 560 or CEP 563 or CEP 564 or equivalent. Course Format The format of the course will consist primarily of seminar-type discussion. Since the field has changes so dramatically during the past few years, an effort will be made to identify and define the theoretical, empirical, and practical issues associated with effective teaching. Thus, the class will work jointly to identify issues involved in understanding the nature of teaching and its relationship to student learning, locate relevant articles, discuss the extent to which current knowledge of teaching and learning is capable of improving educational practices, and discuss ways in which future research on teaching might increase our understanding of effective teaching and learning from instruction. The instructor will prepare five to ten questions each week to stimulate student thinking as they prepare for that week's class. Students are expected to use these questions in preparing for the class discussion, but written responses to the questions are not expected. Rather, they are designed for students to use in thinking about the readings and topic, and possibly in preparing their own questions for class, as described in the next paragraph. Students are expected to prepare for each class meeting by reading the articles indicated for that day, reviewing the instructors questions for the week, and preparing their own questions on the assigned readings and/or the topic being discussed. Each student should write out at least five questions and bring them to class. The main purpose of these questions is to facilitate class discussion by having students identify questions they would like to see answered during the discussion. In order for me to adequately prepare for each class, I would like to receive a copy of the questions ahead of time; you either can send them to me via e-mail or see that I get a hard copy before noon on Wednesday. In addition, a semester paper or project will be required. Semester Paper One of the major requirements for this course will be a paper or project to be completed by each student by the end of the semester. Several alternatives are possible, although the paper/project must relate, in some defensible manner, to the issues and ideas contained in this course. One possibility, to be discussed further in class, would be for a number of students (or the whole class) to create a Web page on the topic. More traditional possibilities include a literature review and critique of the theory and/or research associated with a topic related to the course or a proposal for an empirical study that possibly could be carried out either this semester or next spring (although data collection is not necessarily part of the requirement for the paper). Finally, you may have another idea in mind that would be appropriate for the assignment. If so, be sure to discuss it with me early in the semester. In fact, all students are encouraged to discuss their papers with me early enough in the semester so that my feedback will be available in sufficient time to take it into account in working on the paper. Grading Students may receive either a letter grade or be evaluated on an "S/U" basis. You will be asked to indicate which system you prefer some time during the first half of the semester. Grading will be based on the quality of the semester paper and other written assignments, as well as on the quality of class participation. A grade of Incomplete ("I") will be assigned only if the student is making regular and reasonable progress toward mastering the appropriate criteria for a grade and if advance arrangements have been made with one of us for completing the course requirements within a reasonable and specified period of time.

Concludes that reciprocal teaching is a powerful technique with the potential for promoting transfer and generalization of metacognitive strategies. Rosenshine, B., & Meister, C. (1994). Reciprocal teaching: A review of the research. Review of Educational Research, 64, 479-530. Meta-analysis of 16 experimental studies which examined the effects of reciprocal teaching on achievement. Two groups of studies were reviewed: those in which all strategies were taught during the modeling dialogues, and those in which students were first introduced to the strategies via worksheet activities. In general, findings were positive. The median effect size for teacher-made assessments was .88, for standardized tests it was .32. There were no differences in results based on grade level, number of instructional sessions, or class size. Less able students (but those who were able to decode text) did have greater pre- to post-test gains than did those of average or high ability, however. On possible explanation for this was that the more able readers were already employing metacognitive strategies. One of the major shortcomings of the studies noted by the reviewers was a lack of attention to the quality of the reciprocal teaching. This is a critical aspect of reciprocal teaching that needs to be addressed. The authors list 5 criteria that may be explored in future studies: (a) concentration on the "concept level" rather than "word level" of student contributions to dialogue, (b) attention to linking student ideas to new constructs, (c) dialogues with focus and direction, (d) making the purpose of instruction explicit, and (e) constructive formative evaluation.

Other Technology References Related to Cognitive Apprenticeship Henderson, R. W., & Landesman, E. M. (1993). The interactive videodisc system in the zone of proximal development: Academic motivation and learning outcomes in precalculus. Journal of Computing Research, 9, 29-43. Discusses using videodisc players for graphic displays of real-life problems solving situations. Preparing for Calculus is a series of 8 modules each focusing on a topic in precalculus, such as number line and inequalities, functions, exponents, and the like. The format for each module is as follows: a mathematician models the concept to be learned and then real-world examples are shown with voice-over explanations. The computer then presents an initial problem to the student, which is used to assess his or her initial understanding. Based on error patterns, the computer suggests certain practice exercises. Individual problems can be presented with the "prompt" feature enabled or disabled. This feature explicitly draws the student's attention to relevant aspects of the previous demonstrations. Social learning theory and Vygotsky's concept of scaffolding and the zone of proximal development provide the theoretical backdrop for this videodisc program. It is aligned with the principles of cognitive apprenticeship, as well. The lesson begins with modeling, followed by practice and feedback and gradual diminution of help. The computer acts as scaffolder, assessing the student's current ability and ZPD, and providing constructive feedback to support the student. The prompt device governs the cognitive load taken on by the students. One serious limitation of this program is in the nature of the scaffolding; the computer is not sensitive to the individual learner in this regard. The computer can assess each student's ZPD and choose subsequent problems accordingly, but it cannot substitute for the personal attention of a teacher who can more readily tailor explanations and tasks to incorporate individual differences. Thus, a more beneficial approach would be to develop a videdisc module that permits (or perhaps requires) a degree of teacher-student interaction as well. Murfin, B. (1994). Constructing a MEZOPED (Multiple Electronic Zone of Proximal Development). Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching, 13, 405-413. Discusses computer-mediated communication (CMC) as it may be used to "link the minds of many children and scientists in a multiple electronic zone of proximal development." Focuses on the social and cultural aspect of learning and on the possibility of contact between experts and novices on a large scale. In attending to the culture and prior knowledge and experiences of individual students, proposes that profiles of students be gathered. Thus, the computer could tailor (to the degree that the programming permits) explanations to students to take into account their gender, race, social and cultural background, and relevant prior experiences. Schoaff, E. K. (1993). How to develop a mathematics lesson using technology. Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching, 12, 19-27. Gives practical advice to teachers in utilizing technology in their classrooms for lessons which involve simulation, exploration, or experimentation. Outlines a three-step process designed to use technology to give students access to mathematical concepts. Step 1 is to learn the technology. As a teacher, one must be intimately familiar and comfortable with anything he or she uses to instruct students. The second step is to list the attributes of the technology -- that is, to distinguish what the program does as opposed to what it is used for. For example, the attributes of a spreadsheet include use of recursive formulas, and organization of data in matrix form. The third step is to match problem-solving strategies with the attributes. This is difficult because it changes the nature of the classroom. That is, the teacher must formulate not how to explain a concept, but how to pose questions so that the students can construct knowledge.

With respect to cognitive apprenticeships, technology may be a potential means for addressing some of the issues relating to implementation of programs. For instance, computer programs could function in part as the expert modeler, freeing the teacher to provide individual assistance on an as needed basis. Students could also work in small groups on one computer, thereby facilitating cooperative learning and deeper understanding. LOGO, a computer programming language created by Seymour Papert for teaching children geometry, is one technique that fits many aspects of the cognitive apprenticeship model. The theoretical foundation for LOGO is aligned with the work of both Piaget and VanHiele, and is therefore constructivist and deals with stages or levels of thinking. Both theorists discuss the resolution of some type of cognitive conflict in which the child's explanation of a process or construct does not coincide with his or her observation of reality. The resolution of these conflicts is very much akin to what is involved in conceptual change. In LOGO, students issue commands that direct the movement of the cursor (shaped like a turtle) to create geometric objects. For instance, to draw a square a child may need to command the turtle to move fd 50 (forward 50), rt 90 (turn right 90 degrees), fd 50, rt 90, and so forth. Through practice and exploration, students begin to understand the abstract principles of geometry and geometric concepts. Several researchers and theorists have discussed additional benefits of using LOGO such as increased problem solving ability and socioemotional growth. Although it has not been labeled a cognitive apprenticeship model, almost all of the principles fundamental to cognitive apprenticeships are also apparent with LOGO. The only aspect that is not specifically discussed on the literature is the modeling-coaching-fading. True, this is the fundamental principle of cognitive apprenticeship, but because it has not been framed in such a manner, does not mean that the features do not apply. As with all instructional techniques, the utility of LOGO depends upon the manner in which teachers implement the program. In order to be most beneficial, it seems that implementation will involve some degree of modeling. Although Papert envisioned students being involved in almost total discovery learning, most classroom uses have employed guided discovery. For instance, teachers must first introduce the concept of the LOGO programming language, and provide the students with the necessary fundamentals to use the program. Proponents of LOGO also suggest that lessons may begin with small group or whole class discussions, brainstorming as to approaches to solve a problem, and then implementation. Several research and practical articles discuss other elements of effective lesson. (Click here for a list of references.) Interaction with the computer provides the students with the practice necessary to gain an understanding of abstract geometric principles and constructs. Children can also utilize the program to test hypotheses. Once these principles are learned, the child is no longer dependent upon the computer -- he or she can discuss geometric concepts in the abstract. Thus, modeling, coaching, and fading may be appropriate ways in which to frame discussions regarding LOGO. The other features of cognitive apprenticeships are much more readily apparent: Cooperation and Dialogue One of the hallmarks of LOGO programs is that children work in pairs or groups. Sharing one computer, students must ideally discuss how to accomplish a task and agree upon a method for doing so before "jumping in" with no plan. They must also hypothesize the reasons a particular approach may not be working and suggest possible solutions. Generalization To some extent, the purpose of most of teaching is to foster generalization of isolated facts and skills to their underlying principles. LOGO programming makes the conditions for generalization inviting. For instance, having to repeat the commands fd 50 rt 90 four times to create a square, the child will (hopefully) see a pattern. In fact, LOGO allows one to write macros. That is, a child could give this combination of commands a name, and then direct the computer to draw a square by "telling" it to repeat this combination four times. Global first, then local Children are usually presented with a task or game worded in the finished form -- e.g., draw a square. Thus, they are aware of the larger goal. In addition, when working through a problem, they can focus on macro concepts first, and then attend to the micro aspects later. Confronted with the task of drawing an isosceles triangle, for instance, a student may first work on creating any triangle, and then explore means of refining it. Reflection Reflection occurs as the result of many aspects of the LOGO method. In explaining their hypothesized reasons for errors to the other(s), for instance, children must reflect upon other viewpoints in order to defend their own. Also, in proposing courses of action, they must translate their thoughts and strategies into programming steps. Scaffolding Scaffolding can occur on several levels. The existence of the computer frees up the teacher to rotate among the students, assessing their current knowledge and ability. He or she can then, through carefully chosen feedback, assist students on an individual basis, which is much more efficient. Students can also scaffold one another when working in groups. It may also be possible, depending upon the way in which activities are developed an implemented, that the computer be the scaffolder at times. Simple first, then complex Because of the capacity of the computer and the LOGO language, it is easy for teachers to create a series of assignments which build upon one another in complexity. Metacognitive Strategies The debugging phase of the problem solving process of LOGO programming encourages monitoring in students, as was discussed in the reflections and cooperation points of this page. The use of technology for cognitive apprenticeships may also alleviate some of the difficulties or issues involved in implementing cognitive apprenticeship programs: Making thoughts visible By requiring the students to program the computer to draw a square, for instance, their intuitive understanding of the properties of the square are concretized. The must actually write down that they intuitively know to be the properties of a square -- four equal sides separated by 90 degree angles. Number of students/time constraints Computers have a strange ability to captivate both children and adults. Therefore, the use of the computers may actually keep children more on task, and permit the teacher to rotate through the class, giving help when needed. He or she does not, in other words, need to be commanding the attention of all students at any given time. This alleviates some of the difficulties inherent in having an apprenticeship in which there is one master working with 30 novices.

It has been noted that learning within and outsideof school is quite different (Shuell, 1996).Outside of the school context, apprenticeship is one of the most prevalentmethods of learning. In fact, learning from watching and to some extentcopying others may be one of the most natural and, at least initially,most efficient, ways in which people learn. Under this assumption, the main criticism of traditional teaching in schoolsis that it is often a decontextualized presentation of facts and concepts,without any ties to real world problems and/or situations. There is a concern,therefore that students are not learning the type of knowledge and skillsthat are valued by our society. Theoretically, cognitive apprenticeshipscircumvent this shortcoming in part by focusing on real world applications. Traditional apprenticeships have three dimensions or aspects: (a) observing,(b) coaching, and (c) practice. Collins, Brown, and Newman list analogousdimensions applying to cognitive apprenticeships: Traditional Apprenticeships Cognitive Apprenticeships Observing Modeling Coaching Coaching Practicing Fading During the modeling phase, the teacher takes on much of the cognitiveload and demonstrates the process that the students are to learn. It isimportant to note that although the students are not overtly active duringthis phase (i.e., they are not using concrete manipulatives or engagingin dialogue) they are constructing a conceptual model of the "bigpicture," or ultimate goal, of the process. This provides the studentswith something tangible to which they may refer when learning and practicingthe sub-processes of task. They are, for instance, able to understand thepurpose behind each piece of the larger whole. The coaching phase refers to the stage of learning during which the teacherorganizes learning opportunities to facilitate the learners' mastery ofthe educational objectives. The teacher also provides hints and remindersof the techniques (s)he previously modeled. The teacher continues to help or provide scaffolding in this way, as thestudent gradually builds his/her knowledge base and skills in the givenarea. When appropriate, the teacher reduces his or her overt presence andsupport, fading away, and leaving the learner to think and do on his/herown. Thus, not only does the cognitive apprenticeship model incorporate ourcurrent knowledge about the ways in which people learn, but it also attendsto one of the fundamental issues in reform movements today -- a focus onreal world and practical applications. This must not, however, be done to the exclusion of attention to the moreabstract, generalizeable, type of knowledge traditionally valued in schoollearning. In other words, there must be a balance between training (orpreparation for life), and what is considered " traditional, classiceducation" (Shuell, 1996). Teachers mustbe aware of this potential trap, and design their instructional episodesso as to include attention to the abstraction of general principles. Collinsand his associates seem to address this issue by including three additionalteaching methods in their discussion: (a) articulating, (b) reflecting,and (c) exploring.

An overview of several of these aspects is given below, with specific attention to how they relate to cognitive apprenticeships. Pertinent references and resources are also listed in the references section. Context. This principle asserts that learning is not context free, but rather situational (click here for references on situated cognition). Learning is not accomplished in a vacuum; all learning is done within a context and for a purpose. For instructional purposes, certain contexts are more effective than others. Teachers must consider this in planning their lessons, and strive to organize learning situations accordingly. Tasks must be as "real world" and as relevant to the students as possible, for instance. Care must be taken, however, to maintain the educational significance of the tasks. (This can be accomplished by incorporating the articulating, reflecting, exploring factors of learning.) Additionally, one cannot reduce learning to isolated situations, so the teacher must also work to make connections between concepts and to facilitate an understanding of underlying principles (see the generalization entry in this glossary). Cooperation and dialogue. In the "real world," very little learning is done in total isolation. Rather, learning is often a goal directed and cooperative effort of individuals seeking to achieve some tangible objective. Cooperative learning has been studied extensively in teaching situations, and there are several reasons proposed for its superiority. Some of those relevant to cognitive apprenticeships include the supposition that by working with others, students are exposed to different, often contradictory, thought processes and conceptions. Through negotiation, discussion, dialogue, and reflection (see entry in this glossary) individuals must examine the reasons behind their concepts, articulate them, and in that process gain a deeper understanding of the constructs involved. Expert vs. novice. The distinction between experts and novices is obviously fundamental to the cognitive apprenticeship view of teaching and learning. There has been a good deal of research related to these differences. Initially, research studies focused on simply delineating the differences in performance, memory, and use of cognitive strategies between members of these two groups. More recently, the focus has been on examining the process by which individuals move from novice to expert. These latter studies will be of particular interest to teachers and others interested in instructional design. Generalization. This is one area in which traditional apprenticeships and cognitive apprenticeships differ. In the former, learning is accomplished when the skill (usually physical) is attained. The learning is tied to the task, in other words. Although it is recognized that learning is situational, some degree of transfer is also required for learning to be successful in the cognitive apprenticeship. For example, if a student learns the concept of adding fractions only in conjunction with slices of pizza, there is a danger that he or she will not be able to apply the abstracted principles to another situation. Global understanding first, then local aspects. Under the cognitive apprenticeship model, the teacher focuses first on the global aspect of the task and then on the separate aspects. In other words, students are aware of the goal, or "finishing state." This knowledge of the big picture facilitates a more complete understanding of the purpose underlying the separate tasks. The global portion of this process is accomplished through the modeling or observation stage of cognitive apprenticeships. Reflection. Reflection is a hallmark of expertise (see expert vs. novice entry). Cognitive apprenticeships are designed to give the student a basis and an opportunity to develop such reflective strategies. The modeling phase, during which the student observes the teacher, provides him or her with a conceptual model of the process on which to draw, and with which to compare and evaluate his or her own cognitive development. Scaffolding. The teacher provides the student with support. Vygotsky used this term in conjunction with the "Zone of Proximal Development" (ZPD). The ZPD refers to a child's current level of ability of functioning. An individual cannot perform tasks that fall within his or her ZPD without assistance, but can do so with the help of a more capable peer or a teacher. Through support, guidance, and practice, an individual masters more tasks, and moves farther ahead on the continuum toward total mastery. Thus, the ZPD moves as well; as certain tasks "fall out" of it, other, more advanced tasks, enter. Simple first, then complex. In traditional apprenticeships such a tailoring, the novice tailor may begin by sewing buttons, but never by creating an entire shirt. The reason is obvious; the task of sewing a shirt is complex, consisting of many individual tasks each of which must be mastered before the procedure can be successful. The only way to do this is to concentrate on perfecting the simple tasks, and then gradually adding on to them, making them more complex, until they represent the process of creating an entire shirt. The same is true in the case of cognitive apprenticeships. A student cannot perform integration in calculus, for example, without knowledge of basic algebraic principles. This notion is very similar to scaffolding (see entry in this glossary) and controlling the cognitive load. At the beginning of learning a process, the teacher assumes much of the cognitive load. That is, he or she organizes the learning environment so as not to overwhelm the student with tasks that are simply too advanced based on the child's prior knowledge and level of cognitive functioning in a given area. At first, the student is required to perform relatively simple tasks alone. Gradually, the simple tasks will should then be integrated with one another. Eventually, the complex process which represents the educational objective can be accomplished. Strategies. In many ways, much of the processes that the teacher models are control or regulatory, and are referred to as metacognitive strategies. This is especially evident in reciprocal teaching, a method for increasing reading comprehension developed in the cognitive apprenticeship framework.

There are several issues involved: Making thought processes visible. This is the crux of any apprenticeship -- a tailor must SHOW his or her pupil how to sew on a button. Analogously, a teacher must SHOW his or her students the processes involved in the task or concept being taught. Because the focus of cognitive apprenticeships is on the processes involved with learning, it is not enough to simply tell students the product. Rather, the teacher must explicitly model how he or she arrived at this product. For example, in reciprocal teaching, the teacher should not simply give examples of questions he or she might ask regarding a passage, but should also attempt to inform the students what in the text prompted him/her to think of the questions and to phrase them as (s)he did. This type of modeling is difficult to accomplish. It requires a deep understanding not only of the factual material, but of one's own thought processes as well. Additionally, it is beneficial to be aware of the differences between the functioning of novices and experts in the given domain. By understanding common ways in which naive individuals interpret or perceive a concept, teachers can tailor the explanations of their own thought processes to make these distinctions apparent to students. Number of students/time constraints. Ideally, an apprenticeship involves one novice working with at least one master. In school, the situation is reversed. Hence, the teacher must determine each student's zone of proximal development, his or her current interpretation of a concept, the reasons for any misconceptions, and the best manner to dispel those misconceptions, in addition to maintaining order and attending to teaching the required material. Research in conceptual change may assist teachers in understanding misconceptions. Assessment. Assessment is an important component of any instructional method. The current trend in evaluation is toward authentic or performance assessments. In short, there is a feeling that traditional multiple choice tests do not assess what is valued in our educational system today -- thought processes and problem solving ability, for example. Tied to this is the notion that assessment and instruction should be aligned. In other words, it is not "fair" to test students in a manner which is discrepant from the way in which they have been taught? This brings up several issues relating to cognitive apprenticeships. In most cognitive apprenticeships there is the dual purpose of teaching content and processes. For example, ideally the goals of reciprocal teaching are twofold. One goal is to increase student ability to comprehend text, and the other is to teach students to utilize the metacognitive strategies to do so. One might ask then, how to evaluate students in this framework. Should assessment instruments simply present students with a passage of text and require them to answer questions which will be used to assess comprehension? Or should these instruments be designed to elicit information regarding the child's use of the strategies taught. A second issue in assessment addresses the kinship of activities used in teaching and learning and those in assessment. If, for instance, students always work cooperatively, is it fair to evaluate them individually? Because there are obvious reasons for requiring individual assessment, teachers may need to build some type of solo practice into their cognitive apprenticeship models of teaching. Subject areas. The general literature regarding cognitive apprenticeships does not delineate specific subject matter areas for which the method is applicable, and theoretically, there is no reason that the novice/expert metaphor should not hold for most types of learning. It seems that history and foreign language, for example, could be taught through modeling, coaching, and fading just as effectively as can reading comprehension and mathematics. Of course, the specific technique utilized may need to be revised. Reciprocal teaching, for example, was developed specifically for improving reading comprehension, and it focuses on metacognitive strategies. Several of these strategies could be used in other subject areas. Reciprocal teaching has been discussed in terms of mathematics. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

Metacognition has been linked to a wide variety of positive academic outcomes for students, such as better grades and performance on tests of intelligence. There has been some suggestion that gifted students use more metacognitive strategies than non-gifted students. There has also been research suggesting that learning disabled students can benefit from using these strategies. So, it is important for teachers to be aware of metacognition. There are also ways teachers can encourage metacognition. What is metacognition, anyway?. Historical perspectives on metacognition. Metacognition isn't just a recent psychological idea. Similar concepts have been discussed since William James and Vygotsky, although these concepts were not really fully integrated into teaching and education. Current perspectives on metacognition. Metacognition has really taken off since Flavell's 1976 and 1979 articles. What's being said about it currently, and how does it relate to teaching and learning as we face the 21st century? Metacognition and marginal students. Lots of research has focused on learning-disabled and gifted students. How does metacognition relate to these concepts, and what does it do for classrooms Teaching for metacognition. OK, so metacognition seems to help students. There are several simple things teachers can incorporate into their classes to help your students become more metacognitive. Issues of which to be aware. Is knowing which strategy to use to solve a math problem truly metacognition? What about knowing how to read Shakespeare? What about knowing that you study better in a brightly lit room? And how does one assess metacognition? There are lots of issues to deal with as this field grows into its own. Links to Web sites concerned with metacognition.

Advantages/Benefits of Cooperative Learning Developed by Luz Rodriguez In a meta-analysis of over 600 research studies, Johnson and Johnson (1989) concluded that among other benefits, cooperative learning: minimizes and even eliminate class, gender, disability, and ethnic barriers. frequently enhances and never inhibits achievement. keeps learners on task. empowers learners and give them a positive impression of their learning activities. develops interpersonal and group skills. facilitates active and interesting learning experiences. Thus, well-planned cooperative learning should control for the following problems usually found in small group learning: individual members who don't do their share of the work, other members who do more than their share, thus enabling inequitable workload distribution. group leaders who emerge because of personality rather than expertise or skill for the task at hand. gender issues that affect the roles members assume. group think in which members feel coerced into validating results with which they may not agree. wasted effort due to poor time on task.

Learn. Definitions Definitions of Cooperative Learning Developed by Luz Rodriguez Johnson et al. (1992): Cooperative Learning is the instructional use of small groups so that students work together to maximize their own and each other's learning. For CL to occur, the professor must carefully structure learning groups. There is a crucial difference between simply putting students in groups to learn and in structuring cooperation among the students. To be cooperative a group must have clear positive interdependence, members must promote each other's learning and success face to face, hold each other personally and individually accountable to do his or her fair share of the work, use appropriately the interpersonal and small-group skills needed for cooperative efforts to be successful, and process as a group how effectively members are working together. Bryant and Rivera (1995): Cooperative Learning is defined as sharing the benefits of working collectively to gain knowledge or skill through study and experience. Each student engaged in CL benefits from working as a team, not only by developing academic, communication, and social skills but by receiving credit for the work of the group as a whole. A primary concern with CL is team members working toward a single purpose, as it may be the case of the completion of an assignment. Acquiring academic knowledge is but one aim of CL. CL affords an excellent opportunity to develop interpersonal skills (e.g., turn-taking, collaborating, etc.), to increase overall communicative competence, particularly those associated with language content and form, practicing newly acquired language skills. Each student is actively engaged in the learning process by studying together (i.e., collectively exploring the nature of the content and using their experiences (i.e., prior knowledge) to arrive to a common goal. Each participant is an active, rather than a passive, learner. Each member experiences learning, and all members contribute to the effort by calling upon their experiences and strengths. To sum up: CL is an instructional approach that involves active participation by a heterogeneous group of students toward common goals. Brody (1995): Cooperative learning evolved primarily in K-12 schools, but there are active networks of teachers in all fields and institutions of higher education who apply the research and theory of cooperative learning in their settings. Cooperative learning is a system of team learning that structures group work in a such a way that it promotes both academic and social outcomes. The emphasis is on teacher's role in classroom management, and establishing and assessing social as well as academic goals. the practice of cooperative learning accounts for ways to structure a productive and positive interdependence among students while holding their individual accountable for the outcomes. It has generally been a management and instructional tool to assist teachers in troubleshooting problems and conducting more effective, achievement-oriented group work.

Learn. Principles Cooperative Learning Principles: Essential Elements Developed by Luz Rodriguez Understanding the essential elements allows teachers to think metacognitively about cooperative learning and create any number of strategies and lessons. This will allow them to tailor cooperative learning to their unique instructional needs, circumstances, curricula, subject areas, and students. Sevearl different elements of cooperative learning have been identified in the literature (Holubec, 1992; Johnson & Johnson, 1986; Jules, 1992): Positive Interdependence: The students must believe that they sink or swim together. The success of the group depends on the success of each group. In order to strengthen positive interdependence, joint rewards, divided resources, and complementary roles may also be used. member; thus, group members work together to promote individual and group success. Accountability: All individuals are accountable for their actions as they relate to the rest of the group and group's success. The performance of each individual student is assessed and the results given back to the group and the individual. It is important that the group knows who needs more assistance, support, and encouragement in completing the assignment. Collaborative and Social Skills: collaborative decision-making, trust-building, communication, leadership, conflict-management, etc., as well as social skills (such as accepting and giving criticism and praise, listening, turn-taking, sharing, compromising, being responsible for materials, tasks, and roles, etc.) are important elements in cooperative learning because they represent the ways in which individuals interact and work collectively. These should be taught prior to placing students in cooperative groupings. Group processing: it is conducted after the cooperative activity occurs. Students then critically examine their group behavior by using an evaluation sheet and discussing their interactions (what effective or ineffective skills were used). Teachers need to ensure that members of each cooperative learning group discuss how well they are achieving their goals and maintaining effective working relationships. Groups need to describe what member actions are helpful or unhelpful and make decisions about what behaviors to continue or change. Face-to-Face Promotive Interaction: Teacher must ensure that students interact to help each other accomplish the task and promote each other's success. This in turn, results in both higher achievement and in getting to know each other on a personal as well as a professional level. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

Learn. Activities Teacher Preparation: Building Cooperative Activities Developed by Luz Rodriguez Getting Started Holubec (1992) writes "Often teachers jump into cooperative learning and find the waters are much deeper than expected. Their students complain, refuse to work, copy rather than learn, and socialize. As the teachers struggle back to shore, they may decide that staying on the bank is better than the possibility of going under ... Just as they did not learn to swim by jumping into deep water, they and their students probably will not learn cooperative learning by jumping headlong into it" (p. 181). Teachers may find the following tips helpful: Discuss cooperative behaviors with students (e.g., When groups are working really well, what are people in them doing?). Group size should be small (i.e., when students work well in pairs, they can graduate to threes). Teachers should choose the groups either by having students randomly count off or by assigning heterogeneous pairs. Working alone is not a choice. Teachers should encourage and support the partners of reluctant students. In order to get a student interest in having a partner, sometimes it works to structure some fun or difficult work, where partners are a definite advantage. Initial cooperative activities should be of short duration (approx. 5' to 10'). Students should not be given anything that takes any longer until they are working successfully in the allotted time. Teachers need enough training and practice on the essential elements of cooperation to become educational engineers who can take their existing lessons, curricula, and courses and structure them cooperatively. Well-structured cooperative learning lessons are differentiated from poorly structured ones on the basis of these elements. Gaining Expertise Teachers need to progressively refine their competencies in using cooperative learning by: Planning and teaching a cooperative lesson. Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their lesson. Reflecting on how to better teach the next lesson (thus clarifying the teacher's conceptual understanding). Planning and teaching a second cooperative lesson with the modifications suggested by the feedback received about the first. Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their second lesson, reflecting on how to better teach the next lesson better, and teaching the third lesson, etc. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

Research Successful Research on the Efficacy of Cooperative Learning Developed by Luz Rodriguez Hauserman (1992) states that numerous studies have illustrated the academic and affective benefits of cooperative learning techniques, elevating levels of student achievement, providing the greatest gains for low and middle achievers, minority groups, and handicapped students. Likewise, high achieving students have performed equally well or better in cooperative learning situations in comparison to students in control groups that have used individualzed methods. Overall, research has indicated that there is significant group-to-individual transfer, allowing for greater levels of achievement in science, computer classes, mathematics, reading comprehension, and higher quality cognitive reasoning strategies.

Lesson Plans Sample Lesson Plans for Cooperative Learning Developed by Luz Rodriguez Cooperative learning can be used with some confidence at every grade level, in every subject area, and with any task. Sherritt (1989) provides the following sample cooperative learning lesson plans for ABE and ESL classes. The three topics are: (a) cultural plurality, (b) community social services, and (c) biology. Group Learning Goal Sample 1: A Cultural Lesson: Identify the behaviors in a designated story that illustrate cultural conditioning. Sample 2: A Lesson on Community Social Services: Write and present to the class a group report on community social services. Sample 3: A Biology Lesson: Identify the characteristics of a prokaryotic cell. Group Processes Goal Sample 1: Practice good listening techniques Sample 2: Use conflict resolution skills Sample 3: Practice making eye contact. Individual Goals (Individual assignments can be adapted individual levels so that each member contributes to the group goal and experiences a measure of success according to his/her abilities) Sample 1: After reading the story, each individual will identify illustrated cultural behaviors that conform to or conflict with his/her own. Sample 2: Each group member will research one community social service, acquiring information to share with the group. Sample 3: Each member will have a different cell characteristic to research and to teach to the other members Roles For all samples: Recorder records important points from the group discussions. Leader keeps the discussion going by ensuring that everyone participates and no one dominates. Reporter reports group progress to the entire class Synthesizer sums up what is being discussed Evaluation/Products Sample 1: Each group will submit a matrix of cultural behaviors evident in the story and their relation to the cultures of group members. Evaluation will be based on cohesiveness of the matrix and accuracy of individual responses. Sample 2: Each group of four will submit a cogent, well-written report on four local social service agencies. The group will serve as a panel, with each member presenting to the class information on his/her research. Evaluation will be based on cohesiveness of the report and the quality of information (verbal and written) provided by the panel. Sample 3: Individuals within groups will complete a test on the characteristics of prokaryotic cells. Individual grades will be tallied and feed into a composite group grade We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

How to Make Cooperative Learning Effective Developed by Luz Rodriguez Educators are always look for effective ways to impove their teaching in order to make students' learning a much more rewarding experience. Among the vast array of effective teahcing methods is the so-called Cooperative Learning. As previously pointed out, cooperative learning involves a whole lot more than just putting students in groups and letting the "work cooperatively." For example, it should have a cooperative task structure and cooperative reward incentive, so that the group can work together to coordinate their efforts to complete the task interdepentally and at the same time ensuring that individuals are accountable for the group performance.

There are, however, other interpretations to the meaning of motivation. Corno (1992), for example, reports on a study by Hansen (1989) in which students were presented with assignments which were considered to be confusing or boring. While some students withdrew from productive engagement, others used coping mechanisms to clarify the assignment and persisted in their attempts to complete the assignment. These behaviors suggest, according to Corno, that there are complex social and cognitive factors besides motivation which influence a student's learning behavior. She concludes that these may be volitional processes such as assuming responsibility for learning and regulating concentration, behavior, and affect. Corno believes that these are elements of a class of student processes which is required for learning and that is distinct from motivation. These volitional activities are thought to be different from either affective elements such as liking or enjoying an activity or cognitive elements such as using learning strategies for accomplishing the intended goal. Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation Students are expected to engage themselves in the learning process by implementing purposeful learning activities (1) such as choosing challenging educational goals, employing various self-regulatory learning strategies (2), and having failure tolerance in order to master the goal. However, many students appear unwilling or unable to focus their attentions toward learning mastery, choosing rather to select less challenging goals, employing minimal learning strategies, and quitting when unable to meet the goal easily. These differing student behaviors toward learning activities and goals are classified as resulting from either intrinsic or extrinsic motivational orientations. (3) A student who is intrinsically motivated approaches educational activities as meaningful for the sake of the learning itself. The student selects mastery goals through which he or she can improve competence, understand or expand personal knowledge, or achieve personal mastery. There is a sense that effort leads to success. Learning strategies include the employment of methods to manage the learning by breaking the task into smaller manageable goals which enables the student to be incrementally successful. These successes reinforce persistence with the overall task. There is additionally a sense of pride in accomplishing one's goals. However, failure is often attributed to inadequate effort. In contrast, students with an extrinsic orientation to learning are more likely to choose performance goals which can be accomplished easily, with minimal effort. The student's focus is not on the learning but on demonstrating competence compared to that of others. Success is frequently attributed to being more clever than others, pulling one over on the teacher, or on being lucky. A student with a performance goal orientation requires success for a sense of self-worth. Since failure is very damaging to this type of student's ego and these students also tend to use very limited learning strategies, they are very likely to quit making the effort if initially unsuccessful or if the task appears too daunting. Summary Intrinsic motivation is contrasted with extrinsic motivation as being characterized by a student's being concerned with mastery rather than comparing ability with others', learning for the sake of learning rather than performance, and being involved with the task rather than a concern with one's ego. Students with an intrinsic motivation also believe that effort and success covary while those students with an extrinsic motivational orientation choose easier goals requiring less effort or use effort minimizing strategies such as getting help from others, copying, or guessing.

They indicate that there are three different components of self-regulated learning: an expectancy component, which includes students' beliefs about their ability to perform a task, a value component, which includes students' goals and beliefs about the importance and interest of the task, and an affective component, which includes students' emotional reactions to the task (p. 33). (4) The expectancy component is concerned with the student's asking, "Can I do this task?" Do students believe that they can do the task and are they responsible for their own performance. The value component is concerned with the students' goals for the task (mastery or performance) and their beliefs about the importance of the task. With respect to value, students ask, "Why am I doing this task?" The motivational component is concerned with the affective or emotional reactions to the task, including test anxiety. Students ask, "How do I feel about this task?" Pintrich and De Groot found that the intrinsic value of the material to the student and a belief that the school work was interesting and important resulted in greater cognitive engagement. The ability to utilize learning strategies was tied to performance. However, the students who were more likely to be self-regulating and to persist in their academic efforts were those who were intrinsically motivated to learn the material rather than just trying to get a good grade (p. 37). Material that is interesting or perceived to be meaningful to students seems to lead to greater cognitive engagement and students who value the learning have a greater interest in the task. They will utilize more metacognitive strategies in order to be successful. As the research of Pintrich and De Groot indicates, students require both the "will" and the "skill" in order to succeed with learning tasks. Nicholls, Patashnick, and Nolen (1985) researched whether there was any relationship between adolescents' views about the purposes of education, their beliefs about the causes of academic success, and their personal goals. They asked whether education seen was an end in itself, a component of becoming a responsible and knowledgeable adult, or as a way to gain wealth and status. Their hypothesis was that motivation to master and understand rather than belief that purpose was to get wealth should result in stronger personal commitment to learning. (5) Nicholls et al. analyzed student responses to questionnaires as to what the students thought to be the purposes of schooling (wealth and status, commitment to society, understanding the world, and achievement motivation) with their personal goals in school, satisfaction with school learning, perceived causes of success, and their perceived ability. Avoidance of work behavior (choose easier task that can be done quickly and try to gain favor) was highly correlated with the belief that the purpose of education was to get wealth and status. Students with work avoidance behaviors also believed that success was more related more to luck than effort. Also status seeking students believed that success meant surpassing others. Their success demanded another's failure. They had less satisfaction with school and little interest or plans for attending college. Students with a task orientation who believed that learning was integral to their future lives had greater sense of satisfaction with school. They tried harder to understand material and worked collaboratively. They also saw the teacher as a person rather than as a means to an end. They also had plans to go to college. Causal relations for the two different groups of students were consistent with their beliefs. According to Nicholls et al. (1985), "students who are inclined to feel successful when they do well without effort...are more likely to believe that students succeed when they know how to impress people and act as if they like the teacher" (p. 691). They do not see effort and interest in learning as necessary for success in school. Students who seek to understand and to learn believe that they can succeed if they work hard. They note that the correlation is interesting and in keeping with world view. They suggest that promoting the idea that the purpose of schooling is to get a good job should be discouraged. Emphasizing socioeconomic goals for students may be counterproductive and require value reexamination. Meece, Blumenfeld, and Hoyle (1988) studied fifth and sixth grade pupils comparing their perceptions of academic competence, their intrinsic motivation, and their goal orientation. In this study, the students who showed greater intrinsic motivation had a stronger interest in task mastery than students with less interest. They were, according to Meece et al., "oriented toward gaining recognition, pleasing the teacher, or minimizing effort as much as possible" (p. 521). Graham and Golan (1991) compared motivation with recall. Fifth and sixth graders were given a puzzle to do for a few minutes. Then they were presented with a learning task. However some of the students were told that the task was fun and challenging and that one got better at it as it went along. Others were told that their performance would be about the same as on the puzzle. Some people were better at it than others. They found that the students who were led to believe that they could master the task were more successful in the follow-up test. Clearly, student beliefs influence classroom behavior. The ego-focused context had "detrimental consequences for performance" (Graham & Golan, 1991, p. 193). In contrast, "a mastery goal orientation...promotes a motivational pattern likely to promote long-term and high quality involvement in learning" (Ames, 1992, p. 263).

He developed the list with the expectancy x value theory of Feather (1982). According to the theory the effort people will expend on a task is a product of: (1) the degree to which they expect to be able to perform the task successfully if they apply themselves; and (2) the degree to which they value participation in the task itself or the benefits or rewards that successful task completion will bring to them. (Brophy, 1987, p. 41) Brophy suggests that there are certain essential conditions including a supportive environment, an appropriate level of challenge or difficulty, and meaningful learning objectives. He then sorts and twenty-nine elements into categories including maintaining success expectations, supplying extrinsic rewards, capitalizing of students' intrinsic motivation, and stimulating student motivation with a number of methods. Frymier and Shulman (1995) studied the importance of immediacy behaviors and relevance on student motivation. Immediacy is a perception "of physical and/or psychological closeness." Verbal and non-verbal immediacy behaviors, according to several studies cited by Frymier and Shulman, have been found to have several positive effects including "increases in affective learning, perceived cognitive learning, recall of information, and motivation" (p. 41). They suggest that immediacy behaviors help to increase attention, build confidence, and increase satisfaction among students. These conditions are also necessary for students to be motivated. The fourth condition that Frymier and Shulman found particularly meaningful was relevance of the content to student interest and goals. They found that relevance did correlate with motivation to study. Many times classrooms are likened to work places. Learning tasks are identified as work. Students complete work without cognitive involvement, without understanding the skill or concept. Marshall (1988) finds the comparison of school to work fails to identify the classroom as a place of learning. Marshall suggests that the goals, the recipient of the intended benefit and the benefit itself, the control or authority base, incentives, and evaluation are clearly different between workplaces and learning environments. Learning-oriented teachers provided reasons for their students to engage in the learning and encouraged student responsibility. Common themes included an emphasis on thinking and the challenge of learning, the purpose of school and the assignments as learning, peer helping, self-evaluation of learning, supportiveness of errors as a part of the learning process, as well as acceptance of individual differences, positive expectations, and preventive management. (Marshall, 1988, p. 15) Marshall concludes that there must be changes in the conceptualizations of both teachers and students. Teachers need to see themselves as experts with knowledge to share and they need to have a greater knowledge of learning strategies to help students learn. The student must identify him or herself as a learner not as a worker. Students need to see that they are the intended recipients of the benefits of learning. Summary With inadequate motivation, a student is likely to show little interest or cognitive engagement with learning. There are, however, many elements and approaches which may be undertaken by the teacher in the classroom to encourage students. When students are able to have a sense of security and belonging, when they feel an immediacy with the teacher, and when they begin to be successful, even in small steps, they begin to have greater interest and involvement. With success, the student has a sense of self-efficacy and is more inclined to use effective learning strategies. Even when there is little motivation at the onset, even small successes can stimulate motivation. The teacher must strive to incorporate behaviors which provide emotional and educational support to students. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

Two of the most common are "mainstreaming" and "inclusion". While these terms may be used interchangeably in the literature, the most common definition of each is as follows: (Rogers, 1993) MAINSTREAMING: This term has generally been used to refer to the selective placement of special education students in one or more "regular" education classes. Mainstreaming proponents generally assume that a student must "earn" his or her opportunity to be mainstreamed through the ability to "keep up" with the work assigned by the teacher to the other student in the class. This concept is closely linked to traditional forms of special education service delivery. INCLUSION: This term is used to refer to the commitment to educate each child, to the maximum extent appropriate, in the school and classroom he or she would otherwise attend. It involves bringing the support services to the child (rather than moving the child to the services) and requires only that the child will benefit from being in the class (rather than having to keep up with the other students.) Proponents of inclusion generally favor newer forms of education service delivery , such as heterogeneous grouping, peer tutoring, multi-age classes,... cooperative learning, and development of school media centers which stimulate students' electronic access to extensive databases for their own research (Rogers, 1993). In addition to benefiting the child with a diagnosed disability, inclusive education has also been a movement to "reconstruct classes so that all children representing the range of diversity present in our communities are welcome and provided with an appropriate, meaningful education" (Giangreco, Baumgart, and Doyle, 1995). Therefore, in addition to addressing the needs of the traditional special education students, inclusive education should also address the needs of the students who may traditionally receive special services, such as those with mild difficulties, borderline disabilities, or difficulties in select areas. Inclusive education is thought to include at least six basic elements (Giangreco, Cloninger, Dennis, & Edelman, 1994): All students are welcomed in general education classes in their local schools ("inclusion for some" is a contradiction in terms). Students are educated together in groups in which the number of those with and without disabilities is proportional to the local population (e.g., 10% to 12% have identified disabilities). Students with varying characteristics and abilities participate in shared educational experiences while pursuing individually appropriate learning outcomes with necessary accommodations and supports. Shared educational experiences take place in settings predominantly frequented by people without disabilities (e.g., general education classroom, community work sites). Educational experiences are designed to enhance individually determined valued life outcomes for students and therefore seek an individualized balance between the academic/functional and social/personal aspects of schooling. Inclusive education exists when each of the previously listed characteristics occurs on an ongoing, daily basis. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

These concepts share some commonalties, in that they assume that: Learning is a social process Competence involves expertise rather than native ability Learning, at least meaningful learning, is constructive and self regulating Classroom activities should reflect real - world learning rather than traditional academic tasks. Each of these ideas appear to be congruent with the ideas of inclusive education. Teacher Expectations and Student Performance One difficulty in teaching in an inclusion setting is allowing for the diverse abilities of the students involved, without decreasing one's expectations to such an extent that it becomes difficult for the child with a disability to progress to his or her fullest potential. Thomas Good (1987) discusses the role of teacher expectations on teacher-student interactions and on student performance in general education. Some interesting points that can be applied to inclusion are: Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Teacher expectations of a student lead to a behavior that makes the original erroneous belief come true. For example, if a teacher believes that a student is gifted, he or she is likely to treat the student in a particular way, and , in turn, the student is likely to progress at a more rapid rate than would have otherwise occurred. Sustaining Expectations: This occurs when teachers do not see a student's potential and, therefore, treat the student in a particular way. It is likely that the student, in turn, will not progress to his or her fullest potential. This certainly has the potential to be problematic in students with disabilities who are in inclusion classrooms. Teacher understanding of this potential problem, consultation with special education team members, and overt cognitive attempts to avoid this may help to reduce the risk. Brophy-Good Model (1970). This model explains how teachers communicate their expectations to students, and how students respond. The model states that: The teacher expects different types of behavior and achievement from different students. Because of these varied expectations, the teacher behaves differently toward different students. This treatment communicates to the students what behavior and achievement the teacher expects from them and affects their self-concepts, achievement motivation, and levels of aspiration. If this treatment is consistent over time, and if the students do not resist or change it in some way, it will shape their achievement and behavior. High-expectation students will be led to achieve at high levels, whereas the achievement of low-expectation students will decline. With time, students' achievement and behavior will conform more and more closely to the behavior originally expected of them. Good and Brophy researched this model and found 17 differences in the way that high achieving and low achieving students were treated in the classroom. These are: Waiting less time for lows to answer Giving lows answers or calling on someone else, rather than trying to improve lows' responses by giving clues or additional opportunities to respond. Giving inappropriate reinforcement: rewarding inappropriate behavior or incorrect answers by lows. Criticizing lows for failure more often. Praising lows less frequently for success. Failing to give feedback to the public responses of lows. Paying less attention to lows generally or interacting with them less frequently. Calling on lows less frequently to answer questions. Seating lows farther from the teacher. Demanding less from lows. Interacting with lows more privately than publicly and monitoring and structuring their activities more closely. Administering or grading tests and assignments differently in which highs but not lows are given the benefit of the doubt in borderline cases. Having fewer friendly interactions with lows, including less smiling and fewer other nonverbal indicators of support. Giving briefer and less informative feedback to lows' questions. Using less eye contact and other nonverbal communication of attention and responsiveness with lows. Using effective by time-consuming methods with lows when time is limited. Interrupting lows more frequently when they make reading mistakes. Considerations for Group Work Current teaching practice often includes group work. A variety of types of groups may be implemented, including cooperative learning, reciprocal teaching, and peer tutoring teams. Fields (1995) has identified some of the sociodevelopmental aspects of group formation which may impact on the effectiveness of the teaching/learning group. Fields states that "An underlying philosophy of inclusion is that all students are different in some ways and alike in some ways. Teaching in an integrated class means recognizing similarities and differences among students and providing the necessary adaptations and support services within one class to serve all students." (Fields, 1995, p. 91). Therefore, formation of effective groups requires knowledge, planning, and monitoring on the part of the teacher. Stages of groups: Trust and acceptance Orientation to the task Organization to accomplish the task Dealing with interpersonal conflicts and confusion Development of a sense of cohesion and a free exchange of ideas Interdependence and problem solving managed by the group itself as opposed to a leader (not always reached in all groups). Potential Problems for Group Formation in Inclusion Acceptance This will likely be affected by whether or not the students in the class have been involved in classroom settings with students with disabilities in the past. If this is the first experience, there is likely to be some difficulty in gaining acceptance and building trust. While it may seem wise to apprise the other group members of the situation of the student with a disability prior to his or her entry to the group, this may actually make the student with a disability feel excluded. Field recommends discussing topics such as individual differences with the entire class, including all students with disabilities, so that all students are included in the process. Presenting real life dilemmas to the class and allowing them, as a class or as a group, to struggle with the issue will help to facilitate acceptance. For example, deciding what type of field trip to take, given that one student is in a wheel chair and cannot negotiate steps, could be the basis of a class discussion which will lead to greater understanding and acceptance of the student with a disability. Universality As students accept each other, they begin to recognize common problems, and students are less likely to isolate the student with a disability. Through class and individual discussions, the teacher can help the students to understand the commonalties among them. Similarly, the teacher can help the students to understand that some of the techniques used by the students with disabilities, such as learning strategies or organizational strategies, may be beneficial to other students as well. In this way, overall teaching effectiveness can be improved upon. Task Differences This area presents one of the greatest challenges for the teacher. The general educator must work as a team with the special educator and any support personnel involved (such as therapists or psychologists), in devising group tasks that provide an appropriate challenge for all students. Group tasks that provide opportunity for several different roles at multiple levels are beneficial. Throughout the year, the teacher should emphasize the importance of each person's contribution to a task or class discussion. As the group develops interdependence, the group itself may be able to contribute possible ways that all students can participate in a task. For example, in determining what role a student who is visually impaired may play in a group project, all members of the group should be involved as the student discusses his or her abilities and what he or she is able to contribute. One teacher reported on a fifth grade classroom in which one student (Jen) had Rett's syndrome and was extremely limited in movement, cognitive function, and communication (she could only communicate yes no using signs when presented with a simple question). However, this teacher found ways for Jen to be included in nearly all classroom activities. For example, when the class learned about protozoa, the teacher was unable to find a simple enough book for the Jen, so she had a small group of students make up a children's book on protozoa for Jen. In preparing the book, the students; learning was reinforced, Jen's value as class member was reinforced, and the book was used to move toward some of Jen's individual goals. Similarly, with the help of the speech/language pathologist, the teacher began utilizing students with reading problems to read aloud to Jen. This provided authentic practice for the reader, and worked toward Jen's educational goals of looking at pictures in books. As students learned about various microscopic organisms, the teacher projected the specimens on the wall with a projecting microscope, and students were able to explain what they were seeing to Jen (Richardson, 1994). Time Demands One reality of the classroom is the amount of time that each activity and each student demands. When this is coupled with having one or more students with disabilities in the classroom, it may result in increased time spent with the student with a disability. This may be resented by other class members or their parents. By working with the other teaching team members, the general education teacher can use these issues as a teaching method for the entire class. For example, when teaching a student with behavioral problems, the teacher can address not only the problem behaviors, but can teach the class how to deal with difficult behaviors in the way he or she models appropriate responses. Authentic Learning One trend in general education is toward authentic learning, whereby students learn through situations that are realistic and relevant to them. This may be difficult, or overlooked, when teaching students with disabilities. However, some interests, such as hobbies, music, television shows, or sporting events, may be relevant to students with and without disabilities. While authentic learning is considered by some to allow for deeper understanding and greater motivation in general education, it can also be used to promote sharing and group cohesion in an inclusion setting. Reciprocal Teaching Reciprocal teaching may be applied to inclusive classrooms, particularly to situations with students with learning disabilities. (Click here for more information on reciprocal teaching.) The structure of reciprocal teaching may help students to learn metacognitive skills through modeling The student that takes on the role of the teacher learns how to facilitate other students to learn without simply giving answers -- a problem often seen in teaming. The students generally work in small groups, which may increase acceptance of the student with a disability. Cooperative Learning Cooperative learning may be a beneficial approach in the inclusion classroom. (Click here for more information on cooperative learning.) Some specific advantages of cooperative learning in an inclusion setting are: Promotes active learning by all students, and students are held accountable for their work, so that the student with a disability would not be a passive observer or dependent upon other students for answers. The use of small groups promotes interpersonal skills, and may promote acceptance of the student with a disability. Cooperative learning allows for increased communication between group members, which is frequently an Individualized Education Plan goal for students with learning disabilities. Metacognition and Inclusion Promotion of metacognitive strategies may help students in inclusion classrooms, particularly students with learning disabilities. click here for more information on metacognition click here for more information on metacognition in students with learning disabilities Motivational Strategies and Inclusion This section is still being developed Thanks for your patience!.

These include modifications in teaching style/practice, and modifications in textbooks. The authors have summarized these modifications as follows: Modifications to Teaching Style/Practice to Improve Teaching Effectiveness Slow down or change instructional agenda when some students are having difficulty with material. Make adaptations to improve the textbook's comprehensibility. Respect mainstreamed students as individuals with differences. (link to attitudes) Establish routines appropriate for mainstreamed students. Adapt classroom management strategies that are effective with mainstreamed students. Provide reinforcement and encouragement. (link to attitudes) Establish personal relationships with mainstreamed students. Help mainstreamed students find appropriate ways to deal with feelings. Communicate with mainstreamed students. Communicate with the special education teacher Communicate with parents of mainstreamed students. Establish expectations for mainstreamed students. (link to attitudes) Make adaptations for mainstreamed students when developing long-range plans. Make adaptations for mainstreamed students when developing daily plans. Plan assignments and activities that allow mainstreamed students to be successful. Allot time for teaching and learning strategies as well as content. Adjust physical arrangement of room for mainstreamed students. Adapt general classroom materials for mainstreamed students. Use alternative materials for mainstreamed students. Use computers to enhance learning with mainstreamed students as tools for practicing skills. Monitor the mainstreamed students' understanding of directions and assigned tasks. Monitor the mainstreamed students' understanding of concepts presented in class. Provide individual instruction for mainstreamed students. Pair the mainstreamed students with a classmate. Involve mainstreamed students in small-group activities. (link to groups) Involve the mainstreamed students in whole-class activities. (link to groups) Provide extra time for the mainstreamed student. Adapt pacing of instruction. Keep records to monitor students' progress. Provide students with ongoing feedback about performance. Adapt evaluations for mainstreamed students. Adapt scoring/grading criteria for mainstreamed students. Textbook adaptations to Imporve Teaching Effectiveness Teach study strategies to improve retention of text materials. Work with students individually or in small groups to master textbook materials. Provide assistance for answering text-based questions. Structure post reading activities to increase retention of content. Summarize and reduce textbook information to guide classroom discussions and independent reading. Determine student reading levels to identify students with potential problems with textbooks. Avoid use of textbooks. Develop a study guide or study outline to direct learning from the text. Preview reading assignments with students to orient them to a topic and budget reading and study time. Substitute or supplement textbook reading assignments with direct experiences. Audiotape textbook content. Preview textbook with students to orient them to textbook organization and learning tools.

Advantages of this for the child with a disability are that it allows the child to develop trust with one particular peer, thus making it more likely that questions will be asked, and it gives the child access to someone when the teacher is unavailable. For those who have read the works of Vygotsky, this is very much in keeping with his theory of a "more capable other" to guide the child through to the next level of understanding. In addition to benefits to the student with a disability, teaming has the potential to allow the more capable peer to practice material over and over as he or she teaches the student with a disability, thus reinforcing the peer's own knowledge. While this may seem like a very good solution in theory, in practice there are several problems that may arise if teaming is not handled correctly. Classroom observations have shown that the more capable peer may simply gives answers to the student with a disability, or allows the student with a disability to become overly reliant on him or her (Baker, 1995; Zigmond, 1995). One way to more effectively use teaming involves planning and teaching prior to teaming. According to Webb, Troper, & Fall (1995), students learn best when they construct their own knowledge. Students who are given a verbally labeled explanation of how to solve a problem are much more likely to engage in actual problem solving and constructing of knowledge than students who are given the answer. Therefore, prior to teaming students, it might be best to educate all students on the most effective ways to give and receive help. Then, when the student with a disability asks a peer for assistance, the peer can help the student to understand the concept, rather than simply giving the answer. The student with a disability should then be encouraged to try the problem on his or her own. In addition to planning and teaching prior to teaming, then, the teacher should also be actively monitoring team interactions, and conducting periodic reviews of teaming procedures. In this way, the effects of teaming can be optimized. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page. Please type your comments, name, and email address in the boxes below.

Teach. Traditional Views of Mathematics Teaching Developed by Corinne Schaeffer In a typical mathematics class, the teacher begins by checking homework and/or answering questions from the previous class, followed by lecturing on the next topic, then providing examples of typical textbook problems, and concluding by assigning numerous exercises for students to complete for homework. Generations of students learned mathematics in this manner. However, the traditional lecture method for teaching mathematics is receiving increasing criticism from a variety of sources. The lecture method places the student in a passive role as a learner, and according to Everybody Counts: A Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education, the National Research Council reports: Evidence from many sources shows that the least effective mode for mathematics learning is the one that prevails in most of America's classrooms: lecturing and listening. Despite daily homework, for most students and most teachers mathematics continues to be primarily a passive activity: teachers prescribe; students transcribe. Students simply do not retain for long what they learn by imitation from lectures, worksheets, or routine homework. Presentation and repetition help students do well on standardized tests and lower-order skills, but they are generally ineffective as teaching strategies for long-term learning, for higher-order thinking, and for versatile problem solving. If this is the case, then the nature of effective mathematics teaching must change. Today, students need to be prepared for the technological world in which they live. It is becoming increasingly important to possess skills that include lifelong learning, higher-order thinking, and problem solving skills. As noted above, this is not being accomplished by traditional educational practices. This is not to say that the lecture mode of instruction should be completely abandoned, but rather become one of many tools that teachers have available to provide meaningful learning experiences for students.

These efforts are founded in educational research committed to the idea that students learn best when they construct their own understanding. Effective teachers must provide an environment in which this construction can occur. In an attempt to aid teachers in reform efforts, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) published the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics in 1989 and the Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics in 1991. As stated by a former NCTM President, Mary M. Lindquist, these documents "are the map on which we chart our future course. They guide and direct our journey as we complete our voyage of making mathematics accessible to every student." These documents provide mathematics teachers with a vision and purpose, rather than a set curriculum, for reforming the teaching and learning of mathematics. More recently, the NCTM published the Assessment Standards for School Mathematics (1995) in order to expand on and complement the NCTM's Evaluation Standards. All of these documents were written with the underlying assumption that all students are capable of learning mathematics. As educators we must focus on facilitating student growth and comprehension rather than allowing students to avoid high levels of achievement and understanding in mathematics, which has historically been the case for a large number of people. The links listed below may be of particular interest to those individuals looking for additional information on the NCTM Standards. Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics. This is a link to the actual document. NCTM Standards for School Mathematics: Visions for Implementation. This is an online article that was published in the Arithmetic Teacher. The article provides a nice overview of the process of creating the Standards documents as well as commenting on the challenges of implementing the Standards. Critical Issues in Mathematics. This page is part of the "Pathways to School Improvement site." Information regarding the significance and implementation of the Standards are available here in addition to a variety of supporting materials and additional resources. Understanding Teaching: Implementing the NCTM Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics. This site provides information regarding an interactive multimedia professional development seminar on CD-ROM developed at Technology Based Learning and Research, Arizona State University. Communicating the Next Message of Reform through the Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics. This document provides a very nice summary of the Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics. A good source for anyone just beginning to read about NCTM's efforts of reform. The nature of the mathematics classroom is changing dramatically as a result of NCTM's reform documents. A major emphasis is moving toward problem solving, reasoning, mathematical connections, and communications, while shifting away from memorization and repetition. Students are working together (cooperative/collaborative learning), with the teacher serving as a guide instead of a source of answers, to learn mathematics through solving problems rather than learning recipes. A greater emphasis is being placed on using technology as a tool for investigating and understanding mathematical concepts.

Reform Efforts Reform Efforts in Teaching Mathematics Developed by Corinne Schaeffer Here you will find an attempt to highlight the nature of the changes occurring in mathematics classrooms at all levels (elementary, secondary, and post-secondary) across the country. Although not all attempts at reform are identical in nature, the following describes the basic principles on which most reforms are at least partly, if not completely, based. Changes in Student Involvement For many years, students have been expected to learn a set of procedures for solving specific problems in mathematics without necessarily being expected to understand the concepts underlying these procedures. As stated in Everybody Counts, "there is no place in a proper curriculum for mindless mimicry mathematics" (p. 44). Instead, mathematics educators are being challenged to prepare students for today's world by helping students attain mathematical power which is defined as the "abilities to explore, conjecture, and reason logically, as well as the ability to use a variety of mathematical methods effectively to solve nonroutine problems" (NCTM, 1989, p. 5). Traditionally, students are exposed to fundamental concepts and procedures before introducing any applications. An underlying principle of the Standards reverses this order. Students are now being asked to become engaged in purposeful problem solving activities in which they must make decisions, use technology when appropriate, and communicate their results either verbally or in writing or both. It is then expected that the mathematical knowledge will be uncovered as a result of the activity. The following is a list of five general goals for students established by NCTM: Learning to value mathematics. Becoming confident in one's own ability. Becoming a mathematical problem solver. Learning to communicate mathematically. Learning to reason mathematically. (NCTM, 1989, p. 5) Changes in Pedagogy Clearly the role of the teacher in this new approach to teaching and learning must also change. Instead of planning a well versed explanation of a topic, complete with examples to illustrate typical exercises to be encountered by students, the teacher is now responsible for devising meaningful activities for students to investigate. In addition to creating (or finding and modifying) such activities, the teacher must provide assistance and opportunities for student reflection. The main goal here is to structure the classroom to promote active learning on the part of the students. Teachers may be involved in direct instruction on occasion, but this is no longer the predominant mode of teaching since it typically promotes relatively passive learning on the part of the student. According to the NCTM, "the image of mathematics teaching needed includes elementary and secondary teachers who are more proficient in -- selecting mathematical tasks to engage students' interests and intellect; providing opportunities to deepen their understanding of the mathematics being studied and its applications; orchestrating classroom discourse in ways that promote the investigation and growth of mathematical ideas; using, and helping students use, technology and other tools to pursue mathematical investigations; seeking, and helping students seek, connections to previous and developing knowledge; guiding individual, small-group, and whole-class work.

Technology Teaching and Learning Mathematics with Technology Developed by Corinne Schaeffer Few will argue with the fact that technology is beginning to permeate almost every aspect of today's society. In classrooms, graphing calculators and computer software are providing tools for students to explore mathematical ideas in such a way that would be tedious if not impossible using paper-and-pencil techniques. The following excerpts are included to illustrate the common view regarding the importance of technology held by many mathematical organizations. We believe that: appropriate calculators should be available to all students at all times; a computer should be available in every classroom for demonstration purposes; every student should have access to a computer for individual and group work; students should learn to use the computer as a tool for processing information and performing calculations to investigate and solve problems. (NCTM, 1989, p. 8) Students will use appropriate technology to enhance their mathematical thinking and understanding and to solve mathematical problems and judge the reasonableness of their results. (AMATYC, p. 11) Children should use calculators throughout their school work, just as adults use calculators throughout their lives. More important, children must learn when to use them and when not to do so. (NRC, 1989, p. 47) Unless undergraduate mathematics courses are revised to reflect the impact of computers on the practice of mathematics, students will continue to perceive mathematics as a discipline disconnected from reality. (NRC, 1991, p. 25) This provides pretty clear evidence of the importance of using technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics. However, it is important to note that the emphasis is on the appropriate use of technology by students. References on Technology American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges. (1995).

Are some ways of teaching better than others for furthering student learning? If such knowledge exists, can it be used to improve classroom teaching and learning? If so, what is the best way to accomplish this goal? Questions similar to these have been asked for centuries. Educational research has sought answers to them for over 100 years. This course will explore the research and issues concerned with answering these and similar questions. Substantial changes have occurred recently in the way educational researchers think about and conduct research on teaching and learning. Students typically are seen as active, self-regulated learners who construct their own interpretations and meaning for various kinds of information in the learning environment, including information provided by the teacher. Social context, motivation, and interpersonal communication -- as well as cognition and subject-matter content -- are considered to be important contributors to student learning. Nevertheless, the issue remains as to what role the teacher plays in the teaching-learning process and the way he or she influences student learning and achievement. Given the changes in the field that have occurred in recent years, relevant issues will be explored in addition to the empirical literature concerned with research on teaching and its affect on student learning. Purpose for Conducting Research on Teaching There are two main reasons for doing research on teaching. These two purposes are related, but there are some important differences between them. The first purpose is to understand the nature of teaching and its relationship to student learning. This purpose is akin to scholarly and scientific investigation in general. Consequently, it will be referred to here it as the intellectual purpose. The other purpose is to improve the quality of teaching, and it will be referred to as the practical purpose. Both approaches will be discussed in the course, as well as the difference between them. All research begins with a question. One way to better understand the differences between the two purposes mentioned in the preceding paragraph is to examine the types of questions asked by individuals pursuing with each purpose. Examine the questions in the table on the next page and check your understanding of the two types of research by generating one or two questions that represent each one. Types of Questions Asked by Individuals Interested in the Different Purposes of Research on Teaching Intellectual Practical How do individuals who are known to be good teachers ask questions? How can teachers ask questions more effectively? Do students learn more if the teacher provides a mnemonic for them to use in remembering the material being presented? What kind of mnemonic should be used for remembering a chemical equation? Do good teachers differ from poor teachers in the number of times during a lesson that they explicitly indicate a transition is being made from one topic to another? What is the best way for a teacher to indicate that a new topic is being introduced? Does indicating the way in which the to-be-learned material is organized increase the amount of information that a person learns from a passage? How can a teacher (or a text book) appropriately inform the learner of the organization inherent in the material being presented? The perspective of this course is one in which student learning is viewed as the goal of teaching and a belief that far more is known about the nature of effective teaching than is often acknowledged. Nevertheless, teaching is an extremely complex endeavor and straight forward solutions to the many problems facing educators are not available. A number of issues are involved in trying to understand the teaching-learning process and how it might be improved. Although often there is a tendency to think of the cognitive aspects of teaching and school learning, social, emotional, motivational and other non-cognitive factors also are involved. With these considerations in mind, some of the issues that will be pursued in this course include the following. The Role of the Teacher The way teaching and the teacher are conceptualized has important implications for both research and practice. Is the teacher best thought of as: (1) a disseminator of information and knowledge, (2) an executive decision maker, (3) an orchestra conductor, (4) a midwife, or in some other way that you may have in mind? Is the role of the student best thought of as work or as learning? What implications do these metaphors have on the way schooling is understood? On the extent to which teaching can be "improved?" These types of issues will be discussed during the semester. Teaching and Learning Every teacher, educational researcher, parent, and student has his or her own implicit model of learning. This model of learning influences the wide variety of decisions that are made with regard how one (teacher and student alike) engages in the teaching-learning process. What model do you ascribe to? Some possible ones include (1) passive reception, (2) discovery, (3) knowledge deficit and accrual, and (4) guided construction. How does your personal model of learning affect the way you think about teaching? The type of research you conduct? The way you teach in your classroom? Can teaching be meaningfully conceptualized without regard to whether student learning occurs as a result of that "teaching?" John Dewey once compared teaching to selling, arguing that it makes no more sense to talk about someone have taught something without student learning than it does to say that something was sold unless someone bought the item. Do you agree? Student Mediation of Instruction The affects of what a teacher does never has a direct effect on student learning. Students perceive very different things and react in very different ways to what the teacher does. Not only cognitive factors are involved, either. Social, emotional, and other factors, as well as cognitive factors, influence the way in which teaching affects the learner. In the Handbook of Research on Teaching (3rd ed.), Lee Shulman presents the following diagram: Shulman's TEACHING --> SOCIAL MEDIATION --> COGNITIVE MEDIATION --> LEARNING. Can you explain what Shulman had in mind? Application --> The Relationship Between Theory/Research and Practice Much of what is understood about teaching never gets translated into educational practices. Teaching is not unique in this regard, but that is the focus of this course. There is a tendency to think of scientific knowledge being "applied" to practice, but is this really the best way to think about the relationship between theory and research concerned with effective teaching and the improvement of educational practices? Is the "flow" of knowledge one way or two way? Various ways of thinking about or conceptualizing this relationship will be considered in the course. Among the issues to be discussed will be the question of whether certain models/conceptions are more productive with regard to research and with regard to practice.

Schoenfeld (1987) elaborated on this definition by explaining that metacognition includes the following processes: awareness of cognition and cognitive strategies -- knowledge about one's thinking control or self-regulation of cognitive processes -- how well one keeps track of what they are doing beliefs and intuitions about the task at hand -- what ideas or attitudes one brings to the task (beliefs that math is impossible, or Shakespeare is beautiful, for example) Various authors have used different terms to describe different aspects ofmetacognition, including: metamemory -- knowledge about and regulation of memory states and processes. An example of this would be a student's knowing that they will recall information better on a test if they study in the same room as the test, use of mnemonics to help remember information metacomprehension -- used to describe monitoring of one's comprehension, also referred to as self-monitoring for comprehension. An example of this would be someone realizing that they are not fully understanding something they are reading. An analogous process could be realizing that a math answer is incorrect (such as computing a sine of 1.2) meta-attention -- controlling and regulating one's attention. An example of this is selectively ignoring task-irrelevant stimuli, and focusing attention on relevant stimuli. This could also be broadened to include knowing when one's attention has wandered from the task, and using strategies to keep one's attention on task, such as talking out loud to oneself or structuring the environment to be conducive to attending to the desired stimuli (turning off music while studying, perhaps). Does the concept of an executive controller sound familiar? It should if you've studied the history of psychology.

For example, William James (1890) wrote of a "fringe" of consciousness, in which we experience things such as a "feeling of rightness" and a "feeling of knowing", referring to the metacognitive feeling of an answer being correct or not, or self-monitoring comprehension of information. According to some authors, these feelings of rightness or knowing serve a control function, directing the stream of thought. Vygotsky presented similar ideas. He described the learning process as a social process whereby a procedure or behavior is guided and monitored by other individuals. Gradually, an individual becomes more experienced or competent, and moves toward self-regulation, with another person supervising. At the end, the person is able to self-regulate, or to monitor their own behavior. In essence, Vygotsky describes internalizing a supervisor, or executive controller, to monitor one's performance or behavior. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

Some specifics: A large percentage of students and adults fail to use appropriate metacognitive strategies spontaneously better students and experts tend to report using metacognitive strategies more often than poorer students and novices performance tends to go up on a task once metacognitive strategies have been taught or elucidated many identified metacognitive strategies are often acquired without direct instruction (even children under the age of two demonstrate the acquisition of primitive repair strategies without direct instruction) Metacognition is not a Panacea some critical mass of knowledge is needed in a topic before students can successfully invoke metacognitive strategies that students (especially young or novice students) may be overconfident with their answers or overestimate comprehension, thus reducing the likelihood that they will employ a metacognitive strategy to correct for errors that many strategies require significant practice to overlearn to the point where they reduce cognitive load, making it more likely that students will abandon these strategies that transfer of strategies is problematic -- i.e., often does not happen that classroom variables such as mastery orientation can play a role in supporting a student's use of metacognitive strategies and that student variables such as achievement motivation, depression, locus of control, or perceived self-efficacy might influence the utilization of metacognitive strategies. Summary Taken as a whole, the field of metacognition represents the potential to improve and refine the educational process, especially for poor performers.

For example, gifted readers are more likely to use strategies such as predicting, evaluating, and connecting new content to prior knowledge more often than non-gifted students. Other studies have shown that cognitive flexibilite (strategic flexibility) is more prominent in gifted students. Even when giftedness is compromised by learning disabilities, this holds true. Furthermore, studies have shown that training "normal" students in metacognitive strategies, such as strategic flexibility, drastically improves performance, raising the question as to whether giftedness can be taught (Jausovec, 1994). Some references to check out: Hannah, C. L., & Shore, B. M. (1995). Metacognition and high intellectual ability: Insights from the study of learning-disabled gifted students. Gifted Child Quarterly, 39, 95-109. Jausovec, N. (1994). Can giftedness be taught? Roeper Review, 16, 210-214. Research on Learning Disabled students suggests that some learning disabilities are at least partially due to a lack of metacognitive processing. Additionally, studies show that interventions designed to teach LD students how to be more metacognitive can improve the academic performance of these students (Montague, Applegate, & Marquard, 1993). In light of this, it should not be surprising that low achievers also benefit from metacogntive instruction. Studies have confirmed positive effects on low achievers in both reading and math, and there is no reason to suspect it cannot help in other areas as well. Some references to check out: Kinnunen, R. & Vauras, M. (1995). Comprehension monitoring and the level of comprehension in high- and low-achieveing primary school children. Learning and Instruction, 5, 143-165. Montague, M., Applegate, B., & Marquard, K. (1993).

The individual behaves in reflective, planful, and where necessary, self-corrective ways. An important feature of executive routines is that they can be taught. (Garner, 1988, pp. ???-???) As the research literature on metacognition grows, there is more support for the notion that metacognition is important in students' lives. But how do teachers facilitate students' acquisition of metacognitive strategies? It is important to teach the metacognitive strategies in conjunction with the content that the strategies are to be applied to. This allows students to have concrete experiences with metacognition, and practice the skill. It is then hoped that this skill will be transferred to other areas. However, the skill needs to be mastered in the context of one area first. Teachers must often teach students how to take responsibility for their own learning first. Many students believe that it is the teacher's responsibility to make them learn -- the result of more of an adversarial schooling environment than a collegial one. To facilitate this shift to students taking on the responsibility for their own learning, Marzano et al.(1986) suggests these four steps: Provide explicit instruction in what the task is, what the objectives are, and how to assess progress or completion. Provide opportunities for the class to work cooperatively, in order to mentor each others' learning. Provide explicit instruction on how strategies may be transferred, and provide practice in this endeavor. Help students link newly acquired knowledge to previously learned knowledge. Other researchers have emphasized the support provided by the teacher. Modeling may be the teacher thinking out loud while she solves a problem and checks it. Guidance may be as simple as: suggesting various strategies for attacking a task reminding students of rules previously learned (I before E except after C, e.g.), suggesting milestones (you should have x done by 1:00) purpose for planning ahead how to assess when you have completed the task (your chemicals should change to green and fizz). Facilitating discussion after the task to allow students to learn: the efficacy of various strategies, the problems they ran into, how they solved the problems, and how to avoid those problems in the future. Using metacognitive prompts, such as: What is the goal of this exercise? Have I encountered anything similar? What is relevant and irrelevant? What strategies will be useful? Teachers can MODEL metacognitive behavior, using techniques such as thinking out loud during problem solving, explaining the process of deciding how to attack a problem or issue, doing some explicit self-monitoring for comprehension, checking the final answer, etc. Processes that can be most easily modeled include: planning strategy selection self-monitoring self-questioning (e.g., is this all I need to know? What does that mean? etc.) self-evaluation (Did I answer the question, and is it reasonable?) prediction of answers/conjecture/hypothesizing Cooperative learning and small groups may facilitate this process. Other students can help make metacognitive thoughts explicit and analyzable. It may foster meta-cognitive discussions among students. (TOM: LINK TO FIRST CASE STUDY) Teachers can provide a framework that guides students. Margaret Williamson insisted that students present work in the following format, based on Polya's (1945) work: THINK: write a phrase describing the goal of the project or problem. Make a list of information that will help achieve that goal. Tell if you have encountered a problem like this before. PLAN: Write a plan of how to go about solving the problem. DO: show all work LOOK BACK: write the answer in a short sentence. Check your answer with another student. Did your partner think about the problem in the same way? Why or why not?

Definition of the Construct Although Flavell (1976, 1979) defined metacognition as "knowledge concerning one's own cognitive processes and products or anything related to them... [such as] active monitoring and consequent regulation and orchestration of these processes," there is currently some debate as to what exactly metacognition should be defined as. Some object to simple knowledge (such as knowledge of which strategy to use for a particular problem, or knowledge of stragtegies to remember something) being labeled metacognition. As Gentile (1996) points out, "knowing about your circulatory system, what affects it, and strategis for maintaining its' functioning at optimal levels would be considered [a] cognitive strategy...so why shouldn't knowing about your learning and memory be considered cognitive processes?". This line of argument attempts to constrain metacognition to active monitoring, conscious control, or executive regulation of mental processes. This line of discussion is fruitful, as metacognition appears to have suffered "construct creep", to coin a term. Authors have used this term to refer to everything from knowledge of strategies, executive control of strategies, and self-monitoring of activity to such things as checking solutions to linear equations, listing possible strategies for attacking a problem, detection of errors within a reading passage, prediction of grades, knowledge of sources of motivation, and self-correction of errors. While this process is common when new constructs appear, and generate considerable enthusiasm, it is necessary to arrive at a fairly clear conceptual definition of what metacognition is, or risk having everything becoming metacognition, in which case the construct loses its' meaning. Measuring Metacognition As researchers, measurement is the basis for all activity. I believe that this is the weakest aspect to current metacognitive research at present. I believe that this deficiency arises from two problems: an ill-defined construct and reliance upon self-report measures. Because the construct is ill-defined, many operationalizations of metacognition are suspect. Specifically, measuring metacognition in terms of correctly listing a certain number of strategies for solving a problem may be measuring recall of a discussion, and may have nothing to do with the student's cognition in relation to actually solving a problem. Additionally, many studies that attempt to do more than measure knowledge have tried innovative operationalizations, such as asking students to verbalize their cognition while trying to perform a task, and coding for metacognition (i.e., a student who says something like "Ah, this is where I made the mistake last time" would be scored as being metacognitive). Unfortunately, self-report measures of cognition are nototiously problematic. They assume that students (often young students) are aware of their cognition and metacognition, that they are accurate and unbiased observers of their own cognition and metacognition, and that they can report their observations accurately. I think few people would accept all three of these assumptions, especially for young children. Self-reports of prior strategy use that are "off-line" are even more suspect. (Note that although metacognition is executive and regulatory, it has never been said that it needs to be conscious or purposeful -- it is possible and even likely that at least some metacognition is automatized and below conscious awareness....) One direction I am working on, and encourage others to think about, is how to measure or assess metacognitive activity in a fairly unobtrusive, yet valid, fashion. Of particular interest would be a behavioral measure that would avoid the problems delineated above associated with self-reports. What About Other Subject Areas? Most (at least 90%) of all metacognition research and effort has gone into teaching reading. People are beginning to look at mathematics (where my interests lie), but almost nothing has been done in other areas. Notably absent are: science, language, social sciences, fine arts, music, and so forth. Here are some musings of my own: How do students of a new language know when they have spoken incorrectly? What sorts of strategies do they use to monitor their understanding and production of language? How do scientists know when they have a reasonable answer, and when they need to delve further into a phenomenon? How do we know what questions to ask, or when to ask questions? Is transfer between areas related to metacognition? If so, in what way? How do computer programmers know when they have made a mistake, even before they run a program-- do they have a mental "processor" in their minds running the program while they write? Does programming a computer make one more metacognitive in other areas by having an external source pointing out mistakes? And could reciprocal teaching or group projects do something similar? How does a musician know when they have made a subtle mistake? Is this metacognition in certain circumstances? Do artists use metacognition in some ways? If so, how? Do we need to expand the definition of the construct to incorporate this sort of activity, or does it fall under the current definition? Do people in the "real world" use metacognition? If so, who, and is it similar to metacognition that students use, or different in some way? We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

Learn. Planning Cooperative Learning Developed by Luz Rodriguez Curriculum: Examination of the curriculum is important to determine appropriate instructional objectives and activities suitable for cooperative learning Instruction and Materials: Cooperative learning activities can be used as guided practice activities as part of direct instruction or as an independent practice activity. In the former, students need practice opportunities to achieve mastery with teacher monitoring of newly introduced skills or concepts. In the latter, students understand the skill or concept and do not necessarily require constant teacher monitoring. The following should be considered: how long the activity will last how many activities (and/or weeks) will be necessary to teach or reinforce a skill or concept how frequently during the week activities will be scheduled when during the day such activities will occur what the cooperative learning goals will be in academics, oral language, and/or social/collaborative skills how positive interdependence will be fostered how students will be held accountable for the activity how group processing will be evaluated what materials and resources will be needed Student roles: Roles are important because they define appropriate actions and behaviors. They also provide participants with ownership in the activity. Each role should be defined clearly, and they should be rotated so that students have opportunities for the various responsibilities. Suggested roles include: leader materials person record keeper time keeper spokesperson runner Environment: The idea is to ensure that students are in social groupings (e.g., the furniture should be physically situated so that students can look at each other). Student groupings: researchers suggest that heterogeneous groupings work best because higher-ability students can be paired with lower-ability students. Teacher must consider the academic, behavioral, and social strengths and weaknesses of each student. When initiating cooperative learning activities, start with smaller groups until students learn how to work together within their assigned roles. The following questions should be considered when designing student groupings: What are my goals for the cooperative learning activity? What are each student's strengths and weaknesses? How many students do I want on each team? How many materials and resources do I have available? Do I have a role for each member group? How long will these cooperative groupings stay together? Management: Effective management techniques are critical in any instructional setting, especially during cooperative learning activities. Teachers can address the following questions when planning their management program: What will the rules and consequences be for cooperative learning activities? How will students move to and from cooperative groupings (transition)? How will materials distribution be handled? What will students do with completed work? How will inappropriate behavior be handled? We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page. Please type your comments, name and email address in the boxes below. THANK YOU!

Implementing Cooperative Learning Developed by Luz Rodriguez Teacher's role: Circulate among groups monitoring student understanding, reinforcing appropriate team behaviors(e.g., praising students for doing their role responsibilities appropriately), reinforcing appropriate skills determined in the initial objectives for the activity, collecting data, and providing further instruction if necessary. Formal learning groups. Informal learning groups. Base groups Evaluation for Cooperative Learning Activities Several techniques can be used to evaluate students' progress. Students can be held accountable for their individual behavior and contributions by having a group grade assigned which reflects everyone's efforts. The idea is for students to work collaboratively and do their best so that the group grade does not suffer. Individual tests can be conducted after a cooperative activity or the following day to be sure that each student is achieving progress with the academic objective. A checklist can be developed that lists a series of skills that are targeted for the cooperative learning activity. As teachers circulate and monitor students during group work, they can record frequencies of occurrences or anecdotal notes documenting specific concerns. Group effort and behaviors can be evaluated by the students during the group processing element of cooperative learning. We would be interested in your comments and/or feedback on this page.

CGI focuses on helping teachers make decisions about instruction based on knowledge from cognitive science. Carpenter and Fennema believe that teaching is a form of problem solving as opposed to a set of procedures that can be determined in advance. Although specific practices are not dictated, there are general principles of instruction underlying this approach. These principles are: Instruction should be appropriate for each student. More specifically, problems, concepts, or procedures being learned should be appropriate for each student; students should be able to relate new tasks to prior knowledge; instructional decisions should be based on regular assessment of each student's knowledge throughout instruction. Instruction should actively involve students in constructing knowledge with understanding. Instruction should stress relationships among concepts, skills and problem solving. Assessment should determine not only if a learner is able to solve problems, but should also concentrate on the cognitive processes used to solve problems.

Collected Living Wills This is now out of print. I produced it as there was no extant volumeshowing examples of living wills from various countries - a considerablehandicap to researchers (including myself). Writing to various organisationstakes an awfully long time. A main reason it hasn't been reprinted is becausethe documents readily become out-of-date as examples of what is producedby various organisations. Another reason is that the obsession with piecesof paper hasn't (in my opinion) greatly furthered patient autonomy. A livingwill is only as good as the communication process of which it should bea part. This doesn't mean a lot can't be done to improve existing documents,just that we need to be asking more basic questions. (If you want to hearme go on at length about this, with the various pieces of supporting evidence,you can seek out Dartmouth's Contemporary Issues in Law,Medicine and Ethics and my contributing chapter on living wills.)

Ethics Update- a page of links on euthanasia and ethics. We note with profound misgivings that word "ethics" isfrequently misused on the Web. For a better understanding, we suggest youconsult one of the primers in our bibliography.Beginners should note that there are at least three distinct and separatemeanings of "Ethics" - please try to avoid using the word togive some sort of moral weight to your beliefs. Euthanasia The generally understood meaning is rather more than the dictionarydefinition of dying well - a good and easy death. We generally mean whena doctor induces the death, for instance with a lethal injection, of apatient who is suffering unrelievably and has persistently requested thedoctor to do so. We don't generally include irrational or emotional suicidesor the forced killing of another person, although the term was hijackedby Nazi Germany to mean a form of forced killing, which is a very differentidea. In the Netherlands, the definitions in use for euthanasia and assistedsuicide are defined by the State Commission on Euthanasia: Euthanasia isthe intentional termination of life by somebody other than the person concernedat his or her request. Assisted suicide means intentionally helping a patientto terminate his or her life at his or her request. See also: Netherlands.

Differentfrom voluntary euthanasia (where the dying person has been able to clearlystate his or her wishes). Michigan - See: Kevorkian Millard, Dr Moynihan, Lord N Name of the Scottish v.e. Society We were originally the Scottish branch of Exit. We broke away andbecame Scottish Exit,a separate Society, in 1980. We later changed thename to The Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland which seemed a lessharsh title. In 1995 we decided to adopt the name Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety to emphasise the Scottish origins of our work and avoid confusionwith the London based Voluntary Euthanasia Society or being thought ofas a branch. We retain the acronym VESS and the name Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety of Scotland constitutionally, but put the Scottish element at thefront for all publicity purposes. The London-based society is a more stronglycampaigning organisation than VESS. we have a much smaller budget and concentratemore on research and liaison. Although entirely separate and sometimesholding different views, the two organisations are able to cooperate ona great number of projects, including political campaigns. For an exampleof a joint web page, see: Labourcyberconference page NaturalDeath Centre Netherlands The only country in the world where euthanasia is openly practiced.It is not allowed by statute, but the law accepts a standard defence fromdoctors that have adhered to official guidelines. These hinge on voluntarinessof the request and unrelievable-ness of the suffering. In practice, citizensof other countries are not eligible for euthanasia in the Netherlands.UK residents: you can get a free factsheet on The Termination ofLife by a Doctor in the Netherlands by writing to the Press & CulturalSection of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in London (Tel 0171-584-5040 ext.413). It says: Euthanasia is popularly taken to mean any form of terminationof life by a doctor. The definition under Dutch law, however, is narrower.It means the termination of life by a doctor at the express wish of a patient.The request to the doctor must be voluntary, explicit and carefully consideredand it must have been made repeatedly. Moreover, the patient's sufferingmust be unbearable and without any prospect of improvement. Pain reliefadministered by a doctor may shorten a patient's life. As is the case inother countries, this is seen as a normal medical decision in terminalcare and not as euthanasia.

Many notable right-to-die cases (such as Anthony Bland, andNancy Cruzan) have involved PVS. It is the cerebral cortex that is permanently out of action, but becausethe brain stem is intact the patient breathes on his own and can live formany years provided that adequate nursing care and nutrition are provided.The latter is either by nasogastric tube or one inserted into the stomachthrough the abdominal wall (gastrostomy). These patients have long periodswith their eyes open and have a range of reflex movements - but no evidenceof a working mind - i.e. no psychologically meaningful responses to theenvironment. It is believed that such a patient cannot suffer pain or distress,because he is unaware. Although strictly speaking a patient whose eyesare open is not in coma such patients are sometimes described as in permanentcoma or permanently unconscious. - Prof. Bryan Jennett, international experton PVS, in VESS Newsletter Sept '92 Philosophical approaches Elizabeth Telferon utilitarian & non-utilitarian approaches to voluntary euthanasia.

Reed, Nicholas Rights & Duties / The "Right to Die" Popular utilitarianism and civil liberty movements tend to arguein the language of "rights." This is not the only course thatthe voluntary euthanasia movement could take however: "duties"based language is less confrontational, may protect people who don't havethe means of asserting their rights and, being broad-based rather thanindividual-centred, may be a more achievable way forward for society asa whole. ""Rights" language tends to get public attentionbut also tends to polarise the issues; the phrase ""a right todie" is difficult to sustain and often has to be translated as "aright to choose when to die" or a "right to choose how to die."

TheScottish element of the name is put at the beginning on all public communicationsetc after repeated confusion with the English-based society who call themselvessimply "The Voluntary Euthanasia Society" or "The VoluntaryEuthanasia Society (England Wales and Northern Ireland)." VESS isnot, in fact, a purely local organisation but has members all over theUK and the rest of the world.

Variability in Physicians' Decisions on Caring for Chronically Ill Elderly Patients: An International Study. Canadian Medical Association Journal 1991, 144(9):1133-1138. p.1133. Treatment of incompetent elderly patients with life-threatening illness varies widely within and between countries. Uniform standards should be developed on the basis of societal values and be communicated to physicians. p.1138 Age, correlating highly with number of years in practice, was associated with less aggressive therapy. Family physicians were more likely than specialists to choose more conservative therapy. p.1138 Although the wishes of the patient and his daughter represented a fourth factor that strongly influenced the decisions an appreciable proportion of physicians ignored them. This was true even when the wishes were expressed in an explicit written directive. Overall about 40% of the physicians provided a level of care different from what had been requested. In six of the seven countries more than 10% chose treatment options that differed significantly from the wishes. Annas G. The Health Care Proxy and the Living Will. New England Journal of Medicine 1991; 324(17): 1210-1213. p.1210 The term &quotliving will" was coined by Luis Kutner in 1969 to describe a document in which a competent adult sets forth directions regarding medical treatment in the event of his or her future incapacitation. The document is a will in the sense that it spells out the person's directions. It is &quotliving" because it takes effect before death. p.1211 The Cruzan case itself, which involved facts essentially identical to those in Quinlan, gave impetus to the concept of a health care proxy, just as the Quinlan case had previously increased interest in the living will. p.1211 Although new laws are not necessary in any state (because of existing laws regarding the assignment of a durable power of attorney), the current trend in the United States is for states to enact additional proxy laws that specifically deal with health care. p.1211 Two of the best-written proxy laws have recently become effective in New York (in January 1991) and Massachusettes (in December 1990). p.1211 Hospitals can impede the process of making good decisions, however, if they concentrate on the paperwork rather than on the way in which decisions are made. Some Massachusetts attorneys, for example, have already drafted a 13-page, single-spaced proxy form that is all but unintelligible to non-lawyers. p.1212 The most useful form for both patients and providers is a simple one-page document that sets forth all necessary information in easily comprehensible language. p.1212 Perhaps out of concern for efficiency, some commentators have advocated combining an organ-donor form with the form designating a health care proxy. This is a serious error for at least two reasons. p.1213 Designating a health care agent gives us all the opportunity to confront our mortality and to determine who among our friends and relatives we want to make treatment decisions on our behalf when we are unable to make them ourselves. Annas G. When Procedures Limit Rights: From Quinlan to Conroy. Hastings Center Report 1985 Apr: 24-26. p.24 The New Jersey Supreme Court has concluded that there is no analytical difference between terminating artificial feeding and discontinuing a mechanical ventilator, an action permitted in the 1976 Karen Ann Quinlan case. p.26 ...the &quotNew Jersey approach" of declaring broad-ranging substantive rights, and then attempting procedurally to restrict their application to very narrow categories of patients, creates a &quotCatch 22" effect that fails to promote the autonomy of once-competent patients.

"Although philosophers do not agree on whether moral agents have positive duties of beneficence, including duties to those in pain, members of the medical world are not reticent about asserting them. "Relief of pain is the least disputed and most universal of the moral obligations of the physician", writes one doctor. "Few things a doctor does are more important than relieving pain", says another. [Refs. E D Pellegrino, "The clinical ethics of pain management in the terminally ill", Hospital Formulary 17 (Nov 1982): 1495-96; Marcia Angell, "The Quality of Mercy", New England Journal of Medicine, 306 (Jan 1982): 98-99.] These are not simply assertions that the physician "do no harm" as the Hippocratic Oath is traditionally interpreted, but assertions of a positive obligation. It might be argued that the physician's duty of mercy derives from a special contractual or fiduciary relationship with the patient, but I think this is an error: rather, the duty of medical mercy is generally binding on all moral agents, and it is only by virtue of their more frequent exposure to pain and their specialised training in its treatment that this duty falls more heavily on physicians and nurse than on others." Note: p 128-129. "It is sometimes argued that physician assistance in a patient's suicide would violate the Hippocratic Oath. It is true that the Oath, in its original form, does contain an explicit injunction that the physician shall not give a lethal potion to a patient who requests it, nor make a suggestion to that effect. (To do so was apparently common Greek medical practice at the time.) But the Oath in its original form also contains explicit prohibitions of the physicians accepting fees for teaching medicine, and of performing surgery - even on gall stones. These latter prohibitions are not retained in modern reformulations of the Oath, and I see no reason why the provision against giving lethal potions to patients who request it should be. What is central to the Oath and cannot be deleted without altering its essential character is the requirement that the physician shall come "for the benefit of the sick". Under the argument advanced here, physician's assistance in patient suicide may indeed be for the benefit of the patient. What the Oath would continue to prohibit is physician assistance in the suicide for the physician's own gain or to serve other institutional or societal ends." p. 55. "Thus, just one thing is clear: until the issue of the moral status of altruism itself is resolved, we ought not to uncritically perpetuate policies and practices in medical decision making that preclude its possibility altogether. To do so is to deprive the patient of the possibility of retaining his or her status as a moral agent, and to make him or her a "patient" in not only a medical but a moral sense as well. Among the indignities that medicine is capable of inflicting, this may be among the most profound." p. 229 "On the other hand, stealing, intimidation, and outright aggression may be "natural" behaviour, and yet are severely discouraged." "Arguments against suicide that hold that it is "unnatural" because it runs counter to ordinary human inclinations are inadequate as moral arguments against suicide; such arguments move from "is" to "ought" arguing that because human beings do generally attempt to remain alive rather than kill themselves, they ought always to do so." p. 230. "The natural law argument does not make clear what obligations are imposed upon individuals whose capacities to function have been seriously diminished by disease or disability; these, however, are often situations in which suicide, or prearranged euthanasia, may be considered." [Chap.13, Assisting in Suicide: 17 Questions physicians and mental health professionals should ask] 1. Is the person making a request for help? For example, when somebody wants assistance in suicide is it in fact cloaking some other aspect or some other solution which may be found? 2. Why is the person consulting a physician or mental health professional? Has the consultation been sought because the person has certain expectations from the professionals? 3. What has kept the person from attempting or committing suicide so far? Is it fear of consequences, or given advanced illness or physical limitations they simply cannot obtain the means of causing death? Is the time for suicide not yet right? Or is the person seeking some sort of approval? 4. Is the request for help in suicide a request for someone else to decide? 5. How stable is the request? Has this been part of a long term decision, or a short term response as a result of some traumatic event eg. diagnosis, death of a friend or relative etc.? Also, when the person thinks of suicide, does someone else come to mind? Does the person change their mind about suicide a lot? 6. Is the request consistent with a person's basic values? If there is a discrepancy, can we justify the discrepancy? 7. How far in the future would the suicide take place? Is it intended to solve a future problem, the eventual onset of intractable pain or mental deterioration, or to put an end to problems currently occurring? The triggering event may be difficult for not only the person to justify, but also for others to justify. 8. Are the medical facts cited in the request accurate? 9. How accurate are the other non medical facts cited in the request, for example, that others who assist in an attempt may be subject to criminal penalties, life insurance coverage etc.? 10. Is the suicide plan financially motivated? This is a very American point where she is asking whether it is intended to avoid catastrophic medical expenses? 11. Has the person considered the effect of his or her suicide on other persons, also the stigma associated with suicide? (x ref the Oregon family clause here and any commentary on stigma) 12. Does the person fear becoming a burden? Is he or she being manipulated by family members etc. or has there been frank and open communication between the person and their loved ones? 13. What cultural influences are shaping the person's choice? eg. are religious beliefs, prejudices especially against the handicapped and aged contributing to a feeling of worthlessness? 14. Are the person's affairs in order? 15. Has the person picked a method of committing suicide? Does the person know what kinds of injuries are likely to result if the attempt is not fatal? Does the person want to stick to this one method only? If the person hasn't chosen one method does this make them ambivalent about committing suicide at all or is it simply lack of information? 16. Would the person be willing to tell others about his or her suicide plans? 17. Does the person see suicide as the only way out? Battin M. Euthanasia: The Way We Do It, The Way They Do It. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management 1991, 6(5):298-305. [compares Netherlands, Germany and USA] Battin M. The Least Worse Death. Hastings Center Report 1983 Apr:13-16. safeguards often render natural-death requests and directives cumbersome to execute... all the law protects is the refusal of medical procedures. The physician is caught in between: he recognizes his patient's right to die peacefully, naturally, and with whatever dignity is possible, but foresees the unfortunate results that may come about when the patient exercises his right as the law permits. Which mode of death claims the patient depends in part on circumstance and in part on the physician's response to conditions that occur. In the face of inevitable death, the physician becomes strategist, the deviser of plans for how to meet death most favourably. He does so, of course, at the request of the patient, or, if the patient is not competent, the patient's guardian or next of kin. A scenario in which natural death is accomplished by the patient's selective refusal of treatment has one major advantage over active euthanasia and assisted suicide: refusal of treatment is clearly permitted and protected by law. Unfortunately, however, most patients do not have the specialized medical knowledge to use this self-protective mechanism intelligently. Few are aware that some kinds of refusal of treatment will better serve their desires for a &quotnatural death" than others. And few patients realize that refusal of treatment can be selective. patients may be unable to distinguish therapeutic from palliative procedures. most patients do not have enough medical knowledge to foresee the consequences of refusing treatment on a selective basis; it is this that the physician must supply. though it is crucial in making a genuinely informed decision, the patient's right to information about the risks and outcomes of alternative kinds of refusal has not yet been recognized. Consider the bowel cancer patient with widespead metastases and a very poor prognosis who...refuses surgery to reduce or bypass the tumor. How exactly will he die? ... obstruction of the intestinal tract will occur, the bowel wall will perforate, the abdomen will become distended, there will be intractible vomiting (perhaps with a fecal character to the emesis), and the tumor will erode into adjacent areas, causing increased pain, hemorrhage, and sepsis. Narcotic sedation and companion drugs may be partially effective in controlling pain, nausea, and vomiting, but this patient will NOT get the kind of death he thought he bargained for. Yet he was willing to shorten his life, to use the single legally-protected mechanism - refusal of treatment - to achieve that &quotnatural" death Battin M. Assisted Suicide: Can We Learn Anything from Germany? Hastings Centre Report March-April 1992; 44-51. p.44 In a Boston Globe/Harvard survey... 54 percent of a national sample of 1,311 adults over age eighteen said that if they had an illness with no hope of recovery and were suffering a great deal of physical pain, they would or probably would consider asking their doctor to administer lethal drugs or a lethal injection; and 53 percent said that in the same circumstances they would or probably would ask their doctor to prescribe a lethal drug that they could decide to take later on. p.44 Because the U.S. is so sensitive (as it should be) to the risks of abuse, and because permitting assisted suicide would require a less dramatic change in the law, I think the United States will come to accept assisted suicide in the relatively near future, officially as well as tacitly, but is likely to resist legalizing active euthanasia for a longer time. p.45 Assisting suicide is not a crime in Germany... provided that the person about to commit suicide is tatherrschaftsfahig, that is, capable of exercising control over his or her actions, and also that he or she acts out of freiverantwortliche Wille, or freely responsible choice. p.45-46 ...assisted suicide is not illegal but there may be a duty to rescue a suicide in progress. Like U.S. law, German law imposes an obligation to rescue upon specific parties standing in certian professional or personal relationships to other persons; this is the basis of the physician's legal duty to rescue his or her patient. Thus, as one widely prevalent interpretation of the legal situation holds, although the physician is not prohibited from giving a lethal drug to a patient, once that patient has taken the drug and becomes unconscious, the physician incurs a duty to resuscitate him or her. (PARA) These provisions of German law - all currently highly controversial - have the effect of curtailing the role of German physicians in suicide, and tend to insulate the patient from physician aid. p.46 ...although it apparently would not be illegal for physicians to assist in the initiation of their patients' suicides, as a matter of practice they do not do so. p.47 Freitod (literally &quotfree death" or &quotvoluntary death") is a positive term, free from connotations of either moral wrongdoing or pathology... p.49 ...because the German practice of assisted suicide, as shaped both by law and by linguistic expectation, tends to minimize the role of the physician, it tends as well to minimize the opportunity for whatever evaluation, counseling, and psychiatric consultation the physician might provide. p.50 the German tends to respect Feitod, however difficult it may be to say exactly what differentiates this phenomonon from the previous forms of self-caused death, and tends to regard Freitod as a matter of right - that is, to assume that it ought not to be interfered with and that one always has the right to this choice. p.50 The distinction between suicide as a moral wrong or psychological aberration and as a religiously or altruistically motivated choice is readily marked off in English, but the distinction between suicide as a moral wrong or pschological aberration and an autonomous choice based in personal ideals and values is not. Battin M. Voluntary Euthanasia and the Risks of Abuse: Can We Learn Anything from the Netherlands? Law Medicine & Health Care 1992; 20(1-2):133-143. p.136. "Not all family life is harmonious, and underlying pathology can often be exacerbated by the stresses of a family member's terminal illness brings. "All right, Granny, it's time to go" is a message we can imagine being conveyed in a variety of ways, exhibiting an entire range from the faintest suggestion to outright coercion. Baume P, O'Malley E, Bauman A. Professed religious affiliation and the practice of euthanasia. Journal of Medical Ethics 1995; 21: 49-54 p.49 Attitudes towards active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) among 1,238 doctors on the medical register of New South Wales varied significantly with self-identified religious affiliation. p.52 Of all medical practitioners who had been asked to do so, more than one quarter acknowledged that they had taken steps to hasten death. Beauchamp T., Childress J. (1994) Principles of Biomedical Ethics 4th Edition. Oxford: OUP. (slippery slope analyses: see p.229) p.10 "Similarly, the judgement that an act is morally acceptable does not imply that the law should permit it. For example, the thesis that active euthanasia is morally justified if patients face uncontrollable pain and suffering and request death is consistent with the thesis that the government should legally prohibit active euthanasia because it would not be possible to control abuses if it were legalized. We are not here defending particular moral judgements about the justifiability of such acts. We are maintaining only that the connections between moral action-guides and judgements about policy or law or legal enforcement are complicated and that a judgement about the morality of acts does not entail a particular judgement about law and policy. Factors such as the symbolic value of the law, the costs of a program and its enforcement, and the demands of competing programs must also be considered." p. 120. "The word autonomy, derived from the Greek autos ("self") and nomos ("rule", "Governance", or "law"), was first used to refer to the self-rule or self-governance of independent Hellenic city-states. Autonomy has since been extended to individuals and has acquired meanings as diverse as self governance, liberty rights, privacy, individual choice, freedom of the will, causing one's behaviour and being one's own person." p. 121. "Virtually all theories of autonomy agree that two conditions are essential: 1. liberty (independence from controlling influences) and 2. agency (capacity for intentional action)." p. 125. "Mill's position requires both noninterference with and an active strengthening of autonomous expression, whereas Kant entails a moral imperative of respectful treatment of persons as ends rather merely as means. In the final analysis, however, these two profoundly different philosophies both provide support for the principal of respect for autonomy." p. 145. "Legal, regulatory, philosophical, medical and psychological literatures tend to favour the following elements as the analytical components of informed consent: 1. competence, 2. disclosure, 3. understanding, 4. voluntariness, and 5. consent. These elements are then presented as the building blocks for a definition of informed consent." p. 165. [They quote Eliot Freidson:] "It is my impression that clients are more often bullied than informed into consent, their resistance weakened in part by their desire for the general service if not the specific procedure, in part by the oppressive setting they find themselves in, and in part by the calculated intimidation, restriction of information, and covert threats of rejection by the professional staff itself." p. 165. "Nevertheless, one can easily inflate the threat of control by manipulation beyond its significance in health care. We typically make decisions in a context of competing influences, such as personal desires, familial constraints, legal obligations, and institutional pressures." p. 181. "Although we have justified the obligation to solicit decisions from patients by the principal of respect for autonomy, we have acknowledged that the principal's precise demands remain unsettled and open to interpretation and specification." p. 189. "The principal of nonmaleficence asserts an obligation not to inflict harm intentionally. It has been closely associated in medical ethics with the maxim primum non nocere: "above all [or first] do no harm." This maxim is frequently invoked by health care professionals, yet its origins are obscure and its implications unclear. Often proclaimed the fundamental principal in the Hippocratic tradition of medical ethics, it is not found in the Hippocratic corpus, and a venerable statement sometimes confused with it - "at least, do no harm" - is a strained translation of a single Hippocratic passsage. Nonetheless, an obligation of nonmaleficence and an obligaton of beneficence are both expressed in the Hippocratic Oath: "I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgement, but I will never use it to injure or wrong them." p. 200. "The customary or usual in medical practice can be relevant to a moral judgement, but it is not by itself sufficient or decisive. It is customary medical practice to treat a disease by a specific means, but whether this treatment should be repeated for a particular patient depends on the patient's wishes and condition as a whole, not alone on what is customary. For example, treating pneumonia with antibiotics is usual, but it is morally optional for a patient who is irreversibly and imminently dying from cancer or aids. Ethical judgement is not reducible to professional custom, concensus, traditional codes, or oaths, as indispensable as these are for some professional contexts." p. 202. " ...the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary treatment is morally irrelevant and should be replaced by the distinction between optional and obligatory treatment, as determined by the balance of benefits and burdens to the patient." p. 205. "For some patients the burdens of medically administered nutrition and hydration outweigh their benefits, and no-one should deprive them of the right to refuse treatment. The obligation to care for patients entails provision of treatments that are in accordance with their preferences and interests (within the limits set by just allocation policies), not the provision of treatments because of what they symbolise in the larger society." p. 213. "Writings in biomedical ethics that discuss futility often focus on the patient's or surrogate's right to refuse futile treatment. However, circumstances have increasingly appeared in which the question is whether the physician may or should refuse to provide some treatment. The fact that a treatment is futile is often said to change the position's moral relationship to patients or surrogates. The physician is not required to provide such treatment and sometimes is not required to discuss the treatment. These circumstances commonly involve incompetent persons, especially patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS), where physicians or hospital policies impose decisions to forego life-support on patients or surrogates. Increasingly hospitals are adopting policies explicitly aimed to dying therapies that are judged futile by physicians, especially after the therapy has been tried for a reasonable period of time." p. 214. "Few decisions are more momentous than those to withhold or withdraw a medical procedure that sustains life. But in some cases it is unjustified for surrogates and clinicians to begin or to continue therapy knowing that it will produce a greater balance of pain and suffering for a patient incapable of choosing for or against such therapy." p. 220. "Killing represents a family of ideas whose central condition is direct causation of another's death, whereas allowing to die represents another family of ideas whose central condition is intentional avoidance of causal intervention so that a disease or injury causes a natural death." p. 220. "Both killing by omission and killing by commission can be intentional." p. 222. "Some persons use the term killing as a normative term of maleficence, parallel to "unjustified homicide or murder". Justified acts involving the deaths of patients, therefore, logically cannot be instances of killing. They can only be cases of allowing to die." p. 223. "In the attempt to protect health care professionals from charges of killing, value judgements about what is (morally and legally) permissable often control our factual judgements about the cause of death." p.224 [They quote Dan Brock: "Death and Dying", in Medical Ethics, ed. Robert M. Veatch (Boston: Jones and Bartlett Publishers 1989), p. 345.:] "The judgement of a person who competently decides to commit suicide is essentially that "my expected future life, under the best conditions possible for me, is so bad that I judge it to be worse than no further continued life at all." This seems to be in essence exactly the same judgement that some persons who decide to forego life-sustaining treatment make. The refusal of life-sustaining treatment is their means of ending life; they intend to end their life because of its grim prospects. Their death now when they otherwise would not have died is self-inflicted, whether they take a lethal poison or disconnect a respirator." p. 224. "We conclude that the distinction between killing (suicide, homicide, etc.) and letting die suffers from vagueness and confusion. It is conceptually impossible to classify many acts as instances of letting die without also classifying them as instances of killing. We have also seen that the language of killing is so confusing - causally, legally and morally - that we should avoid it in discussions of euthanasia and assistance in dying. It is often morally and conceptually more satisfactory to discuss these issues exclusively in the language of optional and obligatory treatments, dispensing altogether with killing and letting die." p. 225. "Nothing about either killing or allowing to die entails judgements about actual wrongness or rightness, or about the beneficence or nonmalifecence of the action. Rightness and wrongness depend on the merit of the justification underlying the action, not on the type of action it is. Neither killing nor letting die, therefore, is per se wrongful, and in this regard they are to be distinguished from murder, which is per se wrongful. Both killing and letting die are prima facie wrong, but can be justified under some circumstances." p. 225. "All instances of killing and letting die, then, must satisfy independent criteria, such as the balance of benefits over burdens to the patient, to determine their acceptability." p. 226. "If competent patients have a legal and moral right to refuse treatment that involves health professionals in implementing their decision and bringing about their deaths, we have a reason to suppose we have a similar right to request the assistance of willing physicians to help them control the conditions under which they die." p. 226. "Only a small percentage of patients face overwhelming pain and burdens because pain management and improvements in patients' environments have made circumstances at least bearable for most patients, and hospice environments have improved the care of the dying. The right to refuse nutrition and hydration also gives many patients the opportunity to control the time of their death. However, these facts do not provide a decisive reason for prohibiting increased physician assistance in dying. Some patients cannot be satisfactorily relieved, and in any event there are significant questions about autonomy rights for patients. If a right exists to stop a machine that sustains life, through an arrangement involving mutual agreement with a physician, why is there not the same right to stop the machine that is one's life by an arrangement with a physician?" p. 228. "The phrase "assisted death," particularly "physician-assisted death," is now widely used, but it is ambiguous because many modes of assistance exist. Both assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia are instances of assistance in bringing about death. In assisted suicide, the final agent is the one whose death is brought about, and in voluntary active euthanasia the final agent is another party." p.228 "We believe that sufficient moral reasons exist in some cases to justify mercy killing and assiste suicide, but these reasons are not necessarily sufficient to support revisions in either codes of ethics or public policies. In addressing whether we should retain or modify some current prohibitions, we therefore need to be clear about whether the topic of discussion is the moral justification of individual acts or the justification of institutional rules and public laws governing practices." p.88: As long as principles allow room for discretionary and contextual judgement, the ethics of care need not dispense with principles. However, like many proponents of virtue theory, defenders of the ethics of care find principles often irrelevant, unproductive, ineffectual, or constrictive in the moral life. A defender of principle could say that principles of care, compassion, and kindness tutor our responses in caring, compassionate, and kind ways. But this claim seems hollow. Our moral experience suggests that our responses rely on our emotions, our capacity for sympathy, our sense of friendship, and our knowledge of how caring people behave." p. 8. "Reasons other than incompleteness and lack of stated justification also support scepticism about the adequacy of professional codes in health care. From the time of Hippocrates, physicians have generated codes without scrutiny or acceptance by patients and the public. These codes have rarely appealed to more general ethical standards or to a source of moral authority beyond the traditions and judgements of physicians. In some cases, the special rules in codes for professionals seem to conflict with and even ride more general moral norms. The pursuit of professional norms in these circumstances may do more to protect the profession's interests than to introduce an impartial and comprehensive moral viewpoint. Other rules have traditionally been expressed in abstract formulations that dispense vague moral advice open to competing interpretations." p. 230. "Rules in our moral code against actively causing the death of another person are not isolated fragments. They are threads in a fabric of rules that support respect for human life. The more threads we remove, the weaker the fabric becomes." p. 231. "The ultimate success or failure of these slippery slope arguments depends on speculative predictions of a progressive erosion of moral restraints. If dire consequences will in fact flow from the legal legitimation of assisted suicide or voluntary active euthanasia, then the argument is cogent, and such practices are justifiably prohibited. But how good is the evidence that dire consequences will occur? Does the evidence indicate that we cannot maintain firm distinctions in public policies between patient-requested death and involuntary euthanasia? Scant evident supports any of the answers that have been given to these questions, so far as we can see." p. 233. "One reason for a policy of exhausting all alternatives before allowing physicians to engage in active euthanasia is the precariousness of constructing a social or professional ethic on borderline situations and emergency cases. It is dangerous to generalise from emergencies, because hard cases may make bad social and professional ethics as well as bad law." p. 234. "If it is morally permissible to unplug respirators and detach intravenous lines knowing that death will eventuate, the logic of our present situation is that we are struggling to preserve as many traditional restraints against killing as we can, consistent with taking a humane approach towards seriously suffering patients and respecting their rights." p. 240. "In general we have thus far been able to respect the line between unjustifiable and justifiable passive euthanasia in medical practice, and we should similarly be able to hold the line between justified and unjustified assistance for suicide." p. 262. "Rules of non-maleficence are negative prohibitions of action that must be obeyed impartially, and provide reasons for legal prohibitions of certain forms of conduct. By contrast, rules of beneficence present positive requirements of action, do not always need to be obeyed impartially, and rarely, if ever, provide reasons for legal punishment when one fails to abide by the rules." p. 263. "However, and very importantly, from the fact that morally recommended actions are not strong enough to support legal sanctions, or to satisfy a requirement of impartiality, it does not follow that they are merely moral ideals and are not obligations in the moral life. Not only are various norms of beneficence obligations, but they can be sufficiently strong obligations that they override obligations of non-maleficence." p. 270. "Traditionally, codes of medical ethics have inappropriately viewed physicians as independent, self-sufficient philanthropists whose beneficence is analogous to generous acts of giving. According to the Hippocratic Oath, for example, physicians' obligations to patients represent philanthropy and service, whereas their obligations to teachers represent debts incurred in becoming physicians. However, physicians and many other healthcare professionals are today deeply indebted to society (e.g. for education and privileges) and to patients, past and present (e.g. for research and "practice"). Because of this indebtedness, the medical profession's role of beneficent care of patients is misconstrued if modelled primarily on philanthropy, altruism and personal commitment." p. 286. "Some Aids patients want to commit suicide rather than face the process of suffering and dying from their disease, but their medical condition also causes central nervous system complications such as delirium or dementia that may render them unable to make a substantially autonomous choice. While recognising the case for rational suicide by patients with Aids, one physician contends that from the clinical point of view, careful evaluations of suicide even in terminally ill patients, almost invariably reveal evidence that the suicide occurred as a manifestation of psychiatric disorder rather than rational choice." p. 395. "Surprisingly, codes of medical ethics have traditionally ignored obligations and virtues of veracity. The Hippocratic Oath does not recommend veracity, not does the Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association. The principles of medical ethics of the American Medical Association PMEAMA (AMA) in effect from its origins until 1980 made no mention of an obligation or virtue of veracity, giving physicians unrestricted discretion about what to divulge to patients. In its 1980 revision, the AMA recommends simply and without elaboration that physicians "deal honestly with patients and colleagues." By contrast to this traditional disregard of veracity, virtues of candour and truthfulness are among the most widely praised character traits of health professionals in contemporary biomedical ethics." p. 418. "Rules of confidentiality have long been common in codes of medical ethics. Requirements of confidentiality appear as early as Hippocratic Oath and continue in the Code of Ethics of the AMA." p. 464. "In previous eras professional virtues were often integrated with professional obligations and ideals in codes of healthcare. Insisting that the medical profession's "prime objective" is to render service to humanity, an American Medical Association (AMA) code in effect from 1957 to 1980 urged the physician to be "upright" and "pure in character and .....diligent and conscientious in caring for the sick." It also endorsed the virtues that Hippocrates commended: modesty, sobriety, patience, promptness, and piety. However, in contrast to its first code in 1847, the AMA over the years has de-emphasised virtues in its codes. The references that remained in the 1957 version were perfunctory and marginal, and the 1980 version eliminated all traces of the virtues except for the admonition to "expose those physicians deficient in character or competence." p. 466. "The virtue of compassion is a trait combining an attitude of active regard for another's welfare with an imaginative awareness and emotional response of deep sympathy, tenderness, and discomfort at the other person's (or animal's) misfortune or suffering." p. 468. "The virtue of discernment rests on sensitive insight involving acute judgement and understanding, and it eventuates in decisive action." p. 469. "Trust is a confident belief in, and reliance upon the ability and moral character of another person." p. 470. "Some writers claim that the first or primary virtue is integrity, because it plays such a central role in healthcare ethics." Bennahum D, Kimsma G, Spreeuwenberg C, et al.

Philosophy 1983, 58:5-17. p.15 To be autonomous in one's thinking calls for intellectual skills, including the ability to judge when someone else knows better than oneself. But it calls for the ability to control the emotions that prevent those skills from being properly exercised. This is a complex matter. Courage and self-control enter into the forming of judgements as well as into acting upon them. That is one complication. A second is that certain emotions, e.g. fear or impatience, may prevent one from thinking clearly, or thinking at all; as, equally, intense emotions may prevent one from acting as judgement would dictate. p.15-16 the fear of getting the wrong answer, of being thought unorthodox, may actually prevent a person from trusting himself to accept the truth of his own observations or the safety of his own inferences.

(looks at Compassion in Dying v State of Washington) p.406 There still remained thestep of concluding that there was no constitutionally significant difference between refusing lifesaving medical treatment and assisted suicide, but this step did not seem to trouble the court, and it was quickly taken. p.408 The District Court's quick and untroubled conclusion that there is no legally (constitutionally) significant difference between assited suicide and the termination of medical treatment is also somewhat troubling. It not only goes against the grain of most judgements in the United States, England and elsewhere, it is also contrary to the historical underpinning of the 'right to die' judgements. These judgements were grounded in the common law position that unconsented-to medical treatment, like other unconsented-to touchings, is an assault or battery, and therefore patients have a presumptive right to refuse medical treatment. Whatever the merits of extending this doctrine to the extreme at which medical treatment can be refused in all circumstances, even when death is the likely result (as most United States courts have held), there is no means in logic to extend the right to refuse treatment to include the right to insist on harmful treatment, however little the difference may be in real-life consequences or however formalistic the distinction may seem to some. Discussing Bland: p.411 The implications of this judgement are not always recognised. As the Lords concluded that termination of treatment for such patients is in the patients' 'best interests' it would appear that termination of treatment is actually required and not merely permitted, for to do otherwise would be to act against the patients' 'best interests,' and would be a dereliction of the physician's legal and ethical duty. Block S, Billings A. Patient Requests to Hasten Death: Evaluation andManagement in Terminal Care. Arch Intern Med Sep 26 1994; 154: 2039-2047 p.2039 When patients ask for death to be hastened, the following areas should beexplored: the adequacy of symptom control; difficulties in the patient's relationshipswith family, friends and health workers; psychological disturbances, especially grief,depression, anxiety, organic mental disorders, and personality disorders; and thepatient's personal orientation to the meaning of life and suffering. p.2040 Patients, in fact, lack the technical knowledge to kill themselves quickly andcomfortably. Botched suicides are feared because they may cause physical suffering,shame, humiliation, and a deepened sense of helplessness....Well-organized patientswho carefully seek control over their dying are reluctant to embrace a casual,uncertain scheme to end their lives. The remarkable popularity of 'Final Exit', a manualfor "self-deliverance," testifies to the widespread hunger for certainty about how toend one's life reliably and painlessly. p.2040 Sixty percent to 90% of patients with cancer experience pain during the lastyear of life, while 10% to 20% encounter pain that is severe or difficult tocontrol....More than 90% of cancer pain can be readily managed with simple drugtherapies. p.2040 In the Netherlands, an estimated 85% of patients withdraw their requests foreuthanasia after receiving better symptom control. p.2043 We have observed that physicians seem most willing to consider carrying outassisted suicide or euthanasia with patients whom they like or with whom they identifyand with whom they have had intense and often long relationships. p.2046 When patients receive comprehensive care, requests for hastened death arevery rare. In the extraordinary circumstance when the patient's suffering cannot beameliorated within the framework of his or her personal values, we believe thateuthanasia and assisted suicide represent appropriate extensions of palliative care.

Journal of Philosophy 1983; 80:29-45. p.45 The history of rights movements shows that sympathy, even of enlightened people, moves the public conscience or at least custom and legal institutions only slowly when there is not supporting motivation from protests, nonviolent noncooperation, and sometimes violent action. p.45 One might say that what is important is not the concept of rights, but that the oppressed are resentful and willing to protest, and do so without any feeling of shame - or even disapprove of those among the oppressed who do not speak out. p.44-45 There is a third benefit of the language of rights, in that, if the explication is correct, it encourages the patients of right-infringing actions to feel resentment, to protest, to take a firm stand. To say "You have a right to this" seems to imply that these attitudes/behaviors are justified. Bresnahan J. Medical Futility or the Denial of Death?

Brett A. Limitations of Listing Specific Medical Interventions in Advance Directives. Journal of the American Medical Association 1991; 266(6): 825-828. listing specific interventions in advance does not necessarily enhance self-determination or reduce uncertainty in the decision making. In summary, the intervention-focussed directive runs the risk of promoting the selection or rejection of interventions because of their inherent characteristics rather than as appropriate means to the ends that the patient would have wanted. The SUBSTITUTED JUDGEMENT standard asks the surrogate to make the decision that the patient would have made in the particular situation. This standard is limited by the fact that the surrogate must know something about the patient's prefernces, as expressed when the patient's decision-making capacity was intact. On the other hand, the BEST INTERESTS standard is invoked when the patient's preferences were unknown. This standard, by definition, cannot apply to the patient's preferences. Instead it seeks the surrogate to choose the course of action that promotes the patient's interests according to a more impersonal standard (e.g. that which most reasonable persons would choose). Patients, however, do not select or reject diagnostic interventions in a vacuum; they choose interventions according to the clinical context in which they find themselves. At first glance, the detailed intervention-focused directive appears to conform to this contextual model. The person is given a clinical context (eg advanced irreversible dementia), and asked whether he or she would choose an intervention (eg, use of antibiotics)...the patient may not want an antibiotic for a virulent pneumonia that will lead to rapid death but would prefer an antibiotic for an indolent pneumonia that is not expected to result in death but is causing an uncomfortable cough and chest pain. (on multiple choice LWs)...this complexity does not guarantee improved decision making from a medical perspective, nor does it necessarily increase the certainty that decisions will conform to treatment goals from the patient's presumed perspective. The simplest and most practical solution to the problem of advance directives is to encourage wider use of health care proxy directives... Another innovation, exemplified in the VALUES HISTORY document, is to focus on those individual values that might be relevant to decisions about life-sustaining treatment.

Neither doctors nor any other occupational group should be placed in a category which lessens their responsibility for their actions." British Medical Association. Medical Ethics Today. London: BMA 1993. p.161 ...the Association confirms its commitment to the fundamental right of patients to accept or reject, through advance directives, treatment options offered to them. p.161 ...the BMA has very strongly recommended that any patients who wish to draft advance directives should ensure that they are well informed and do so with the benefit of medical advice. p.162 The possibility of patients inadvertantly misdirecting their doctors by an inadequate appreciation of the circumstances or of the evolution of new treatments led the Association to recommend strongly that advance directives should not be legally binding on doctors, but legal cases in 1992 and 1993 indicated that an anticipatory decision which is clearly established and applicable to the circumstances would be as legally binding as any current decision made by a competent patient. (Cases referred to are Re T [1992]4 All ER 649; and Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993]1 All ER 859.)p.162 The BMA suggests that patients who have drafted an advance directive carry a card indicating that fact as well as lodging a copy with their doctor. p.162 The BMA recommends that any person making an advance directive updates it at regular intervals. Five years is suggested as an appropriate interval for patients to review their decisions. p.163 It is not acceptable for doctors to give patients a tacit impression that an advance directive would be respected when the doctor, for reasons of conscience, has no intention of doing so. p.164 The precise role, powers and title of a proxy decision-maker are not defined by either custom or law (even in Scotland where tutors dative may exercise this role). Pending clarification in law, the BMA believes that in cases where such a person has been nominated by the patient, the criterion to be followed in decision-making would be that of "substituted judgement," with the agent as a sympathetic interpreter of the patient's own values, rather than attempting to judge the patient's best interests. p.177 In the BMA's view, liberalising the law on euthanasia would herald a serious and incalculable change in the ethics of medicine. p.177 Effective management of pain and distress which has the side effect of curtailing life, is a necessary form of treatment. p.177 The Association advises doctors to consider their own views and inform patients at the outset of any absolute objection they might have to the principle of limiting treatment at the patient's request. p.177 When a decision is reached that it would not be in the best interests of the patient to give life prolonging treatments, the withholding of certain treatments is ethical, provided that caring attention to the patient's comfort is sustained. p.177 Patients can only make valid choices on the basis of shared information about diagnoses, prognoses and realistic treatment options. p.178 The BMA strongly supports the principles underpinning advance directives which represent the patients's settled wish regarding treatment choices when the patient is no longer able competently to express a view. p.178 When preparing an advance directive patients are entitled to receive balanced counselling on the medical issues from their doctor. Discussion between patients and doctors of the specific terms of an advance declaration should be a continuing dialogue. p.178 The BMA is not in favour of legislation on advance directives. p.178 It is the responsibility of the patient to ensure that the existence of an advance directive is known to those who may be asked to comply with its provisions. Doctors, having been notified that an advance directive exists, should make all reasonable efforts to acquaint themselves with its contents. p.178 It is strongly recommended that patients review their advance directives at regular intervals (at least once every five years). p.178 The Association encourages doctors to raise the subject of advance directives in a sensitive manner with patients who may be thought likely to have an interest in the matter or who are anxious about the possible administration of unwanted treatments at a later stage.

New England Journal of Medicine 1992; 327(19): 1384-1388. (philosophical) p.1384 We cannot resolve these moral tensions by making one side of the tension disappear. Instead, we must learn to live with these tensions within a pluralistic society. This requires more reliance on negotiation, compromise, and practical reasoning, and less on abstract ethical theory. p.1384 I argue here that an adjudication of assisted death might follow from viewing it as a compassionate response to one sort of medical failure, rather than as something to be prohibited outright or as something to be established as a standard policy. p.1385 To take this case forward requires a case-orientated approach that identifies models of sound ethical practice and then asks whether new, controversial cases resemble those model cases in their most important moral features. p.1386 The point of calling assisted death a response to a medical failure - the failure of medical interventions to arrange a good death - is to make the strong claim that assisting a death is an admission of incompetent medical practice until proved otherwise. This in turn indicates what sort of medical defense must be offered, in a particular case, to justify the practice. p.1386 Identifying a psychopathology that interferes with competent decision making but that cannot itself be ameliorated by treatment may be diagnostically elegant but moves the patient no closer to a good death. p.1387 If the defense of how one has managed a medical failure must occur on a case-by case basis, we cannot construct a statute that would list all possible justifications and restrictions in advance. p.1387 A good death occurs as much as possible among caring and supportive people. If the law forces already suffering patients to die alone - for fear that seeking the supportive presence of others might implicate them in an illegal act - then the law undermines important social values of family and community.

Hastings Center Report, July-August1993:33-38 p.33-34 What if medicine once and for all accepted death as a limit that cannot beovercome andused that limit as an indispensable focal point in thinking about illnessand disease? The reality of death as a part of our biological life would be seen, not asa discordant note in the search for health and well-being, but as a foreseeableendpoint of its enterprise, and its pacification as a proper goal of medicine fromtheoutset. What if the aim of scientific medicine was not an endless struggle againstdeath, with the fight against disease as the token of that struggle, but helping humansbest live a mortal, not immortal life? p.34 Medicine's pursuit of health shouild be leavened by its need when health fails, asit must, to prepare the way for as peaceful a death as possible. p.34 At present medicine takes as its task only the pursuit of health, or thepreservation of a decent quality of life, with death as the accidental result of illnessesand diseases thought to be avoidable and contingent, even though in fact still fatal.Death is what happens when medicine fails. p.34 In the task of allowing a peaceful death, brinkmanship would be repudiated fromthe outset. Active treatment to cure disease and stop death from coming would stopwell short of its technical possibilities, at that point when a peaceful death couod bemost assured and best managed. The worry that a patient might die sooner thantechnologically necessary would be actively balanced by anxiety that a patient mightdie later than was compatible with a peaceful death. p.35 The process of dying is deformed when, through overconfidence in our power tomanage technology and to manage our own ambivalence toward death, we fail to takeaccount of what an overzealous medicine can do. p.37 A standard of futility compatible with the goal of avoiding an unnecessarily painfulor extended death would be most valuable. The test of futility could be twofold: first,an inability to arrest more than momentarily (by a few days or weeks) a downward,deteriorating course; and second, the probability, should that kind of effort be made,that a peaceful death would become increasingly unlikely. At that point, curativemedical treatment has indeed become futile and ought to be stopped. The standard isthus one that looks to the possibility of sustaining life in some decent fashion, butalso and simultaneously to the choices necessary for enhancing the possibility of apeaceful death. p.38 ...when a patient is incompetent and death on the way, family members shouldnot be forced, through guilt or a confusion about killing and allowing to die, to believethat a termination of treatment is wrongful killing.

Most medical care in Japan is supported by a system of medical insurance in which palliative care is not sufficiently covered, but curative therapies are. It is often assumed that people's greatest fears of dying concern pain and going into hospital. As can be seen from the results, this is the perception of the medical profession and not patients. The thing that worried people most in New Zealand and Japan was facing the unknown, whereas in the UK leaving the family was the major concern for dying people. Choice in Dying, Inc. Refusal of Treatment Legislation - A State by State Compilation of Enacted and Model Statutes. New York: Choice in Dying 1991 In 1976, California became the first state to pass legislation that directly addressed decisionmaking on behalf of incompetent patients. The California Natural Death Act allowed individuals, in certain circumstances, to plan in advance for their treatment at the end of life. On June 25th, 1990, the United States Supreme Court reached the constitutional question of the &quotright to die" in the landmark case of Nancy Cruzan. The Court recognized that every competent individual has a constitutional liberty right to be free of unwanted medical treatment. At the same time, however, the Court left the regulation of this right on behalf of incompetent patients in the hands of the states. As Justice O'Connor noted in her concurrence, &quotToday we decide only that one state's practice does not violate the constitution. The more challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding incompetents' liberty interests is entrusted to the &quotlaboratory" of the states...in the first instance." QUOTING CRUZAN V. DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, 497 U.S. 261,262(1990). Following the Cruzan decision, the state legislative laboratories became increasingly active. The amendments currently being considered generally expand patients' rights to make end-of-life treatment decisions in advance. In line with this trend is the enactment of the federal Patient Self-Determination Act as part of the 1990 Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act. The PDSA, which went into effect in December 1991, requires health care providers (primarily hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies) to give patients information about their rights to make advance directives under state law; the substance of the law governing advance directives is left to the states. The PDSA also requires care providers to have written institutional policies regarding advance directives and to document whether or not a patient has executed one. QUOTED (PDSA): U.S.C.A. 1395cc & 1396a (West Supp. 1991) Christakis N, Asch D. Biases in How Physicians Choose to Withdraw Life Support. Lancet 1993; 342:642-646. p.642 Physicians do have preferences about the form of life support withdrawn. From most likely to least likely the order is: blood products, haemodialysis, intravenous vasopressors, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, tube feedings, and intravenous fluids. p.642 Four biases in decision making were also identified. Physicians prefer to withdraw forms of therapy supporting organs that failed for natural rather iatrogenic reasons, to withdraw recently instituted rather than longstanding interventions, to withdraw forms of therapy resulting in immediate death rather than delayed death, and to withdraw forms of therapy when confronted with diagnostic uncertainty. p.642 Because these biases may have clinical, social, and ethical consequences counter to patient goals, and because they may affect the underlying decision whether to withdraw life support at all, they may represent impediments to rational and compassionate decision making on critical care. p.645 Our research shows that physicians' preferences about the type of life support to withdraw are influenced by iatrogenic complications, duration of therapy with each form of life support, expected timing of death, and diagnostic uncertainty. p.645 The decision biases that we have identified here may, in some circumstances, prolong the period of dying, increase the suffering of patients and their families, and waste resources. p.645 Should, therefore, advance directives be drafted to specify how life support could be withdrawn? We think not: rather than seek such specificity physicians should focus on the underlying goals. p.645 The primary goal in life support withdrawal ordinarily is to allow the patient to die as humanely as possible, and the decision should be made in the most ethically sensitive, logically rigorous, and clinically appropriate way possible. The biases we have identified may subvert this objective. Ciesielski-Carlucci C. Physician Attitudes and Experiences with Assisted Suicide: Results of a Small Opinion Survey. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics 1993; 2:39-44. p.42 Of the 45 physicians surveyed, 24 had a total of at least 50 requests, and 12 physicians assisted at least 25 persons in a suicide. In sum, of the 45 respondents, 56% had at least one request to assist in a suicide and 27% had actually assisted at least once in the past. p.43 Respondents were more likely to assist (defined as prescribing or administering) a patient who is suffering from a terminal illness than one who is in chronic pain. This trend would remain the same if medically assisted suicide were made legal. p.43 ...patients are asking for assistance and that Dr Kevorkian is not alone in granting requests.

Uhlmann et al showed that physicians and spouses inaccurately predicted patients' resuscitation preferences. Physicians, who had a median patient-physician relationship of 3.4 years, either significantly underestimated or overestimated patients' preferences for resuscitation in five of six illness scenarios. Spouses significantly overestimated patients' preferences in three of six illness scenarios. Similarly, Ouslander et al found little congruence between decisions made by frail elderly and their closest relative, social worker, nurse, and primary physician. In a study carried out by Zweibel and Cassel, patients and proxies responded to five vignettes about elderly persons who required life-sustaining treatment for survival (ie, ventilation, resuscitation, chemotherapy, amputation, and tube feeding), but were unable to make health-care decisions. The proportion of instances that patients wanted the opposite of what their proxies predicted ranged from 24% for tube feeding to 50% for chemotherapy. Conwell Y, Caine E.

(PARA) This, however, is not necessarily true. First of all, we simply do not know whether unrequested life-terminating acts occurred less or more often in the past. To demonstrate a slippery slope one would need to show that something changed after introducing a certain practice, and for this at least two investigations would be required. p.26 We conclude that no empirical data can be marshalled to support the slippery slope argument against the Dutch. p.26 No patient is guaranteed euthanasia, and no physician is obliged to comply with a request for it. There must always be the doctor's conviction that euthanasia is the only acceptable way out of the suffering. Delden J, Pijnenborg L, Maas P. Dances With Data.

The application of these theoretical responses within hypothetical scenarios to the actual events that occur is a matter of conjecture and speculation. This raises serious questions about the value of executing directives that specify great detail. Indeed, the more detailed an advance directive is, the more likely it is to vary from events that actually occur. It may be of more value for individuals to express themselves in their own terms, not in the medical jargon that health professionals use to write documents, and to address their personal goals, hopes and fears."

Dartmouth 1996:179-214. p.188 With or without supportive legislation, the medicalization of the living will may, in some instances, reverse the real intent, which was to protect the autonomy of the patient in choosing a peaceful death. p.189 Most attempts at living will documentation so far have been notable for their blandness, almost as if they were designed for lawyers and academics rather than lay members of the community who might have ailing health and poor eyesight. p.189 Eloquent arguments for the use of the living will as a starting point for patient-doctor dialogue and understanding... ... fall short when we consider that, in Britain's hard-pressed health service, the doctor may barely have the time to explain current medication, much less sit and explain as yet non-existent diseases, prognoses and life-saving treatments. It would seem that explanations as well as safeguards should be built into the living will paperwork itself... p.190 Pregnancy waivers, indicating whether or not a refusal of treatment shall be overruled in the event that the incapacitated person is concurrently pregnant, may be very helpful if the declarant is of child-bearing age, but might invoke further problems unless there were prior statutory clarification.

Dartmouth 1996. pp129-160. p.130-131 Once public debate has aired an issue, reform generally only proceeds from centrist arguments that are accessible to a broad populace; that juncture may quite probably have been reached on a number of the issues here under discussion, and so the diatribes of 'pro-life' and 'right-to-die' campaigners become tangential amd anachronistic, fuelling the debate but not the reform. p.131 Political and sociological perspectives may be more important than overreliance on the ability of the law to enable, effect or enforce change... p.131 ...if developments cannot be predicted with certainty, the need for a consensual approach is emphasized: a) to maximize the chances of reform being implemented; b) to spread the burden of responsibility for reform as equally as possible within the society to which it applies; and c) to minimize any instability following implementation. p.132 ...protests, opinion polls, eloquent arguments in favour of euthanasia or the more strident demands of voluntary euthanasia societies may provide supporting motivation for change, but the main instruments of reform are likely to be agreements between opposing factions, commonly held values such as compassion, practical caring, shared emotional responses to specific dilemmas and the insights these generate. p.137[On Advance Directives] As long as basic conditions are fulfilled (that the directive is clearly established andapplicable in the circumstances), their force at common law seems secure: but that theadvance decision was clearly established and applicable in the circumstances, mean, forinstance, that the patient clearly understood the result of refusing treatment, was capableof making a directive on the basis of such information, and that the instructions clearlycoincide with circumstances in incompetence about which the patient had previously onlyhypothesized. That gives us sufficient ground to work out that they are persuasivelegally - as long as the basic conditions are not challenged by medical opinion, or otherevidence. p.137 A case known as Re C, hailed by some as an important step forward for advancedirectives, was, in fact, only a step forward for advance decisions, and in a lower court atthat. The court was able to establish, for a competent patient, that the decision wasclearly established and applicable in the circumstances, and so make the decision binding- this facility is not the case for advance directives. p.145 Proxies can be an unreliable way of protecting prior choice. p.146 We can attempt to maximize the usefulness of living wills, without overstating their usefulness, their effectiveness, their applicability or thinking that they address more than a tiny part of the overall problem. Donnie J,Gopalakrishnan G et al. The Relationship of Empathy to Moral Reasoning in First Year Medical Students. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics (1995) 4:448-453.The study found no correlation between moral reasoning and the four empathy subscales: perspective taking, empathetic concern, fantasy, and personal distress. Women had higher DIT amd mostly higher IRI scores than men. Because the two tests require the subject to relate to others based on the principle of justice or empathy, it was concluded that higher scores on the DIT and IRI reflected an other orientation as opposed to self-orientation. Doukas D, Gorenflo D. Analyzing the Values History: An Evaluation of Patient Medical Values and Advance Directives. Journal of Clinical Ethics (1993) 4(1):41-45. p.41 The Values History's purpose is to learn more about the patient's values that give meaning to advance directives chosen for medical therapies. p.44 Over the past 25 years, medical literature has emphasized the importance of the principle of autonomy in medical decision making. Contrary to this trend, our findings demonstrate the importance of beneficence-based patient values in end-of-life decision making. Specifically, family-burden values were relevant to these decisions, while the autonomy-based values of communication and physician compliance were not pertinent. Therefore, the findings of this study challenge the contemporary presumption regarding the relastive importance of thre principles of beneficence and autonomy in advance decision making. Doukas D, McCullough L. The Values History - The Evaluation of the Pateint's Values and Advance Directives. Journal of Family Practice 1991; 32(2)145-150. p.145: The validity of the Values History is based on a basic ethical consideration: the Values History enhances the autonomy of the patient in a way that present advance directives do not, by clarifying for the health care team thepatient's expresses values underlying decisions to be carried out when decision making by the patienbt is no longer possible. One possible benefit of such an evaluation is to help physicians and institutions manage more reliable the uncertainties that surroundadvance directives. Downie R, Charlton B.

The Incompetent Patient on the Slippery Slope.Hastings Center Report July-August 1994, p.6-12. p.6 ...the current subordination of the incompetent patient's experential interests isunsatisfactory on several scores. the ethicists' and policymakers' near-obsession withdefending the competent person's right to control her future treatment has left thebest interests standard inadequately developed ans subject to widely variedinterpretation. p.7 Dementia is estimated to affect from 7 to 20 percent of persons between the agesof seventy-five and eighty-four, and 25 to 47 percent of persons above that age. p.7 The vast majority of dementia patients have an experiential world. Unlike NancyCruzan and Karen Quinlan, most dementia patients are subjects with their ownthoughts, perceptions, emotions, and perspectives. These patients are themselvesaffected by the medical interventions they receive - they subjectively experience theconsequences of the treatment decisions made on their behalf. Yet the subjectivity ofthe dementia patient is often overlooked in treatment decisionmaking. p.8 It is indisputably difficult for the competent observer to step into the shoes of acognitively impaired individual. Frequently, patients are unable to communicate by usinglanguage. The worlds of those who can speak can be especially difficult to interpret. Insuch cases, observers are left to rely on behavioral and physiological data as thebasis for attempting to understand how incompetent patients experience their lives. p.8 If we adopted the skeptical position regarding our access to impaired patients'subjectivity, then no one could argue for or against a particular treatment action ongrounds of its affect on the patients themselves. If, on the other hand, we accept thatincompetent patients can be directly harmed and benefited, then we are obligated toattempt to understand as best we can their subjective experiences. p.10 It is an intimidating, indeed, frightening responsibility to calculate the overall valueof life for another human being. Both history and current practice reveal too manyexamples of its abuse. It is understandable that some would prefer to avoid thecalculation, erring on the side of treating all who cannot decide for themselves. Yetthis "solution" would expose incompetent patients to unjustified experential burdens; itwould also impose severe burdens on patients' families and others withoutcountervailing benefit to the patients themselves. p.10 For life-sustaining treatment to be appropriate, it must confer a substantialenough benefit to outweigh both its customary risks and the distinctive experentialburdens it poses for dementia patients unable to fathom its purpose. p.11 When the ability to communicate, respond, or otherwise interact with people andobjects in the world is lost, how can continued life, even in the absence of severepain, constitute a benefit of any significance to these patients themselves? p.11 [Many] moderately impaired patients are capable of simple relationships, retainsome memory of the past and concept of the future, can initiate purposefulmovement, or are otherwise able to participate in the lives they are living. Asubstantial number are also responsive to rehabilitative and other positive efforts toimprove their quality of life. Although their existence may strike observers as"degrading" or "undignified," these patients typically are not concerned about suchmatters. p.11 We simply cannot make a defensible judgement about when life-sustainingtreatment would advance an incompetent patient's interest without attempting toascertain that patient's subjective reality.

Dutch Law Defines Patients' Rights. BMJ (News) 1994; 308:616. The Netherlands has become the first country in Europe to pass a law defining the responsibilities of doctors to their patients. Doctors must now provide clear information, written down if requested, before they obtain consent for any operation. This information must include the nature, goals, and risks of the treatment. This can be overruled, but only if a doctor can argue that it would put the patient at a serious disadvantage; then the information must be given to a third party. The patient's wish not to be given information must be respected unless this would present dangers to the patient or to others. Doctors are legally obliged to honour &quotliving wills." Dyer C.

BMJ (News) 23 Oct 1993; 307:1023-1024. p.1023 A schizophrenic patient at Broadmoor Hospital won a High Court injunction banning doctors from amputating his gangrenous right leg now or in the future. p.1024 Doctors will still be able to challenge advance directives in the courts on the grounds that the wording is not precise enough or does not cover the proposed treatment, or that the patient was not competent to take a decision when the living will was made. Dworkin R. Life's Dominion - An Argument About Abortion and Euthanasia. London: Harper Collins 1993. (analysis of Roe v Wade and Casey with reference to appointed circuit judges: pp.8-9) p.26 Three distinct issues come together in decisions about euthanasia. We must be concerned how best to respect the patient's autonomy, his best interests, and the intrinsic value or sanctity of his life. p.184 the law produces the apparently irrational result that people can choose to die lingering deaths by refusing to eat, by refusing treatment that keeps them alive, or by being disconnected from respirators and suffocating, but they cannot choose a quick, painless death that their doctors could easily provide. p.180 Every state in the United States now recognizes some form of advance directive: either &quotliving wills" documents stipulating that specified medical procedures should not be used to keep the signer alive in certian specified circumstances, or &quothealth-care proxies" - documents appointing someone else to make life and death decisions for the signer when he no longer can. And we all know we may have to make such decisions - as relatives or friends or doctors - for others who have signed no living will or proxies. p.211 There is no doubt that most people treat the manner of their deaths as of special, symbolic importance: they want their deaths, if possible, to express and in that way vividly to confirm the values they believe most important to their lives. p.217 Making someone die in a way that others approve, but he believes a horrifying contradiction of his life, is a devastating, odious form of tyranny. p.225 When a mildly demented person's choices are reasonably stable, reasonably continuous with the general character of his prior life, and inconsistent and self-defeating only to the rough degree that the choices of fully competent people are, he can be seen as still in charge of his life, and he has the right to autonomy for that reason. But if his choices and demands, no matter how firmly expressed, systematically or randomly contradict one another, reflecting no coherent sense of self and no discernable even short-term aims, then he presumably has lost the capacity that is the point of autonomy to protect. Recognizing a continuing right to autonomy for him would be pointless. He has no right that his choices about a guardian (or the use of his property, or his medical treatment, or whether he remains at home) be respected for reasons of autonomy. He still has the right to beneficence, the right that decisions on these matters be made in his best interests; and his preferences may, for different reasons, be important in deciding what his best interests are. But he no longer has the right, as competent people do, himself to decide contrary to those interests. p.238 People who want an early, peaceful death for themselves or their relatives are not rejecting or denigrating the sanctity of life; on the contrary, they believe that a quicker death shows more respect for life than a protracted one. p.239 Whatever view we take about abortion and euthanasia, we want the right to decide for ourselves, and we should therefore be ready to insist that any honourable constitution, any genuine constitution of principle, will guarantee that right for everyone. E Emanuel L. What Makes a Directive Valid? Hastings Center Report (1994) 24(6):S27-S29. S27 The theoretical basis for advance directives is that the end of life and the process of death are critical matters that the individual has more right to manage than any other person. The person who leads it, more than any other person, has a rightful interest in moulding the narrative whole that is her or his life. Emanuel L, Barry M, Stoeckle J et al.

[includes history of proxy decision making, precedents etc] p.2068 Historically, the ethical justification for proxy decision making inheres in two related claims. First, the incompetent patient's right to refuse medical care can be exercised through a proxy decision. Second, knowing the patient's wishes well, the proxy will make "the decision that the incompetent patient would make if he or she were competent." The proxy decision maker is justified in exercising the incompetent patient's right to refuse care to the extent that he or she can "don the mental mantle" or "stand in the shoes" of the patient and make the same decisions under the circumstances that the patient would. In legal doctrine, this is called substituted judgement. Emanuel L, Emanuel E. Decisions at the End of Life Guided by Communities of Patients. Hastings Center Report 1993 Sep-Oct; 6-14. article also argues a case for &quotdefault proxies") p.6 ...few people ever use advance directives, and even when they do, physicians do not always honour them. In addition, the documents may be unavailable when relevant. p.7 Overall, when we combine data we can conclude that living wills and other written instructional directives can be relied on to represent a patient's wishes accurately, under good circumstances, in 46 to 84 percent of decisions. The more serious limitations are that only about 20 percent of the population use them, and the directions of even fewer will be honoured. p.7 Only half of the patients who designated a proxy in a written document have discussed with that person their preferences regarding specific interventions, such as mechanical breathing or artificial feeding and fluids. p.8 ...potential proxies are more hesitant to withdraw or terminate life-sustaining treatment than patients are. The burden of decisionmaking is heavy, and produces much greater reluctance to withhold care from a loved one than from oneself. p.7 ...of the proxies who do manage accurately to judge patients' wishes, less than two-thirds will be emotionally capable of carrying them out. Emanuel L, Emanuel E, Stoeckle J, Hummel L, Barry M. Advance Directives: Stability of Patients' Treatment Choices. Archives of Internal Medicine (1994) 154:209-217. p.209 Most people made moderately stable decisions when using scenario- and treatment-specific directives, and stability improved after they reviewed the decisions, especially among those who had discussions with their physicians. p.209 These findings suggest that advance directives can be relied on 1 to 2 years after completion to reflect a patient's choices. p.209 The common assumption justifying the use of advance directives is that a patient's prior expression of treatment choices accurately represents his or her future choices, that is, they are stable over time. p.212 Stability was moderate among patients who did not complete high school and was greater among patients with a higher education. p.216 This finding suggests that treatment directives made in the absence of specific education may reflect autonomous choices somewhat better than proxy decisions if the proxy acts in the absence of specific prior guidance from the patient.

The Limits of Proxy Decision Making: Overtreatment. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics (1995) 4: 524-529. p.524 We found a significant number of cases in which healthcare providers at a long-term care facility came into conflict with surrogates because the treatment desired by the surrogate was viewed as excessively burdonsome when evaluated by an experienced team of nurses, physicians, and social workers. Neither acourt-appointed guardian nor an institutional ethics committee were likely to be able to resiolve these conflicts because of lack of clarity about what constitutes the best interest of impaired nursing home patients. p.527 The solution to the dilemma is to develop institutional policies within longterm care facilities that would restrict the scope of treatment decisions made by proxies. Policies would be derived from the experience of a broad spectrum of nursing home staff... caring for patients with severe dementia. They would delineate what constituted an acceptable level of care designed to promote the comfort and well-being of demented patients. Within the context of care plan outlines that insured the goal of patient comfort, proxies would participate in the implementation of specific therapies based on thier view of the importance of the goal of life prolongation. p.528 Institutional policies, which reflect religious or other convictions, should be developed within a framework established by professional societies.

These results should not be used as a shortcut to determine patient preferences for care, but may provide new insights into the basis for patients' preferences. In discussing choices for future life-sustaining care, physicians need to explore with each individual the basis for his or her choices. p.366 We found variation in the degree to which elderly outpatients stated desires for life-sustaining care if they were to become terminally ill. Women wanted life-sustaining treatments less often than did men; black patients were more inclined to choose life-sustaining treatments than were white patients; patients with less education and patients scoring higher on a depression index were more likely to state a desire for more treatment.

Other advance directives require one to anticipate medical conditions that might arise and to decide in advance what medical treatment one would choose or not choose. No mention is made about who the individual is now, what matters to the individual, or why the individual has made the choices he has - in short, no attention is paid to the only information that is real and not hypothetical. These insights gathered over the past several years may account for the unexpected appeal of the Values History form, especially to persons whose job requires them to encourage others to execute advance directives, such as health care professionals, administrators, pastors, and counselors.

It may well be, however, that she has made the correct moral response to her patient's need and that any sensitive court of law would agree. In this, she and the law would show that type of mercy which may force us to desperate and unusual measures in tragic situations. Gillick M, Fried T. The Limits of Proxy Decision Making: Undertreatment. cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics (1995), 4:172-177. p.177 A resolution to this dilemma is for states to modify their proxy legislation, eliminating restrictions on the types of therapy or kinds of medical illness that proxies may address, and adding a proviso that proxy decisions cannot violate the explicit noprms of the medical profession. Gillick M, Hesse K, Mazzapica N. Medical Technology at the End of Life - What would Physicians and Nurses Want for Themselves? Archives of Internal Medicine 1993 Nov 22; 153: 2542-2547. p.2542 Nurses predicted significantly higher refusal rates than physicians... p.2542 Factors predicting refusal patterns were age and being a nurse. p.2542 We conclude that physicians and nurses, who have extensive exposure to hospitals and sick patients, are unlikely to wish aggressive treatment if they become termially ill, demented, or are in a persistent vegetative state. Many would also decline aggressive care on the basis of age alone, especially in the presence of functional impairment. p.2542 The assumption underlying advance directives is that patients are able to imagine situations in which they might subsequently find themselves... p.2457 These observations further support the hypothesis that clinical experience affects preferences. This suggests that individuals who complete advance directives do so in the absence of adequate information. Gillon R. (1992) Philosophical Medical Ethics. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons. Goddard M. Hospice Care in the Future: Economic Evaluation may be Useful. Cancer Topics 1992, 9(1):10-11. p.10 Hospices absorb a substantial amount of resources. Expenditure on services has been estimated at +54 million in 1988/89, excluding the costs of capital development which are likely to be large. p.10 ...a large study undertaken in the USA revealed that without the help of family and friends, hospice care could not achieve any savings over non-hospice care at all... p.11 The superiority of hospice care over conventional care is often assumed, but again there is limited evidence to support this assumption.

Two important characteristics of Dutch society suggest themselves as possibly relevant. In the first place, it is characterised by a relatively high level of social solidarity, manifesting itself in the institutions of an advanced welfare state, including a comprehensive health-care system. The fear that poverty and the costs of medical care might drive dying people into 'involuntary' euthanasia is rather far-fetched in the Netherlands. A second important characteristic of Dutch society concerns the level of confidence in public institutions and professions. Gunnell D, Frankel S. Prevention of Suicide: Aspirations and Evidence. British Medical Journal 1994; 308:1227-1233. p.1229 ...40% of suicides make contact with their general practitioner in the month before death. p.1231 Suicide offers an escape from an intolerable, although probably transient, period of emotional turmoil. H Hardwig J. SUPPORT and the Invisible Family. hastings Center Report 1995 July/August, Special Supplement: G22-G25. p22 For millenia, medical ethics has focussed on the doctor-patient relationship. Thus the SUPPORT trial to improve clinical decisionmaking for seriously ill patients can be viewed as a report about the failure of this dyadic relationship. ...physicians who are so unconcerned about patient preferences that they don't even bother to look at them when they're placed in the chart, and patients who do not take advantage of opportunities to discuss their treatment preferences with their physicians. p.23 We must also recognize that families are not simply or even primarily "patient support systems." They must not be thought of or treated that way by doctors, hospitals, health care planners, or bioethicists. To do so is immoral, as Kant made plain. It involves treating the rest of the patient's family as mere means to the preferences of the patient. p.24 Treatment decisions that respect and enhance the autonomy of the patient may at the same time disregard and shatter the autonomy of the patient's caregivers and the rest of her family... If autonomy is a value, it's a value for all involved. Hardwig J. The Problems of Proxies with Interests of Their Own: Towards a Better Theory of Proxy Decisions. Journal of Clinical Ethics 1993 Spring: 20-27. p.21 ...the reservations we have about interested family members and their proxy decisions are partly of our own making. The accepted theory of proxy decisions is deeply flawed and must be recast. Our medical practice is, I believe, often better than the conventional theories of proxy decision making. Nonetheless, some of our deepest worries about proxy decision making grow out of the morally inappropriate instructions we give them. p.26 ...we must provide guidance and support for those caught in the moral crucible of proxy decisions. Not only would this approach be more ethically sound, but it would, I believe, decrease the number of inappropriate proxy decisions. Hardwig J. What About the Family. Hastings Center Report 1990 March/April:5-10. p.5 The prevalent ethic of patient autonomy ignores family interests in medical treatment decisions. Acknowledging these interests as legitimate forces basic changes in ethical theory and the moral practice of medicine. p.10 Our present ethical theory can only condemn as unethical any attempt to weigh in the interests of other family members. If we would acknowledge the moral relevance of the interests of the family we could perhaps develop an ethical theory that would guide and support physicians, patients, and families in the throes of agonisiong moral decisions. Hare J, Pratt C, Nelson C. Agreement between Patients and Their Self-Selected Surrogates on Difficult Medical Decisions. Archives of Internal Medicine 1992 May; 152: 1049-1054. ...within individual pairs, agreement on treatment occurred only 70% of the time even though surrogates were asked to base their treatment decisions on substituted judgement.Patients considered &quotburden on the family" and &quottime left to live" as the most important factors in choosing among difficult treatment options, while surrogates identified the patients' pain as the most important factor. ...physicians and spouses are no more accurate at predicting the treatment preferences of patients than would be expected by chance alone... Clearly, confidence on the part of surrogates does not necessarily ensure the surrogates' accurate determination of patients' wishes. ...surrogates are often required to make emotion-laden decisions on the basis of an imperfect set of &quotfacts."

Forty percent wanted to make the decision about institution of artificial ventilation themselves if mentally competent and 24% wanted to use some form of advance directive if mentally incompetent. p.1031 Elderly patients faced with a life threatening illness are a heterogeneous group. They have widely differing preferences for treatment and there are few external guides to these preferences. Heintz A P M. Euthanasia: can be part of good terminal care. British Medical Journal, 25 June 1994, p.1656. p.1656 It makes no sense to discuss euthanasis in terms of being for it or against it. The basic question is whether we accept the right of human beings to decide for themselves how their lives will end. Helme T. Stances Towards Euthanasia. Psychiatric Bulletin 1991, 15:1-3. p.3 A Terminal Care Commission could be instituted, by the Secretary of State on the model of the Mental Health Act Commission, in order to review the provision of terminal care and to establish guidelines for good practice. The Commission could then be approached, either by practitioners or by patients or relatives, and second opinions provided on request. p.3 [discusses and proposes a 2nd possibility, that of Euthanasia Tribunals.] High D. Advance Directives and the Elderly: A Study of Intervention Strategies to Increase Use. Gerontologist 1993; 33(3):342-349 p.347 The study further suggests that the most effective intervention is one that provides older people with a moderate level of well-written, easily understood educational materials accompanied by easy access to assistance in completing the appropriate documents. p.347 The reasons for the low rate of use of advance directives among U.S. citizens, especially older Americans, are more complicated than a lack of information and a lack of encouragement from health care professionals. p.348 The data suggest that serious attention needs to be given to understanding elderly people's overwhelming preference for family surrogates. p.348 Moreover, it is not clear that all of life's events, especially end-of-life health care decisions, can or should be anticipated... As a consequence, it may well be appropriate for legislators, policymakers, ethicists, health care professionals, and advocacy groups to rethink from the bottom up the whole advance directive process. Hiller T, Patterson J, Hodges M, Rosenberg M. Physicians as Patients - Choices Regarding Their Own Resuscitation. Archives of Internal Medicine (1995) 155:1289-1293. p.1291 ...most physicians actively engaged in primary care would not choose CPR for themselves with chronic diseases and functional limitations as defined by our vignettes - particularly with advancing age. Alternatively, many would choose CPR if they were having an acute myocardial infarction with ventrivcular dysrhythmia, a condition for which it was designed and has been shown to be beneficial. p.1291 Alzheimer's dementia was consistenly the condition in which physicians would least want CPR for themselves. Hoefler J Deathright: Culture, Medicine, Politics, and the Right to Die. Oxford: Westview Press 1994. p.173 "With In re Quinlan (1976), it was argued that the constitutionally protected right to die could be exercised by a family on behalrf of an incompetent patient as long as the family could establish that its decision was consistent with the decision the incompetent principal would make if able to do so. This knowledge might include understandings about the principal's religious beliefs, general attitudes regarding medical care, and other substantial (albeit indirect) evidence of that person's frame of mind with regard to right-to-die issues. ... This reasoning would become known as the "substituted judgement" standard, which holds that a third party's best guess about the wishes of the incompetent patient could be substituted for that which was impossible to obtain: the expressed wishes of the patient." p.173 "The term substituted judgement actually originates with the Massachusetts case In re Spring (1980). In this case, the court decided that a seventy-eight-year-old incompetent individual with end-stage kidney disease could forgo hemodialysis, based on what was known about the individual's general preferences in such matters. No written or specific oral instructions would be required as long as the principal's predisposition toward the withdrawal of life support could be reasonably demonstrated by a third party." p.173-4 "The "Best Interests" Standard. In another important Massachusettes case, Superintendant of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz (1977), the court seemed to expand the coverage of the constitutionally protected right-to-die beyond those who were currently incompetent to those who had never been legally competent. Joseph Saikewicz, the principal in this case, had been mentally retarded since birth. But the Massachusettes court hearing the case presumed that those who knew him could reasonably determine what his wishes might be, even though he himself had never been legally competent to make such decisions on his own behalf. Extending the Quinlan rationale to Saikewicz was something of a stretch for the substituted-judgement standard, however, leading the Saikewicz court to introduce the notion that other factors might be considered, including age (Saikewicz was sixty-seven), the pain associated with continued therapyt, the chances for therapeutic success, the suffering associated with the continuation of life, and the inability to cooperate with therapy when in a degraded mental state. This move to consideration of other factors broadened the realm of possibilities for those seeking to establish the right to die, and in the process, it laid the groundwork for what would become a second kind of test: the "best-interests" standard, a term that was actually not coined until the New Jersey court heard the case of Claire Conroy five years later."

Lord Donaldson set out the conditions which would ensure that a previous refusal oftreatment would be legally binding. These are that the patient has full capacity at thetime the decision was made; this was not subject to any undue influence; and thepatient contemplated the situation which later arose and the consequences of refusingconsent. Clients who are considering making a living will should always be advised to discussthe document with their doctor.

Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal 1993, 3(3):303-325. [good examples of scenarios for developing values] p.303 We recognize three stages in the development of advance directive forms in the United States: (1) the legal phase, which focused on the technicalities of constitutional and penal law regarding privacy and professional conduct; (2) the checklist phase, which involved the development of instruments, primary lists, foir assessing patients' values and preferences and integrating them into advance directives; and (3) the story phase, which uses stories to develop value profiles and to integrate them into proxy decision making. p.313: "Many clinicians, lawyers and ethicists believe that traditional advance directive forms are largely ineffective in providing sufficient information on values, preferences, and guidance for medical intervention. Story-based value assessments and directives and other narrative methods that employ the development, evaluation, and integration of stories into a person's own life story are an alternative to traditional directives. Since story-based assesments and directives do not provide ready-made recipes for medical intervention, they challenge good clinical practice to integrate value assessment with medical assessment and improved physician-patient interaction into on-going stories of cure and care."

Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics 1993; 2:19-35. p.22 In 1972... the Dutch Reformed Church published a pastoral writing in which voluntary euthanasia was conditionally accepted as a humane way of dying. p.23 The Dutch healthcare system, unlike that of other countries, provides care for all citizens at a highly advanced level, without exceptions. p.23 Most people in the Netherlands die at home, being cared for by their general practitioner. p.23 To investigate the practical matters of numbers and extent, in 1990 the government installed the Commission on the Study of Medical Practice Concerning Euthanasia: the Remmelink Commission. p.24 Some adjectives used to designate a distinction, for example the terms active/passive and direct/indirect, are considered to be confusing and are left behind as &quotstations passed." p.24 Euthanasia has come to be defined as &quotIntentionally taking the life of a person upon his or her explicit request by someone else than the person concerned." p.24 Within the law, the difference between acting and refraining from acting has no particular relevance, and this consideration took precedence over the psychological experience of the difference. Passive euthanasia is self-contradictory because it concerns the omission of a treatment to which the patient has not consented. p.33 (Commentary Thomasma D pp31-33) The Dutch, unlike Americans, do not practice general medicine as strangers to patients and their values. They are able to construct a value history for the patients who request euthanasia at the end of their lives. Kirby M. Patients' rights - why the Australian courts have rejected 'Bolam.'

(Note: for further report on HACKETHAL and pictures see: VESV Report No.46, August 1984) p.63 ...German penal codes, in contradistinction to American law, consider motive in the evaluation of culpability, thus allowing for leniency in spite of the basic rigidity of the law. p.65 In his private clinic, Hackethal provided a lethal dose of cyanide to an old lady with a massive destruction of her face due to cancer. She had been a long-time patient of his and had explicitly asked to be assisted in ending her life. After the death of the patient, Hackethal publicised the case in numerous press and TV interviews which were followed by his prosecution. The case was later dismissed as abetment of suicide, an action not punishable under German law. This verdict must be seen as a typical instance of current uneasiness in regard to the euthanasia issue: presumed to have been motivated by compassion, Hackethal was exonerated from the charge of practising illegal euthanasia. On the other hand, judgement is issued with the clear understanding that no legal facilitation of mercy killing is intended, and that cases like the present one do not constitute a precedent of any kind. Recently, Hackethal filed a request with the state attorney, and subsequently with the constitutional (supreme) court, to be allowed to offer death assistance to a young woman who is quadriplegic, suffers from extreme pain and wishes to die but is bodily unable to commit suicide. Hackethal's request was denied and unleashed a flood of criticism from medical and eccesiastical officials. Incidentally, recourse to abetment of suicide can hardly be seen as a reliable legal loophole, for the prosecution may easily shift the emphasis fromsuicide to manslaughter and thus lead to a verdict of guilty. Both current legislation and well-meant reform efforts have tried to reduce the vulnerability of abetment but, since at the time suicide is progressively being considered less a free decision and more one of reduced mental incompetence, abetment loses its protective function as it can only be exculpatory when the suicidal individual is a fully competent adult. Because suicidal intentions are always to be considered pathological, a recent textbook on medical ethics justifies brief involuntary commitments in psychiatric clinics for suicide-prone individuals.

Bioethics (1994) 8(1):27-48. p.37 It is not empirically obvious why interests in dignity, the financial well-being of one's family, bodily integrity, and so on, should be said to survive and be applicable to a person who either no longer exists or cannot cognize and presently appreciate these values. Although present practices regarding the use of living wills may go on despite the failure to justify their employment philosophically, such failure would mean that the consensus was forged on a fictitious account of self-determination. Thus, those who argued in the pre-consensus years for the primacy of the best interest standard as the sole standard of decision making would actually be correct. p.39 ...Buchanan and Brock favour interpreting living wills as embodiments of acts of will rather than evidence of preferences in order to make it more likely that the living wills will actually be employed and given a substantial role in the decision-making process. p.42 We must make it clear what it means to say that interests &quotsurvive." ... They survive in the memories, both personal and institutional, of the community. p.42 I currently remember other people and have an interest in how others remember me in the future. It is this social meaning of interests that best accounts for their survival. p.43-44 ...we can also make sense of the fact that patients express more confidence in their designated proxy decision maker than seems warranted by current research. The patient's confidence may not be based on the ability of the proxy to give the same answer regarding a treatment choice as the patient would presently give, but rather, the patient is expressing a trust that the proxy can take the patient's character into account and deliberate in a way that will discover a plan of action that generally accords with the patient's values. Thus, the patient's interests, values, and to some degree, personhood, survive in the deliberative process of the proxy. p.47-48 The narrative understanding of the relation between self and society, on the one hand, substantiates applying living wills based upon self-determination. Kuhse H. The Case for Active Voluntary Euthanasia. Law Medicine & Health Care 1986; 14(3-4):145-148. The question is whether a patient can rationally choose an earlier death over a later one, and that choice is made in either case. Hence, if a patient can rationally choose passive euthanasia, she must also be able to rationally choose active euthanasia. Kushner T.

The Values History: An Innovation in Surrogate Medical Decision-Making. Law, Medicine & Health Care 1990, 18(3):202-212. p.210 Perhaps most dismaying are studies finding that potential surrogate decision-makers often are unable to predict the preferences of their principal. This lack of knowledge bodes poorly for the surrogate decision-maker's ability to exercise accurate substituted judgement. It was against this backdrop of unexpressed and misunderstood desires that the Values History Project was conceived at the Institute of Public Law in 1988. p.210 While the Institute recommends that traditional advance directives be completed, if appropriate, in conjunction with the Values History, the potential use of the Values History extends beyond the legal limit posed by advance directives. p.210 The Values History approaches the topic differently than advance directives: instead of asking a person what medical decisions she or he wants made in the event of decisional incapacity, the questions focus on the premises and processes the person uses, and would like used, when deciding om medical treatment. What seems to have been overlooked until now is the recognition that advance directives are syllogisms that ask for medical conclusions. One premise is a not-yet-existent future medical condition or event; the conclusion is the treatment the person does or does not want, at least given today's range of possible options. What is lacking in the syllogism is the other important universal premise: the values that underlie and inform any such decision. p.211 While we cannot predict our future, we can at least explain ourselves now. The explanation may help ensure that the person we are, and hope to be, is respected by others who must stand in our stead. p.211 [criticizing Emanuel & Emanuel's Medical Directive:] While comprehensive in its scenarios and treatment options, the Medical Directive, like all advance directives, asks for answers that are based on unexpressed values.

The Effect of Recovery From Depression on Preferences for Life-Sustaining Therapy in Older Patients. Journal of Gerontology 1994; 49(1):M15-M21. M15.Refusal of life-sustaining therapy by a medically ill depressed older patient creates a dilemma for the clinician. It is difficult to know whether treatment refusal in this setting represents a transient wish to die, influenced by depression, or whether it is an authentic reflection of the patient's will. M15.This study demonstrated that treatment of mild-to-moderate depression does not necessarily result in an increased desire for life-sustaining medical therapy. Because depressed patients exhibit less consistency in their preferences over time, we advise careful and repeated discussions with the depressed patient regarding these decisions. M.15 Preferences did not change significantly from initial to final interview, regardless of whether subjects had recovered from depression or remained depressed. With the exception on cardiopulmonary resuscitation, however, control subjects' preferences were more stable than depressed subjects' choices. Leonard-Taitz J.

Journal of the American Medical Association 1995; 274(20):1834-1836. Editoral on SUPPORT Principal Investigators: A Controlled Trial to Improve Care for Seriously Ill Hospitalized Patients. p.1835 The SUPPORT nurses failed to increase discussions between physicians and patients. p.1835 Assessments of the patient's pain were not provided routinely to the attending physician. Apparently no component of the SUPPORT intervention directly addressed the problem of inadequate pain control. p.1835-1836 ...merely providing information does not change physician behaviour. Recommendations by consultants in the medical record are often not followed. Providing physicians information about new drugs, vaccines, and practice guidelines does not alter their practice. p.1836 In retrospect, was it wise to expect to improve care at the end of life without changing the organization and culture of the hospital? Such changes might include conferences on decisions near the end of life, case management meetings regarding individual patients, individual feedback to physicians on their performance, and recognition for clinicians who provide outstanding care at the end of life. p.1836 Physicians who are local opinion leaders can catalyze colleagues to adopt new clinical practices. A respected senior physician might organize seminars on how to discuss prognosis with patients, elicit their concerns and preferences for care, and negotiate a mutually acceptable plan of care. A physician respected for communication skills could offer to accompany physicians when they discuss patients' decisions about life-sustaining interventions. this "consultant" could help the attending physician address patients' concerns and correct misunderstandings. Respected physicians may have more impact on physician-patient communication than skilled nurses because some physicians may have difficulty accepting suggestions from nurses regarding life-sustaining interventions. p.1836 Rather than rejecting the ideal of patient autonomy, physicians and hospitals might redouble efforts to make informed consent a reality. p.1836 Currently physicians receive little practical training on talking to patients about life-sustaining interventions. Residents rarely watch senior physicians hold such conversations and are seldom observed by experienced physicians. More direct supervision and feedback would likely improve these discussions.

On the whole, advance directives...by producing some order in a legally chaotic situation, give some legal protection to physicians and hospitals. Giving such protection, if the shield of protection is used wisely and responsibly, may be an ethically good thing. It may, on the one hand, encourage physician communication and enable patient choice; but, on the other hand, the protection given by this law may be used by institutions and physicians to distance themselves all too easily from a particular patient's particular situation by taking refuge in a generic rule. Medicine does not want to throw out the baby of genuine and ethical caring with the bathwater of physician paternalism. Advance directives can help bring about situations in which a dialogue between physician and patient is improved, or they can bring about a situation in which physicians and health care institutions abrogate their responsibility and justify this abrogation by a mere obesiance to the concept of autonomy. Ventilators, after all, can be used temporarily (as in anesthesia or to tide a patient over a bout of severe pneumonia) or permanently (as when a patient with chronic lung disease finally becomes and permanently ventilator dependent), or they can, and quite properly so, be used as a comfort measure. Logue B. Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America. Oxford: Maxwell Macmillan 1993. p158-159 In theory, advance directives can ... offer patients autonomy in terminal-care decisions, a chance to avoid expensive, invasive, and futile procedures, and the possibility of a more acceptable death. p.160 Many people believe that by signing a living will they can avoid &quotmedical torment of all sorts". But the facts are at variance with this common belief. p.160 ...the degree of foresight required by those who sign is quite unrealistic; no matter what contingencies are foreseen, the crisis that materializes may be far different from those that were envisioned. QUOTES MANY CASES OF LIVING WILLS AND PROXIES BEING IGNORED pp160-163 p.162 (Often advance directives are)...too vague to be adequate guides to the patient's wishes. p.163 As one critical care nurse put it, the agent must act as a &quotbodyguard". p.165 The bottom line is that often strangers - the medical personnel who happen to be on duty at the critical time - will make the crucial choices. p.166 There is undeniably scope for professional intervention in devising advance directives, and professional cooperation is essential if they are to be implemented. Even when their knowledge is adequate, patients and their caregiving relatives may hesitate to question, let alone challenge, the doctor's opinion because they fear his anger, rejection, or even abandonment. Logue B. When Hospice Fails: The Limits of Palliative Care. OMEGA (1994) 29(4); 291-301. p.292 Although unmanageable patients may indeed be rare in hospice experience, thisis largely attributable to the fact that patients are highly selected for their likelihood tobenefit from hospice's specialized services. That is, those who are unmanageable orlikely to become unmanageable are seldom considered good candidates for hospice.Moreover, the selection process works both ways: patients who select hospice tend tobe those who find its goals compatible with their own. p.292 Hospice cannot accomodate all the old, incurably ill, and dying patients whomight conceivably benefit from palliative care. Over two million deaths occur each yearin the United States, whereas hospice programs collectively serve only about 200,000patiants annually. p.294 Undoubtedly, some patients and families are quite satisfied with the hospicechoice. But, on average, hospice patients are no more satisfied with their medical andnursing care than patients in other care settings. p.294 That some are pleased with hospice services...does not conclusively demonstratethe desirability of that regimen for every patient. Nor does the existence of satisfiedpatients allow us to conclude that other alternatives, such as physician-assistedsuicide, might not be deemed more desireable than palliation were thay to be offered. p.295 A good death...is under the dying person's control and gives that person time tosettle debts and fulfill obligations. Achieving "closure" is important. The term refers tosettling differences, healing wounds, and closing gaps in human relationships. Closureis difficult or impossible when the timing of death is uncertain or when the patient istoo physically frail or mentally impaired. To most people, a death without closure is abad death. p.299 Palliative care may well be the best choice for some. But it should not be theonly alternative. Medical realities and the alleviation of pointless suffering necessitatethat policymakers consider options consistent with patient autonomy and the right todie. Louis R. Passive Taboos.

McLean S, paper given to International College of Surgeons, London November 14th 1994: "Where the directive is indeed a negative declaration, the doctor would certainly be frustrated by not being able to intervene, but this presumes that the nature of the advance directive is only clinical. In fact some directives now address themselves to values histories rather than clinical condition and this would be my preferred model. The difference is that the individual describes not which medical conditions he or she would not want to live with, but rather the circumstances in which continued life is not preferable to them - even if something could be done medically."

But nothing will be solved simplyby changing the way in which decisions are made - say, by removing them from thecourts and bringing them within a legislative structure - unless other principles,cherished by all jurisdictions form the basis of the decision-making criteria. Legislationprovides the opportunity to create a framework which does not rely on sophistry, andwhich also takes account of wider matters. Principles such as transparency andaccountability of decision-making, formal justice and compassion will not inevitablyform any more part of a legislative than a court-based framework, but they could.

Second, women's moral agency in relation to medical decisions is often not recognized. Third, courts apply evidentiary standards differently to evidence about men's and women's preferences. Fourth, life-support dependent men are seen as subjected to medical assault; women are seen as vulnerable to medical neglect. p.91 Gender profoundly affects judicial analysis of right-to-die cases. Judicial reasoning about men stresses the role of personal autonomy in these controversial decisions. Judicial reasoning about women examines the role of caregivers. Miller P.

Respondents were more likely to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation when given a therapy-specific advance directive vs general-statement advance directive, 84% vs 73% respectively. With a therapy-specific advance directive that was supported by a proxy and prior patient-physician discussion, 100% of physicians were willing to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Detailed advance directives with a supportive proxy, coupled with physician-patient discussion, furnish the most reliable medical directives. N O Ogden R. Euthanasia, Assisted Suicide & AIDS. British Colombia: Perreault Goedman Publishing 1994. p.71 Three of the respondents, in particular those who had been involved in more than one assisted death, indicated that they had access to drugs through an underground network. It was mentioned by several that connections were important. Patients who are not well-connected risk having second-rate deaths through the use of second-rate drugs. p.90 Distressing images equal to those of deplorable back-alley abortions are conjured up by the appalling and torturous conditions amongst which some of the assisted deaths in this study took place. This may make a case for state regulation of euthanasia. The data indicate that individuals are involved in euthanasia and assisted suicide in a completely unregulated, underground environment. p.90 ...and at the present time it (euthanasia) is happening with no record, no discussion, no consultation, no consistency, no direction, no guidance, and no comfort to the public that it is being done correctly (quoting Tibble & Broadway, 24 Aug 1993 CNS News Ontario, reporting on the 1993 Canadian Medical Association Conference). p.99 A more suitable alternative (to the Dutch system) is to refer all such cases to a quasi-judicial tribunal that reviews applications for aid-in-dying. The onus would be on the patient to give evidence regarding his or her clinical condition, and consideration must be given to alternative treatments. The application would be completed with the assistance of a professionally trained aid-in-dying counsellor who would evaluate the applicant's ability to give informed consent and ensure that all relevant social, medical and psychiatric inrformation was included. Approved applicants would be issued an aid-in-dying licence, which would allow for voluntary euthanasia to be administered under medical supervision, but not necessarily by a physician. p.102 Individuals who choose to involve themselves in euthanasia and assisted suicide should be accountable for their decisions. The present legal climate, with its inconsistencies and confusion about killing versus allowing to die, imposes a barrier that precludes any accountability for justified killing. p.75 Mary contacted the Hemlock Society for help in planning Daniel's death, but found them to be of little help. She sought advice through AIDS Vancouver and the PWA Society and was told that they did not provide counselling with respect to euthanasia or assisted suicide. Finally Mary read some &quothow to" British publications that she found were oriented toward the dying person, with little emphasis on those who might assist. p.82 (case example where instructions from Goodbye Society and Final Exit failed to avoid a messy death).

Decisions about Enteral Tube Feeding among the Elderly. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 1993; 41:70-77. p.70 Advance-directive discussions about enteral tube feeding and other health care decisions, using understandable hypothetical clinical vignettes that describe risks and benefits that might influence decisions, should be encouraged in the practice of geriatric medicine. p.73 For the rapidly increasing numbers of people who will live into extreme old age with some degree of cognitive and/or physical impairment, certian types of decisions are probably more importamnt to address in an advance directive than others. p.73 Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among the extremely old and frail geriatric population, especially in nursing homes, may be viewed as moot because of the abysmal survival rate of CPR in this patient population. Decisions about enteral feeding, on the other hand, may be critical because more and more people are living to an age when self-feeding becomes problematic due to advanced dementia, stroke, Parkinson's disease or other conditions. p.73 ...it is possible to construct a clinical vignette about the decision to accept or forego enteral feeding that generally healthy and cognitively intact elderly people can comprehend and potentially use in making this difficult decision. p.74 The vignette format lends itself to a thorough explanation of risks and benefits. ...

There was a low rate of agreement between decisions made by the elderly participant and the decisions the potential proxies thought they would make. p.1371 ...of particular concern, is the rate of disagreement between the physicians and their elderly patients on the high-risk vignettes. P Palley C (1991) The United Kingdom and Human Rights. London: Sweet & Maxwell. p.70 ...rights, freedom and liberties function as "hoorah" words, necessarily implying wrongfulness by government for failing to create conditions necessary for their exercise. Such language becomes even more emotive when conjoined with adjectives such as immutable, inalienable, imprescriptible, fundamental and absolute, or with phrases such as "simple and uncontestable principles." p.71 Although such adjectives (and indeed nouns in seventeenth century usage) make for sloganising, they reflect significant characteristics of human rights and of legal and international rights, as well as aspects of political theory. p.72 The word "fundamental" as meaning foundation or basis had a long history and was first used by James I who used it in a Scots sense with reference to his right to succession. Subsequently the concept of "fundamental law" was regularly invoked from 1635 onwards in Charles I's struggle with Parliament. p.72 Fundamental law, taken in conjunction with the ideas of immutability and inalienability, was later translated in the British American colonies into new constitutional arrangements which were scarcely alterable because of the rigid procedures required for constitutional amendment. That is to say, the Constitution and fundamental rights were entrenched, so that their provisions constituted higher or fundamental law, putting them beyond the reach of passing legislatures, temporary expressions of popular sentiment and majority tyranny. The most recent development has been use of the term "absolute." It refers to the notion that fundamental rights are always binding in all circumstances whatsoever. Modern international human rights Conventions have adopted this notion... Such Conventions can in consequence cause problems for Governments. p.78 ...attacks on the good faith of those who disagree, and claims to infallibility, will, by strengthening the spirit of faction, delay incremental, let alone institutional, change.

Confucian ethics is a form of virtue ethics with a strong deontological basis. p.70 ...after ...a popular program called &quotHalf Hour at Noon," Central People's Broadcasting Station received more than 1,000 letters from its audience all over China; 85% of them favoured some form of euthanasia... p.70 There are two Chinese translations of the word &quoteuthanasia": anlesi, which means peaceful and happy dying, and wutongzhisi, which means painless killing. The first is the more widely accepted. p.71 Most Chinese ethicists argue that the principles of beneficence, autonomy, and justice can be applied to justify euthanasia in certain circumstances. p.71 There have been cases in which patients committed suicide by hanging themselves, or have cut an artery with a knife, or have jumped from a window after their request to withdraw treatment was refused.

(also discusses and lists proposed safeguards) p.1381 Approximately 6000 deaths per day in the United States are said to be in some way planned or indirectly assisted, probably through the &quotdouble effect" of pain-relieving medications that may at the same time hasten death or the discontinuation of or failure to start potentially life-prolonging treatments. p.1382 In physician-assisted suicide, a lethal amount of medication is usually prescribed that the patient then ingests. Since this process has been largely covert and unstudied, little is known about which methods are the most humane and effective. p.1383 The most pressing problem is the potential abandonment of competent, incurably ill patients who yearn for death despite comprehensive comfort care. p.1383 Physicians who respond to requests for assisted suicide from such patients do so at substantial professional and legal peril, ofetn acting in secret without the benefit and support from colleagues. This covert practice discourages open and honest communication among physicians, their colleagues, and their dying patients. Decisions often depend more on the physician's values and willingness to take risks than on the compelling nature of the patient's request. There may be more risk of abuse and idiosyncratic decision making with such secret practices than with a more open, carefully defined practice. Finally, terminally ill patients who do not choose to take their own lives often die alone so as not to place their families or caregivers in legal jeopardy. p.1383 ...there is more risk for vulnerable patients and for the integrity of the profession in such hidden practices, however well intended, than there would be in a more open process restricted to competent patients who met carefully defined criteria.

The intervention group was randomized to receive an educational brochure and encouragement to execute durable health care proxies. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group with completed durable health care proxies on file in their primary physicians' offices. p.2202 Subgroup analysis of elderly patients also revealed no intervention effect. Univariate analysis revealed three significant predictors of patients' proxy completion: patient age, whether patients had discussed directives in hospital with their physicians, and whether patients' physicians completed proxies for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that these three variables interact to predict the probability of patients' executing proxies. Reno J.

Second, the assistant may be abusive by eliminating opportunities for the suicidant to change his mind.

Canadian Medical Association 1993; 148(9): 1497-1502. p.1497 The perceived barriers to completing an advance directive were inability to write, the belief that an advance directive was unnecessary, a fatalistic attitude, previous discussion of preferences, a desire to leave the decision to doctors, uncertainty about preferences, a desire to discuss preferences rather than document them, a desire to wait until the situation arose, a desire to write down preferences in the future and a desire to avoid thinking about preferences or advance directives. p.1497 Respondents with more knowledge of life-sustaining treatments were more likely to want to complete an advance directive. p.1499 Fifty-one (49%) preferred proxy directives, 9 (9%) instruction directives, 25 (24%) both types and 5 (5%) neither; 15 (14%) were not sure what type of directive they preferred.

Treatment Limitation Decisions under Uncertianty: The Value of Subsequent Euthanasia. Bioethics 1994; 8(1):49-73. p.49 With treatment, a patient may recover such that he no longer requires life-supporting treatment. However, his life may be not worth living. If active euthanasia of "non-terminal" patients is prohibited, the option of dying will no longer be available. p.52 Paradoxically, patients are allowed to die when they are (or would be) very uncertain about the nature of the final outcomes of treatment, but are not allowed to die when it becomes clearer what the nature of their options are. p.52 Critically ill patients are allowed to die because it is believed that future disabled life is not in their interests. However, there may be considerable uncertainty about the nature of outcomes. While this may be the best guess of what life will be like in the future, it may also be a blind guess. It is likely that some patients are allowed to die when there is some objective chance of a worthwhile future life. p.71 When treating critically ill incompetent patients, it is commonly argued that we ought to aim to treat the patient as he would rationally desire, or according to his best interests. However, ther is often extreme uncertainty at three levels concerning the outcomes of treatment of critically ill incompetent patients: 1. uncertainty about outcomes and their probabilities. 2. uncertianty about whether this patient would prefer this particular outcome and to what degree he would prefer it. 3. uncertainty about whether an outcome is in the patient's best interests.In critically ill competent patients, there is often uncertainty as to whether this patient wants to be treated. In the face of such uncertianty, subsequent euthanasia can be a valuable prescription for critically ill patients. It allows us to correct the error of treating those whose lives turn out to be not worth living. It also allows us to treat more of those whose lives might be worth living, without the fear that we might be committing them to a miserable existence. p.72 Paradoxically, it is only with the possibility of death that we can rationally save more worthwhile lives.

In the eyes of the law acts of omission and commission directed at the hastening of death are the same.The definitions for euthanasia and assisted suicide in use in the Netherlands are defined by the State Commission on Euthanasia: &quotEuthanasia is the intentional termination of life by somebody other than the person concerned at his or her request.

Nothing, of course, can substitute for thoughtful, timely, and, perhaps, repeated discussions recorded in detail in the patient's medical record. Unfortunately, the reality of medical practice makes it likely that such information will be overlooked. (CF MILESTONE HOUSE) (CONCLUDED:) The brief general instruction component of the California DPAHC is not helpful in communicating patient wishes regarding specific life-saving procedures. p.2120 Patients often are not equipped to make well-informed judgements on the basis of their limited medical knowledge, and asking them to complete a checklist of procedures may direct attention away from more important issues of values and goals. p.2120 ...we suggest that advance directive instruments should be developed that enable patients to express their wishes in terms of quality of life under varying clinical states. p.2120 The rationale is that patients are fully capable of knowing and expressing their wishes with respect to conditions under which they would prefer not to be kept alive and that physicians, through their training and experience, are best able to understand which treatments (or lack of treatments) best meet their patients' wishes.

Rather the right question, framed in the context of this particular constitutional challenge, is whether an absolute ban on the use of physician-prescribed medications by a terminally ill person to hasten that person's inevitable death, if and when the person chooses to do so, is an &quotundue burden" on the person's &quotliberty" interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, and so is unconstitutional.

Shavelson, L. A Chosen Death: The Dying Confront Assisted Suicide, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1995. p. 26 "The science surrounding suicide for the terminally ill is an all-anecdotal, and dangerously inexact. Clouded by secrecy, no precise body of medical knowledge has evolved about the best methods for ending the life of someone suffering from a terminal illness." p. 40. "Virtually everyone with a terminal illness who decided to take their life (and many who decide not to) fits the clinical guide-lines that would allow a psychiatrist to label them depressed, yet the depression of someone with a terminal illness is complexly different from the classical psychological illness." p. 66. "...for the majority of people who are dying, it will be sufficient merely to know that assistance is available. They will rest assured of comfort as they progress to their natural deaths, perhaps never needing the fatal dose that is ready." p. 103. "The present prohibition against legal assistance in suicide has guaranteed that not a single physician has ever assisted in the death of a patient while following set rules, nor under the observation of her peers, nor under the watchful eyes of the law. Yet surveys of doctors have found that up to 37% have, in secrecy, aided in the death of a terminally ill patient. While the public expresses fear of abuse of assisted suicide, no one is overseeing those physicians who have already made aid in suicide part of their medical practice." Short D. Difficult Patients. British Journal of Hospital Medicine 1994; 51(3):128-130. Failure of the patient to respond to treatment tends to make the doctor regard that patient as difficult. The doctor feels a sense of failure, and is inclined to suspect the patient of not having adhered to the prescribed regimen. Simmonds N. Rights, Socialism and Liberalism.

Canadian Medical Association Journal 1992; 146(2): 127-134. p.129 Value-based directives maybe easier for patients to complete, because they do not require a knowledge of health problems or medical treatments. However, preference-based directives may be easier for health care professionals to interpret and implement, because they provide more explicit directions regarding treatment. It is difficult to know how to balance these conflicting goals. Since values and preferences represent fundamentally different, but complementary, approaches, instruction directives should contain both these components. Skegg P.

See: R. v. Hyam [1975] AC 55,73. p.131 It is widely accepted that if there was no other way to assuage pain, a doctor would be morally justified in administering a pain-killing drug to a patient whose death was imminent, even if he believed that the drug might have the incidental effect of hastening death.

Journal of Medical Ethics 1992 (Supplement); 18:1-22. p.6 Where a patient has lost the capacity to make decisions but has given a valid advance directive to refuse treatment and/or has appointed a representative to make decisions about refusal of treatment, such directives and decisions should be res[pected by doctors and other health-care workers. p.6 Patients having decision-making capacity who are severely and irremediably suffering from incurable diseases sometimes ask for assistance in dying. Such requests for active termination of life by a medical act which directly and intentionally causes death may be morally justifiable and should be given serious consideration. p.7 The term 'decision-making capacity' was chosen instead of 'competent' because the latter has different meanings, legal and non-legal, in different countries.

Forty-five per cent were in favour of legalisation of active euthanasia under certain circumstances. p.43 In response to the question: &quotHave you ever taken active steps which have brought about the death of a patient" which was aked of all respondents, 19 per cent said yes (56 respondents). p.45 The legal ambiguity of the current situation means that patients are often subject to the ethical and moral codes of individual doctors when decisions are made. p.45 These and previous findings suggest, firstly, that alteration or clarification of the law would not necessarily change the practices of individual medical practitioners, and secondly, that questions of legality are currently not the principal considerations used when making decisions to withhold or withdraw treatment to terminate the lives of patients.

SUPPORT stands for 'Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments.' See also: Jama editorial on this article: Lo, B. Improving Care Near the End of Life) p.1591 Objectives.- To improve end-of-life decision making and reduce the frequency of a mechanically supported, painful, and prolonged process of dying. p.1591 Patients.- A total of 9105 adults hospitalized with one or more of nine life-threatening diagnoses; an overall 6-month mortality rate of 47%. p.1591 Results.- The Phase I observation documented shoprtcomings in communication, frequency of aggressive treatment, and the characteristics of hospital death: only 47% of physicians knew when their patients preferred to avopid CPR; 46% of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were written within 2 days of death; 38% of patients who died spent at least 10 days in an intensive care unit (ICU); and for 50% of conscious patients who died in the hospital, family members reported moderate to severe pain at least half the time. p.1591 Enhancing opportunities for more patient-physician communication, although advocated as a major method for improving patient outcomes, may be inadequate to change established practices. p.1594 Thirty-one percent of phase I patients with interviews preferred that CPR be withheld, but only 47% of their physicians accurately reported this preference during the first interview. Nearly half (49%) of the 960 phase I patients who indicated a desire for CPR to be withheld did not have a DNR order written during that hospitalization. Nearly one third of these patients (278[29%]) died before discharge. p.1594 In interviews conducted after a patient died, surrogates indicated that 50% of all conscious phase I patients who died in the hospital experienced moderate or severe pain at least half the time during their last 3 days of life. p.1595 Families reported that half of the patients who were able to communicate in their last few days spent most of their time in moderate or severe pain. p.1595 Based on a study in a defined population at our Wisconsin site, we estimate that patients meeting SUPPORT criteria account for approximately 400,000 admissions per year in the United States and that another 925,000 people are similarly ill but would not meet SUPPORT entry requirements of being hospitalized or in intensive care. Patients with SUPPORT illnesses and severity account for about 40% of persons dying in the defined population. p.1596 Can enhanced decision making improve the experience of seriously ill and dying patients? p.1596 Because there was no movement toward what would seem to be better practices, one could conclude that physicians, patients, and families are fairly comfortable with the current situation. Certainly, most patients and families indicated they were satisfied, no matter what happened to them. p.1596 Physicians have their established patterns of care, and while they were willing to have the SUPPORT nurse present and carrying on conversations, physician behavious appeared unchanged. Perhaps physicians and patients in this study acknowledged problems with the care of seriously ill patients as a group. However, when involved with their own situation or engaged in the care of their individual patients, they felt they were doing the best they could, were satisfied they were doing well, and did not wish to directly confront problems or face choices. p.1596 The study certainly casts a pall over any claim that, if the health care system is given additional resources for collaborative decision making in the form of skilled professional time, improvements will occur. In phase II of SUPPORT, improved information, enhanced conversation, and an explicit effort to encourage use of outcome data and preferences in decision making were completely ineffectual, despite the fact that the study had enough power to detect small effects. p.1596 The five hospitals had been chosen for their diversity and their willingness to undertake a substantial and controversial challenge. Yet none showed a tendency toward improvement in these outcomes. p.1597 In conclusion, we are left with a troubling situation. the picture we describe of the care of seriously ill or dying persons is not attractive. One would certainly prefer to envision that, when confronted with life-threatening illnesses, the patient and family would be included in discussions, realistic estimates of outcome would be valued, pain would be treated, and dying would not be prolonged. That is still a worthy vision. However, it is not likely to be achieved through an intervention such as that implemented by SUPPORT. Success will require reexamination of our individual and collective commitment to these goals, more creative efforts at shaping the treatment process, and, perhaps, more proactive and forceful attempts at change.

Close family members performed slightly better than physicians in reflecting the elderly person's wishes. p.59 Even if the appointed person cannot more accurately represent the elderly person's wishes regarding medical treatment, their wishes are being honoured in one respect: the person they prefer is the one making decisions for them. p.59 ...the major ethical argument in favour of durable power of attorney has been that such appointed agents would be best able to represent the values of the principal... To the extent that such an appointment does not increase the likelihood that the patient's wishes will be carried out, the ethical attractiveness of this mechanism is considerably diminished. p.60 Clearly, if substituted judgement is the ideal standard of choice for proxy medical treatment decisions, then decision makers should be asked to make the decisions they believe the elderly person would want for themsleves. The study results show that this is not a vain or merely symbolic exercise. Tribe D, Korgaonkar G. Withdrawal of Medical Treatment. Journal of the Medical Defence Union (1993) 2:42-44.

Recent reports, however, have diminished this empirical uncertainty. p.1346 ...euthanasia is defined as someone other than the patient intentionally ending the life of a patient at the patient's request. p.1346 Many patients (40%) die at home, especially patinets with cancer (48% of all cancer deaths). p.1346 Almost all patients (99.4%) have health care insurance, and 100% of the population is insured for the cost of protracted illness. There are no financial incentives for hospitals, physicians, or family members to stop the care of patients. Moreover, the legal right of patients to health care on the basis of their insurance will override budget and other financial agreements. p.1347 ...euthanasia occurs at home in one of about 25 deaths, in hospitals in one out of 75, and in nursing homes in one out of 800.

After receiving CPR information, both groups changed their preferences such that intergroup differencves were no longer seen. p.171 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation information can influence preferences even among persons with living wills, implying that preferences are neither fixed nor always based on adequate information.

If such a patient acts on the wish for death and actually commits suicide, it is ethical for a physician who knows the patient well to refrain from an attempt at resuscitation. Ward B, Tate P. Attitudes among NHS doctors to Requests for Euthanasia. British Medical Journal 1994; 308:1332-1334. p.1332 For the benefit of both patients and doctors euthanasia should be discussed more openly. p.1333 A sizeable proportion of doctors are asked by their patients to hasten their deaths - 60% in this study, 40% of Australian medical practitioners, and 75% of Dutch family doctors. p.1333 ...32% of doctors who had faced a request for active euthanasia reported that they had complied with such a request. This proportion is comparable to the 29% of doctors in an Australian study who said that they had taken active steps to end a patient's life. p.1334 ...the current law on euthanasia is not satisfactory for patients. Patients may be aware that, although they may request active euthanasia, doctors cannot provide it legally; indeed, to raise this issue may be thought to compromise their relationship with the doctor. Conversely, remaining silent may also affect this relationship. A doctor may think that he or she cannot raise the issue for personal, professional, or legal reasons, and so communication between doctors and patients may be blocked. p.1334 ...the fact that active euthanasia is illegal may deprive dooctors of access to sources of adequate and effective advice and support, both professional and personal. Watts D, Howell T. Assisted Suicide is Not Voluntary Active Euthanasia. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 1992; 40(10): 1043-1046. p.1043 Assisted suicide involves several possible levels of assistance: providing information, for example, may mean providing toxicological information or describing techniques by which soemone may commit suicide; providing the means can involve written prescriptions for lethal amounts of medication; supervising or directly aiding includes inserting an intravenous line and instructing on starting a lethal infusion. p.1044 By opening the door for counseling or treatment of reversible conditions, requests for assisted suicide might actually lead to averting some suicides which would otherwise have occurred.

Law Medicine & Health Care. 1992; 20(1-2):116-126. p.121 A decision made by a patient to forgo mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, or some other life-sustaining treatment involves the negative right (or liberty right) of treatment refusal. A correlate of this negative right is the obligation of the patient's physician not to interfere with or thwart that negative right unless the physician has some overriding obligation of another sort. By contrast, a request by a patient for a physician's assistance in committing suicide can be interpreted as involving a positive right (or welfare right), or at least a claim to that effect. The difference is important: the patient does not merely request to be left alone by the physician, but tries to impose a moral obligation on the physician to help the patient accomplish the desired end of self-destruction. That claim, whether based on merit or need, is weak, and certainly need not be regarded as imposing an obligation on the physician who receives it. Wellman C. The Inalienable RIght to Life and the Durable Power of Attorney. Law and Philosophy (1995) 14:245-269. p.247 Our language of rights is theoretically misleading and unnecessarily controversial in practice because of the way in which we use simple labels or abstract phrases to refer to complex specific rights. What we normally call "the right to life" is almost certainly a rights-package, a cluster of very different rights bundled together because they all concern, in one way or another, someone's life. [these he enumerates as, 247-249:] A moral claim-right not to be killed by another A moral claim-right that others not endanger one's life A moral liberty-right to defend one's life with all necessary force A moral liberty-right to defend one's life with all necessary force A moral liberty-right to preserve one's life by any necessary means A moral claim-right to be rescued from the danger of death A moral liberty-right to risk one's life p.255 There are at least two moral reasons that ground the duty not to kill a human being. One is that the act of killing a human normally results in grievous harm, the loss of a life and thereby the loss of every other value that constitutes that person's well-being. p.255-256 Another duty-imposing reason is that the act of killing someone is highly invasive; it intrudes into one's life in a disruptive manner and thereby invades the most private zones of the self. The fact that the act of killing a human is harmful and intrusive are specifically moral reasons because they are reasons both for an agent to refrain from acting in that manner and reasons for anyone in society with that agent to react negatively if the agent acts contrary to those reasons. They are reasons for others to act negatively to the killer because his act of killing reveals him to be one who is at least callous and probably hostile and malicious as well as arrogant in the sense of arrogating to himself another's choice whether to live or die. p.261 When a patient has given consent to medical treatment, that treatment is much less invasive and intrusive because it is friendly rather than hostile and welcome rather than unwelcome. Wells C. Patients, Consent and Criminal Law. Journal of Social Welfare and Family Law 1994; 1:65-78. p.65 It has been estimated that there could be 10,000 cases of assisted euthanasia in the United Kingdom each year. p.75 ...there is a need to expose the hidden relationship between motive and criminal culpability and to give critical thought to that between homicide, assisting suicide and euthanasia.

Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics (1992) 2:107-115. p.109 Interpreting advance directives, particularly in the light of prognostic uncertainty, can be complex. p.109 The anxiety of implementing advance directives only underscores the need for efficient and sensitive communication between the patient and the proxy, and the proxy and the physician. p.112 In many Chinese and Japanese communities, autonomy has different connotations. In these communities, &quotautonomy" is to be expressed by the family as a whole rather than by a single designated proxy. p.112 Truthtelling also holds differing levels of importance in different cultures. p.112 ...Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Lebanese families who have conspired to keep elderly patients in ignorance of their true diagnosis - principally out of respect. p.113 Our concern is that indiscriminately posing the same set of questions about advance directives to every patient is entirely likely to inflict unnecessary emotional pain on some; the mentally ill, the elderly, and pregnant women are just a few examples. Z Zweibel N, Cassel C. Treatment Choices at the End of Life: A Comparison of Decisions by Older Patients and Their Physician-Selected Proxies. Gerontologist 1989; 29(5): 615-621. p.615 The proportion of respondents reporting having written a living will varied from 4% in the study population reported in this research (Cassel & Zweibel 1987) to 15% in a telephone survey of a random sample of adults conducted by the American Medical Association (Wall Street Journal, 1988) to 17.5% in a sample of older adult research volunteers (High 1988). p.618 ...the proportion of pairs in which the patient would want the proxy to make a decision opposite the one the proxy reported she would make ranges from 24% for tube feeding up to 44% and 50% respectively for resuscitation and chemotherapy. p.620 Our findings on preferences for resuscitation tend to support those of Uhlmann and colleagues in the only other study examining the ability of proxies to predict patient preferences for life-sustaining treatment. In both studies, proxies were often unable to accurately report patient treatment preferences. Copyright © 1995-6 Chris Docker.

The Title is based on the series of articlesin the Canadian journal "Last Rights" in which some of the chaptersinitially appeared. Beyond Final Exit explains... the history of suicide guidesand the reliability (and unreliability) of information in them. Dispels the myth that a leading, lethal, over-the-counter drugcan cause blindness in the event of failure, discusses the lethal doseand the supporting evidence. Analyses the use of tricyclic antidepressants, frequently prescribeddrugs that can be lethal alone or in combination. Discusses street drugs - illicit drugs bought on theblack market - should they be used for self-deliverance if you get accessto them? Answers common questions about poisonous plants - if you'reoptimistic about these, be warned of the side effects first! What about carbon monoxide? The favourite method of Dr Kevorkian?Beyond Final Exit looks at its effectiveness and obtaining supplies, andthere is also a chapter on other inert gases worth considering. Fasting? In Departing Drugs there is only a passing referenceto controlled fasting as a means of self-deliverance. .Manypeople have used this method successfully and yet it is not without itscritics. Beyond Final Exit includes what is probably the most comprehensiveexamination of the known facts on this method New information has come to light in recent years on barbiturateswere virtually discontinued twenty years ago but some people have old suppliesor manage to obtain them and want to know the dosages and effectiveness.and, in this new volume, Beyond Final Exit takes a fresh look atthe evidence. The International Drugs Consensus Working Party published thefruits of their research in Departing Drugs - the Supplementto How to Die With Dignity, and many people wanted to know the reasoningbehind some of the controversial new developments, so a scientific companionwas planned. While in preparation, more research was accomplished and newinformation brought to light. Self deliverance guides were pioneeredby the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland with How to Die WithDignity in 1980; they were popularised by Derek Humphry in his best-sellerFinal Exit and placed on a scientific footing with DepartingDrugs. Now, in 1995, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society proudlypresents Beyond Final Exit, the latest research into self-deliverance. Supported by hundreds of references to supporting data, BeyondFinal Exit bares its finding to scrutiny by other researchers worldwide.It is already the subject of strong interest from the Netherlands, whereself-deliverance (in preference to doctor-administered euthanasia) is gainingground. Beyond Final Exit gives you the facts and the secure knowledge on methodsof self-deliverance. Beyond Final Exit is already in its secondprinting. Order your copy now while stocks last.

We are very heartened by the results. It provides politicianswith the ammunition they need to approach such issues responsibly, andreach a compassionate response when all palliative options have been exhausted." *********************************************** Glasgow University: Glasgow University's Institute ofLaw & Ethics in Medicine today released the results of its year-longintensive study into the pros and cons of the physician-assisted suicidedebate. The Report, called Sometimes a Small Victory, which is over 200pages long, includes a thorough examination of the relevant legal, medicaland ethical dilemmas, together with two surveys that reveal current feelingsof the public at large and also within the medical profession. Concluding that people wish to see the issues debatedand many would welcome legal change, the report includes a draft Bill whichthe researchers call a "legislative template" for moving forward. Highlights: The Report disagrees with the House of LordsSelect Committee on Medical Ethics, and says: "...the arguments againstlegislation are not of sufficient weight to tip the scales against thearguments in favour, but they must be accorded consideration in the draftingof any legislation which would produce change. This is no easy task, butone which must be undertaken." Surveys: When asked about preferred methods, 42% preferredvoluntary euthanasia and 28% assisted suicide (22% had no preference).In a separate, postal survey of UK medical practitioners and pharmacists,54% were in favour of a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicideto take place in specific circumstances, with only 36% against. 60% ofthe 1000 practitioners who responded had treated a patient who was consideringsuicide, 12% personally knew another health professional who had assisteda patient to kill themselves and 4% had themselves provided the means (suchas drugs or information about lethal acts) to assist a patient to killthemselves. One interesting finding of the second study was that mostmedical practitioners found physician-assisted suicide preferable to voluntaryeuthanasia (43% in comparison to 19%), especially in view of the findingsin the first study which showed the public's preference for voluntary euthanasia. There was little by way of differences in the percentagesof hospital physicians, medical GPs, surgeons or psychiatrists favouringa change in the law - approximately 48% were in favour. This was in starkcontrast to the percentage of pharmacists in favour (72%) and anaesthetists(56%). Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the viewthat "if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctorsshould be allowed in law to assist." Definitions: Assisted suicide: this is where the personwho wants to die takes their own life with the help of a doctor who providesthe means of death: i.e., a prescription for drugs. It is the action ofthe person himself or herself which leads to their own death, at the timeand place of their choice. Voluntary euthanasia: this is where the persondecides they want to die and is helped to die by someone such as a doctoror other medical staff, friends or family. It is the actions of the otherperson that lead to death. *********************************************** SOMETIMES A SMALL VICTORY S. McLean, A.

Every human being has a legitimate interest in his or her owndeath and manner of dying. We believe in offering the individual some choice in orchestratingthat very personal time. For some, that choice will be to accept all possible treatments thatmodern technology can offer; for others, protecting quality of life before quantity may be themost important element, for others, it may be dying in a way that reflects their living, perhapsretaining some control over the dying process and maybe the time and circumstances ofdeath and, even if it is never used, holding the key to the door marked "Exit." Our record so far In 1980 the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland broke away from the English society tobecome independent and so publish How to Die With Dignity - the first self-deliverancemanual in the world. In 1993 we instigated the International Drugs Consensus Working Partyand published Departing Drugs, which was the first scientifically researched volume on thesubject. It has been reprinted in several languages around the globe. Both Departing Drugsand How to Die with Dignity were non-profit ventures and, in accordance with clear ethicalguidelines, not available to the general public or minors. From 1992 to 1995 we sponsoredresearch into living wills, clarifying the advantages and difficulties of such documents andproducing a leading new format that anticipated the British Medical Association's Code ofPractice. We published Collected Living Wills, the first international collection in the world. In1995 we introduced the use of Values Histories in this country, breaking down the barriers tothe use of living wills, and published Beyond Final Exit with essays on the latest research intoself-deliverance. Our aims To make dying with dignity an option available to anyone, to protect patients and doctors alikein upholding the humanity of dying well, to seek legal reform, where necessary, and tointroduce safeguards regarding voluntary euthanasia. A Short History of Important Events 1935 Formation of a voluntary euthanasia society in England (later known as "Exit" or "The Voluntary Euthanasia Society") by Lord Moynihan & Dr Killick Millard. 1936 King George V receives euthanasia from Lord Dawson unofficially. Voluntary Euthanasia Bill presented to the House of Lords: rejected. 1969 Voluntary Euthanasia Bill debated again in the Lords and again rejected. The term "living will" is coined by Luis Kutner to describe an advance refusal of medical treatment. 1973 Voluntary Euthanasia societies formed in the Netherlands. 1974 Dr George Mair publishes "Confessions of a Surgeon" giving details of voluntary euthanasia practised in a hospital. 1976 Voluntary Euthanasia societies formed in Japan and Germany. 1st international conference of voluntary euthanasia societies, in Tokyo. 1977 Dutch Medical Council officially accepts V.E. 1978 Derek Humphry's "Jean's Way" published in London, telling how his wife had made a pact with him to end her own life. 1979 British V.E. Society votes to publish a guide to self-deliverance. Membership quadruples. Publication delayed until 1981 by legal and other obstacles, and the book subsequently withdrawn after further legal problems. 1980 Scottish Exit (later known as VESS) assumes independence under the auspices of George Mair and Sheila Little, and publishes "How to Die With Dignity" - the first suicide guide to be published in the world. Official formation of the World Federation of Right-to-Die Societies. 1981 Nicholas Reed, of the English V.E. Society, is sentenced to prison for assisting suicides. A Rotterdam court states conditions under which aiding suicide and administering Voluntary Euthanasia will not lead to prosecution in the Netherlands. 1983 Legal worries over publication of the English Society's guide to self-deliverance continue. The Attorney General unsuccessfully seeks an injunction to prevent distribution. 1984 The Supreme Court of the Netherlands declares that V.E. is acceptable subject to ten clearly defined conditions. 1985 Lord Jenkins presents a Bill to the Lords to repeal a relevant clause of the English Suicide Act: defeated. 1990 Roland Boyes MP presents a Bill to Parliament for euthanasia: defeated. 1991 US Congress passes the "Patient Self-Determination Act", compelling hospitals to respect Living Wills. Derek Humphry's book on self-deliverance, "Final Exit," tops an American best-seller list for several weeks. Washington State Initiative Bill legalising voluntary euthanasia narrowly defeated. 1992 Dr Cox is tried for administering euthanasia to Mrs Boyes and receives a suspended sentence. The British Medical Association declares its support for living wills. 1993 The Law Lords allow the feeding tube of Tony Bland, who is in persistent vegetative state, to be removed. Sue Rodriguez, a young woman with Lou Gehrig's disease, seeks permission from the Supreme Court of Canada for assistance to die, and is refused by a narrow majority. Formation of the International Drugs Consensus Working Party and publication by VESS of "Departing Drugs," the first scientifically researched international self-deliverance guide. Formation of the House of Lords Select Committee to investigate euthanasia and living wills. 1994 First international collection of living wills published (by VESS). The Council of the British Medical Association declares support (in principle) for legislation regulating living wills. Oregon USA passes a law to allow doctors to prescribe lethal drugs, but an injunction prevents it from taking effect. 1995 The British Medical Association produce a Code of Practice on Living Wills. The Law Commission propose legislation covering living wills and health care proxies. VESS distributes a radical new living will form after much research, anticipating the BMA guidelines, and also introduces the values history document to the UK. The Irish Supreme Court decides that the feeding tube may be removed from a woman who has lain in a vegetative state for over 20 years, so that she may die. The case of Mrs Johnston, who has been in a coma for three years, is brought to the Scottish Courts to see if her feeding tube may be removed, allowing her to die. Northern Territory, Australia, passes the first law in the world to allow active voluntary euthanasia, allowing doctors to administer a lethal injection. The law is linked to improvement of palliative care and will takes some months before it is fully operational. Cases from history (An appeal by the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society) In March 1993 Anthony Bland had lain in persistent vegetative state for three yearsbefore a Court Order allowed his degradation and indignity to come to a mercifulclose. The judges said that if he had made a living will expressing his future wishes hecould have been allowed to die in peace earlier. The Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety is at the forefront of living will research in the UK. Your subscription willhelp to make a peaceful death through a living will a reality for anyone who desiresit. In 1992 Dr Cox openly defied the law and assented to 70 year old Mrs Boyes'persistent request for voluntary active euthanasia. Mrs Boyes' was so ill that she"screamed like a dog" if anyone touched her. Conventional medicine did not relieveher agony. In her last days, when she repeatedly requested to die, Dr Cox finally gaveher an injection of potassium chloride, bestowing on her the boon of a peaceful deathso many of us feel we are entitled to. Dr Cox, although given a suspended sentence,was hauled through the courts like a common criminal. We believe good doctorsacting in all conscience like Dr Cox, should be lauded, not vilified, and should havethe benefit of legally approved codes of conduct that embody consistent safeguardsagainst abuse. Together we should ensure that medicine and the law serve the patientand the citizen once more. Together, we can stand and be counted. And, from pooledresources, each small contribution will contribute to the powerful tidal wave that theScottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society can use to bring this about. Sue Rodriguez, a mother in her early thirties, died slowly of Lou Gehrig's disease. Shelived for several years with the knowledge that her muscles would, one by one, wasteaway until the day came when, fully conscious, she would choke to death. She beggedthe Courts to reassure her that a doctor would be allowed to assist her in choosingthe moment of death. They refused. She lived on in terror, helped eventually by adoctor who, in February 1994, covertly broke the law to help her die in peace. A lawon assisted suicide with rigorous safeguards could have saved her the nightmare duringthose months before her death, given her the confidence to carry on - with thereassurance that when it got too bad she could rely on a compassionate doctor tofollow her wishes at the end. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is pledged tosupport research for drafting the most thorough, yet feasible, assisted suicide Bill yetpresented to Parliament. Your support will make it happen. "Re C" A 68 year old prisoner of Jamaican origin had been diagnosed as suffering fromchronic paranoid schizophrenia and was treated with drugs and electro-convulsivetherapy. In September 1993 the prison doctors found he had gangrene in his rightleg. They felt his chance of survival with conventional treatment was no better than15%, and so recommended that his leg be amputated below the knee. The prisonerrefused amputation and received conventional treatment only. There was a likelihood,however, that gangrene would recur. The prisoner stated he would rather die on twolegs than live on one, and his solicitor asked the hospital to promise not to amputatein any circumstances without the prisoner's consent. They refused, and he sought acourt injunction to uphold his wishes. The court considered expert testimony in thecase (known as Re C) and found that, although the prisoner was suffering fromschizophrenia, there was nothing to suggest that he did not understand the nature,purpose and effects of treatment; he had understood, and, with a full knowledge thatdeath might result from refusing amputation, had clearly made his choice. The courtupheld the prisoner's right to make an advance refusal of treatment and granted aninjunction. The case paved the way for acceptance of advance refusals of medicaltreatments and so for living wills. Completion of a Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety living will document could save distressing and drawn-out court proceedings ifever you were incapacitated. Karen Ann Quinlan collapsed on April 15th, 1975. She was twenty-one years old.Within hours, she entered a coma from which she could never recover. Her parents,staunch Roman Catholics, knew their daughter would not want to be kept alive byextraordinary means. A year later, as Karen lay in a "persistent vegetative state," thecourts finally allowed her treatment to be stopped; but artificial feeding wascontinued and she was maintained as a living corpse until June 1985, when sheeventually died of pneumonia. Her case spurred thousands of letters of sympathy andfuelled the "right to die" movement. How many people need to die degrading deathsbefore society learns a little humanity? The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society iscommitted to research and teaching in these difficult areas. Help us to help you, andall those who would seek die with dignity and give you their heartfelt thanks. Ramon Sanpedro is currently seeking, through the courts, the assistance of a doctorto help him die with dignity. He was paralysed in Spain as a result of a swimmingaccident during his youth. He describes himself as "a head attached to a corpse." Hewrites: "Why die? Because every journey has its departure time and only the traveller has theprivilege and the right to choose the last day to get out. Why to die? Because at times thejourney of no return is the best path that reason can show us out of love and respect forlife, so that life may havea dignified death." Ramon Sanpedro makes no suggestion as to what the wishes of others in a similarphysical condition might be. In fact, some people who are so paralysed takeenjoyment in life and want to go on living. Their choice should be respected and theyshould be given every support. But Ramon Sanpedro has made his choice and hischoice should also be respected. We should seek to ensure that the rights of theindividual are always respected without allowing others to feel endangered orpressurised. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society provides international technicaland informational support. With your help, we can make the world a better place. Nancy Cruzan lost control of her car one day in January 1983 in Missouri. When theparamedics arrived, they were able to restore her breathing and heartbeat and she wastransported, unconscious, to hospital. She continued to be fed through a surgically-implanted gastrostomy tube. After several years, a court found that, although herrespiration and circulation continued unaided, she was oblivious to her surroundingsexcept for reflexive responses to sound and perhaps painful stimuli; her brain haddegenerated, irreversibly; she was a spastic quadriplegic; she suffered contraction ofher four extremities, with irreversible muscle and tendon damage; and had nocognitive or reflex ability to swallow food or water or to maintain her essential dailyneeds nor would she ever recover such an ability. She lay in persistent vegetative stateeven though she had told her housemate that, if sick or injured, she would not wishto continue her life unless she could live "at least halfway normal." This was the firsttime the U.S. Supreme Court had been faced with what we call the "right to die."They said that Missouri had "arrogated to itself" the power to define life, and NancyCruzan's life and liberty consequently put into disquieting conflict. She had not madea living will, and the court case paved the way for a uniform, national Patient Self-Determination Act that regulated living wills and made them more widely available.The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is campaigning for uniform UK reform tomake living wills more widely available. Your help can make it a reality. 57 year old Georgette Malette, in the early afternoon of June 30th, 1979, wasrushed, unconscious, by ambulance, to hospital. The car in which she was a passenger,driven by her husband, had collided with a truck. Her husband had been killed; shehad suffered serious injuries. She was a Jehovah's Witness and carried a card statingher firm conviction that no blood or blood products should be administered to herunder any circumstances. The doctor treating her ignored the card and gave her ablood transfusion which he decided was medically indicated. In June 1980 MrsMalette brought charges against Dr Shulman. The judge found that Mrs Malette hadsuffered emotionally and mentally and ordered substantial costs to be paid. It madeno difference that the medical team didn't agree with her beliefs. Her advance refusalof treatment was unambiguous. Unfortunately, living wills tend to be far less clearcut, dealing with a wide range of circumstances in which interpretation is sometimesnecessary. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is at the forefront of researchinto living wills and other ways of having your wishes respected at the end of life.Public support will help us to help make dying more dignified for all those who wantto retain some control and self-respect in their dying phase. When her case came to trial, Claire Conroy was unable to move from a semi-fetalposition. She was severely demented, had heart disease, hypertension and diabetes andher left leg was gangrenous to the knee; she had sores, couldn't speak, had only alimited ability to swallow, and had eye problems; she had a urinary catheter in placeand was unable to control her bowels. She was able to moan and scratch, andoccasionally smile when someone combed her hair. Claire Conroy eventually diedbefore the courts were able to decide what to do. She was not a candidate forvoluntary euthanasia. She had not made a living will. But her case posed veryworrying dilemmas about end of life decisions. Pushing difficult deaths to one sidewill not make them go away or make them any easier. The Scottish VoluntaryEuthanasia Society encourages open discussion of the problems increasingly facing usin society. We care, and we listen with an open mind. We ask you to work with us sothat every person can die with dignity in the way that he or she would choose. LIVING WILLS The law favours patients being able to make their own decisions about health care, but thepracticality of ensuring this is far from clear. Living wills are an attempt to implement this with respect to refusal of certain medical treatments (such as resuscitation) should certain states of incompetence arise (such as coma, persistent vegetative state, heavy sedation or advanced dementia). Difficult medical decisions may need to be taken when the patient is unable to speak for him or herself. With little or no possibility of recovery, would you want measures that might only prolong the dying process - possibly to a more distressing conclusion than might be achieved without active treatment? The advance instructions of the patient for such eventualities are invaluable, and may be formalised into a written document or "living will." Living wills are perfectly lawful, and encouraged by parliament, the British Medical Association and the Law Commission; they have little or nothing to do with active voluntary euthanasia, which is at present illegal; but the voluntary euthanasia societies, from a humanitarian interest in the dying process, are involved with the promulgation of living wills, in addition to campaigning for reform on active voluntary euthanasia. Living wills accord with the present law and good medical practice Living wills do not authorise active voluntary euthanasia Living wills do not ask a doctor to perform anything that is illegal or against good medical practice Living wills are supported by all major professional medical and nursing bodies Many organisations produce living will documents - some are better than others - some are misleading and are better avoided see: living will packsFor further reading on living wills, see under the A-Z Index section on living wills. What do we mean by self-deliverance? In Britain, even if you have exhausted all other options and despite sincerelyrequesting it, the humane assistance of a doctor to bring your death a little closer isneither something you can count on nor something tolerated by law.Hopefully you would never want someone to do that anyway - most terminal sufferingcan be relieved these days - but if you were one of the unlucky ones whose sufferingcouldn't be relieved, what consolation is it to know that the law might be changedlong after you're dead? Probably not a lot. But a doctor or friend helping you (oreven being in the same room with you) when you decide to end your life could resultin a criminal prosecution for the survivor. In a country where voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide are unregulated andillegal, the only real option for some people can be, sadly, to commit suicide. TheEnglish language is short on words to distinguish between different types of suicide.The word "suicide" can be used to cover the irrational self-killing of a lonely teenagerwho is suffering temporary emotional depression. But take the death of a 93 year oldman suffering unrelievable indignities from a terminal illness who calmly decides to goout on his own terms, at his own time and choosing: suicide hardly seems to describeit, and so the term "self-deliverance" has gradually come into popular usage. SO IF PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE SELF-DELIVERANCE, SURELY THERE'S NO NEEDFOR VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA?Unfortunately it isn't quite that simple. There are many ways that people die, butvery few completely reliable ways. In the case of a suicidally-depressed teenager, it isperhaps a good thing that a lot of attempts fail; but failure in the case of a rationalattempt - to leave an existence of unbearable suffering - only adds trauma and a senseof inability to the unrelievable problems which motivated the attempt. The horrors offailed rational suicides have been well documented by writers such as Russel Ogdenand Lonny Shavelson. BUT IF YOU MAKE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHONEED IT, WHAT IF IT GETS INTO THE WRONG HANDS?Someone who is determined to find ways to end his or her own life will probablyunearth all the known information from newspapers, crime stories and medicallibraries. Depressed people may not even bother researching the ways - they maychoose violent methods such as crashing a motor-car or jumping off a cliff (thougheven these methods are not completely foolproof). But for rational self-deliverance,such means are abhorrent - a life of dignity and self-control reflects consideration forother people and the memories one leaves behind. Drugs or car exhausts are moreoften the method of choice.There has been for a number of years a best-selling book on methods of self-deliverance called "Final Exit." The book is easily purchased from almost anybookstore. Although the success of the book has drawn valuable public attention tothe desperate need for such information, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Societydoes not believe that such open dissemination of this type of literature is desirable.We seek to discourage irrational suicide that is a result of transient emotionaldepression; but, especially since physician-assisted suicide is not an option in thiscountry, we believe that competent adults should still have some say in timing theirdeath if they so wish.For the vast majority, knowing that one can choose the door marked "Exit" if thingsget too bad is an immense comfort and reassurance. That reassurance, however, isnothing but false hope if the information is faulty. THE SCOTTISH VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA SOCIETY - PIONEERS IN SELF-DELIVERANCEIn July 1979, Exit - then the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Great Britain) decided that abook on how to end one's own life would be a good idea. After announcing theirintention, membership rose at a rate of 1,000 a month from an initial 2,000. Thefollowing year however, concerned over conflicting legal opinions, they decided notto publish. The Scottish Branch voted to become independent in order to publish andso, in 1980, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Scottish Exit) became thefirst right to die society in the world to publish such a booklet for its members. Itwas called "How to Die With Dignity." The booklet was based on the opinions of asingle doctor and contained many errors, as have subsequent books, and so eventuallyin 1993 an International Drugs Consensus Working Party met at the Society'sheadquarters to finalise a scientifically researched volume called "Departing Drugs."The academic foundations were published in a later work called "Beyond Final Exit",and the legality of publication examined by the Scottish Regius Professor of Law,Joseph Thomson. The booklet was compiled and distributed as a non-profit venture and, unlike FinalExit, available not from bookshops but only by formal application to the Society.Before the book was issued, one of the rules was that any purchaser must have been amember of a right to die society for at least three months, so discouragingirresponsible or ill-considered use of its contents. The Society also reserves the right torefuse to sell it - something an assistant in a bookshop is unable to do with the"popular" guides. We take our responsibilities very seriously. Most members whopurchase the booklet are in excellent health and are simply wanting a sort ofinsurance for their dying years, months or days. But if an individual seems suicidal wealways offer counselling or referral to a support group. DO PEOPLE USE SELF-DELIVERANCE IN THE NETHERLANDS?When a person has made a successful request for voluntary euthanasia, doctors oftenfavour allowing the patient to take the final, lethal medicine him or herself, as a finalact of will. Departing Drugs is currently being translated into Dutch (as it has beentranslated into Spanish, German and French). However, only a few patients arephysically able to do so by the time they want their final release. For those that are,there is the added assurance that the doctor will take over if anything goes wrong.Equally important, there is always the presence of a reassuring hand, whether of thedoctor, friends or relatives - all of whom may be present. It is a sad reflection on the society in which we live that people sometimes need todie alone and in secret. A humane law for voluntary euthanasia or physician-assistedsuicide would reduce the pressure on "self-deliverance." Until then, people are dying,often badly, and they deserve what help and support we can give them.

Every human being has a legitimateinterest in his or her own death and manner of dying. We believe in offeringthe individual some choice in orchestrating that very personal time. Forsome, that choice will be to accept all possible treatments that moderntechnology can offer; for others, protecting quality of life before quantitymay be the most important element, for others, it may be dying in a waythat reflects their living, perhaps retaining some control over the dyingprocess and maybe the time and circumstances of death and, even if it isnever used, holding the key to the door marked "Exit." Our record so far In 1980 the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland broke away fromthe English society to become independent and so publish How to Die WithDignity - the first self-deliverance manual in the world. In 1993 we instigatedthe International Drugs Consensus Working Party and published DepartingDrugs, which was the first scientifically researched volume onthe subject. It has been reprinted in several languages around the globe.Both Departing Drugs and How to Die with Dignity were non-profit venturesand, in accordance with clear ethical guidelines, not available to thegeneral public or minors. From 1992 to 1995 we sponsored research intoliving wills, clarifying the advantages and difficulties of such documentsand producing a leading new format that anticipated the British MedicalAssociation's Code of Practice. We published Collected Living Wills,the first international collection in the world. In 1995 we introducedthe use of Values Histories in this country, breaking down the barriersto the use of living wills, and published Beyond FinalExit with essays on the latest research into self-deliverance. Our aims To make dying with dignity an option available to anyone, to protectpatients and doctors alike in upholding the humanity of dying well, toseek legal reform, where necessary, and to introduce safeguards regardingvoluntary euthanasia.

BUT SURELY SUICIDE ISN'T ILLEGAL? HOW CAN I HELP PROTECT MY RIGHTS? I AM INTERESTED IN THE PRINCIPLES YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT- WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? 1. WHAT IS VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA? When we hear the phrase voluntary euthanasia peoplegenerally think of one of two things: the active termination of life atthe patient's request as it occurs in the Netherlands (or similar proposalsin other countries); or the Nazi extermination program of murder. Manypeople have beliefs about whether euthanasia is right or wrong,often without being able to define it clearly. Some people take an extremeview, while many fall somewhere between the two camps. Dictionary definitionsavail us little, as there will always be large groups of people that claimit means something else. The apparent derivation a gentle and easy death(from the Greek, eu - thanatos) hardly describes what we mean. Even extendingthe definition to include bringing about of this, especially in thecase of incurable and painful disease (Oxford English Dictionary) hardlycovers it - hospices often succeed in bringing about a peaceful death,but they don't perform euthanasia! In the Netherlands, the only country where euthanasiais openly practised, euthanasia is defined as "the intentional terminationof life by another at the explicit request of the person who dies"(Netherlands State Commission on Euthanasia). The argument then often centreson the voluntariness of the request. How can one be sure that it is voluntary?Supporters of the voluntary euthanasia movement generally believe that itwould be possible to devise sufficient safeguards to ensure that the requestwas voluntary and that people could never feel pressured. The Dutch are critical of their own system and are continuallyrefining and testing it - though generally they feel that it respects humanrights and is part of good medicine. They get rid of the word voluntarysince the explicit request is part of their definition of euthanasia.An explicit request is objectively observable, whereas voluntariness dependssomewhat on interpretation. (Some opponents of euthanasia suggest thatthe true will is impaired if one is asking to die and that therefore thereis no voluntariness. Most people would agree if the person was emotionallydistraught over, say, being jilted by a lover, or if the person was psychiatricallyof unsound mind, but most of us view more considered statements as voluntary,especially if we are unable to find any evidence to the contrary. Obviously the Dutch definition needs careful implementationto ensure voluntariness, and the Dutch attempt to do this by a seriesof safeguards within a close doctor-patient relationship, a high standardand availability of palliative care, and general public support. Thereis much debate over whether we could have a similar system in, say, Britain,but we feel that the present system is unsatisfactory and so we press forreform. One of the few certainties of life is death, but in thetwentieth century it is still a taboo subject. The "forbidden"nature of death adds to the unnamed fears and worries that most peoplefeel when asked to confront the idea of their own death. Yet once peoplecan overcome their reluctance to discuss the subject, most often what isrevealed is not the fear of death itself, but the manner of dying. Thedifficulty of thinking about "death with dignity" is that itimplies that one day you, or someone you love, may be in a position towant that choice. No one can prevent death finally, but we can and shouldensure that the dying process is a gentle and peaceful one. When life consistsof a few agonising, drugged weeks, many patients beg their doctors to helpthem die, and many doctors, mindful of the ethics of their profession,feel forced to refuse. Those who, out of compassion, accede to such a request,know they are breaking the law and putting their careers at risk. This is the dilemma which faces all of us now. Shouldwe, as potential patients, have the legal right to ask our doctors to helpus die when the end of life is in sight and our suffering severe? Back to Contents 2. WHY THE NEED FOR SOCIETIES? In England, The Voluntary Euthanasia Society was foundedin 1935 by the late Dr C. Killick Millard M.D., DSc. Its principal objectwas to make it legal for an adult person, who is suffering severe distressfrom an incurable illness, to receive medical help to die at their ownconsidered request. In 1980 Scottish Exit (now the Voluntary Euthanasia Societyof Scotland or VESS) became an independent group, and published "Howto Die With Dignity". This booklet, by Dr George Mair, was the firstguide to self deliverance in the world. An updated version, together withthe well-researched modern supplement "Departing Drugs," is stillavailable to members of at least three months' standing, as long as theyspecifically request it. Members can receive the booklet in Scotland, Englandor anywhere in the world. VESS also acts as a centre and focus for researchconcerning medical decisions at the end of life, and particularly livingwills. The VESS Newsletter is considered a leading source of information.VESS can provide information and support to members of the public, doctors,lawyers, educational institutions and students, politicians and the media.Individuals should note, however, that while seeking a change of the law,we will only act within the law as it stands. The history of reform shows that humane and well-arguedproposals only tend to pass into law when there is a strong public voicebehind them. The people who struggle against inhumanity make their markby creating a better world. We can't help those who have died in abjectsuffering, but we can work for the good of those whose death is yet tocome - not only by striving for better, caring services, but by restoringcontrol to the individual who has entered the last phase of life. Back to Contents 3. IS THERE GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE MOVEMENT? A National Opinion Poll, in April 1993, showed that 81% ofScots agree with our aims for a change in the law. A phone-in after a TVprogramme gave a figure of 93% in agreement, from a total of 23,000 calls.A survey published in the British Medical Journal in 1994 showed that aconsiderable number of doctors are already acceding to requests for activevoluntary euthanasia. Many more doctors feel that a change in the law isoverdue. Yet any move towards legislation of Voluntary Euthanasia has sofar been blocked by opponents. Opposing voices tend to reveal an ignorance of the truenature of VOLUNTARY euthanasia. Misunderstandings abound, and we hope inthis leaflet to lift and remove any fears and misapprehensions. If youwish to write or phone, we are also glad to answer any queries. International support is growing rapidly. A number ofcountries are actively considering legislative reform. Right-to-Die Societiesaround the world have increasing support from the swiftly growing numbersof individuals demanding their rights to self-determination. Back to Contents 4. DOES THE SOCIETY ENCOURAGE EUTHANASIA FOR THE OLDAND INFIRM? There can be no voluntary "euthanasia" if any persuasionis present. In all humane societies there is proper provision for caringfor the elderly and infirm. Such facilities are also paid for out of taxesin a normal working life, and an individual has a right to choose to benefitfrom these services - the individual has the right to choose the type ofcare he or she would like, or to decline further treatment. No one shouldbe driven to contemplate suicide through lack of service, care or support. While it is often the old and infirm who choose self-deliverance,the choice has been made in the light of each individual's quality of life.Love of life is a primitive instinct: no one should be persuaded to diethrough propaganda. But a conviction, deeply held for whatever reason,that the time has come, should be respected, and everyone should have theright to choose release. Back to Contents 5. I WANT TO DIE. PLEASE CAN THE SOCIETY HELP ME? VESS is not a suicide club. As a pressure group we seek tobring about a change in the law, but we must act, and be seen to be acting,within the law. Neither do we encourage suicide stemming from irrationalor emotional impulses. Although we have no formal association with theSamaritans, we urge any emotionally traumatised individual contemplatingsuicide to get in touch with them. We also stress the importance of clearand full diagnosis of existing conditions if a person is already ill. Back to Contents 6. WHAT DOES VESS FEEL ABOUT MALFORMED BABIES, THE MENTALLYHANDICAPPED OR THE INCURABLY INSANE? VESS seeks only the legislation of voluntary euthanasia.Handicapped babies, and the mentally retarded cannot make that voluntarydecision, and so are not included in our remit. VESS also presses equallystrongly for safeguards against any type of so-called euthanasia that doesnot stem from a clear, well-informed and voluntary request on the partof the individual. We stand for freedom of choice, and this also includesthat of individuals and doctors who are opposed to our views but do notseek to impose those views on others. Back to Contents 7. WHY DO YOU NEED VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA WHEN THERE ISTHE HOSPICE MOVEMENT? There have been enormous advances in the care of the terminallyill, and for many, the lucky ones who find a place in a hospice, this hasproved adequate to ensure that they come to a peaceful and dignified end. Unfortunately, even with medical advances and excellenthospice research in palliative care, severe indignity, pain and distresscannot always be controlled. The hospices' most optimistic estimate forpain control is 95%. In practice, in ordinary hospitals, it may be as lowas 30%. There are conditions such as cancer, strokes, acute arthritis,and more recently AIDS, to name just a few, where all the medical skillsin the world aren't enough for a particular individual case. If that person,after undergoing all possible treatment, still feels enough is enough,they should have the right to be helped to die. The phrase "terminal illness" suggests a wayof looking at death, not at the moment of brain death, but as a processlasting some period of time; once this more realistic view is embraced,and the fact of dying accepted by the individual, the doctors and the relatives,what can be gained by ensuring that the process of dying is prolonged asmuch as possible? Now, a dying person's wishes often count as nothing:hence we want a change in the law. Back to Contents 8. WHY ISN'T THE LAW CHANGED? Often the medical profession claim there is no need for legislation.In fact, Lord Dawson of Penn, the royal physician, argued that helpingpatients to die was part of good doctoring. We now know he had practicalexperience of this, in timing the end of George V. A Bill promoted in 1936,seeking to permit voluntary euthanasia in certain circumstances and withcertain safeguards, was rejected, but public sympathy was with it. Subsequentattempts to reform the law have met with similar fates, including in 1990an Early Day Motion on the subject of voluntary euthanasia, and a 1993Select Committee of the House of Lords. By mobilising public concern this could be changed. Youcan help by supporting us; you could write to your MP, or open a debatein your newspaper. Back to Contents 9. BUT SURELY SUICIDE ISN'T ILLEGAL? Suicide has long been legal in Scotland and, since 1961,in the rest of Britain. However, aiding another person towards his or herown suicide is still illegal, no matter how laudable the motives. It isthis situation which makes it impossible for doctors to practise activeeuthanasia. There is the added difficulty that by the time many peopleare driven to contemplate suicide because of their suffering, they arenot physically able to accomplish the act. The law is inconsistent inasmuchas it tolerates suicide, but outlaws the means. To deny a person controlover his or her own life is immoral. It is an abuse of human rights, andshould be illegal. Back to Contents 10. HOW CAN I HELP PROTECT MY RIGHTS? One way that we help members to establish their wishes isto provide a form of advance directive known as a Living Will, which anindividual signs when in sound mind and body, to specify what they wishto happen should various circumstances arise. It is signed in a commonsense, practical way, and not under emotional stress. The form can thenbe lodged with your doctor as an indication of your wishes. It deals withrequests for the withholding of treatment where the situation warrantsit. It does not ask the doctor to do anything contrary to existing law,but allows him or her to have access to the considered opinion of the patient.Many doctors are welcoming the fact that patients and those closest tothem are willing to share the responsibility of what can be a very difficultdecision. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursingencourage the use of living wills and publish a Code of Practice to guidetheir members. VESS also supplies a Living Will Alert Card, to be filledin and carried in your purse or wallet, indicating you have signed a livingwill. We suggest the use of a values history to help guide doctors shoulddifficult situations arise not adequately covered by your living will.Thevalues history helps you and your doctor to identify those things that,for you, make life worth living. It can also further understanding withthose close to you, so they will know what is important to you should youneed their support.

Five judges met on March 5th to decide Janet's fate. A judge was urged on Wednesday 20th Dec '95 to honour the sanctity of life and refuse to rubber-stamp doctors' plans to allow 52yr-old Janet Johnston's feeding tube to be removed. The Court of Session was told that before lapsing into a persistent vegetative state, Mrs Johnstone had wanted to continue living. Law Hospital HNS Trust, on the other hand, supported by Mrs Johnston's family, is asking Lord Cameron to rule that it would be lawful to end artificial feeding to "allow Mrs Johnston to die peacefully with dignity and with the least distress". Mrs Johnston, of Allanton, Lanarkshire, took an overdose in January 1992. She was conscious on admission to hospital but then fell into a coma and doctors have now agreed that nothing can be done to help her. STORY IN FULL Press reports: 30 Nov 95 24 Nov 95 8 Sep 95 (inc Law Comm) 29 Aug 95 Legislative Proposals on Living Wills The Law Commission's new paper on Mental Incapacity (England) Several years in the making, this 290 page report has been heralded as one of the most thoughtful and thorough analyses of living wills published in this country to date. Instead of attempting to push a "new law" on living wills, the Commission has made a thorough examination of the existing law, recognised that such legal provision as currently exists "...is out of step with modern social conditions and the present day understanding of the rights and needs of those who lack decision-making capacity" and is "unsystematic and full of glaring gaps." The Report covers more than just living wills - it looks, for instance, at protecting vulnerable people from harm. But the analysis of the situation regarding advance directives and the principles behind them is transforming and original; yet it is developed from a broad base and so offers little that will seem controversial. The remit of the Law Commission was set up in 1965 by Act of Parliament for the specific purpose of promoting the reform of the law. This current volume is an elegant example of the "least amount of legislation to get the job done." Many bills have been put before parliament and rejected because they lacked foundation. The weight of these new statutory proposals derives largely from the excellent foundation, from which they proceed with a logic more like the force of gravity. Secondly they are minimalist: they do not so much suggest major revision of the law as overhaul and clarify existing law by way of statute. In a substantial chapter entitled Advance Statements about Health Care the report at a stroke cuts through and highlights the inadequacy of the long-standing debate over whether to use the term "advance directive" or "living will." A disadvantage of both these phrases, says the Law Commission, is that they "concentrate attention on the existence of a piece of paper." The fundamental question is not the piece of paper but the nature and legal effect of the views which have been expressed by the person concerned. There is a strong distinction (echoed by the BMA Code, see page 4 of this issue) made between advance decisions and advance expressions of views and preferences. These differences are more important than whether they are enshrined in a written document, although a document will undoubtedly be an important piece of the picture. The Commission recommend that an "advance refusal of treatment" is defined as "...a refusal made by a person aged eighteen or over with the necessary capacity of any medical, surgical or dental treatment or other procedure and intended to have effect at any subsequent time when he or she may be without capacity to refuse consent." The authority to treat is then invalidated if "...an advance refusal of treatment by the person concerned applies to that treatment or procedure in the circumstances of the case." This approach is put forward as a way of superseding the tests for "validity" and "applicability" proposed in the case known as "Re T". An advance decision must be very specific and apply exactly to the situation that has arisen in order to be binding. The Commission recognise that many of the difficulties associated with this do not, fortunately, apply to statements of wishes; but, if the statement of wishes is a such favourable default mechanism, how is it possible to give it legal weight so that a doctor will not ignore it? The Commission's solution is an ingenious and lucid interpretation of the law as it now stands, developed into a recommendation that such rules be enshrined in a new law. If there is no valid refusal of treatment then anything done in relation to the health care of a person who lacks capacity to make his or her own decision about that matter must be (1) reasonable and (2) in the best interests of that person. But, you will object, many doctors feel that it is in the "best interests" of the patient to treat them irrespective of any living will, especially one that can be challenged as perhaps inapplicable to the exact circumstances that have arisen. So here we have some new rules on best interests. The report proposes that, in deciding what is in a person's best interests, regard must be had to four listed matters, namely: (1) the ascertainable past and present wishes and feelings of the person, and the factors he or she would consider, (2) the need to permit and encourage the person to participate, (3) the views of other appropriate people, and (4) the availability of an effective less restrictive option. What happens if these criteria are ignored? The conclusions drawn are powerful: "As far as health care is concerned, these new rules mean that treatment will not be lawful unless it is both reasonable and in the best interests of the particular patient. It will not be in the best interests of the patient unless the doctor has taken into account the ascertainable past and present wishes and feelings of the patient and the factors he or she would have considered. If the treatment given is not lawful then the doctor is liable to an action in damages for battery if, as is likely, he or she has touched the patient." The new rules are a sensible legal framework from which the whole subject of living wills can be approached. It approaches an ethical structure upon which decisions can be made - this is something in which the legislation of America, Denmark and Australia has been singularly remiss. On the question of appointing proxies, or "continuing powers of attorney" (CPA) as the Law Commission would call them, the underpinning is far less rigorous. A loophole in the law, yes; most countries already have some way of allowing individuals to appoint a third party to make decisions of this nature for them, and many have enacted new laws specifically to look at health care decisions. Does the fact that most jurisdictions allow it mean it is right? Does it achieve the result that people assume it does? A great number of studies, several of them approaching statistical significance that cannot be ignored, suggest that the answer is "no". When you appoint someone to make decisions for you, "as you would have made them," are you simply abrogating your autonomy in favour of any decision that person would find acceptable, or do you have some sort of confidence that they would make the decision you would have made? Again, studies show that most people have confidence in their proxies to make a sort of "substituted judgement" decision - to "put themselves in the patient's shoes" - yet when presented with hypothetical scenarios proxies are able to score little better than chance. The disparity seems to arise because patients have discussed broad preferences with a proxy ("I wouldn't want to be a vegetable") but have failed to throw light on the greyer, more difficult areas of, say, partial paralysis, bouts of dementia, or other variables that might be the possible outcomes of particular treatments. The popular misconception is perpetuated and remains popular not just with lawmakers but with patients who are inadequately informed about the extreme fallibility of such a decision making process. The House of Lords recognised the danger and did not favour the more widespread development of a system of proxy decision making, in spite of the strong current of supporting opinion. The Law Commission depart from this view and say that "...exactly the same arguments could be made against allowing people to delegate their financial powers." They draw up extensive safeguards and protections. They say that "We recommend that, unless expressly authorised to do so, no attorney may consent to any treatment refused by the donor by an advance refusal of treatment." There is a presumption against allowing the CPA to make a refusal of life-sustaining treatment, but it can be specifically overridden by the authorisation of the declarant, so the Commission: "...recommend that, unless expressly authorised to do so, no attorney may refuse consent to any treatment necessary to sustain life." This still leaves the door open to allow patients to appoint and authorise proxies in the belief that the proxy will make the decisions about life-sustaining treatment as the patient would have done. A better safeguard would have called for communication of detailed values between patient and proxy as is done in the modern "values history" documents (living will type statements that concentrate on the specific, underlying values and life situations rather than medical treatments to be refused). If Parliament favours the Law Commission's recommendations on living wills a step forward will be made for patient autonomy; if it also accepts the recommendations on continuing powers of attorney, there is a risk that the good will be undone. Addendum: The Scottish Law Commission: Report on Incapable Adults Instead of Scotland leading the way as we Scots would expect, this latest volume is little but a pale reflection of the(English) Law Commission's equivalent. True, a few archaic items aretidied up (such as tutors), but other anachronisms are perpetuated orintroduced. In deciding whether to give treatment to an incapacitatedperson, doctors are still exhorted to consult the nearest relative (nomention of "significant other"). One might say they took the weakestpart of the English Commission's report (on proxies) and made itworse. The section on advance statements (in which the EnglishCommission showed such brilliant insight and accomplished somethingof a tour de force in its exposition of best interests) is lukewarm andseems to show only a very basic understanding of the issues.

One such rock is John Beloff. A psychologist with a deep interestin philosophy, he was drawn to the v.e. debate through his interest inpsychical research (a subject on which he is now considered an authority)."Both topics put one on one's metal to prove one's position,"he says. Beloff claims he hates quarrels but enjoys disputes: "Ifyou make enemies you can't have a dispute; rather than denouncing themloudly, it makes more sense to persuade those opposed to euthanasia bythe sweet light of reason." In his thirteen years in the movement, Beloff has commanded world-widerespect and affection. On the committee, he has been Chairman and Treasurer,and his years as the former were marked by a harmony and absence of theopposing factions so common to committees. He developed the Newsletterinto a regular and respected publication, fuelled by articles from a widerange of eminent speakers and writers. When there were no funds, Beloffwould hold meetings in his own house. But his work has not been limitedto extensive public talks. He has written extensively on v.e. and has regularlylectured to medical students about it at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.Unlike most committee members, Beloff however has been able to work atall levels, including the actual day-to-day work in a campaign organisation.For his efforts in manning the VESS Office twice a week, he was given theworking appellation Honorary Secretary, backing up the work of the paidstaff by contributing voluntary assistance on a regular, reliable basis. At the end of one of the longest standing commitments to VESS, JohnBeloff will this year be resigning from active committee work and fromthe editing of the Newsletter, not from disillusionment but with the feelingthat VESS is in safe hands and that he has served long enough. Now in his76th year, a humanist who draws strength from the lives of great peoplehe admires, what advice would Beloff offer those that keep up the struggle?"Don't lose heart, you are bound to have disappointments. Keep pluggingat it!" A new article by John Beloff appears in the next issue of VESS Newsletter. John Beloff - writings on v.e can be found in VESS Newsletter,eg Jan 1988, Do We Have a Duty to Die?

Introduction The law has attempted, and continues to attempt to provide, a stopgap for certain socio-medical shortcomings. For a competent adult patient, the law, medicine and ethics are in agreement about only proceeding with treatment which is acceptable to that patient . Whether we argue from a utilitarian viewpoint to maximise the greatest good for the greatest number, or whether we present a Kantian or duties-based argument, the result is largely uncontroversial. In the case of the incompetent patient, however, I hope to suggest that existing mechanisms are inadequate, even if they are the best that can be offered from a legal context. The American system relies heavily on the substituted judgement standard.(1,6,15,19) The system, which is some 15 years old, seeks to identify a surrogate to make the decision that the patient would have made - putting oneself in the patient�s shoes as it were. It relies and falls on the premiss that the surrogate knows something of the patient�s preferences as expressed when the patient�s decision-making capacity was intact. The fallacy of such an assumption is demonstrated by a large number of studies(10,14,16,22) and, although it still has heavy support in law, there is little controversy about the inability of surrogates to make substituted judgements. For instance, in studies of paired patients and nominated proxies, even though 90 per cent of patients predicted that family menbers would accurately predict their wishes, those family members were unable accurately to do so. Doctors fared no better, although doctors who had been well acquainted with their patients over a long period of time - something that rarely happens now - fared very slightly better. If family members, courts and doctors are unable to guess or ascertain what a patient would have wanted, there is no rationale for the substituted judgement standard.Notwithstanding this, the English Law Commission is seeking legislation for Continuing Powers of Attorney that would encourage such proxy decision making.(17) But before turning to what I believe might be acceptable, if partial, alternatives, I will briefly examine the main standard of decision-making for incompetents in use on the UK - that of . The best interests standard asks the surrogate to decide the course of action that promotes the patient�s interests according to what most reasonable persons would choose.(15) The English Law Commission is sensibly attempting to widen this formally, to include any evidence of the patient�s expressed preferences.(17) Unfortunately, few people express such preferences in advance,(5) or express them clearly enough, or express preferences that are applicable to the circumstances that arise. Hence we have the choice of making weighty decisions on the flimsiest of evidence, or of making decisions based on what we might falsely assume any reasonable person would want. Of those cases where express preferences have been made known in advance, such preferences are frequently ignored.(5) Studies demonstrate that not only do patients preferences vary very considerably for given treatments but that medical bias(3) influences which treatments are given or withdrawn. Attempting to reinforce such flimsy mechanisms with legal protocols will not better equip them to perform the function for which they are intended and will, in the end, only further cloud the issues. Just as a case can be over-medicalised, by treatment of the disease and symptoms, in isolation from the patient as an individual with individual preferences and circumstances, so can legalism, by applying rules that may be inappropriate in an individual circumstance, hinder rather than help the execution of justice and good medical practice; formal rules based on inadequate assumptions should instill us to find better answers rather than mere acceptance of those rules.(12) The two Standards fall principally on the practical difficulty in obtaining sufficient evidence of patient preferences, whether actual or that of the supposed reasonable patient. If such information could be obtained, either standard could perhaps be made to work, but as that would rely on the advance cooperation of all patients it is not likely to happen. Given that some patients will, however, cooperate, there is no need to discard such standards, only to improve their workability whilst simultaneously developing mechanisms to take the pressure off these over-used devices.(21) I would like to present some short proposals for such mechanisms. Proposals 1.Institutional guidelines on specific situations 2.Transparency of resource allocation 3.Empathy and compassion as tools of the nurse advocate 4.Development of a family-based ethic 5.Preferences derived from communities of patients Institutional guidelines on specific situations Modern technology has brought with it a range of associated problems such as PVS and the applicability of CPR or antibiotics in dementia. Developing medical ethics has sought to emphasise patient autonomy as the main or sole criterion for decision-making, extending this principle by tortuous devices into the area of decision making for the incompetent adult.(2) This has perhaps contributed to lack of development of contiguous mechanisms that might be ethically viable. The debate on PVS, while far from concluded, has brought diagnosis to the level where, in some cases, it is known with certainty that the brain is destroyed and no medical treatment can restore it or any quality of life. Continuing treatment not only may be construed as an affront to dignity, whether the dignity afforded to a person or a corpse, but will, if we are talking about NHS resources, inevitably result in reduction of medical treatments available to other patients. At the moment, such decisions to stop treatment in PVS can only be taken by a court - again, involving an even further drain on the sorely pressed public purse. The process of decisionmaking through consultation in Scotland has given way to formal court hearings, which in turn attempt to invoke a best interest standard. I submit it could be better developed by means of institutional guidelines developed by the professional associations. Guidelines could be developed for other conditions as well as PVS where the patient�s preference is no longer the most relevant factor.(8) Transparency of resource allocation I won�t attempt in this essay to consider what I believe to be an inadequate system of resource allocation in this country, but will mention for consideration what I see to be a great danger to equitable decisionmaking - the lack of transparency in health care resource allocation. We need to stop the lie of infinite resources for any need that is deemed great enough - there is no way that such resources can be found. But we have a duty to make the decisionmaking process more open. Patients need to know what they can reasonably expect and also what they can not reasonably expect the public purse to provide. They need to know the limitations and inadequacies of hospitals and the decisionmaking and resource allocation processes, and come to terms with them. When we have done this as a society, we may also be able to pave the way for change in this area. Even if the best interests of a patient can be ascertained, there may be insufficient funding available to serve them. Instead of pouring so much effort into desperately trying to discover what the patient would want and then presenting the harsh disappointment of reality, it might be more equitable to present the availability of choices and then encourage development of patient autonomy within the scenario of those practically available options. Empathy and compassion as the tools of the nurse advocate Over-reliance on science and social science is at the root of much of the failure of the best interests and substituted judgement standards. Studies have suggested that compassion is a necessary fuel for insight and effective information gathering concerning the patient and factors that might affect decisions regarding that patient. Compassion heightens our awareness of a situation(4) though without, of itself, helping us to form better moral judgements.(18) Nurses are ideally placed to utilize compassion a)because of their increased contact with patients and significant others, b)because more nurses are women and studies have suggested an increased capacity for compassion in women, and c)the nurse�s institutionalised role as patient advocate(7) - and I note that it might be necessary to accord more formal recognition of this role. The nurse advocate might potentially be able to give a broader based picture than could otherwise be obtained. Within a best interests framework even, the nurse might better be able to provide the necessary information, but the advantage of developing this platform over reliance on the law of best interests, is that it allows greater flexibility to consider the context of information, short of court hearings, and were legislation to become overly prescriptive, better flexibility than even the courts. Development of a family-based ethic The best that medical practice currently aspires to in its ethical decisionmaking is respect for the autonomy of the patient within a doctor-patient relationship. While it is a necessary basis(21) from which to start, it is severely limited, and its lack of practical development contributes in no small part to the unfairness which best interest and substituted judgement standards are forced at times to perpetrate. Family members and significant others, whether healthy or ill, have their own autonomy which needs to be respected.(13) Community morality may also have a valid part to play. Family and community may have to bear the brunt of medical decisions about an individual when that patient is discharged from hospital or kept in. Such considerations suggest that decisionmaking should be broader based than focussing exclusively on the patient�s supposed autonomy. Legal requirements of best interests and substituted judgement make no allowance for this and may also fail to serve the patient well. The nurse advocate is again ideally placed to develop such an ethic, as long as we do not over-medicalise that profession as we have done with the doctor�s. While the patient is the chief player in the drama, recognition that medical decisions should not be taken in isolation from non-medical factors and persons other than the patient is also fundamental.(11,13,20) Preferences derived from communities of patients Finally, in identifying patient preferences, undue weight may be given to the unexpressed or expressed wishes of the patient. It is well established that patients often make poor decisions on the basis of inadequate understanding; it is also well-established that their treatment preferences frequently change with increased understanding. Most patients express no advance preferencesfor treatment in incompetency(5) and identifying applicable preferences may place quite unreasonable weight on dubious information. The practicality of getting all patients to provide adequate and well-informed treatment preferences in advance of incompetency may be impossible, beyond our resources as a nation, or an undue invasion of competent persons� willingness to consider and provide such information. A well-considered default position is therefore necessary. What we do know is that specific groups of patients tend to make similar decisions.(5) Such population groups might, for instance, turn out to include long term nursing home residents in a certain age band. As concordance within a group might not be 100 per cent we have to acknowledge the imperfect nature of such a default, but it is less imperfect than most of the current attempts to devolve decisions to surrogates. The initial research to identify preferences of specific communities of patients would be financially and ethically justified by its long term contribution to a solution. By comparison, the present attempts to strain the limits of substituted judgement and best interests are like wet earth in the holes of a dyke. References 1.Brett A. Limitations of Listing Specific Medical Interventions in Advance Directives. Journal of the American Medical Association 1991; 266(6): 825-828. The SUBSTITUTED JUDGEMENT standard asks the surrogate to make the decision that the patient would have made in the particular situation. This standard is limited by the fact that the surrogate must know something about the patient�s prefernces, as expressed when the patient�s decision-making capacity was intact. On the other hand, the BEST INTERESTS standard is invoked when the patient�s preferences were unknown. This standard, by definition, cannot apply to the patient�s preferences. Instead it seeks the surrogate to choose the course of action that promotes the patient�s interests according to a more impersonal standard (e.g. that which most reasonable persons would choose). 2.British Medical Association. Medical Ethics Today. London: BMA 1993 p.162 The possibility of patients inadvertantly misdirecting their doctors by an inadequate appreciation of the circumstances or of the evolution of new treatments led the Association to recommend strongly that advance directives should not be legally binding on doctors, but legal cases in 1992 and 1993 indicated that an anticipatory decision which is clearly established and applicable to the circumstances would be as legally binding as any current decision made by a competent patient. (Cases referred to are Re T [1992]4 All ER 649; and Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993]1 All ER 859.) p.164 The precise role, powers and title of a proxy decision-maker are not defined by either custom or law (even in Scotland where tutors dative may exercise this role). Pending clarification in law, the BMA believes that in cases where such a person has been nominated by the patient, the criterion to be followed in decision-making would be that of substituted judgement, with the agent as a sympathetic interpreter of the patient�s own values, rather than attempting to judge the patient�s best interests. 3.Christakis N, Asch D. Biases in How Physicians Choose to Withdraw Life Support. Lancet 1993; 42:642-646. p.642 Physicians do have preferences about the form of life support withdrawn. From most likely to least likely the order is: blood products, haemodialysis, intravenous vasopressors, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, tube feedings, and intravenous fluids. p.642 Four biases in decision making were also identified. Physicians prefer to withdraw forms of therapy supporting organs that failed for natural rather iatrogenic reasons, to withdraw recently instituted rather than longstanding interventions, to withdraw forms of therapy resulting in immediate death rather than delayed death, and to withdraw forms of therapy when confronted with diagnostic uncertainty. p.642 Because these biases may have clinical, social, and ethical consequences counter to patient goals, and because they may affect the underlying decision whether to withdraw life support at all, they may represent impediments to rational and compassionate decision making on critical care. p.645 Our research shows that physicians� preferences about the type of life support to withdraw are influenced by iatrogenic complications, duration of therapy with each form of life support, expected timing of death, and diagnostic uncertainty. p.645 The decision biases that we have identified here may, in some circumstances, prolong the period of dying, increase the suffering of patients and their families, and waste resources. p.645 Should, therefore, advance directives be drafted to specify how life support could be withdrawn? We think not: rather than seek such specificity physicians should focus on the underlying goals. p.645 The primary goal in life support withdrawal ordinarily is to allow the patient to die as humanely as possible, and the decision should be made in the most ethically sensitive, logically rigorous, and clinically appropriate way possible. The biases we have identified may subvert this objective. 4.Downie R, Calman K. Healthy Respect: Ethics in Health Care. 1994 OUP. P.37 ...whereas science, including the social sciences, gives us horizontal understanding we must in concrete situations supplement this by what we could call vertical understanding, the sort of understanding which comes from insight into a personal history. ...the second type of understanding of human beings, as distinct from the scientific sort, necessarily requires that one has developed in oneself a certain range of moral qualities, and especially compassion. 5.Emanuel L, Emanuel E. Decisions at the End of Life Guided by Communities of Patients. Hastings Center Report 1993 Sep-Oct; 6-14. p.6 ...few people ever use advance directives, and even when they do, physicians do not always honour them. In addition, the documents may be unavailable when relevant. p.7 Overall, when we combine data we can conclude that living wills and other written instructional directives can be relied on to represent a patient�s wishes accurately, under good circumstances, in 46 to 84 percent of decisions. The more serious limitations are that only about 20 percent of the population use them, and the directions of even fewer will be honoured. p.7 ...of the proxies who do manage accurately to judge patients� wishes, less than two-thirds will be emotionally capable of carrying them out. p.11...by having the opportunity to participate in community deliberations regarding policies affecting their lives, people can realize a deeper aspect of autonomy, namely, participation in deliberative dialogue. 6.Emanuel E, Emanuel L. Proxy Decision Making for Incompetent Patients: An Ethical and Empirical Analysis. Journal of the American Medical Association 1992 p.2068 Historically, the ethical justification for proxy decision making inheres in two related claims. First, the incompetent patient�s right to refuse medical care can be exercised through a proxy decision. Second, knowing the patient�s wishes well, the proxy will make the decision that the incompetent patient would make if he or she were competent. The proxy decision maker is justified in exercising the incompetent patient�s right to refuse care to the extent that he or she can don the mental mantle or stand in the shoes of the patient and make the same decisions under the circumstances that the patient would. In legal doctrine, this is called substituted judgement. 7.Fletcher N, Holt J, et al. Ethics, Law and Nursing (1995) Manchester University Press. p.113 The UKCC encourages nurses to act as advocates for patients and defines advocacy as being concerned with promoting the well-being and interests of patients and clients. 8.Fried T, Gillick M. The Limits of Proxy Decision Making: Overtreatment. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics (1995) 4: 524-529. p.524 We found a significant number of cases in which healthcare providers at a long-term care facility came into conflict with surrogates because the treatment desired by the surrogate was viewed as excessively burdonsome when evaluated by an experienced team of nurses, physicians, and social workers. Neither a court-appointed guardian nor an institutional ethics committee were likely to be able to resolve these conflicts because of lack of clarity about what constitutes the best interest of impaired nursing home patients. p.527 The solution to the dilemma is to develop institutional policies within longterm care facilities that would restrict the scope of treatment decisions made by proxies. Policies would be derived from the experience of a broad spectrum of nursing home staff... caring for patients with severe dementia. They would delineate what constituted an acceptable level of care designed to promote the comfort and well- being of demented patients. Within the context of care plan outlines that insured the goal of patient comfort, proxies would participate in the implementation of specific therapies based on thier view of the importance of the goal of life prolongation. p.528 Institutional policies, which reflect religious or other convictions, should be developed within a framework established by professional societies. 9.Re G: Incompetent Patients in PVS: Views of Relatives and Best Interests MLR [1995] 80. 10.Gillick M, Fried T.

Hastings Center Report 1995 July/August, Special Supplement: G22-G25. p.22 For millenia, medical ethics has focussed on the doctor-patient relationship. Thus the SUPPORT trial to improve clinical decisionmaking for seriously ill patients can be viewed as a report about the failure of this dyadic relationship. ...physicians who are so unconcerned about patient preferences that they don�t even bother to look at them when they�re placed in the chart, and patients who do not take advantage of opportunities to discuss their treatment preferences with their physicians. p.23 We must also recognize that families are not simply or even primarily patient support systems. They must not be thought of or treated that way by doctors, hospitals, health care planners, or bioethicists. To do so is immoral, as Kant made plain. It involves treating the rest of the patient�s family as mere means to the preferences of the patient. p.24 Treatment decisions that respect and enhance the autonomy of the patient may at the same time disregard and shatter the autonomy of the patient�s caregivers and the rest of her family. 12. Hardwig J. The Problems of Proxies with Interests of Their Own: Towards a Better Theory of Proxy Decisions. Journal of Clinical Ethics 1993 Spring: 20-27. p.21 ...the reservations we have about interested family members and their proxy decisions are partly of our own making. The accepted theory of proxy decisions is deeply flawed and must be recast. Our medical practice is, I believe, often better than the conventional theories of proxy decision making. Nonetheless, some of our deepest worries about proxy decision making grow out of the morally inappropriate instructions we give them. p.26 ...we must provide guidance and support for those caught in the moral crucible of proxy decisions. Not only would this approach be more ethically sound, but it would, I believe, decrease the number of inappropriate proxy decisions. 13.Hardwig J. What About the Family. Hastings Center Report 1990 March/April:5-10. p.5 The prevalent ethic of patient autonomy ignores family interests in medical treatment decisions. Acknowledging these interests as legitimate forces basic changes in ethical theory and the moral practice of medicine. p.10 Our present ethical theory can only condemn as unethical any attempt to weigh in the interests of other family members. If we would acknowledge the moral relevance of the interests of the family we could perhaps develop an ethical theory that would guide and support physicians, patients, and families in the throes of agonisiong moral decisions. 14.Hare J, Pratt C, Nelson C. Agreement between Patients and Their Self-Selected Surrogates on Difficult Medical Decisions. Archives of Internal Medicine 1992 May; 152: 1049-1054. ...within individual pairs, agreement on treatment occurred only 70% of the time even though surrogates were asked to base their treatment decisions on substituted judgement. 15.Hoefler J Deathright: Culture, Medicine, Politics, and the Right to Die. Oxford: Westview Press 1994. p.173 With In re Quinlan (1976), it was argued that the constitutionally protected right to die could be exercised by a family on behalf of an incompetent patient as long as the family could establish that its decision was consistent with the decision the incompetent principal would make if able to do so. This knowledge might include understandings about the principal�s religious beliefs, general attitudes regarding medical care, and other substantial (albeit indirect) evidence of that person�s frame of mind with regard to right-to-die issues. ... This reasoning would become known as the substituted judgement standard, which holds that a third party�s best guess about the wishes of the incompetent patient could be substituted for that which was impossible to obtain: the expressed wishes of the patient. p.173 The term substituted judgement actually originates with the Massachusetts case In re Spring (1980). In this case, the court decided that a seventy-eight-year-old incompetent individual with end-stage kidney disease could forgo hemodialysis, based on what was known about the individual�s general preferences in such matters. No written or specific oral instructions would be required as long as the principal�s predisposition toward the withdrawal of life support could be reasonably demonstrated by a third party. p.173-4 The Best Interests Standard. In another important Massachusettes case, Superintendant of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz (1977), the court seemed to expand the coverage of the constitutionally protected right-to-die beyond those who were currently incompetent to those who had never been legally competent. Joseph Saikewicz, the principal in this case, had been mentally retarded since birth. But the Massachusettes court hearing the case presumed that those who knew him could reasonably determine what his wishes might be, even though he himself had never been legally competent to make such decisions on his own behalf. Extending the Quinlan rationale to Saikewicz was something of a stretch for the substituted-judgement standard, however, leading the Saikewicz court to introduce the notion that other factors might be considered, including age (Saikewicz was sixty-seven), the pain associated with continued therapy, the chances for therapeutic success, the suffering associated with the continuation of life, and the inability to cooperate with therapy when in a degraded mental state. This move to consideration of other factors broadened the realm of possibilities for those seeking to establish the right to die, and in the process, it laid the groundwork for what would become a second kind of test: the best-interests standard, a term that was actually not coined until the New Jersey court heard the case of Claire Conroy five years later. 16.Lambert P, Gibson J, Nathanson P. The Values History: An Innovation in Surrogate Medical Decision-Making. Law, Medicine & Health Care 1990, 18(3):202-212. p.210 Perhaps most dismaying are studies finding that potential surrogate decision-makers often are unable to predict the preferences of their principal. This lack of knowledge bodes poorly for the surrogate decision-maker�s ability to exercise accurate substituted judgement. 17.Law Com No 231 Mental Incapacity 1995 HMSO 18.Loewy E. Compassion, Reason, and Moral Judgement. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics (1995) 4: 466-475. p.466 ...compassion is a sentiment that, although it needs to be controlled by reason, ought to be fostered and cherished. A natural trait is ethically neutral. It can, however, serve to make us aware of and concerned about moral problems and their impact on others. 19.Lowy C.

Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics 1994; 3(2):195-208. p.203 Best respect can be understood as a decision-making standard that rejects any result as inevitable, identifies a group of persons best able to collect the most relevant information concerning objective moral fact and subjective moral voice, and requires this group to meet with each other to maintain focus and correct misunderstandings. 21.McLean S. A Patient�s Right to Know - Information Disclosure, the Doctor and the Law. Hants: Dartmouth 1989. p.169 The ease with which any jurisdiction is capable of vindicating patients� rights depends on its history and jurisprudence as much as it does on willingness to make appropriate modifications or enthusiasm for change." 22.Seckler A, Meier D, Mulvihill M et al. Substituted Judgement: How Accurate Are Proxy Predictions? Annals of Internal Medicine 1991; 115(2): 92-98. p.92 Although patients predicted that both their physicians (90%) and family members (87%) would accurately predict their wishes, neither family members nor physicians, in fact, were able to accurately predict patients� wishes... p.95 ...physicians did no better than chance alone in predicting the wishes of their patients... p.95 ...most of the patients incorrectly believed that their designated family members and physicians would accurately predict their wishes. p.95 Using hypothetical scenarios, the investigators found poor agreement between healthy elderly patients, their spouses, and their physicians concerning decisions for resuscitation. 23.Weiler K.

The judges said that if he had made a living will expressing his future wishes hecould have been allowed to die in peace earlier. The Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety is at the forefront of living will research in the UK. Your subscription willhelp to make a peaceful death through a living will a reality for anyone who desiresit. In 1992 Dr Cox openly defied the law and assented to 70 year old Mrs Boyes'persistent request for voluntary active euthanasia. Mrs Boyes' was so ill that she"screamed like a dog" if anyone touched her. Conventional medicine did not relieveher agony. In her last days, when she repeatedly requested to die, Dr Cox finally gaveher an injection of potassium chloride, bestowing on her the boon of a peaceful deathso many of us feel we are entitled to. Dr Cox, although given a suspended sentence,was hauled through the courts like a common criminal. We believe good doctorsacting in all conscience like Dr Cox, should be lauded, not vilified, and should havethe benefit of legally approved codes of conduct that embody consistent safeguardsagainst abuse. Together we should ensure that medicine and the law serve the patientand the citizen once more. Together, we can stand and be counted. And, from pooledresources, each small contribution will contribute to the powerful tidal wave that theScottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society can use to bring this about. Sue Rodriguez, a mother in her early thirties, died slowly of Lou Gehrig's disease. Shelived for several years with the knowledge that her muscles would, one by one, wasteaway until the day came when, fully conscious, she would choke to death. She beggedthe Courts to reassure her that a doctor would be allowed to assist her in choosingthe moment of death. They refused. She lived on in terror, helped eventually by adoctor who, in February 1994, covertly broke the law to help her die in peace. A lawon assisted suicide with rigorous safeguards could have saved her the nightmare duringthose months before her death, given her the confidence to carry on - with thereassurance that when it got too bad she could rely on a compassionate doctor tofollow her wishes at the end. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is pledged tosupport research for drafting the most thorough, yet feasible, assisted suicide Bill yetpresented to Parliament. Your support will make it happen. "Mr C", a 68 year old prisoner of Jamaican origin had been diagnosed as suffering fromchronic paranoid schizophrenia and was treated with drugs and electro-convulsivetherapy. In September 1993 the prison doctors found he had gangrene in his rightleg. They felt his chance of survival with conventional treatment was no better than15%, and so recommended that his leg be amputated below the knee. The prisonerrefused amputation and received conventional treatment only. There was a likelihood,however, that gangrene would recur. The prisoner stated he would rather die on twolegs than live on one, and his solicitor asked the hospital to promise not to amputatein any circumstances without the prisoner's consent. They refused, and he sought acourt injunction to uphold his wishes. The court considered expert testimony in thecase (known as Re C) and found that, although the prisoner was suffering fromschizophrenia, there was nothing to suggest that he did not understand the nature,purpose and effects of treatment; he had understood, and, with a full knowledge thatdeath might result from refusing amputation, had clearly made his choice. The courtupheld the prisoner's right to make an advance refusal of treatment and granted aninjunction. The case paved the way for acceptance of advance refusals of medicaltreatments and so for living wills. Completion of a Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety living will document could save distressing and drawn-out court proceedings ifever you were incapacitated. Karen Ann Quinlan collapsed on April 15th, 1975. She was twenty-one years old.Within hours, she entered a coma from which she could never recover. Her parents,staunch Roman Catholics, knew their daughter would not want to be kept alive byextraordinary means. A year later, as Karen lay in a "persistent vegetative state," thecourts finally allowed her treatment to be stopped; but artificial feeding wascontinued and she was maintained as a living corpse until June 1985, when sheeventually died of pneumonia. Her case spurred thousands of letters of sympathy andfuelled the "right to die" movement. How many people need to die degrading deathsbefore society learns a little humanity? The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society iscommitted to research and teaching in these difficult areas. Help us to help you, andall those who would seek die with dignity and give you their heartfelt thanks. Ramon Sanpedro is currently seeking, through the courts, the assistance of a doctorto help him die with dignity. He was paralysed in Spain as a result of a swimmingaccident during his youth. He describes himself as "a head attached to a corpse." Hewrites: "Why die? Because every journey has its departure time and only the traveller has theprivilege and the right to choose the last day to get out. Why to die? Because at times thejourney of no return is the best path that reason can show us out of love and respect forlife, so that life may havea dignified death." Ramon Sanpedro makes no suggestion as to what the wishes of others in a similarphysical condition might be. In fact, some people who are so paralysed takeenjoyment in life and want to go on living. Their choice should be respected and theyshould be given every support. But Ramon Sanpedro has made his choice and hischoice should also be respected. We should seek to ensure that the rights of theindividual are always respected without allowing others to feel endangered orpressurised. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society provides international technicaland informational support. With your help, we can make the world a better place. Nancy Cruzan lost control of her car one day in January 1983 in Missouri. When theparamedics arrived, they were able to restore her breathing and heartbeat and she wastransported, unconscious, to hospital. She continued to be fed through a surgically-implanted gastrostomy tube. After several years, a court found that, although herrespiration and circulation continued unaided, she was oblivious to her surroundingsexcept for reflexive responses to sound and perhaps painful stimuli; her brain haddegenerated, irreversibly; she was a spastic quadriplegic; she suffered contraction ofher four extremities, with irreversible muscle and tendon damage; and had nocognitive or reflex ability to swallow food or water or to maintain her essential dailyneeds nor would she ever recover such an ability. She lay in persistent vegetative stateeven though she had told her housemate that, if sick or injured, she would not wishto continue her life unless she could live "at least halfway normal." This was the firsttime the U.S. Supreme Court had been faced with what we call the "right to die."They said that Missouri had "arrogated to itself" the power to define life, and NancyCruzan's life and liberty consequently put into disquieting conflict. She had not madea living will, and the court case paved the way for a uniform, national Patient Self-Determination Act that regulated living wills and made them more widely available.The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is campaigning for uniform UK reform tomake living wills more widely available. Your help can make it a reality. 57 year old Georgette Malette, in the early afternoon of June 30th, 1979, wasrushed, unconscious, by ambulance, to hospital. The car in which she was a passenger,driven by her husband, had collided with a truck. Her husband had been killed; shehad suffered serious injuries. She was a Jehovah's Witness and carried a card statingher firm conviction that no blood or blood products should be administered to herunder any circumstances. The doctor treating her ignored the card and gave her ablood transfusion which he decided was medically indicated. In June 1980 MrsMalette brought charges against Dr Shulman. The judge found that Mrs Malette hadsuffered emotionally and mentally and ordered substantial costs to be paid. It madeno difference that the medical team didn't agree with her beliefs. Her advance refusalof treatment was unambiguous. Unfortunately, living wills tend to be far less clearcut, dealing with a wide range of circumstances in which interpretation is sometimesnecessary. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is at the forefront of researchinto living wills and other ways of having your wishes respected at the end of life.Public support will help us to help make dying more dignified for all those who wantto retain some control and self-respect in their dying phase. When her case came to trial, Claire Conroy was unable to move from a semi-fetalposition. She was severely demented, had heart disease, hypertension and diabetes andher left leg was gangrenous to the knee; she had sores, couldn't speak, had only alimited ability to swallow, and had eye problems; she had a urinary catheter in placeand was unable to control her bowels. She was able to moan and scratch, andoccasionally smile when someone combed her hair. Claire Conroy eventually diedbefore the courts were able to decide what to do. She was not a candidate forvoluntary euthanasia. She had not made a living will. But her case posed veryworrying dilemmas about end of life decisions. Pushing difficult deaths to one sidewill not make them go away or make them any easier. The Scottish VoluntaryEuthanasia Society encourages open discussion of the problems increasingly facing usin society. We care, and we listen with an open mind. We ask you to work with us sothat every person can die with dignity in the way that he or she would choose.

The Jim Brady Story [Back to VESS Newsletter Page] When love brokethe law... Jim Brady's family stood by him when he developed Huntington's disease- even when it meant breaking the law Colin Gavaghan It is the kind of scenario which most people would prefer never evento contemplate, far less have to face. A much loved relative, afflictedby constant suffering and rendered almost entirely helpless by a diseasewhich will eventually kill him, makes repeated pleas for assistance inending his life. On Boxing Day 1995, Paul Brady made his decision; a decisionwhich came after a prolonged battle with his conscience, but which wasto end in a battle for his own liberty. In 1985, Paul's brother James had learned that he had inherited the genefor Huntington's disease, a degenerative illness of the central nervoussystem. James knew that this information was effectively a death sentence;the gene for Huntington's is dominant, which means that someone carryingit will always be affected by it, and the disease cannot be cured. He knew what kind of death he could expect: he, Paul and their sister Margarethad already watched the disease claim the life of their mother some twentyyears earlier, and they recalled the mental and physical deteriorationwhich preceded her death. Despite its inevitability, James refused to surrenderto his fate. He determined to live as full a life as possible for as longas possible, fighting "like a demon" against the onslaught whichthe disease waged against his body. He continued to live in his own homeand remained active in both his work and his support of his beloved CelticFootball Club. The progress of the disease, nonetheless, was relentless. Two years afterhis initial diagnosis he was forced to give up his job as an engineer,and, as his coordination deteriorated further, walking became increasinglydifficult and his speech became slurred - a situation rendered all themore humiliating by the fact that his condition was frequently mistakenfor drunkeness. In 1993, James was admitted to a nursing home after collapsingin the street. His decline was so rapid that he was soon bedridden and effectively helpless.It was around that time, according to his sister Margaret, that James beganasking her for help in ending his life. Margaret, however, could not bringherself to assist in her brother's death, attempting instead to consoleJames with the vain hope that a cure for his condition might be found. By Christmas 1995, James was virtually unrecognisable. His wasted muscleswere no longer under his control, and his emaciated body was contortedby frequent convulsions. He had developed a variety of complications, includingkidney and chest infections and liver damage, and he was barely able toswallow. In addition, he faced the indignity of relying upon his familyand carers to attend to his most intimate personal needs. After spendingChristmas with his family at Margaret's home, Paul was bathing James whenhis brother asked once more for help in ending his life. This time, Paul could deny his brother's request no longer. The followingevening, he gave James, who had already consumed a quantity of alcohol,around five or six times his prescribed dosage of Temazepam. When he returnedto the bedroom some time later, Paul found James still alive but unconscious,at which point he placed a pillow over his brother's face and suffocatedhim. He immediately informed the rest of the family what he had done. Paul was arrested, and remanded in custody. Still reeling from the traumaof James's death, he now faced the horrifying reality of being chargedwith murder. Legally, he was in a difficult situation. He did not disputethat he had taken his brother's life, nor that he had done so deliberately.Furthermore, his circumstances were not of the sort which would ordinarilysee the charge mitigated to one of culpable homicide. This being so, hecould well have experienced difficulty in defending himself against themurder charge, and, if convicted, would have faced a mandatory life sentence. Lord Macfadyen was left greater discretion when it came to sentencing when,in the event, Paul Brady's plea of guilty to culpable homicide was acceptedby the Crown. While admitting that he had considered imposing a custodialsentence, Lord Macfadyen eventually elected to admonish Brady. In so doing,he made reference to "a combination of powerful mitigating circumstances"which had influenced his decision, including the fact that Brady had actedout of "compassion rather than from any malicious motive or any desireto make matters easier" for himself. He also referred to the factthat Paul's acts were carried out "at his [James's] own earnest, andplainly heartfelt, request." The decision elicited the now predictable response from the Roman CatholicChurch, with Scottish spokesman Father Tom Connelly stressing that theChurch adhered to the maxim that "Thou shalt not kill." Dr GeorgeChalmers, of the Church of Scotland's board of social responsibility, alsostated his opposition to euthanasia, expressing concern that the case wouldestablish a precedent. Lord Macfadyen, however, was very careful to emphasizethat the illegality of Paul Brady's actions had been recognised, and thatit was only the "exceptional" circumstances of this case whichhad deterred him from imposing a custodial sentence. Brady's is the second major case concerning end-of-life decisions to bedecided before the Scottish courts this year; in April, the Court of Sessiondecided to allow artificial feeding and hydration to be withdrawn fromJanet Johnstone. It is, however, the first to deal with an example of whatcould properly be referred to as voluntary euthanasia. As with the Johnstone case, the decision in the Brady case has provokedsomething of a mixed response from advocates of reform in this area. WhileLord Macfadyen's decision not to imprison Paul Brady has been widely welcomed,there is also dismay that a case such as this should have to be resolvedby recourse to the criminal courts. It is the view of many supporters ofa right to die that James Brady's was a classic example of the kind ofcase in which medical assistance should be available to an individual whowishes to exercise control over the timing and circumstances of his death. James Brady was incurably and terminally ill, unable to control even themovements of his own body. He was well aware of the fact that the futureheld only the prospect of more suffering. Yet in order to put an end tohis suffering, he had to ask of his own loved ones that they subject themselvesto the emotional ordeal of extinguishing his life by their own hands, togetherwith the threat of a lengthy prison sentence.

As part of probably the most influential andrespected official survey conducted in Britain, Professor Donnison, thecurrent Vice-Convener of VESS, authors the background work that VESS canuse as political ammunition in the fight for reform. Euthanasia - helping people out of this world when they decide that theywant to leave it - has gone on since the dawn of time. But it was seldomtalked about. People usually died in their own homes. What happened intheir last hours was known only to their closest relatives and perhapsto a doctor or nurse. But now decisions about death are seldom out of theheadlines for long. Why the change? The advance of medical technology is bringing a steadily growing majorityof deaths into hospitals where life, of a sort, may be prolonged for along time. Someone has to decide what nature used to decide for us. Thosedecisions are no longer taken privately in a small family group but amidsta constantly changing crowd of doctors, nurses, patients and technicians. Death itself grows harder to define. In Britain at any one time there areabout two thousand people who have spent more than six months in a persistentvegetative state from which they will never recover. Many dread the pointlessindignity of such a fate, and they are asserting their right to be heardwith growing confidence. Whose death is it anyway? Meanwhile, as drugs have been made less lethal suicide becomes harder toarrange without professional help. Ten years ago you could get a prescriptionfor sleeping pills, go home and swallow the lot, and that was that. Nowyou just wake up with a splitting headache. For these and other reasons, more and more decisions about the ending oflife are brought to the courts which are ill-equipped to handle them. Canit be right that some people kill themselves while still capable of doingso because they know they cannot ask anyone to help them once they becomeincapable? Or that doctors are entitled to withhold treatment from dyingpatients if "best practice" suggests it would not be "intheir best interests", but cannot then withdraw it unless the treatmenthas clearly failed? Or that a court should be asked to decide whether afeeding tube which accidentally fell out should be replaced? Or that manygood doctors admit that they have risked their careers by helping patientsto die when they were asked for that last service? Such dilemmas have ledsome of our best judges to conclude that it is high time Parliament reviewedthe whole issue. The increasingly angry debate about euthanasia helps to explain the reluctanceof politicians to tackle this hot potato. On the one hand are those whosay that "Life is a gift from God and is not ours to do with as weplease". (Cardinal Winning's spokesman recently.) On the other arethose who say that "There is a constitutionally protected interestin determining the time and manner of one's own death". (A recentdecision by a U.S. Federal Appeals Court.) Both standpoints can be forcefullyargued. But what do the British people think of them?. The most thorough study yet made of their opinions appears in the latestof thirteen annual reports on British Social Attitudes, published today.This shows that the more extreme contenders on both sides speak for smallminorities of our people. Seven situations which might justify euthanasiawere described. Only 5 per cent of those interviewed would oppose euthanasiain every one of them; and only 7 per cent would approve it in every one.The great majority of our fellow citizens would approve it in some casesbut not in others. They are a cautious, pragmatic lot without clear-cutprinciples: very British. When seeking explanations for profound differences of opinion in Britain,the usual suspects are education, class, political allegiance and gender.But these throw little light on this case. The most resolute opponentsof euthanasia are those who go regularly to church (of any religion); thosewho oppose abortion, suicide and capital punishment; and those who worryabout the power of doctors and do not trust them. Other factors play apart, but these are the most important. Those who chose "the rightto life" as their slogan may have tapped a deeply rooted seam of valuescutting across class and politics. But time is likely to be on the side of the reformers. Acceptance of abortionand suicide, abandonment of church going and other patterns associatedwith support for euthanasia are more often found among younger people thanamong the older people whom they will steadily replace as time goes by. Reform, when it comes, will have to be by private member's bill, for eachParty is pretty evenly split on the issue. Changes in the law will be piecemeal,opening a way to euthanasia in some cases but not in others, and leavingplenty of room for further argument. That may seem a disappointingly messyoutcome. But it may be no bad thing that we shall have time to monitorwhat happens and make sure that proper safeguards are built in before wego further.

This interest has both a UK and an international dimension. Death, Dying and the Law highlights the legal and ethical dilemmas surrounding this issue from a comparative perspective and draws some conclusions about the role of the doctor, the individual and the law-makers in this moral minefield.

Later will be hectic. Before I even leave the house each day, I mentally prioritise the jobs for the day ahead and make a list (although this often needs updating as new exigencies arise). 8.30am: try to sort out problems with mail being repeatedly wrongly delivered. Not much luck - usual excuses from the GPO. 9am: down to the post office. Buy stamps, and also check weight of the newsletter so we don't overpay the GPO for franking. Back in the Office, finish imprinting the foreign newsletter envelopes Airmail and Small Packet, then phone to arrange collection. Sort out mix-ups with suppliers over the phone as I open the first of the mail. Scan the thick bundle of information on the political conferences as I mess with the computer to get it to work properly: debugged files supplied by Microsoft turn out to include a bugged file that needs correcting from an earlier update. Pre-sort the mail: a)letters that don't need a reply, b)letters that can be answered with a phone call, c)letters that can be delegated for reply, d)letters for reply (the last group is sorted roughly according to urgency). A long letter from a veteran campaigner who is now terminally ill deserves particular and immediate attention. Stack bills in a pile to be dealt with later. 11am: Roast beef roll and soft drink from the take away. Scan the email letters as I munch. Phone goes - elderly man in some distress and who has difficulty talking so the call takes a while. Put the phone down but it rings with a stream of callers who have minor, but time-consuming queries. Finish preparing a staff assessment and development form for a new research assistant who has just successfully completed her probationary period. Make some tea. News comes over the Internet of international developments in Australia and Canada (no charges in the Rodriguez assisted suicide case.) Scan through it intently to assess the relative importance then relay highlights to the Institute of Law & Ethics in Medicine (who are researching a v.e. bill on a grant from VESS). Tea's gone cold. 1pm: Try to clear my desk. It's a bit like parting the Red Sea. 2pm: colleagues arrive. Ask John if he will do a short piece for the new Contributors' Bulletin. Formal interview with Deirdre to introduce the development and assessment program. 2.30pm: Deirdre and I attack the mound of newsletters - all the foreign destination ones need to be sorted by zone and counted before the GPO calls to collect the 1700 or so packages. We stuff them into eight sacks, double check the arithmetic, and prepare a cover letter and cheque. Phone goes while we're doing this and we handle membership queries at the same time, but everything is ready when the GPO calls. John brings in his piece, ready for typing. We all take a ten minute coffee break and chat about the latest movies. 3.10pm: plan the afternoon workload with Deirdre. We get through as much as possible of the backlog of subscriptions, reinstatements, bank orders, information queries, book orders, address changes etc. Deirdre is now up to speed on most of the 101 or so computer operations that we use to handle the data, but we'll both work on it until about 7pm, which should hopefully also allow time to decimate the correspondence tray. John pens a letter to one of our friends and colleagues abroad and leaves about 4pm. By about 6.30pm we seem to have made quite a lot of progress, judging from the mountain of mail-to-be-posted in the overflowing out-tray. There has been a minor snag, when the database program, overloaded from trying to do a Beyond Final Exit mail-shot last week, seized up. Miraculously we get it going again. Deirdre's due to finish at 7pm but I'm hoping she'll want to work late. We decide to stop and go out for pies and then do a second shift. Lock the Office for 40 minutes. Back at the Office and we start the new six-monthly bulletin we promised benefactors. Last year, when we reorganised the membership subscriptions, as a courtesy and note of appreciation to those members who send 50, 100, 250, and 500 pounds a year, we promised additional six-monthly bulletins. Nine months later and we still haven't produced one, so Deirdre and I go through the mountain of stuff we didn't have room for in the Newsletter and select a few of the more interesting or informative pieces for a bulletin. I'd planned on four to five hours maximum, but neither of us want to sacrifice potential quality merely to go home a bit earlier. We finish at 3.30am, exhausted, but pleased with a job well done. The extra time for me is vocational (i.e. I wouldn't choose otherwise, although the demands of doing the job properly mean there is not much choice about it either). I get home to bed and pour myself what I feel is a well-deserved glass of red wine. Tuesday Slightly late start. Read up on the Irish hunger strikes as the coffee boils. This is particularly interesting as we have just launched a world first on death-by-starvation in Beyond Final Exit, and this documentary account supplements the prison officers' technical reports which formed part of the background material in preparing the starvation article. Interrupted as the phone rings. It's the VESS badge suppliers and I negotiate a new supply. Down the coffee while going over some legacy details/options. We've been left some shares, most of which will probably need to be converted to cash. Check the diary for the next two weeks. Medical Law conference in Amsterdam cancelled. Schedule a meeting on Thursday requested by VES London to plan our joint campaign for the political party conferences. Answer the fax and phone messages. Cappuccino at lunch time from the take away pleasantly keeps the caffeine levels up. Weather's wonderful this week. Remember with fondness the words of a friend who is dying of cancer, reminding me of the importance of pausing in the midst of work to enjoy the beauty and quiet moments in life that make it so special. Stroll back to the Office feeling slightly elated. I have a tendency to get obsessive about work occasionally and so remind myself of things like there's millions of children dying of hunger in the world - dying in dignity is a hoped-for luxury for people in well-off countries. 4.30pm: start writing a response to a journal article (The article contains inaccuracies about assisted suicide and the law in Scotland). Start to prepare an abstract for an upcoming conference on living wills. Write up this diary so far. 7pm: home for dinner and I practice a few songs on guitar while it cooks. 8.30pm: back to the Office. Check the latest euthanasia on-line news and gossip. Tidy up and take two big bags of mail down to the postbox. Sort some info from CD-Rom to back up coming Newsletter articles on Kevorkian and the Netherlands. Decide this is probably the best night this week to take some time off. Call a couple of pals and go to see a late-night movie. Home by about 12.30am. Resist the temptation to go back into the Office to do some typing (I'm a natural night person) and take myself off to bed with chicken soup and a book, managing a couple of pages before I fall asleep. Wednesday Reschedule the Thursday meeting for the morning instead of the afternoon. That way, if it goes swiftly I can maybe work on values histories developments with the Natural Death Centre in the afternoon. The reason for the urgency is that advertising deadlines are on Friday. Book a ticket on the four o'clock train. Zip through the mail and outstanding urgent business, adrenalined with a large espresso coffee and a get it done now mentality. Most of the mail today is fairly straightforward, thankfully. Invitation from Edinburgh University to do a guest seminar but not till December. Phone Deirdre to see if she can come in early, which she does. One of the great things about Deirdre is that I can throw her in at the deep end when the pressure's on and she doesn't panic, just gets on with it. The other great thing is that her help means I occasionally get a night off now, although it would be better if we could have her working full time. Get the Contributors' Circular mailed out. Just before we close the Office, Deirdre gets her first Sams call - a suicidally depressed person in tears on the phone and wanting to talk (we call them Sams calls as Samaritans phone technique is needed for them). She handles it, but feels drained by the experience. We talk it through briefly, though not to the extent I would have wished as I have to get the train. 4pm: en route for London. My bag includes four copies of Medical Law Reports, an undergraduate paper on euthanasia written by a student who did some research at the Office, a magazine with some computer developments that look useful, the book on Irish hunger strikes, and a clutch of articles photocopied from the medical and legal journals. The last of these is particularly important and train journeys are one of the few times I get to read them. My method involves highlighting quotes which will be useful in talks and papers, underline the authors for ready identification, and putting the initials of the journal in red at the front top right. The quotes are later added to a computer database by author, together with the full reference, and the papers filed in the Office by journal title. This provides a dual resource facility: 1) In preparing articles and seminars the database can be rapidly searched for the most appropriate information and quotations - these can be copied directly into the wordprocessed draft without re-typing. 2) The database provides a key to the most useful article for answering queries that arise. This assists both national and international querents within the movement, as well as professional organisations, politicians, the media, and degree-level students. The VESS Office fulfils a function as a resource centre for all questions on euthanasia and assisted suicide - it is perhaps one of our most important roles as a Society attempting to facilitate change. The train's too noisy to get into it straight away - it'll be quieter later on in the journey. I finish the abstract for the living wills conference. I've composed most of it in my head and just need to get it down on paper. At 5pm I get forty winks. I'll probably be up late tonight preparing for tomorrow's meeting, so I look on it as a sort of investment. Thursday 10am: meet with Meredith, VES London Public Relations Officer. All hopes of getting through everything this morning are dashed as I realise the enormity of the task. Measurements for the vast array of options from the political conference organisers on furniture, carpet, display space and accessories, are supplied in a patchwork medley of inches, millimetres and No Measurements. So eliminating guesswork from the physical layout alone is tiresome. The advertising deadline for the conference brochure is tomorrow, and the proofs from the printers arrive by fax and are hopelessly bad, so we plead for an extension on copy dates and put pressure on the printers, pulling out the stops to try to convey exactly what is needed. Then the display itself. Meredith's marketing background is very different to my own and the process of thrashing out ideas is invigorating but also hard work. As the costs of producing a professional looking and effective display will be quite considerable, it is important to get it right - especially when it is likely to be fairly crucial in the next stage of the campaign. We analyse different conceptual approaches and decide on theformat. To assess the options within that format we need to look at production processes and costs, and so quickly grill two or three specialist companies over the phone to get figures and breakdowns. Then we work on content. The subject matter needs to be emotive and/or attention-grabbing, but there are a lot of no-go areas: pictures of Tony Bland could cause distress to his family; pictures of Dr Cox could be even worse - perhaps even precipitating a lawsuit. Then we have to examine copyright availability, potential quality of reproduction when enlarged, and whether the pictures would be manipulated by computer graphics or conventional re-photographing. A call to the VESS Vice-Convener, who is also experienced in political campaigning, produces a couple of useful ideas on the display area and title of the stall. Finally we look at manning the stands and the formalities demanded by the organisers for allocation of passes. We eventually get through it, and decide how to share the division of further labour and allocation of responsibilities for the various deadlines. The VES London office closes at 5.15pm and I go to meet a friend who has an active interest in euthanasia. The kind offer of a couch for the night means I can stay over till tomorrow without leaving the VES meeting early or running up hotel bills for a second night. Friday Make time for a visit to the opticians. Then plan drugs research. VESS library research is centred in Glasgow University's extensive library, but for intensive work the Royal Society of Medicine Library in London is more comprehensive. The librarians recognise me and allow me computer access at no charge. It's also a wonderful building to work in, beautifully furnished and expert staff who have time to assist if necessary. If there's anything obscure that they can't find, a search can be made through a British Library facility that accesses material from anywhere in the world. Weighed down with papers, I opt for the last train (7pm) - the queue is out onto the pavement. The train is packed. I chat to an attractive woman sitting next to me. Unfortunately she is only going as far as Peterborough, but before she gets off she tells me of an assisted suicide story in today's Times (I haven't had time to read a paper today). No, she hasn't kept the paper. I scavenge through the length of the train until I find a discarded copy. Read the article, which reports on what could well be a test case in the USA. Get back to some reading and writing as the train quietens down, and work my way through a bottle of red wine that I've brought with me. Back in Edinburgh for 11.40pm. Open some of the mail (61 items), faxes (5), phone messages (8) and emails (8). A few interesting pieces, including a go-ahead from the WF Board for a leaflet I drafted for them. The only really urgent item appears to be a fax from a medical worker abroad who needs some technical info on specific suicide drugs within twenty-four hours. VESS has been an international repository for this type of information since the advent of Departing Drugs. The clinician is known to me and I make a quick telephone call. Then I check the Internet for news of the American assisted suicide story, forwarding essential details to the Institute electronically. It's an important case, but not worth doing a news release on from the VESS Office at the present time. Two phone messages and one of the faxes are from friends whom I have ignored again this week. Make a mental note of friends I want to get together with for a pint or maybe lunch at some point next week. It's shortly after one a.m. If I get home for a quick shower, I'll make the late night local bar in time for a quick drink with some other nighthawks. Saturday The mail has grown again. Go into the Office for a couple of hours in the morning to open and sort it all, but it'll be the afternoon before I can make headway with any serious work. The main item is again about self-deliverance, this time from a Dutch doctor who needs some assistance on planning his research. I always answer these sorts of queries: in the relatively new field of self-deliverance research I need all the friends I can get. Break for dinner about 7pm, back to work at around 9pm, and work straight through till 3am, mostly writing and exchanging emails on suicide information. Sunday Have a lie-in, rising late and eventually getting into gear with coffee as black as an Ethiopian seductress (dreams!) and some opera played loudly in the background to wake me up properly. Don't go into the Office till the afternoon though. Then work through most of the stuff I want out of the way by Monday morning. It's a case of gearing up now for the Committee meeting in a fortnight, which I find stressful. The committee, all volunteers, meet approximately every six weeks to discuss and make policy decisions about euthanasia issues and matters affecting the Society. Part of my work consists of briefing them on these issues so they have the information to see the likely results of deciding one way or another on any particular issue. Generally it is impossible to convey this adequately in the amount of paperwork which it would be realistic to expect them to read and assimilate (or the Office to type up), and fortunately most of the Committee are guided by the Office when a particular course is indicated. Of course this doesn't always happen, which means that the reasoning on any particular issue and supporting documentation then has to be prepared minutely. There are two issues which are on very shaky ground and will entail immense work merely to clarify the facts. There's also a newspaper wanting to run a story on euthanasia so that will be competing for attention tomorrow, together with the things in the must do pile of mail that can't easily be delegated. But all in all it's been a relatively quiet week. No committee meetings, no public talks, no major media interviews or press releases. Typical? Depends how you define it. The VESS Office is events and task driven, so routine is out of the question. My own agenda, on starting the job, was 1) Living wills - there seemed to be no properly researched document in existence; 2) Drugs - the books available were no more than the opinions of one or two doctors without any proper research or supporting evidence; 3) an assisted suicide / voluntary euthanasia law, or a reform to enable it to happen with proper safeguards for those who need and want it - all the Bills proposed so far have been aptly described as Mickey Mouse efforts (attempts to thrust one-page ready-made bills at parliament without any allowance for the reality of the existing framework of the law). The first two are largely accomplished, and the third is under way, due to VESS. I assess every potential task as being more helpful or less helpful in achieving these goals. That's what we're here for and I get impatient at times with people in the movement who concentrate on peripheral matters but don't get involved by speaking or writing publicly about the subject of euthanasia itself, missing the wood for the trees. They in turn get irritated with me for not considering their input (which can entail a lot of extra work) as important or feeling that there is a difference of opinion when in fact it is simply deflecting from the main issues. But it's all part of the game and no-one said it would be easy. I wish I could buy large boxes of tact from Safeways! Another week finished and I haven't lost my sense of humour, my enjoyment of the job, or my sense of separate identity. I'm even going to get to another movie tonight if I'm lucky. If we can accomplish the third objective that I set myself when I started the job then perhaps I can retire or do something else - write a book or work abroad or get involved with something like the Genome project or Amnesty or something. I like challenges and successes. After that I get bored...

Principal author of Departing Drugs and co-authorof Beyond Final Exit, he also pioneered the first extensive UK researchinto living wills and developed the VESS Newsletter from its then 4-6 pagesto its present internationally acclaimed format. But those are things hedoes in his spare time, often on top of an exhausting schedule of pressinterviews and public lectures. What keeps him going in a job which increasinglydominates his life and absorbs all his energy in his commitment to humanrights? It started at the age of 15 when, having read something of the morebarbarous history of the Christian church and compared it with the gentlerprecepts of creeds like Buddhism, he wrote to his Anglican vicar resigningfrom his religion. Later, working for a small publishers specialising inhuman rights and civil liberties, he was asked to investigate VESS. Hebecame hooked and, after many years working on the committee and helpinggenerally, took it on full time, abandoning a successful marketing careerto live on a quarter of his previous salary. Unacceptable though his lifestyle might be to many, he has no regrets.His salaried work, 40 hours a week in the VESS Office, he sees as the necessarynuts and bolts enabling essential stepping stones to be laid. "Asvoluntary societies grow, the internal politics become ever more unmanageable,but without VESS we would have very little hope of effecting any change.Working as staff rather than on the committee can be stressful, but it'sgiven me the opportunity to make a lasting contribution in some areas." The office work is not just routine work with added research. It's emotionallyexhausting, and to help him cope with it and give whatever help is possible,Docker took a training course with the Samaritans. Mostly he is restrictedto giving the caller space and freedom to talk, since giving personal adviceis still illegal. His latest project has been to create a a website onthe Internet, providing reference material and informed comment to thousandsof supporters.

Welcome. If, one day, you become terminally or unrelievably ill (and you don't happen to be a Dutch citizen)you may have little choice about the timing of your death. A large proportion of suicide attempts are botched, resultingin increased suffering and indignity. Scottish Exit was the first organisation in the world, in 1980, to publish a bookon how to avoid botch-ups. There have been many imitators, but it was only in 1993 that such information was put on a scientific footing withthe international publication of Departing Drugs. The information is restricted.

Pourquoi le droit de mourir dans la dignit�? La dur�e moyenne de la vie a augment� sensiblement dans les pays industrialis�s. Aussi longtemps que nous sommes en bonne sant�, c'est un don de la providence. Mais les progr�s des techniques m�dicales qui ont contribu�es � nous garder en bonne sant� peuvent aussi �tre utilis�s � prolonger notre agonie. Notre consentement est n�cessaire pour tout traitement m�dical, mais la plupart des gens acceptent automatiquement les propositions du m�decin. Ils peuvent d�s lors passer des mois ou des ann�es avec une qualit� de vie tellement d�plorable qu'ils ne d�sirent plus que la mort. Ce que veut la majorit� D'apr�s les sondages, la majorit� des gens estiment que les m�decins devraient �tre autoris�s � aider un malade en phase terminale et sans espoir de gu�rison � mourir, sur la demande r�p�t�e du patient. Dans presque tous les pays, un m�decin qui le ferait pourrait �tre accus� de meutre. Le droit � choisir Dans la monde entier, les personnes qui se pr�occupent de cette situation ont cr�e des associations pour le droit de mourir dans la dignit�. Beaucoup d'entre elles sont appel�es des associations pour l'euthanasie volontaire. Certaines pr�f�rent envisager l'aide � la bonne mort sous la forme du suicide assist�. Quelles sont les r�alisations des associations pour le droit de mourir dans la dignit�? Les membres de ces associations re�oivent un �testament biologique� (Living will) ou une directive anticip�e, qui pr�cise quels traitements sont d�sir�s et quelles techniques de prolongation de la vie sont refus�es dans les derniers instants. En Hollande, la coop�ration entre la profession m�dicale et les tribunaux est arriv�e au point que les m�decins ne sont pas poursuivis pour avoir, en cas de nec�ssit�, administr� des m�dicaments pour autant qu'ils respectent des directives tr�s strictes.Les m�decins hollandais s'occupent uniquement de leurs propres patients. Si vous �tes domicili� ailleurs et si vous d�sirez une telle option � la fin de votre vie, la situation l�gale doit changer dans votre propre pays. Vous pouvez aider ce processus. Le premier pas dans cette direction est de contacter votre association locale pour le droit de mourir dans la dignit� (voir au verso). Si une telle soci�t� n'existe pas dans votre r�gion, contactez celle qui vous semble �tre la plus rapproch�e g�ographiquement ou linguistiquement, ou contactez: The WFRDS Secretary, Mr Malcolm Hurwitt, 61 Minterne Avenue, Norwood Green, Southall, Middx UB2 4HP, United Kingdom.

The Rt Revd Bishop Alastair Haggart could expect all of these were itnot for the good fortune that he joined the VESS Committee after retiring.But he has not been let off too lightly. Apart from causing great rippleswithin the Episcopalian community, he has contributed his influential voiceon a punishing schedule of media talks about v.e. and given many hoursof work demanded of a Convener outside of committee time. Outsiders often express surprise and admiration when we proudly tellthem we have a Bishop heading our Committee! Yet, as Alastair explains,euthanasia is not an anti-Christian issue. "There are two reasonswhy I am involved with VESS: the first that it is one of the great complexand urgent questions facing western humanity, and the second is becauseI am a Christian and have a strong respect for the sanctity of life."He speaks of the principle of "double effect" as a cover forwell-intentioned fudges. 35 years ago, when he worked closely with doctorsin Dundee, he tells of open collusion between doctors, clergy and family.The wife of a cancer patient might hear the words "I'm going to leavethese pills - if the pain gets very severe don't hesitate to give them- they are very strong." From a strict Calvinistic upbringing, he was something of a revolutionary,regarding the way creationists viewed things as "blinkered."He says, "From the day I was a student I was committed to a searchfor truth and I've tried to stick to that in the face of cultural and politicalpassions." But he believes we will maximise the probabilities forsuccessful v.e. reform by being open to those who disagree with us, helpingthem to abandon their simplifications. "Our attitude and advocacymust be compatible with concerns such as compassion and respect for others'autonomy and integrity in the widest sense. Bishop Haggart practiceswhat he preaches - next May he has been invited to speak to hospice doctorsat the Edinburgh's Royal College of Nursing.

I swear by Hippocrates... We hear the "Hippocratic Oath" endlessly referred to as the excuse when doctors don't want to do something! Not that modern day doctors actually "take" the Oath - but what does it actually say? Here it is, together with a short commentary about this much quoted figure. Introductory note HIPPOCRATES, the celebrated Greek physician, was a contemporary of the historian Herodotus. He was born in the island of Cos between 470 and 460 B.C., and belonged to the family that claimed descent from the mythical Aesculapius, son of Apollo. There was already a long medical tradition in Greece before his day, and this he is supposed to have inherited chiefly through his predecessor Herodicus; and he enlarged his education by extensive travel. He is said, though the evidence is unsatisfactory, to have taken part in the efforts to check the great plague which devastated Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war. He died at Larissa between 380 and 360 B.C. The works attributed to Hippocrates are the earliest extant Greek medical writings, but very many of them are certainly not his. Some five or six, however, are generally granted to be genuine, and among these is the famous "Oath." This interesting document shows that in his time physicians were already organized into a corporation or guild, with regulations for the training of disciples, and with an esprit de corps and a professional ideal. One saying occurring in the words of Hippocrates has achieved universal currency, though few who quote it today are aware that it originally referred to the art of the physician. It is the first of his "Aphorisms": "Life is short, and the Art long; the occasion fleeting; experience fallacious, and judgment difficult. The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and externals cooperate." (From "Harvard Classics Volume 38, Copyright 1910 by P.F. Collier and Son. This text is placed in the Public Domain, June 1993.) THE OATH OF HIPPOCRATES I SWEAR by Apollo the physician and Aesculapius, and Health, and All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this stipulation to reckon him who taught me this Art equally dear to me as my parents, to share my substance with him, and relieve his necessities if required; to look upon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee or stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and those of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath according to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgement, I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art. I will not cut persons labouring under the stone, but will leave this to be done by men who are practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses I enter, I will go into them for the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and, further, from the seduction of females or males, of freemen and slaves. Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret. While I continue to keep this Oath unviolated, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected by all men, in all times. But should I trespass and violate this Oath, may the reverse be my lot.

It is not allowed by statute, but the law accepts a standard defence from doctors that have adhered to official guidelines. These hinge on voluntariness of the request and unrelievable-ness of the suffering. It is not a condition that the patient is terminally ill or that the suffering is physical. In practice, citizens of other countries are not eligible for euthanasia in the Netherlands. UK residents can get a free factsheet on the Termination of Life by a Doctor in the Netherlands by writing to the Press & Cultural Section of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in London (Tel 0171-584-5040 ext.413), an excerpt from which is printed below. &quotEuthanasia is popularly taken to mean any form of termination of life by a doctor. The definition under Dutch law, however, is narrower. It means the termination of life by a doctor at the express wish of a patient. The request to the doctor must be voluntary, explicit and carefully considered and it must have been made repeatedly. Moreover, the patient's suffering must be unbearable and without any prospect of improvement. Pain relief administered by a doctor may shorten a patient's life. As is the case in other countries, this is seen as a normal medical decision in terminal care and not as euthanasia." Terminology The word &quotvoluntary" in voluntary euthanasia emphasizes the express intent of the person wanting to die, and distinguishes it from mercy killingor any other form of killing. Voluntary euthanasia is performed by, or at the autonomous request of, an informed and competentpatient. In the Netherlands this phrase, however, is not used; the word &quoteuthanasia" simply implying voluntary euthanasia, since if it is notvoluntary it is not regarded in the Netherlands as euthanasia. Euthanasia comes under the generic heading of &quotMedical Decisions to End Life" (MDELs). It is defined by the Dutch Government Commission on Euthanasia (1985) as "A deliberate termination of an individual's life at that individual's request, by another. Or, in medical practice, the active and deliberate termination of a patient's life, on that patient's request, by a doctor." Requirements Doctors will not be prosecuted if they have met the substantive requirements published by the Royal Dutch Medical Association in 1984 (also confirmed by court decisions). These are: the patient makes a voluntary request the request must be well considered the wish for death is durable the patient is in unacceptable suffering the physician has consulted a colleague who agrees the proposed course of action Notification The Royal Dutch Medical Association and the Ministry of Justice in 1990 agreed a notification procedure with the following elements, subsequently laid down in regulations under the Burial Act. the physician performing the euthanasia or assited suicide does not issue a declaration of natural death, but informs the local medical examiner of the circumstances by filling in an extensive questionnaire the medical examiner reports to the districty attorney the district attorney then decides whether or not a prosecution shouold be instituted Physical administration In the Netherlands, the practice is an injection to render the patient comatose, followed by a second injection to stop the heart. Official guidelines encourage the doctor to allow the patient to take the lethal dosage, under supervision, if this is a practical alternative. Applicability to other countries In the last fifty years, several western countries have grappled with the dilemmas associated with advancing medical technology, greater life expectancy and the difficulties associated with unbearable suffering. Some are looking at ways to allow euthanasia, and the Netherlands is often cited as a role model. Many researchers, in the Netherlands and abroad, have drawn attention to the specific characteristics of Dutch culture and suggested that countries need to find their own solutions rather than simply try to import the Dutch system wholesale. An Australian state has passed a law that both allows euthanasia and promotes palliative care; Several American states have presented challenges to the constitutionality of laws against assisted suicide. Major research continues in Scotland, home of the first book in the world on &quotself-deliverance". Some of the factors that make the Netherlands different: There is a high standard of medical care - amongst the highest in the world. The majority (over 95%) of people are covered by private medical insurance, guaranteeing a large core of basic healthcare, including long-term care Palliative care is very advanced. Pain and palliation centres are attached to all hospitals. Other countries, by comparison, have costly but relatively few such centres (normally known as &quothospices") During the Nazi occupation, Dutch doctors went to concentration camps rather than divulge the names of their patients. This is one of the factors that increase the relationship of trust between doctors and patients, to a much higher level than in most other countries. Moreover, most patients know their doctor well, and over a considerable time period.

When the thread finally breaks... Colin Gavaghan VESS researcher Colin Gavaghan traces the sad story of Janet Johnstone, and the legal dilemmas faced in Scotland's first right-to-die case. On May 31st, at approximately 10.27p.m., 53 year old Janet Johnstone died. Her death, coming fifteen days after the withdrawal of artificial feeding, brought to an end not only one of the most highly publicized and controversial cases to come before Scotland's civil courts in recent years, but also four years of anguish endured by her family. Mrs Johnstone's case had already seen Scots legal history made. On April 24th, in the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom ruled that life-sustaining treatment could be withdrawn from Johnstone, a patient at Lanarkshire's Law Hospital. A number of deeply contentious and often rather complex questions, both legal and ethical as well as medical, have arisen out of the case. These have, however, faced the constant danger of being overshadowed by tabloid speculation as to the nature of Janet Johnstone's relationship with her husband, the possible reasons behind her attempted suicide, and Peter Johnstone's much publicized ostracization by many other residents of the small Lanarkshire town. The news of Mrs.Johnstone's death saw a torrent of pent-up emotions expressed by her husband. Peter Johnstone, who has been married to Janet for thirty-two years, spoke of the emotional trauma which he has endured over the last four years. Although obviously deeply affected by the news, his grief was tempered by relief that the ordeal which he and his family had endured was soon to be over, telling journalists that "For me, it's both a relief and a heartache." The matter first came to public attention in August of last year, when Law Hospital NHS Trust, supported by the patient's family, sought assurance from Court of Session that the withdrawal of nasogastric feeding would not give rise to civil or criminal action against the medical staff concerned. Janet Jonnstone has been in a persistent vegetative state since shortly after an apparent suicide attempt in January 1992. The case appeared before Lord Cameron, but was deemed by him to be of sufficient complexity and importance to merit a request for guidance from the Court's Inner House. On 22 March, five Court of Session judges, including the Lord President, Lord Hope, held that it would be competent for Lord Cameron to authorise the withdrawal of nasogastric feeding, were he to reach a decision that such a course of action would be appropriate based upon the arguments and facts presented to him. The Lord President stressed, however, that this would not necessarily exempt any doctor acting in such a manner from criminal liability, the jurisdiction of the Court of Session being restricted to civil matters. The case was then referred back to Lord Cameron. As regards the possibility of a decision to remove treatment giving rise to a criminal prosecution, the Lord Advocate, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, issued a policy statement in April of this year stating that he would not authorise the prosecution of a doctor who, acting in good faith and with the authority of the Court of Session, withdraws life-sustaining treatment from a PVS patient, with the result that the patient dies. All that remained was for Lord Cameron, having been authorised by the Inner House to deliver a decision on the matter, to hear the final arguments and come to a decision as to the determination of this particular case. After one more day, he did just that. Following the same line of reasonong as that employed by Lord Hope in the Inner House, Lord Cameron would appear to have based his decision on a determination of Janet Johnstone's "best interests." The application of the best interests test has often proved controversial in cases such as this. The nature of the persistent vegetative state is such that it could quite reasonably be contended that the patient is utterly incapable of possessing any interests of any kind. As Prof Sheila McLean, of Glasgow University's Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine, observed in her analysis: The best interests test is spurious because the nature of the diagnosis itself means that the person in PVS has no interests whatsoever, far less "best" ones. That this is so becomes quite evident upon consideration of Lord Hope's description of Janet Johnstone's condition: The function of consciousness has been lost forever. The patient is wholly unaware of her surroundings. She cannot see, hear, feel pain or pleasure, communicate by word or movement or make voluntary movements of any kind. The Court would appear to have circumvented this possible obstacle by employing a similar logic to that which formed the basis of the Bland case, i.e. that the task before the court was not to determine whether it was in the patient's interests to be allowed to die, but rather to consider whether it could be said to be in his or her interests to prolong life-sustaining treatment. In the Johnstone case, the Court of Session formed a similar opinion of the persistently vegetative patient to that taken by the House of Lords in Bland; that in view of her condition, it is no longer possible to suggest that the continuance of the treatment which is presently being administered, and has for some considerable time been given, to Mrs Johnstone to maintain her in her present condition in which she is permanently insensate, is of any benefit to her. That being so, there are no longer any best interests to be served by continuing such treatment. The Johnstone verdict prompted immediate condemnation from pro-life groups, and from representatives of the Roman Catholic Church. A last minute attempt to prevent the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment was made by Father James Morrow, a well-known pro life activist. However, his attempt to have an interdict granted against Law Hospital, preventing any action until a tutor had been appointed to represent Mrs Johnstone, was rejected by Lord Hamilton, who concluded that Fr Morrow was seeking to re-open issues which had already been considered at great length by the court. In addition, Lord Hamilton was not satisfied as to whether Fr Morrow's had legal title to raise such proceedings. Much of the opposition to the decision to allow Mrs Johnstone to die was particularly concerned by the perceived precedent set by the decision to allow the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration. The Catholic Church, while recognising that a doctor's obligation to preserve life extends only to the employment of "ordinary" means, does not accept that the provision of nasogastric feeding falls within the category of medical treatments which "impose an extraordinary burden on himself or others." Indeed, their opinion - and it is an opinion shared by a considerable number of others - is that its provision should not properly be regarded as medical treatment at all, but as the provision of "basic care." In a press statement shortly after the decision was known, Cardinal Thomas Winning made public his disapproval at the step the Court had taken. "Never before in Scotland has nourishment been equated with medical treatment," he argued. "Nourishment is a right of every human being and to deny food is to starve a person to death - this can never be morally right." This view was not shared by Brian Potter, Scottish secretary of the BMA. "Feeding is by a tube," he pointed out, "and this is an extraordinary means of keeping someone alive. Lord Cameron's ruling allows us to stop that." It could, however, be argued that the approach taken by the Court of Session in this case renders such semantic considerations to be largely irrelevant for practical purposes. If the Court is concerned primarily with what may be said to be in the patient's best interests, then questions as to whether the provision of artificial feeding constitute medical treatment, or whether naso-gastric feeding amounts to an extraordinary measure, may have a negligible bearing on the outcome of the case. If Janet Johnstone's life is deemed to be of no benefit to her, then its prolongation, by whatever means, could be seen as inherently futile, irrespective of the precise terminology which is employed. Almost inevitably, in view of recent well-documented cases of apparent error, some reservations were expressed as to the accuracy with which persistent vegetative state can be diagnosed. The danger of possible misdiagnosis was specifically addressed by Dr John Browning, Law Hospital's medical director. While "aware of cases in which people appear to be recovering from PVS," cases which he conceded could be said to "cast doubt over the diagnosis," he offered assurance that no such doubts concerned Mrs Johnstone's prognosis. "If we were not completely sure Mrs Johnstone was PVS," he insisted, "then we would not have gone down this avenue." Although welcomed by right-to-die organisations, the Johnstone decision has left many advocates of end of life choices feeling less than entirely satisfied. In one sense, it has reaffirmed what many see as a legally anomalous position with regard to decisions about death and dying. Once again, the courts would appear to have conceded that a decision to end the life of a patient accepted as being wholly without interests can be acceptable, while steadfastly refusing to sanction assistance for those who are capable of expressing preferences, and who, unlike Janet Johnstone, may reasonably be argued to have a positive interest in dying. As McLean observed: What our law does, therefore, is to endorse decisions which will result in the deaths of certain patients (most notably those who cannot express a preference) but not those who are competent to ask for aid in dying. In addition, reservations have been expressed over the way in which Janet Johnstone's life finally ended. While supporting the view that her life was of no value to her, some commentators have argued that, once the decision had been made to bring that life to an end, that result should have been achieved with as little delay as possible. Even if it was certain that the patient herself was completely oblivious to what was happening, the point has been made that a prolonged death through dehydration would only add to the distress of relatives and carers. It should, however, be borne in mind that, for as long as the distinction between acts and omissions continues to be relied upon in cases such as these, it is difficult to see what other course of action will be open to the Court. Certainly, any positive act, by a physician or any other party, carried out with the intention of hastening the patient's death, would almost certainly result in a criminal prosecution. Prof McLean is only one of many who would like to see this state of affairs reconsidered, with a view to allowing lives such as Janet Johnstone's to be ended with as much dignity, and as little prolongation of suffering for all concerned, as is possible. Opposing views as to the fate of Janet Johnstone will certainly continue to be voiced in the press and other media long after the last echoes have died away in the Court of Session. That many will oppose Lord Cameron's decision is certain, and even many of those who support the outcome may feel less than entirely satisfied by the reasoning underlying it, or the way in which the decision was put into effect. However, whatever criticisms may be levied at the verdict, it must be hoped that at least a degree of good will arise from it. Firstly, it seems inevitable that the publicity surrounding the case will act as a catalyst for a much needed public debate in Scotland on what McLean describes as "the end of life debate as a whole." And secondly, it must, of course, be hoped that the decision will in time bring relief to a Lanarkshire family who have already endured enough.

The Chief Executive informed me that the MNDA was opposed to voluntaryeuthanasia because it gave the wrong signals to newly diagnosed patientsand that, in any case, he had never before come across an MDA patient whosupported voluntary euthanasia. I informed him that he was clearly moreout of touch with his membership than I had previously imagined. Followingthis, the MNDA grudgingly asked me to write a debate-type piece for inclusionin their monthly newsletter, where I would be able to state my views anda patient with the opposing view would state theirs. Having written this,I was then informed that the article had been vetoed by the National ExecutiveCouncil, but would I like to write a little piece about some of my experienceswith alternative medicine! As you may imagine, my dealings with the MNDA have cooled somewhat sincethat time and this, combined with some ongoing problems we were havingwith them, promoted me to start another motor neurone disease charity:the Motor Neurone Disease Care and Research Society. MND is a degenerativeneurological condition which currently has no known cause or cure. Thedisease kills the nerves which control movement so that sufferers, whilstretaining total brain function and being able to feel pain, find themselvesgradually trapped inside a completely paralysed body. Average life expectancyafter diagnosis is three years. *BBC showing of a film made in the Netherlands of a manwith Motor Neurone Disease receiving euthanasia.

It may be used to supplement a Living Will, if you have one. Also, the Extended Values History Form is not copyrighted, and you are encouraged to make additional copies for friends and relatives to use. It is called an extended values history form to distinguish it from a short, scenario-based values history form. WHY A VALUES HISTORY FORM? A Values History Form recognizes that medical decisions we make for ourselves are based on those beliefs, preferences and values that matter most to us: How do we feel about our overall health? What personal relationships in our lives are important to us? How do we feel about independence or dependence? About pain, illness, dying and death? What are our goals for the future? A discussion of these and other values can provide important information for those who might, in the future, have to make medical decisions for us when we are no longer able to do so. Furthermore, a discussion of the questions asked on the Values History Form can provide a solid basis for families, friends, physicians and others when making such medical decisions. By talking about these issues ahead of time, family disagreements may be minimized. And when such decisions do need to be made, the burden of responsibility may be lessened because others feel confident of your wishes. HOW DO I FILL OUT THE VALUES HISTORY FORM? There are a number of ways in which you might begin to answer these questions. Perhaps you would like to write out some of your thoughts before you talk with anyone else. Or you might ask family and friends to come together and talk about your - and their - responses to the questions. Often, simply giving copies of the Extended Values History Form to others is enough to get people talking about a subject that, for many of us, is difficult and painful to consider. The most important thing to remember is that it is easier to talk about these issues BEFORE a medical crisis occurs. Feel free to add questions and comments of your own. WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY COMPLETED EXTENDED VALUES HISTORY FORM? Make sure that all those who might be involved in your health care are aware of you wishes: family, friends, physicians and other health care providers, your Pastor, your lawyer. If appropriate, give written copies to these people. But remember, each of us continues to grow and change, and so the Extended Values History Form should be discussed and updated fairly regularly. Consider attaching a copy of it to your Living Will, if you have one, or filing it with important medical papers. WHO SHOULD CONSIDER COMPLETING THIS VALUES HISTORY FORM? Everyone. While we often focus on older people, it is just as important that younger people discuss these issues and make their wishes known. Some of the most difficult medical decisions must be made on behalf of younger patients. If they had talked with families and friends, decision makers could feel they were following the patient's wishes. We hope this Extended Values History Form is of help to you, your families and friends. Many people have commented that it is important to reflect, not so much on How I want to die, but rather on How I want to LIVE until I die. Further evidence on the Values History - A Summary of Points Submitted by Chris Docker to the BMA Living Wills Code of Practice Committee 11 January 1995 (Skip this section if you want to go straight to making a values history) 1. Values history directives, whether dialogue, scenario, or story-based, provide a valuable format for discussionof withdrawing/withholding of life-sustaining-treatments, between doctors and patients (and, where appropriate,significant others). They may be used to decide future treatment options during incompetence, or, by showingunderlying core values, supplement an advance medical treatment-decision directive. 2. Values histories, unlike medicalized advance directives, only ask a patient to express views, are seen as lessthreatening than asking a healthy patient to make advance medical decisions about life and death, and are lessintrusive on a doctor's skill in making appropriate clinical decisions. Values histories get away from the&quotfear atmosphere" that can be engendered by traditional living wills - they do not cause a doctor tobe feel threatened by litigation, nor do they have the same potential to make a patient worry about dying if thehealth-care worker (rather than the patient) is the one to initiate discussion of the document (which it may beeminently desirable for the health care worker so to do). They are thus often a more acceptable document thanthe traditional advance directive. 3. The values history gives more realistic and specific guidance to next of kin or a significant other thantraditional advance directives or casual conversations. 4. If a patient expresses an interest in making an advance directive, the health care provider should makeavailable or encourage completion of a values history. 5. If the patient presents with a medicalized advance directive, the doctor should invite the patient to completea values history additionally, or cover a similar area as the values history form by means of dialogue with thepatient. 6. Some patients may wish to make a Values History Directive only. 7. Values histories are useful in a wide range of situations where the doctor needs to understand thepatient as a person, and could routinely be offered on registration with a new G.P. In today's hard-pressed National Health Service, theyhelp to provide personal knowledge about a patient that a doctor in times past would have acquired in a moreleisurely fashion. 8. Compared to traditional, medicalized advance directives, values histories are less subject to the objections ofnot being clearly established at the time of their writing, or applicable in the circumstances that subsequentlyarise: they rely neither on an understanding/misunderstanding of the medical treatments proposed, nor onspeculative attempts to hypothesize about future medical conditions. They are thus often seen as a moredesirable form of advance directive. 9. As the values history makes minimal use of technical or complex language, it is less liable tomarginalize persons from a poor educational/socio-economic or persons for whom English is not the firstlanguage. (Unlike traditional living wills which, in American studies, have shown to be used and favoured moreespecially by white, middle class people.) 10. Values histories, as well as being more patient-centred and geared to autonomous expression anddecision making, are more clinically useful than purely medicalized advance directives. They can help to validatepreferences about treatment and also indicate appropriate courses of action that were not, or could not, becovered by traditional advance directives alone. They are a useful clinical tool to elicit values relating to chronicas well as critical medical care. 11. Values histories, it can be argued, represent a potentially more enduring expression of preferences todetermine future health care choices than do traditional advance directives. Preferences for complex alternativesthat have variable probabilities for outcome in the future are difficult to assess for durability (although limitedstudies suggest some stability.) Core values may be more enduring than decisions about how to applythose values. 12. Values histories are more in keeping with developments in law and ethics that emphasise patient autonomy.They present doctors with an opportunity to be pro-active in leading the way in good medical care, instead ofmerely accommodating existing law. The values history gives a picture of the patient as an individual personrather than as a set of medical paradigms. The traditional advance directive is based on medical diagnosis-procedures-outcomes and risks failing to do this. A doctor may need information about a patient's lifestyle andattitudes in order to discharge the responsibility of making medical decisions that that patient would have madein a particular situation if competent, or even to make decisions about disclosure, or recommendations, fora competent patient. 13. A recently completed study (Pearlman, USA) has suggested thatalthough there is a strong relationship between patients' advance treatment preferences and envisaged healthoutcomes, this relationship is not strong enough to make substitution possible. Treatment preferences are not asubstitute for eliciting what states of health a patient would find acceptable. It is very desirable, therefore, thatadvance directives, if used, should be supplemented with a values history approach, written or verbal, or avlaues history incorporated in the advance directive. Overleaf: Selected References Doukas D, McCullough L, "The Values History - The Evaluation of the Patient's Values andAdvance Directives", Journal of Family Practice 1991; 32(2)145-150, p.145: "The validity of the Values History isbased on a basic ethical consideration: the Values History enhances the autonomy of the patient in a way thatpresent advance directives do not, by clarifying for the health care team the patient's expresses values underlyingdecisions to be carried out when decision making by the patienbt is no longer possible. One possible benefit ofsuch an evaluation is to help physicians and institutions manage more reliable the uncertainties that surroundadvance directives." Emanuel E, Emanuel L, &quotFour Models of the Physician-Patient Relationship", Journalof the American Medical Association 1992; 267(16)2221-2226, p.2225.: &quotFreedom and control over medicaldecisions alone do not constitute patient autonomy. Autonomy requires that individuals critically assess their ownvalues and preferences; determine whether they are desirable; affirm, upon reflection, these values as ones thatshould justify their actions; and then be free to initiate action to realize the values." McLean S, paper given to International College of Surgeons, London November 14th 1994:&quotWhere the directive is indeed a negative declaration, the doctor would certainly be frustrated by not beingable to intervene, but this presumes that the nature of the advance directive is only clinical. In fact some directivesnow address themselves to values histories rather than clinical condition and this would be my preferred model.The difference is that the individual describes not which medical conditions he or she would not want to live with,but rather the circumstances in which continued life is not preferable to them - even if something could be donemedically." Singer P et al, &quotAdvance Directives: Are they an Advance?"Canadian Medical Association Journal 1992; 146(2):127-134, p.129: &quotSince values and preferencesrepresent fundamentally different, but complementary, approaches, instruction directives should contain boththese components." Gibson J, &quotReflecting on Values", Ohio State Law Journal 1990; 51(2):451-454: "...whereas [such] formal directives ask for a series of medical conclusions, the Values History formtargets value premises that are not medical in nature but are always considered (consciously or not) when makingmedical decisions. Other advance directives require one to anticipate medical conditions that might arise and todecide in advance what medical treatment one would choose or not choose. No mention is made about who theindividual is now, what matters to the individual, or why the individual has made the choices he has - in short, noattention is paid to the only information that is real and not hypothetical. These insights gathered over the pastseveral years may account for the unexpected appeal of the Values History form, especially to persons whose jobrequires them to encourage others to execute advance directives, such as health care professionals,administrators, pastors, and counselors." Pearlman R, Cole W, Patrick D, Starks H, Cain K, &quotAdvance Care Planning:Eliciting Patient Preferences for Life-Sustaining Treatment", Pt.Educ & Counseling, In Press:&quotAfter a brief introduction to the topic of ACP [advance care planning] and advance directives (often usingfamiliar language such as &quotliving wills"), the health care provider should inquire about the patient'sunderstanding of these terms and the potential value in his or her health care. After laying this groundwork,clarification of a patient's preferences about health care should ensue." Kielstein R, Sass H, &quotUsing Stories to Assess Values and Establish MedicalDirectives", Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal 1993, 3(3):303-325, p.313: &quotMany clinicians, lawyers andethicists believe that traditional advance directive forms are largely ineffective in providing sufficient informationon values, preferences, and guidance for medical intervention. Story-based value assessments and directives andother narrative methods that employ the development, evaluation, and integration of stories into a person's own lifestory are an alternative to traditional directives. Since story-based assesments and directives do not provide ready-made recipes for medical intervention, they challenge good clinical practice to integrate value assessment withmedical assessment and improved physician-patient interaction into on-going stories of cure and care." (Thearticle examines different types of values histories, their evolution, and generally favours them over traditionaladvance directives.) Schneiderman L, Pearlman R, Kaplan R, Anderson J, Rosenberg E, &quotRelationship ofGeneral Advance Directive Instructions To Specific Life-Sustaining Treatment Preferences in Patients with SeriousIllness", Archives of Internal Medicine 1992; 152:2114-2122, p.2120 "...we suggest that advance directiveinstruments should be developed that enable patients to express their wishes in terms of quality of life undervarying clinical states." Dickens B, &quotA Response to the Papers of Molloy and Colleagues (Canada) and Cranford(United States) on Advance Directives", Humane Medicine 1993; 9(1):78-84, p.80: &quotThe application ofthese theoretical responses within hypothetical scenarios to the actual events that occur is a matter of conjectureand speculation. This raises serious questions about the value of executing directives that specify great detail.Indeed, the more detailed an advance directive is, the more likely it is to vary from events that actually occur. It maybe of more value for individuals to express themselves in their own terms, not in the medical jargon that healthprofessionals use to write documents, and to address their personal goals, hopes and fears." Hoffman M, &quotUse of Advance Directives: A Social Work Perspective on the Myth Versusthe Reality", Death Studies 1994; 18:229-241, p.229 [on living wills and related documents:] &quotAsimportant as such documents may become in the future, perhaps even more important will be the processindividuals go through defining what quality of life means to them by specifying their values and beliefs to theirfamilies and physicians before they face a crisis situation." Pearlman R, &quotAre We Asking the Right Questions", Hastings Center Report SpecialSupplement 1994; 24(6):S24-S28, p.S24: &quotDo advance forms and discussions provide sufficient informationfor valid representation of preferences? Does the written record communicate meaningful preferences that areapplicable to future clinical situations? and, Does availability of advance directives inhibit communication withpatients before the onset of mental incapacity? These questions seem more germane than questions about theeffect of advance directives on perceived satisfaction with care and health costs, or clinicians' adherence to thepreferences expressed in advance directives. There is also the need to ascertain whether the original objectives foradvance directives match the desires of the individuals they were intended to benefit. Many patients desireadvance directives to ward off untoward outcomes of medical technology. With these individuals it may bedesirable simply to elicit general goals of care under certain circumstances. Other patients may want to providemore detailed infrormation, such as treatment preferences. ... one important question is which type of advancedirective (written, verbal, proxy, instruction, values history, etc, best helps a particular patient communicate his orher treatment preferences."

First, I want to suggest one reason why doctors and nurses have ethical problems over the idea of advance statements. This will involve looking briefly at what I shall tell 'the main ethical tradition' in medicine, and then at the main challenge to the tradition from the patients' rights movement. Secondly, I want to suggest a way of interpreting the doctrine of consent which will reconcile the two points of view and so legitimise advance refusals at least. Thirdly, I want to suggest reservations about the doctrine of C.P.A. in this context. Finally, I want to look at some objection to advance statements. (1) The main tradition and its critics From the time of Hippocrates until the 1960s medical ethics was seen entirely in terms of doctors' duties to patients. These duties have traditionally been thought of as those of not harming the patient (non-maleficence) and of helping the patient (beneficence). Medical understanding of these duties has been affected by three different currents of thinking (Jonsen 1990). The first current is the one flowing from the origins of modern medicine in the Greek world. When the Hippocratic Oath required the physician not to harm but to help, it was against a background of Greek craftsmanship. The art or craft (techne) of the carpenter is to work on wood according to the nature of wood. There are bounds or limits concerning what is appropriate for each craft, and to go beyond these bounds is to be guilt of hubris or pride. Hence, when the Greek doctor promises not to harm and to do good to the patient what is intended is much the same requirement as that laid on the carpenter when, as a good craftsman, he tries not to damage his material, wood, but rather to bring out its nature as wood. We might term the Hippocratic ethics that of the competent craftsman. The relevant portion of the Hippocratic Oath really indicates that there are constraints on the skill or art of medicine; it does not truly involve beneficence in our modern sense. But beneficence in our modern sense enters the scene via the Samaritan tradition in medicine. It is known that St.Luke was a physician and there is some evidence that the good Samaritan was meant to be a physician - certainly he treats the man fallen by the way side with an infundation of oil and wine, which was a remedy for wounds in Greek medicine. However that may be, the ideal of the good Samaritan who ministers to the sick despite inconvenience and danger to himself was one which enormously affected the tradition of medicine, and it gave us the ideal of beneficence in something like its modern form. Yet not completely like its form in modern medicine, for another current entered ethics via the Order of Knights Hospitallers. This Order was found in the 11th century to provide hostels for pilgrims to the Holy Land and to care for the sick, and later those wounded at the Crusades. The members of this Order were mainly of noble families and were deducated to serve 'our lords, the sick'. This tradition continued in the religious orders, and it emerged in a different form in the 18th century when the status and education of doctors began once again to improve, and the image of the g entleman-physician began to re-appear. The opening words of the influential book of medical ethics, written by the British physician Thomas Percival (1803), bear witness in elegant language to the ethic of noblesse oblige: 'Physicians and surgeons should minister to the sick, reflecting that the ease, health and lives of those committed to their charge depend on their skills, attention and fidelity. They should study, in their deportment, so to unite tenderness with steadiness, and condescension with authority, as to inspire the minds of their patients with gratitude, respect and confidence.' These words echo the sentiments of the Knights Hospitallers of the Crusades, and they were incorporated into the Code of Ethics of the American Medical Association and stood unchanged from 1847 to 1912; their spirit lived long after that. To sum this up, we can say that all doctors would nowadays subscribe to the ethical idea that they have duties not to harm and to do good to their patients, but they may be unaware of the fact that the medical interpretation of these duties has been coloured by (at least) three traditions: the Hippocratic tradition of competent craftsmanship, the Samaritan tradition of helping one's neighbour in all circumstances, and the Knights' Hospitaller tradition of noble service. The effects or influences of this rich ethos on modern medicine can be seen in the manner in which doctors feel obligated to develop and apply the modern version of craftsmanship, which is medical technology; to treat patients wherever they can be treated and to resist rationing; to treat patients in terms of a medical perspective on needs rather than a patients' perspective. This rich medical ethos, which I shall call 'the main tradition', remained largely undisturbed from the Greek world to the end of the 1950s. Since then however there have been at least three attacks on it, deriving from three different sets of ideas: the emergence of nursing as an independent profession and along with that the development of a team approach to health care; the rise of patients' rights movements; and the need for rationing following the growth of demand on medical services. These movements overlap in various ways, and all are particular manifestations of broader social changes. The attack which is especially relevant to this paper derives from the patients' rights movement. The public wish to be involved in decisions which are going to affect them. This move to more openness, more consultation, has affected medicine as much as other areas of society. The concept which has been adopted to encapsulate the idea of the rights of patients is 'autonomy'. Codes of medical ethics and philosophical discussion from the 1970s increasingly added 'respect for the patient's autonomous decisions' to the duties of non-maleficence and beneficence. Some of the dispute over advance statements can be seen as a particular form of this more general conflict which arises in medicine when the main tradition - identified by the principles of non-maleficence and beneficence - encounters the new tradition of respect for the patients autonomous decisions. I want to pursue this further by looking in more detail at the doctrine of consent, which is my second theme. 2. Consent Advance statements may be thought to be extending the doctrine of consent or refusal, which is itself derived from autonomy. Now while this may be so it is important to examine the doctrine of consent more precisely, for there are at least three strands in it. (a) The weakest sense of consent is 'agreeing to' or 'accepting'. If we take an analogy from consent in political philosophy then a ruler like Elizabeth I of England ruled by consent in that she was popular and the punters accepted or agreed with her policies of beating up the Spanish etc. But her right to act in this way did not depend on their agreement; if they had not agreed, then it would not have mattered. This is the weakest sense of consent. In medicine it might be illustrated in contexts in which the doctor says 'I am proposing to do X and Y' or 'I have just done X and Y. Is that OK?', and the patient weakly says 'Yes, thank you doctor'. This strand of the consent doctrine is compatible with the main tradition in that it does not confer rights on the patient. (b) A strong sense of consent is 'authorising'. A might authorise B to do X, Y on his behalf. In this case Bs right to do X, Y necessarily depends on As authorisation. B is delegated to do X, Y and the main responsibility for the doing of X and Y rests with A. For example, I might instruct or authorise my agent to bid for me at an auction. This is too strong a sense of consent to be assimilated into even a modified main tradition in medical ethics. (Although the term 'authorise' is used in the BMA Guidelines in Fig. 1, and P.21, line 2). It has the serious disadvantage in medicine of undermining professional autonomy: the doctor may feel that what I authorise is futile, and in any case it is up to him to make the treatment decisions (although, as we shall see, the patient can legitimately refuse treatment). It should be noted that the use of the term 'directive' may encourage patients to see themselves as authorising their doctor to act as their agent. This has already happened in the USA. In a study of the literature Paris et. al. (1993) note that doctors will almost always continue treatment if requested by patients or relatives even if they regard it as futile. They do this because they believe that patient autonomy carries with it the right to whatever treatment the patient requests. Moreover, this view is supported by many US ethicists. For example, Veatch and Spicer (1992) maintain that a physician is obliged to supply requested treatment even if the request 'deviates intolerably' from established standards or is in terms of the doctor's judgement 'grossly inappropriate'. In reply to the US position we must remember that the principle of respect for autonomy applies not only to the patient but to the doctor, and if in the doctor's professional opinion the requested treatment is 'grossly inappropriate' then the doctor has no duty to provide it; indeed he/she has a duty not to provide it. The position has in fact been supported in the UK by the Court of Appeal. In a case in which a physician had indicated that he would not concur with a family's request to give a dying patient ventilatory treatment if that became necessary to sustain the patient's life, Lord Justice Donaldson stated that 'courts should not require a medical practitioner...to adopt a course of treatment which in the bona fide clinical judgement of the practitioner was contraindicated.' Lord Justice Balcome went further and wrote that he 'could conceive of no situation where it would be proper to order a doctor to treat a patient in a manner contrary to his or her clinical judgement'. In other words, the Court of Appeal, is here supporting the professional autonomy of the doctor (Re J (a minor)1992). But whatever the legal situation in the UK there are 3 points to be made (a) that the American writers of this article dismiss the judgments of the Court of Appeal as expressing English social class interests - where the lawyers support the doctors. They predict that this will change. (b) It is in fact the case that many doctors, and many more nurses, believe that they are obliged to do what the patients and relatives request especially at the end of life. (c) The Patient's Charter encourages this, what we may term 'consumer' autonomy, approach to medicine. Contrary to our US colleagues there is good reason for maintaining the asymmetry whereby the patient may legitimately refuse a treatment or authorise a refusal, but cannot authorise, as distinct from agree to, the positive giving of a treatment. The explanation is that the doctor is the expert on the patient's medical good - hence only the doctor can authorise treatment - but the patient is the expert on his/her own total good. In the light of this knowledge of an overall or total good, the patient is entitled to refuse treatment which might well be in his/her narrower medical good. One upshot of this is that the BMA must be careful about terminology. There are 2 points. (1) They use the term 'advance directive' to mean 'advance refusal', and I wonder if it might not be better to stick with 'advance refusal' if that is what is meant, since the term 'directive' sounds a wider one and might suggest that it is possible in a document to direct or authorise a positive treatment. (2) There is moreover a logical inconsistency in the BMA dcoument. In the definitions (para. 2) advance directives or refusals are made a subset of advance statements, whereas in the summary (para. 14) there is a contrast implied between advance statements in 14.1, and advance directives or refusals in 14.2. This suggest that there are two different categories involved. I prefer the second approach - in which statements of preference or requests are contrasted with refusals - but the terminology must be clear and consistent. I said that the doctrine of consent contains three strands - the weak idea of agreeing to or accepting what has been proposed, and the strong idea of authorising . The third strand is that of: (c) Shared decision making. Shared decision-making has two elements: (i) Patient preferences and values are discussed by the doctor in the light of the doctor's treatment proposals or they could be mentioned in advance in a document. This type of discussion is necessary but not sufficient for what I am calling joint or shared decision-making. (ii) The second necessary condition is that this discussion results in the activating of a socially or often a legally sanctioned procedure. We can call this procedure the giving or the refusing of permission. These two conditions are together necessary and sufficient for this sense of consent. I should like you to note some points about it. (a) Permission is given by both patient and doctor. Each may permit the treatment or not. (b) Permission is a normative term. It is not like 'agreeing' or 'accepting' which are non-normative - I can accept a drink or agree to go to the cinema without any question of rights. But to give permission is to confer a right. Thus the patient gives or refuses the doctor a right to intervene, and the doctor gives the patient a right to have or not have the treatment in question. (c) The norms in question must be socially and in the end legally sanctioned or legitimised by public policy. In other words, the parties must know and agree about procedures, and society more generally must know and agree. Now if we apply the doctrine of permission, thus explained, to advance statement of preferences or advance refusals we have a doctrine which enables us to accept the merits of the new patients rights movement without abandoning the main tradition. The patient can be protected against paternalistic decisions deriving from doctors' or relatives views of their total good. They can be protected because they can refuse permission through socially and/or legally sanctioned procedures. On the other hand, the doctor's professional autonomy is also respected in that he too is giving permission through socially sanctioned procedures. Moreover, responsibility is shared. In the first strand of the consent doctrine - agreeing or accepting - the main responsibility remains with the doctor. In the second - authorising - the main responsibility rests with the authoriser. But in the third the responsibility is shared by (a) the patient (b) the doctor (c) society which has sanctioned the procedures through its public policy. 3. Continuing Power of Attorney It may be argued that the doctrine of authorisation does have a place in this discussion - because if it is thought desirable to invoke the doctrine of continuing powers of attorney or proxy decision making then we do require the strong doctrine of authorisation. But I am very doubtful about this doctrine in the context of advance statements. The Law Commission (7.7) are in favour of extending the doctrine to medical matters. They consider the objection: 'that a person's choice of proxy might become out of date, that the proxy might not make the same choice as the patient would have made...' And they reply: 'Exactly the same arguments could be made against allowing people to delegate their financial powers. They appear to us to be arguments in favour of adequate safeguards rather than arguments against the extension of the popular E.P.A. (Enduring Power of Attorney) scheme to personal and medical matters.' Well, I am not so sanguine as the Law Commission. The crucial difference is that in financial matters the proxy is acting in ways what are for the perceived good of the donor, whereas in medical matters a decision may be required which leads to the death of the donor. Many proxies will not have the stomach for that kind of decision. In 7.10 the Law Commission recommends 'that an attorney acting under a CPA should act in the best interests of the donor, having regard to statutory factors.' To which I shall say 'Yes, provided we also agree that death can be in a person's best interests'. There is in fact some empirical evidence from the USA that, when it comes to the bit, the attorney - often a guilt-ridden relative - will say: 'Do everything possible.' Whereas proxies may have a place in decision-making - say in the context of incapacity where there is no advance statement - I maintain that people should make up their own minds and embody their will in socially sanctioned documents. 4. Some Objections There are several common ethical objections to advance statements. All of them can be answered. 1. Patients do not really want to discuss future incompetence and death, and so would rather not discuss advance statements. In reply we can say that many people do want to make arrangements for their possible future incapacity, and no one is obliged to do so. 2. Discussion of advance statements takes too much time and requires special training and competence. In reply it can be noted that as advance statements become more familiar less time will be required. Forms with helpful advice can give guidance. 3. The incompetent patient's best interests should take precedence over even the most thoughtful choices of a patient while competent. The reply is that it is essential that competent patients who record their wishes know these wishes will be followed later, a person's values and choices should govern even after loss of competence because he or she remains essentially the same person, and to recognize the proposed exception would invite widespread disregard of treatment directives.

Or are we in danger of falling prey to optimistic enthusiasm? Bioethicist Charles Hite is the Director of Biomedical Ethics Sertvices for the 13 hospitals and allied health organisations in Southwest Virginia. In the following article, taken from his introduction to a recent conference in Roanoke, Virginia, entitled "Deciding How We Die: The Use and Limits of Advance Directives", Professor Hite outlines some of the known facts about advance directives and some of the common misapprehensions. Nearly four years ago the Patient Self Determination Act came into being in the United States with the hope of assuring that patients' preferences about medical treatment would be followed when they could no longer speak for themselves. This federal law was the latest in a series of events over the previous two decades that sought to give more power to patients to make decisions about the way they lived and the way they died. After a number of court decisions helped establish a consensus that patients did indeed have the right to refuse life-sustaining treatments, documents known as advance directives were seen as a way to extend that right to patients who lost their decision-making capacity. The Patient Self-Determination Act became the latest vehicle for promoting autonomy, requiring hospitals and other health care institutions to inform patients about their rights to control health care decisions. The results of the mandatory and massive education program required by the act have fallen short of what many had hoped for. Despite the intent of the act, we know that the vast majority of patients have not completed a formal advance directive. We know that most patients have not had any sort of meaningful discussion with their physicians about the type of treatment they want at the end of their lives. Patients and doctors seem engaged in the game "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." Patients are waiting for the physician to initiate discussions about end of life decisions but physicians remain convinced that to do so would upset their patients or undermine their trust. We know that many patients believe their family members or their physicians will make the treatment decisions they would have made, yet studies show that families and physicians quite often have very different perceptions about what the patient really wants. We know that some patients are comfortable with the notion that surrogate decision-makers might override the instructions outlined in their advance directives if there appears good reason to do so. We know the treatment preferences patients express in advance directives are very dependent on the way a question about treatment is phrased. A review of journal articles over the past few years could easily lead one to believe that the Patient Self-Determination Act has been largely ineffective and that advance directives have done little to enhance the likelihood that patient wishes are an integral part of medical decision making. Listen to these few exerpts: "Despite public enthusiasm for the use of advance directives and great efforts to promote them, we found little evidence that these documents are associated with enhanced communication between patients and physicians about end-of-life decisions." That from an April 25, 1994 article in Archives of Internal Medicine that described structured interviews with 115 seriously ill cancer patients and their physicians. "Advance directives were infrequently available and had little impact on the pattern of care." From the March 1995 issue of Chest describing a study patients in a 13-bed medical intensive care unit of a community teaching hospital. Quite simply, as far as we could tell, advance directives were irrelevant to decision making." - That from a study co-authored by Dr Joanne Lynn, that looked at more that 3,000 seriously ill patients at five major medical centers. "The effectiveness of written advance directives is limited by inattention to them and by decisions to place priority on considerations other than patients autonomy." From a New England Journal of Medicine article in March 1991 describing a study of nursing home residents and family members. While not all research on advance directives casts doubt on their usefulness, there are clearly some fundamental problems that need to be addressed. Some have suggested that there has been too much emphasis on advance directives as an event rather than a process. Rather than view advance directives as written documents that are discussed, signed, and locked away, we need to embrace the notion of advance care planning. In this scenario, advance directives are just part of what has been described as "the larger process of communication among patients, their health care providers, their families, and important others regarding the kind of care that will be considered appropriate when the patient cannot make decisions." This is a process that occurs over time, not just at one sitting. Certainly, physicians need to be encouraged to participate in the process. Physicians must realize that most patients are very receptive to having discussions about the type of care they want at the end of their lives. They need to know that these discussions generally do not provoke fear or mistrust in patients but rather that they can be vehicles for building trust in the physician-patient relationship. Physicians must also receive education and training in how to have these discussions with their patients. At least one study has shown that simply providing physicians with a didactic lecture on end of life decision making has very little effect on their willingness to talk to patients. What does help is for physicians to have mentors, colleagues whom they can actually observe having conversations with patients. Even if we learn to overcome the barriers that prevent good communication and understanding of patient preferences, there are still many perplexing issues in advance care planning. What is the role of families in end-of-life decision making? Are there limits to what patients can ask for in advance? How do we resolve differences among ethnic and religious groups about limitations on patient preferences? Can advance directives be overriden and, if so, under what circumstances? Charles Hite is general editor and contributing author for "Introduction to Clinical Ethics" published by University Publishing Group in Frederick, Maryland in the Spring. We hope to bring you more about this pivotal conference on living wills in a future issue. (This issue: see also p.13) We continue to suggest to readers to view your living will as only one part of an overall and ongoing communication process with your doctor. © 1995 Chris Docker You are the 161st person to browse through here since 6th Feb 1996 using the above URL WT02-B27-172IA007-000073-B036-383http://www.euthanasia.org:80/96-3mcln.html 194.88.132.128 19970222053053 text/html 9961HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 05:38:49 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html First British research on assisted suicide [VESS Homepage][Subscriptions][A to Z][Books][Feedback & Questions][Email vess@euthanasia.org][FastAccess] [Back to VESS Newsletter Page] First British research on assisted suicide announced Alison Britton & Sheila McLean Alison Britton, LLB, Dip LP, M.Phil, is a researcher in medical law at the Glasgow University, and the principal full-time researcher on the Physician Assisted Suicide Project made possible with a grant from VESS. International Bar Association Professor Sheila McLean is the Director of the Institute of Law & Ethics in Medicine at Glasgow. As this article goes to press, it is impossible to describe the enormous interest that the project on physician assisted suicide has generated. We have been inundated with materials and positive support for our research. As well as making our task more interesting and rewarding, it also emphasises the fact that many people welcome a chance to debate the subject and be given the opportunity to express their views. With just a couple of months until completion of our final report on the project, we thought it may be of interest to give an idea of the report's outline as well as some of our research to date. Our initial task was to build a framework; a starting point upon which our subsequent research and writing could be based. Our general "structure" therefore, in the early months, was to raise awareness of the fact that this research was being undertaken. Through extensive letter writing, we made our contacts and sought opinions. We wrote to organisations, institutions, Royal Colleges, government departments and anyone who we thought could provide information relevant to the project. Meanwhile, an extensive literature search was underway. Again, we were surprised at the amount of material available. The number of articles, notes, statutes and cases we have is in the thousands. As to the report itself, it has been divided into ten chapters. In the next few paragraphs, we have provided quite a bit of detail as to what is covered in the chapters. Hopefully, you will find it thought provoking or at least, interesting.We have begun by tracing the history of, and the rationales for, the prohibition of suicide itself and bringing it up-to-date. With this in place, the second chapter will explore the tradition of medical ethics, which at first sight seems to prohibit clinical involvement in suicide or providing assistance. The argument will be that the principles of Hippocrates have stood the test of time only in part, and that over the centuries in word and in deed to take account of changes that have occurred. Why these changes have occurred will also be examined. Moreover, the more recently re-stated principles place primary emphasis on the rights and interests of the patient rather than the physician. Thus, they value autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence. Although autonomy is a clearly definable concept, beneficence and non-maleficence have shown themselves to be subject to interpretation. It is arguable, that the latter two could encapsulate the clinicians' agreement to facilitate an autonomous choice by the patient, as is done in cases such as respecting competent treatment refusals and advance directives, where the outcome is the foreseeable death of the patient. Chapter 3 will address and analyse the arguments against permitting patients to make such choices at the end of their lives. The chapter will explore the validity of these arguments using both a legal and ethical perspective. Areas of law tangential or parallel to the questions raised by patient choice will be introduced and scrutinized in order to clarify whether or not they are accepted by the law, as well as whether or not they are inherently consistent, philosophically. Chapter 4 will undertake a similar exercise in respect of the arguments in favour of patient control of these decisions. Once again, the arguments will be approached from a legal and ethical perspective. This chapter will include a summation of chapters three and four concluding that the arguments in favour of patient choice are stronger and more compelling than those raised against it. Having reviewed all of the above arguments, chapter 5 will seek to define physician assisted suicide. In doing so, attention will be paid to cases, for example, such as that of Sue Rodriguez which have been considered by the courts and elsewhere, and to their arguments and conclusions. Physician assisted suicide will be distinguished from all three possible forms of euthanasia, and the moral differences will be highlighted and analysed. Chapter 6 will ask whether or not there is a reason why doctors should be involved at all. A number of possible reasons against clinical involvement will be explored, before analysis is made of the medical role. It will be argued that there are strong reasons, which donot conflict with medical ethics, why the clinician is best placed to provide the means, and make the assessment of the appropriateness of, physician assisted suicide. Chapter 7 will review what went before and explore the areas of the law and professional ethics which require to be modified or changed if physician assisted suicide were to be legalised. The aims of these reforms would be to ensure the lawfulness of the actions of the doctor, the rights of the person seeking assistance and the protection of all others who might be involved. ...will draw together all of the above into a draft bill which would be suitable for the legislative process of the United Kingdom. The Bill will be permissive in nature, and will incorporate all of the consequential legal changes outlined... Chapter 8 may arguably be the one to cause most discussion. It will review the literature already available in respect of attitudes to choices at the end of life. It will include our recent independent research and questionnaire of healthcare professionals and public opinion which was commissioned especially for our report. Chapter 9 will take a comparative view of those jurisdictions whose legislature or courts have addressed the question of physician assisted suicide. Analysis will be made of their laws, the arguments which preceded or followed their passing and the style of legislative and other intervention utilized. Chapter 10 will draw together all of the above into a draft bill which would be suitable for the legislative process of the United Kingdom. The Bill will be permissive in nature, and will incorporate all of the consequential legal changes outlined in chapter 7, above. Following the Frontline Scotland programme which used the findings of our questionnaire, the response rate to it rose to approximately 50%. Such a response rate is almost unheard of in surveys... Following the Frontline Scotland programme which used the findings of our questionnaire, the response rate to it rose to approximately 50%. Such a response rate is almost unheard of in surveys, and it is most gratifying to realise how many people are willing to share their opinions with us. Some respondents went further and supplied us with an additional two or three pages of their individual views. Such enthusiastic participation is going to be a great asset to our final report, allowing us to analyse a broad spectrum of professional and general public opinion. It was not only the response rate which rose after the programme. The programme gave rise to a huge amount of interest which was by no means confined to Scotland, or for that matter, Britain. The project had coverage from first thing in the morning on breakfast television to the later viewing of Newsnight. Sky Television and American NBC also carried a report. This publicity was well supplemented by every form of media you could imagine; radio broadcasts and newspapers alike besieged our office and jammed the university switchboards. Things have calmed a little now and we are doing the last of our rounds of letters; this time to the churches, political parties and the Scottish and English Law Commissions. The aforementioned publicity should stimulate a response. Whether the response is of a positive or negative nature is less certain. As to the next few months and completion, we can only hope that our final report generates as much interest as our preliminary findings. © 1996 University of Glasgow You are the 71st person to browse through here since 5 July 1996 using the above URL WT02-B27-173IA007-000073-B036-415http://www.euthanasia.org:80/smcl.html 194.88.132.128 19970222053107 text/html 6846HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 05:39:13 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html How should we decide? Newsletter How should we decide? Prof. Sheila McLean The ruling of the Court of Session that Scottish Courts do have the jurisdiction to decide about whether or not nasogastric feeding and hydration can be removed from people in persistent vegetative state undoubtedly moves Scots Law forward, and brings it into line with other jurisdictions. But even for those who firmly believe that the withdrawal of artificial feeding is justified on grounds of compassion and respect for dignity there remains some concern both about the way in which the developed world treats these cases and the tests which are applied in them. Lord Hope's formulation of the tests to be applied in the Janet Johnston case seems to move away from the somewhat spurious concept of "best interests" even although this is what he claims to be describing. The best interests test is spurious because the nature of the diagnosis itself means that the person in PVS has no interests whatsoever, far less "best" ones. Rather Lord Hope chose to indicate that artificial feeding could be removed when it provided no benefit to the patient - in other words, in situations where doctors feel that treatment is futile. Although I believe that this is a better formulation than that which is used in some other countries, it still leaves a lurking feeling of unease. The discomfort with this conclusion is based on a number of factors. First, "futility" in medicine is not a clear cut concept. Indeed, there is a growing volume of literature (mostly emanating from the U.S.) which points to the difficulty of being certain that something is futile. Futility must have something to do with whether or not it can achieve its aim. Viewed from this perspective, the aim of artificial feeding is to maintain life, and in this it is manifestly successful, so how are we to define it as futile? It is widely accepted that the tests used to judge medical behaviour are not particularly stringent.... Second, the Lord President made it clear that not all cases of this sort will need to be brought before a court in future. Rather, those caring for the patient and the relatives will be able to make these decisions, presumably in the majority of cases. Thus, the decision will clearly be one based on the best clinical judgement of doctors and will be tested (if challenged) against the rules which govern medical practice in general. It is widely accepted that the tests used to judge medical behaviour are not particularly stringent, and it might be thought that where the outcome is the ending of a life (no matter its quality) these tests are not strict enough to satisfy the general feeling that taking life (without the consent of the individual) is not a "good" thing. Third, there is a paradox in the fact that - since the abolition of the death penalty - not even our criminal courts can sanction death.1 So, even where something is proved to the highest legal standard of "beyond reasonable doubt" the court cannot authorize the ending of a life. Yet, the outcome of a civil court's findings, based on the much lower standard of "a balance of probabilities" combined with the test generally applied to medical practice and already described as lacking stringency, may result in just such approval being given. My suspicion is that the routes taken by courts have been tailored so that they cannot be seen as endorsing voluntary euthanasia.... These concerns are not founded on, although they may be exacerbated by, recent reports that some people who have been diagnosed as being in PVS have apparently recovered (although the extent of the recovery is not clear). Whatever one's views about "death with dignity" it is surely unsatisfactory that an unconsented-to ending of life is not tested as strictly as is humanly possible. My suspicion is that the routes taken by courts have been tailored so that they cannot be seen as endorsing voluntary euthanasia, hence the use of the criteria I have already described. Yet, arguably, the conclusion must be that the courts are endorsing a form of non-voluntary euthanasia, whilst refusing to accept the validity of a competent request for assistance in dying. For this and other reasons, it is surely time (as one of the judges in the Court of Session strongly urged) that end of life decisions were the subject of public debate, culminating ideally in an honest appraisal of the values to which we subscribe and a legislative response.

The cemetery, which covers 44 hectares, contains 100,000 burial places and since opening has had over one million burials. The main entrance is on Boulevard de M�nilmontant where visitors can pick up maps showing locations of some of the more famous gravesites. Walking through the cemetery, the older parts seem to make use of above ground burial; the tiny houses are actually small chapels in a state of disrepair. Chestnut trees line some of the avenues, giving the visitor the relaxing feel of a country park. Famous people in history that now rest there in peace include the writer Oscar Wilde, rock singer Jim Morrison, the writer Marcel Proust, actress Simone Signoret, and composer and pianist, Frederic Chopin. When I visited a few years ago, wandering between the tombs and gargoyles that flank a crisscross of meandering pathways over the vast expanse of the cemetery, I was struck by the ambience that lingered in the shadows of these famous names. Many arrows were inscribed on pathways and smooth stones to point the traveller towards the final resting place of "JM" or "Jim." In his poem "Paris Journal", this 60's icon of rock-and-roll had written: "So much forgetten already, So much forgotten, So much to forget." Only 27 years old, he had died in Paris in 1971 and it seemed his fans were determined not to forget him; film director Oliver Stone had paid ttribute to him in the film named after his rock group, The Doors. With some curiosity I followed the arrows to the hallowed place - but only to find a dishevelled and rather ordinary, unkempt grave. Remembrance, it seemed, now spared scant attention to his mortal remains. Oscar Wilde's resting place provided stark contrast. The controversial writer who, in his own poetry, had immortalized the graves of Shelley and Keats, was himself now the object of much attention and affection at the graveside. The colossal tomb stood proudly, an imposing piece of modern sculpture, piled around with beautiful fresh flowers. Many admirers had left written notes, touching in their devotion. Others had left mementos - even a Paris subway ticket, carefully placed and secured with a small mound of stones. And what of Chopin's grave? One of the most eminent composers of piano music, a man whose genius enlarged the technical range and the musical expression of the instrument through a remarkable body of work. He had died quite early, of tuberculosis, and in Paris. I followed my map to seek out his grave, and the music in my head was not his famous Funeral March but a light, delicate Nocturne, that at that moment had an almost mystical quality. I felt that there was something essential about the act of dying that could never be adequately expressed in words - could it be hinted at in music? I somehow expected to find a well-kept area, fresh flowers perhaps, but prepared myself to face the drab reality of yet another gravestone. The air was getting cold - soon Cimeti�re du P�re Lachaise would be closed. I realized, with disappointment, that I had passed the place on the map where Chopin rested. An unspectacular grave that had been easy to miss? Only my natural frustration caused me to turn back and check. It was, in fact, almost hidden. Beautifully situated and raised somewhat from the main walkway, surrounded by beautiful shrubs. Chopin's grave struck a note of eloquent simplicity. And there, resting near the spotlessly clean marble, a lighted candle sent an unspoken message to a life completed. - Chris Docker Photographic links to P�re Lachaise © 1996 Chris Docker You are the 714th person to browse through here since 12th Feb 1996 WT02-B27-175IA007-000073-B037-145http://www.euthanasia.org:80/telfer.html 194.88.132.128 19970222053251 text/html 24195HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 05:40:23 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Philosophical approaches to death with dignity Philosophical approaches to the dilemma of death withdignity Elizabeth Telfer Dr Elizabeth Telfer is a senior lecturer in the Department of Philosophyat the University of Glasgow, where she lectures on contemporary moralissues, including euthanasia. She is co- author of "Respect for Persons"and has recently written "Food for Thought". Her approach todeath with dignity demonstrates how this issue can be approached philosophicallyby means of several different schools of thought. The paper that followsis based on themes used by Dr Telfer in her address at the VESS AGM inAberdeen this year on 29th June. Introduction This paper tries to set the issue of voluntary euthanasia in a philosophicalframework by showing how some of the main philosophical theories aboutmorality would deal with the topic. Philosophers have not discussed euthanasiaas such until recently, although it is now a popular topic. What has alwaysbeen discussed, however, is suicide, which raises much the same moral problemsas voluntary euthanasia. The moral similarity between voluntary euthanasiaand suicide enables us to make a reasonable guess about what some of thegreat philosophers would say about voluntary euthanasia. In this country patients have a legal right to refuse treatment even ifdeath will be the result, though doctors may make it difficult for themto exercise this right. But it is illegal for a doctor actively to bringabout the death of his patient at the patient's request, in the way thatis now decriminalised in the Netherlands. In this paper I shall concentrateon the controversial issues: whether it is morally permissible for a doctoractively to bring about the death of his patient at the patient's requestand whether the law should be altered to permit this. My title mentions "death with dignity". But dignity is a verycomplex concept. I shall not attempt to give a definition of dignity here.Instead I shall list aspects of dignity which seem to be important whendeath with dignity is discussed, recognising that some of these aspectswill be more important to some people, others to others. Dignity involves:not being dependent on other people or on things; self-control and autonomy;privacy; the maintenance of one's own standards, of all kinds; self-esteem.A death with dignity is a death which enables the dying person to retainthe elements of dignity which he or she values. Consequentialism & Utilitarianism Traditional philosophical theories about morality have often aimed to finda criterion of morally right action. We can divide such theories into twogroups: those which hold that the right action is always that which producesthe best consequences, and those which hold that the right action is notalways that which produces the best consequences. Theories of the firstkind are called Consequentialist theories; theories of the second kindare called Deontological theories, from the Greek words 'deonto' meaning'to do with obligation' and 'logos' meaning roughly 'body of knowledge'.Consequentialist theories can be further subdivided: into Egoistic theories,those which see the consequences which matter morally as including onlyconsequences for the doer of the action, the agent, and Universalistictheories, those which see them as including consequences for all thoseaffected. I shall return to Egoism at the end of my paper. I shall beginwith Universalistic Consequentialism, because this view (which still hasmany philosophical adherents) may strike one at first as the obvious common-sense,rational, secular approach to moral questions. The first question that arises about Universal Consequentialism is: whatcounts as good consequences? One popular answer is the one given by JohnStuart Mill in his famous essay, Utilitarianism good consequences are simplyhappiness, and happiness is pleasure and freedom from pain - not only physicalpain but also distress of other kinds. According to this view, then, theright action is that which produces the most pleasure and least pain forall those affected. Another kind of answer is also found in the works ofMill, notably in his Essay on Liberty but also in Utilitarianism: the viewthat good consequences depend not only on the quantity of pleasure butalso on the quality of the experiences which produce it and of the humanbeing which is developed by them. According to this second conception ofgood consequences, the right action is that which promotes in oneself andothers what we may call a higher happiness, one which stresses self-developmentand the fostering of the distinctively rational nature of human beings. Terminology is a problem here. Some philosophers confine the term "Utilitarianism"to the doctrine expounded in Mill' essay of that name, whereby the goodconsequences are pleasure and the absence of pain. Others use the term'Utilitarianism' for Universal Consequentialism in general, since all versionsof this view judge actions by their results - their usefulness or utility.I shall adopt this terminology, which distinguishes different forms ofthe theory as 'Hedonistic' (pleasure-based) Utilitarianism and 'Ideal'Utilitarianism. I think that both the Hedonistic and the Ideal Utilitarian would arguethat voluntary euthanasia is often right. The Hedonistic Utilitarian wouldsay that situations often arise in which a person's continued existencebrings more pain than pleasure both to them and to all those who are distressedby their suffering - not to speak of the resources which are being spenton keeping them alive and which would produce more happiness if used inother ways. The Ideal version of Utilitarianism is even more in tune withthe views of those who advocate the possibility of death with dignity throughvoluntary euthanasia. For Ideal Utilitarians can counter the familiar objectionto euthanasia - that no one who receives proper expert care need die inpain and distress - by saying that the good that they seek is not mereabsence of pain, physical or mental, but the preservation of dignity andthe exercise of the human endowment of autonomy. However, there are severe problems for the Utilitarian approach to thedefence of voluntary euthanasia. The first is that it seems to justifytoo much: might it not sometimes justify involuntary euthanasia? If sufficientnumbers of people would gain in happiness and quality of life from thedeath of one person, the Utilitarian has to agree that such an action wouldbe justified, provided it could be carried out without causing a generalpanic which would outweigh the hoped-for gain in happiness. This problem is one example of a general difficulty with Utilitarianismof any kind. If the rightness of an action is to be measured in overallconsequences, there is no protection for the individual against the majority:they may do whatever they like to him, provided there is sufficient gainto outweigh his loss. We might put this point by saying that Utilitarianismdoes not safeguard the individual's rights. And it is just this inabilityto safeguard individuals' rights that leads many to reject the Utilitarianapproach, as yielding results which are too much at variance with our moralintuitions. A second problem is the line that the Utilitarian has to take on changingthe law. We are apt to assume that the law should reflect private morality:if an action is right, then the law should permit it. But for the Utilitariana law is right if it is useful: that is, if having such a law would maximisethe good results in which he believes. Some Utilitarians say that a changein the law, to permit voluntary euthanasia with due safeguards, would indeeddo this. But a more cautious Utilitarian might believe that the existenceof such a law would not have the best possible consequences overall: forexample, he might think that it would increase distress because ill peoplewould come to feel that they had to ask for euthanasia although they didnot want it. On the Utilitarian view a law which does not have the bestconsequences is not the right law; so the cautious Utilitarian would haveto advocate in public that the law should continue to forbid euthanasia,but in private that people should frequently break it. This possibilityof incoherence between what is publicly supported and what is privatelyenjoined is an example of another general difficulty with the Utilitarianapproach: it often means preaching one thing and hoping that people sometimesdo another. This kind of dishonesty is another respect in which Utilitarianismgoes against many of our moral intuitions. Modern Utilitarians have sophisticatedreplies to the difficulties which I have raised. But I shall unfairly assumethat in the end they cannot be solved, and turn to another approach altogether. Deontology The Deontologist maintains that some or all actions are right or wrongin themselves, because of the type of action they are, whether or not theyproduce the best consequences. This type of view is less easy to systematisethan the Consequentialist view. But for present purposes Deontologistscan be divided into those who start from lists of separate duties or rights,and those who start from one general formula from which more particularduties may all be derived. The source of the list or the formula is typicallysaid to be reason or rational intuition. But a religious philosopher mightground them in God's commandments, even if he thought, as many did, thatwe can be aware of such commandments by the light of reason without theneed of religious revelation. I shall begin with the list-makers. Examples of these would be John Lockein the seventeenth century, Richard Price in the eighteenth century andDavid Ross and H. A. Prichard in the twentieth. Some Deontological philosophersspeak in terms of duties, others of rights, but for our purposes they maybe grouped together. However, we need to distinguish between two kindsof rights. Some rights, commonly called negative rights, are rights notto be treated in certain ways, and there are corresponding duties not totreat the owners of these rights in these ways. Other rights are positiverights to receive goods or services. Other people may have a duty to providethese, though it tends to be difficult to decide exactly who, as with suchrights as the right to work. There are two negative rights, found in most lists, which are particularlyrelevant to voluntary euthanasia. These are: the right not to be killed,corresponding to a duty not to kill, and the right to liberty correspondingto a duty to respect others' liberty. I shall say a little about each ofthese. The notion of a duty not to kill seems at first to rule out euthanasiaof any kind, and those who oppose euthanasia sometimes seem to think thatall they need to do is to say 'Thou shalt not kill' in a suitably solemnvoice. But we do not regard the prohibition of killing as absolute: wemay think there can be justified wars or justified capital punishment,or that killing in self- defence or defence of others is justified. Andit is easier to justify voluntary euthanasia than the killing in theseother cases, where the person who dies does not choose to do so. If thereason why in general we ought not to kill is that life is a person's mostprecious possession, then that reason can be overturned if the person nolonger wants to live. ...those who oppose euthanasia sometimes seem to thinkthat all they need to do is to say "Thou shalt not kill" in asuitably solemn voice. However, if we argue in the language of rights, the issue ismore complex. A person's right to life corresponds to a duty of othersnot to kill him. Now rights can be waived or renounced, and if that happensothers no longer have a duty on that ground not to kill him. (As we shallsee, they may feel that they still have such a duty on other grounds.)But when someone requests voluntary euthanasia, he is not only renouncingthe negative right not to be killed; he is also asserting a positive rightto be killed in that particular way. The issue then arises of who has theduty to provide this, and many doctors who are happy about letting peopledie or even about assisting suicide may not see themselves as having thispositive duty. Another negative right which features on many lists is a right to do asone sees fit, or right of liberty. Clearly this right cannot be unlimited.I do not have a right to harm others, and if what I want to do interfereswith what they want to do we will need to arrive at some compromise. Iwill also have some specific obligations to some other people, and probablygeneral duties to contribute to the welfare of others - though the extentand even the existence of this last kind of duty is controversial. Butit might be thought that if what I want to do neither harms nor interfereswith others, and if I have duly fulfilled my obligations to others andcontributed to their welfare, and if I am of sound mind, then I have theright to do as I see fit in other matters, and others have the correspondingduty not to interfere. But, as before, the distinction between negative and positive rights isrelevant. The negative right to liberty entails that no one may preventanother person from committing suicide (if he is of sound mind, and soon) or from helping another person to die if they both wish this. It wouldnot follow that there is a positive right to be helped to exercise thisliberty to die. But why should anyone have any reason not to help? Onereason for many is that they feel uneasy about regarding life itself asjust a possession which can be dealt with in the same way as any other.Sometimes the source of the uneasiness is religious. I cannot considerhere whether Christianity, to take only one religion, necessarily impliesa condemnation of voluntary euthanasia; this seems to me to be a very complexquestion. But I think one can say that whereas believers are entitled totheir own misgivings, they are not entitled to impose them on others whodo not share their religion or do not interpret it in the same way. However, there are also secular points of view which give a special statusto human life and which at first sight seem to rule out voluntary euthanasia.I will consider two of these. Both belong to the other wing of the Deontologicalposition: that which deals in general formulae rather than specific lists. The first formula I shall consider is Natural Law. This term can be usedbroadly to mean morality, seen as like law but distinct from the man-madelaws of particular states and conceived of as prescribed by reason andperhaps ultimately by God. But I am using the term more specifically, tomean the idea that the right action is always that which fulfils and respectshuman nature - our potential and purpose as human beings - in ourselvesand others. This idea is often religious and based on God's purpose forhuman beings. But it also exists in a secular form. This formula is often thought to rule out suicide and therefore also voluntaryeuthanasia. For example, it is argued that human beings have a naturalinstinct of self- preservation which bids them preserve their lives, soit is going against nature to seek one's own destruction. But one can replythat a human being's nature is not only instinct. Human beings also have by nature the capacity to use reason to considertheir own greatest welfare and ask whether instinct is serving them well,and the decision that existence is no longer worth having is one whichexercises just those faculties which are traditionally thought to be peculiarlyhuman. We might also say that it is particularly characteristic of humannature to wish to preserve its own dignity and autonomy. I would thereforeargue that the formula of Natural Law need not be seen as ruling out eithersuicide or voluntary euthanasia. The other formula that I wish to consideris Respect for Persons as Ends. The puzzling phrase 'as ends' means thathuman beings are to be valued for their own sakes and not simply used asa means to the fulfilment of anyone's wishes. They have a unique worthwhich cannot be measured in terms of any amount of other goods. This rather cloudy idea, developed in these terms by Kant in the eighteenthcentury, is easier to revere than to apply. Kant himself certainly thoughtthat it ruled out suicide. He thought that suicide was the destructionof a uniquely valuable human self for the sake of some mere wish - forexample, the wish to relieve pain or misery. Presumably Kant would havetaken the same line about voluntary euthanasia. But it is not clear thatRespect for Persons must condemn all cases of suicide and voluntary euthanasia,particularly as personhood is conceived of in terms of reason and capacityfor morality, not merely being alive. I would argue that many choosersof voluntary euthanasia show rather than deny Respect for Persons: theybelieve they are called upon to exercise their autonomy to prevent thegradual change of their personhood into something less - animal, vegetableor even machine. ...the decision that existence is no longer worth havingis one which exercises just those faculties which are traditionally thoughtto be peculiarly human. I hope to have shown that those branches of Deontology thatI have considered - the right to life and liberty among list items, andthe general formulae of Natural Law and Respect for Persons - do not necessarilyforbid voluntary euthanasia and may even enjoin allowing it. These arenot the only list items or formulae that might be considered. But theymight be enough to show that the Deontological approach can permit euthanasiaand safeguards individual rights better than Utilitarianism. What about the law? The typical Deontological approach to the law wouldbe that it should reflect morality, rather than be independently assessedin purely pragmatic terms, as with Utilitarianism: if voluntary euthanasiais morally permissible, the law should allow it. But if unwanted consequencesdo arise from a permissive law, the Deontologist has a dilemma, ratherlike that which faces liberals in the United States, where the constitutionguarantees the right to freedom of speech and therefore allows people todeliver with impunity racist and religious abuse that would be illegalin Britain. Should a right to voluntary euthanasia be enshrined in laweven if the existence of that law has undesirable results? The proper resolutionof this dilemma would depend on the details of what happens, so I cannotdiscuss it here. Instead, I shall look briefly at the branch of Consequentialismthat I mentioned at the beginning without discussion: Egoism. Consequentialism Revisited - Egoism The Egoist believes that the right action is always that which has thebest consequences for the doer of the action, or agent. As with Utilitarianism,there are different versions of this doctrine according to whether thegood consequences are seen in terms of maximum pleasure, minimum pain (HedonisticEgoism) or in terms of other good consequences for the agent, such as hisor her self- development or flourishing. At first sight, Hedonistic Egoism seems to prescribe a life spent tramplingon anyone who gets in one's way, and so to be ruled out as contrary toeverything that is normally thought of as right. But ever since Plato philosophershave realised that in general human beings cannot maximise pleasure inthat way. Most people are not strong enough to do this with impunity, andin any case most people need friendship and cooperation with others fortheir own happiness. So Hedonistic Egoism cannot be dismissed quite sohastily. However, occasions would arise where Hedonistic Egoism, like HedonisticUtilitariansm, demands ruthless action. For example, it would prescribeinvoluntary euthanasia to a doctor or carer who would gain a good dealfrom someone's death, did not care enough about the victim to miss himpersonally and could conceal his deed from anyone who did. Such people,if rational, would not even feel guilty, for they would by their creedhave done the right thing. A doctrine which prescribes this, even if onrare occasions, is too much at variance with our ordinary ideas of moralityto be persuasive. However, Higher Egoism is another matter. For example, Aristotle's doctrineis that the right policy in life is not to pursue our own pleasure butto develop our own flourishing or foster our best selves. And the bestself is a non-egoistic self, who cultivates the kind of friendship in whichfriends are second selves and possesses all the moral virtues, includingother-regarding ones such as generosity and justice. This kind of Egoism, instead of telling us always to pursue our own welfare,in a sense breaks down the distinction between self and others; we couldnot readily criticise it on the ground that it was obviously at variancewith our ordinary moral views. On the other hand, it is not much use asa guide to action. We first need to know what kinds of action are virtuousin order to cultivate the virtues Aristotle speaks of. The appeal of theAristotelian approach today is not as a guide, but as a general frameworkin which one may set the moral life, and indeed all aspects of life. Aristotlethinks we cannot but pursue our own good as we see it, and perhaps he isright. But he aims to win us to a noble view of that good, in which ourown true welfare is to be the best we can be. He lays stress on the distinctivenature of man and on the best life as one in which rational faculties arewell exercised. The idea of a death with dignity, one in which these valuesare preserved, fits well with his outlook. Conclusion In this paper I have tried to show in outline how various well-knownphilosophical theories of morality can be applied to the dilemma of deathwith dignity. I have argued that none of these theories need be interpretedas forbidding voluntary euthanasia and that several of them can providea convincing justification of it. > >WT02-B27-176IA007-000073-B037-194http://www.euthanasia.org:80/press.html 194.88.132.128 19970222053311 text/html 28301HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 05:41:10 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society Press Releases Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society: Press Releases PRESS RELEASE 21 Nov 1996 Prof S McLean Study- Sometimes a Small Victory.

We are very heartened by the results. It provides politicianswith the ammunition they need to approach such issues responsibly, andreach a compassionate response when all palliative options have been exhausted." *********************************************** Glasgow University: Glasgow University's Institute ofLaw & Ethics in Medicine today released the results of its year-longintensive study into the pros and cons of the physician-assisted suicidedebate. The Report, called Sometimes a Small Victory, which is over 200pages long, includes a thorough examination of the relevant legal, medicaland ethical dilemmas, together with two surveys that reveal current feelingsof the public at large and also within the medical profession. Concluding that people wish to see the issues debatedand many would welcome legal change, the report includes a draft Bill whichthe researchers call a "legislative template" for moving forward. Highlights: The Report disagrees with the House of LordsSelect Committee on Medical Ethics, and says: "...the arguments againstlegislation are not of sufficient weight to tip the scales against thearguments in favour, but they must be accorded consideration in the draftingof any legislation which would produce change. This is no easy task, butone which must be undertaken." Surveys: When asked preferred methods, 42% preferred voluntaryeuthanasia and 28% assisted suicide (22% had no preference). In a separate,postal survey of UK medical practitioners and pharmacists, 54% were infavour of a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide to takeplace in specific circumstances, with only 36% against. 60% of the 1000practitioners who responded had treated a patient who was considering suicide,12% personally knew another health professional who had assisted a patientto kill themselves and 4% had themselves provided the means (such as drugsor information about lethal acts) to assist a patient to kill themselves. One interesting finding of the second study was that mostmedical practitioners found physician-assisted suicide preferable to voluntaryeuthanasia (43% in comparison to 19%), especially in view of the findingsin the first study which showed the public's preference for voluntary euthanasia. There was little by way of differences in the percentagesof hospital physicians, medical GPs, surgeons or psychiatrists favouringa change in the law - approximately 48% were in favour. This was in starkcontrast to the percentage of pharmacists in favour (72%) and anaesthetists(56%). Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the viewthat "if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctorsshould be allowed in law to assist." Definitions: Assisted suicide: this is where the personwho wants to die takes their own life with the help of a doctor who providesthe means of death: i.e., a prescription for drugs. It is the action ofthe person himself or herself which leads to their own death, at the timeand place of their choice. Voluntary euthanasia: this is where the persondecides they want to die and is helped to die by someone such as a doctoror other medical staff, friends or family. It is the actions of the otherperson that lead to death. *********************************************** SOMETIMES A SMALL VICTORY S. McLean, A.

Chapter 8 Matters of life and death: attitudes to euthanasia by DavidDonnison and Caroline Bryson A fate worse than death Very few people in Britain are at either endsof the debate over euthanasia, asserting either a person's right to dieat will or a prohibition against being able to opt for death regardlessof the circumstances. The vast majority fall somewhere in between, supportingeuthanasia in certain qualified circumstances. An overwhelming 82%, forinstance, would support a law allowing doctors to end the life of someonewith 'a painful incurable disease', up from 75% who took this view aboutten years ago. At the other extreme, only 12% think euthanasia should beallowed by law for someone who is 'simply tired of living and wishes todie'. A bare majority (51%) would legalise euthanasia for a person 'whois not in much pain nor in danger of death, but becomes permanently andcompletely dependant on relatives for all their needs'. Does support vary with age? Young people are less likely than olderpeople to be religious, a factor strongly associated with views on euthanasia.But, after taking differences in 'churchgoing' into account, the effectof age on attitudes towards euthanasia disappears. So while older peopleare, on the whole, less pro-euthanasia than the young, the data certainlydo not suggest that this is because they are closer to the age at whichmatters of life and death begin to come more sharply into focus. Eitherway, overall support for euthanasia is likely to continue increasing overtime as younger, less religious, cohorts replace their older, more religiouscounterparts in the population at large. Living wills Only 2% of the public have made living wills (which saywhat doctors should do if one is incapable of making decisions for oneself),but a further 12% of people say they have considered making one. More important,perhaps, nearly three in four people believe that doctors should be allowedto honour living wills and to end a person's life in the circumstancesthey have laid out.

PRESS RELEASE / COMMENT 25 Apr 1996 Janet Johnstone Scots law yesterday, in the historic ruling from Lord Cameron, whichallowed PVS patient Janet Johnstone to have a feeding tube removed so thatshe could die in peace, took a step forward from its English counterpart. Sheila McLean, international Bar Association Professor of Law & Ethicsin Medicine at Glasgow summed it up thus: "Coupled with the earlier statement from the Lord Advocate, that,as a matter of policy, he would not prosecute doctors who remove nasogastricfeeding from patients in this condition if they have obtained the authorityof the Court of Session, doctors in Scotland can now be reassured thattheir actions will attract neither civil nor criminal liability - assumingcourt authorisation has been granted. In this, they are more fortunatethan their counterparts in England and Wales for whom the question of criminalliability is less clear." The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society welcomed the decision. Said ExecutiveSecretary Chris Docker: "This must be an immense relief for the family.SOciety needs to look at the whole range of decisions at the end of lifeso that morals can catch up with medicine. 50 years ago we would not havehad such dilemmas; today, it is harder to know when enough is enough. Wealso welcome the fact that tighter guidelines are being drawn up for thediagnosis of persistent vegetative state. No-one wants plugs pulled whenthere is any chance of any reasonable quality of life: we have to knowbeyond all reasonable doubt." PRESS RELEASE (VESS) 20 Mar 1996 (Immediate Release) Living Wills Although welcoming the attention given to living wills (advance directives)by the Patients' Association and the BMA, The Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety was cautious in its response. Said Executive Secretary, Chris Docker: Living Wills are an attempt to look at a tiny part of the problem of deathand dying in isolation from the real question of whether death is everpreferable to life. Although there are advantages to making a living will,there are many pitfalls, and we are not confident that the BMA and Patients'Association's remit has adequately examined them. While it is admirablethat some attempts to give guidance on these tricky questions are beingmade, there is still too great a tendency by most organisations to viewthe question of living wills, that are essentially about personal moralchoices, as if they could be neatly wrapped up in medical and legal thinking. The experience of other countries, notable the USA and Denmark, has shownthat much (seemingly) good theory on living wills has resulted in littlenet benefit to the patient. If we really want to respect patient autonomywe have to find a way that will work in practice, not just a neat ideathat everyone thinks should work. Our organisation has long experienceand a track record of research in this area yet we feel much more workstill needs to be done. PRESS RELEASE (Living Will & Values History Project) 20 Mar 1996(Immediate Release) Living Wills The BMA and the Patients' Association have recently released a Guidefor patients who wish to make "living wills" or "advancedirectives". These documents are to indicate refusal of treatmentin advance of incompetence. They cannot request treatment that would nototherwise be offered and they cannot request active euthanasia. Evidence shows that living wills reassure many people that they will notbe "overtreated" or "kept alive as vegetables". Insome cases, such as persistent vegetative state, such fears are perhapswell-founded and a living will would make the job of doctors and the courtsa lot easier. Unfortunately, most people don't make living wills. Of those who do, mostare ignored, even though they are supported by common law. Responsible guidance on such documents can only be to the good, but societyneeds to take a much deeper look at the problems of death and dying inthe modern world, and the problems of communication between doctor andpatient. Shallow reliance on living wills is like looking through the keyhole,without sufficiently broad vision to find answers to the wide range ofproblems, and without even a reliable key to unlock the door. The Living Will and Values History Project encourages the use of livingwills, but emphasises the crucial nature of dialogue with the doctor -without which such documents may be rendered almost valueless. We stronglyencourage the use of non-medicalised forms such as "values histories".There is a strong trend to treat what is essentially a question of personalvalues and personal ethics as if it were a medical matter; this is unfortunate,but well designed living wills that emphasize patients' values and interestscould be very useful, especially if given greater weight in law (as proposedin the English Law Commission's recent bill, for instance). People planning to make living wills should find out as much as they can- such information-gathering could well include whatever advice the Patients'Association can offer. The Living Will & Values History Project supplies packs, at a nominalcharge to cover costs, which include the latest living will document, avalues history statement, stickers, wallets and other accessories, as wellas guidance for patients, lawyers and doctors. The documents are the resultof wide academic research over several years and have been warmly welcomedin the field of medical law and ethics. PRESS RELEASE 26 Dec 1995 (Immediate release) New Web Site The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society is pleased to announce itsnew Internet Web Site. The site will provide resource ionformation for all projects relating tovoluntary euthanasia, living wills, refusal of medical treatment etc; aswell as access to current news on these topics, both Scottish and worldwide. The main access point is: http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/fastaccs.html This provides links to the various areas of interest (For further information Contact Chris Docker, Executive Secretary, Scottish Voluntary EuthanasiaSociety 17 Hart Street, Edinburgh EH1 3RN Tel 0131-556-4404 Fax 0131-557-4403 email didmsnj@easynet.co.uk Government rejects living wills bill in its present form - Commentby the Living Will & Values History Project 18 Jan 1996 On Tuesday, the Lord Chancellor announced that the Government has rejected,in its present form, the Bill by the law Commission on Mental Incapacitythat deals with Living Wills. He has said the Government will issue a consultationpaper. The Living Will and Values History Project would welcome a bill toclarify the position of living wills but believes such a bill needs tobe more than mere window dressing. The Law Commission's proposals are admirablein many ways but fail to take into account extensive evidence that showsliving wills are only signed by a few people and that most of those documentsare ignored by health care staff when the time comes. Studies also showthat proxies are unable to make decisions as the patients would have wishedand no allowance is made for this in the Law Commissions proposals. Legislation that is ineffective will give people false reassurance.Consultation which merely asks for a cross section of opinions standsto fall from inattention to empirical research. Greater steps need to be taken to ensure effective communication betweendoctors, patients and proxies. One measure that would assist the processwould be encouragement of "values histories" - advance statementsthat are more personal and far less medicalised than the majority of livingwills. There is no longer the in depth understanding of the patient asa person that the traditional "family doctor" had time to develop.Mechanisms must be implemented to ensure vital personal preferences areknown and respected. Note to editors: 1.The Living Will and Values History Project was setup in response to the alarming growth and proliferation of living willdocuments that bore little correlation to academic and empirical data ontheir usefulness or effectiveness. It collates, analyses and applies researchin this area and acts as an adviser and resource base, as well as publishingits own document. It works on a non-profit basis.2. The Project has justopened its own site on the Internet, providing on-line information andsome examples of documents. URL: http://www.citynet.co.uk/users/vess/lwvh.html PRESS RELEASE 28 Dec 1995 (Immediate release) Details of Web Activity Why has the Society started its own website? We began using the web to get fast news ourselves on voluntary euthanasiaissues, particularly from the American site DeathNET. The Internet providesmuch faster updates than any other medium, including television, and widercoverage. We decided to maintain our own site firstly to provide a similarpresence with an emphasis on Scottish and UK current right to dieaffairs- such as the Janet Johnston case in the Court of Session Edinburgh justnow, or the bill by the Law Commission covering living wills and currentlybefore Parliament; we also want to attract new members - particular fromthe younger age-group - who will help to further the debate. We receivedozens of student enquiries a month - many from schoolchildren who findthat euthanasia is now part of their humanities course, and from universitystudents in areas such as medical law. Many of these students have accessto the Internet, and the site allows us to provide them with a great amountof information at hardly any cost. We have a strong research and liaisonbase, and feel the way forward is not solely through campaigning with thetraditional methods of a pressure group. Do you give out details of how to commit suicide on the Internet?That material is already there, but not from us. We do publish materialon how to die with dignity - it is the reason we originally came into being(in 1980) - but we believe such information should not be generally availableto the public. There are tragic cases of emotionally distraught peoplecommitting suicide after reading popular manuals from the library - wewill have no part in this, though people will find it before they findus if that's what they're looking for: our information pages provide internetlinks to the Samaritans, together with the warning that information broadcastand published by irresponsible individuals is frequently unreliable. Before anyone can apply for our booklet, they must provide documentaryevidence that they have been a member of a right to die organistaion fora minimum of three months: it doesn't have to be ours - the booklet isproduced on a non-profit basis. There are other restrictions, and we onlyissue it in accordance with clear ethical and legal guidelines. In somecountries they are even more strict: in Germany, where they have sold over10,000 copies in translation, the waiting period is 12 months. In a country where no-one can ask a doctor to legally perform euthanasiaif everything else is hopeless, having such information gives hundredsof individuals a sense of security about the the period before death. Mostpeople who purchase the booklet will never use it, but it is like havingthe key to the door marked Exit.

In Britain, even if you have exhausted all other options and despite sincerelyrequesting it, the humane assistance of a doctor to bring your death a little closer isneither something you can count on nor something tolerated by law.Hopefully you would never want someone to do that anyway - most terminal sufferingcan be relieved these days - but if you were one of the unlucky ones whose sufferingcouldn't be relieved, what consolation is it to know that the law might be changedlong after you're dead? Probably not a lot. But a doctor or friend helping you (oreven being in the same room with you) when you decide to end your life could resultin a criminal prosecution for the survivor. In a country where voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide are unregulated andillegal, the only real option for some people can be, sadly, to commit suicide. TheEnglish language is short on words to distinguish between different types of suicide.The word "suicide" can be used to cover the irrational self-killing of a lonely teenagerwho is suffering temporary emotional depression. But take the death of a 93 year oldman suffering unrelievable indignities from a terminal illness who calmly decides to goout on his own terms, at his own time and choosing: suicide hardly seems to describeit, and so the term "self-deliverance" has gradually come into popular usage. SO IF PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE SELF-DELIVERANCE, SURELY THERE'S NO NEEDFOR VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA?Unfortunately it isn't quite that simple. There are many ways that people die, butvery few completely reliable ways. In the case of a suicidally-depressed teenager, it isperhaps a good thing that a lot of attempts fail; but failure in the case of a rationalattempt - to leave an existence of unbearable suffering - only adds trauma and a senseof inability to the unrelievable problems which motivated the attempt. The horrors offailed rational suicides have been well documented by writers such as Russel Ogdenand Lonny Shavelson - many of these failures have followed good &quotadvice". BUT IF YOU MAKE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHONEED IT, WHAT IF IT GETS INTO THE WRONG HANDS?Someone who is determined to find ways to end his or her own life will probablyunearth all the known information from newspapers, crime stories and medicallibraries. Depressed people may not even bother researching the ways - they maychoose violent methods such as crashing a motor-car or jumping off a cliff (thougheven these methods are not completely foolproof). But for rational self-deliverance,such means are abhorrent - a life of dignity and self-control reflects consideration forother people and the memories one leaves behind. Drugs or car exhausts are moreoften the method of choice.There has been for a time books on methods of self-deliverance, such as &quotFinal Exit", &quotSuicide Mode d'Emploi" and &quotGentle Death." These books have been available from almost anybookstore. Although their success has drawn valuable public attention tothe desperate need for such information, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Societydoes not believe that such open dissemination of this type of literature is desirable.We seek to discourage irrational suicide that is a result of transient emotionaldepression; but, especially since physician-assisted suicide is not an option in thiscountry, we believe that competent adults should still have some say in timing theirdeath if they so wish.For the vast majority, knowing that one can choose the door marked &quotExit" if thingsget too bad is an immense comfort and reassurance. That reassurance, however, isnothing but false hope if the information is faulty. THE SCOTTISH VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA SOCIETY - PIONEERS IN SELF-DELIVERANCEIn July 1979, Exit - then the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Great Britain) decided that abook on how to end one's own life would be a good idea. After announcing theirintention, membership rose at a rate of 1,000 a month from an initial 2,000. Thefollowing year however, concerned over conflicting legal opinions, they decided notto publish. The Scottish Branch voted to become independent in order to publish andso, in 1980, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Scottish Exit) became thefirst right to die society in the world to publish such a booklet for its members. Itwas called "How to Die With Dignity." The booklet was based on the opinions of asingle doctor and contained many errors, as have subsequent books, and so eventuallyin 1993 an International Drugs Consensus Working Party met at the Society'sheadquarters to finalise a scientifically researched volume called "Departing Drugs.&quotThe academic foundations were published in a later work called "Beyond Final Exit",and the legality of publication examined by the Scottish Regius Professor of Law,Joseph Thomson. Please note that self-deliverance books often give varying information and, that of the various drugs books available, we can only vouch for the information in these two volumes, which is based on published scientific research. The booklet was compiled and distributed as a non-profit venture and, unlike other manuals, available not from bookshops but only by formal application to the Society.Before the book was issued, one of the rules was that any purchaser must have been amember of a right to die society for at least three months, so discouragingirresponsible or ill-considered use of its contents. The Society also reserves the right torefuse to sell it - something an assistant in a bookshop is unable to do with the"popular" guides. We take our responsibilities very seriously. Most members whopurchase the booklet are in excellent health and are simply wanting a sort ofinsurance for their dying years, months or days. But if an individual seems suicidal wealways offer counselling or referral to a support group. DO PEOPLE USE SELF-DELIVERANCE IN THE NETHERLANDS?When a person has made a successful request for voluntary euthanasia, doctors oftenfavour allowing the patient to take the final, lethal medicine him or herself, as a finalact of will. Departing Drugs is currently being translated into Dutch (as it has beentranslated into Spanish, German and French). However, only a few patients arephysically able to do so by the time they want their final release. For those that are,there is the added assurance that the doctor will take over if anything goes wrong.Equally important, there is always the presence of a reassuring hand, whether of thedoctor, friends or relatives - all of whom may be present. It is a sad reflection on the society in which we live that people sometimes need todie alone and in secret. A humane law for voluntary euthanasia or physician-assistedsuicide would reduce the pressure on "self-deliverance." Until then, people are dying,often badly, and they deserve what help and support we can give them. exploring the options for dying with dignity... Copyright © 1996 Chris Docker.

The BMA took up the challenge andcoordinated a multi-professional group that this month published theCode as an impressive booklet. It comes as a 40-page paperback containing the principle points ofthe Code expanded with explanatory notes throughout. The mainpoints are repeated in a concise 16-page insert contained in a backpocket. The Code takes immediate pains to point out that there are a widevariety of advance statements (living wills) under consideration,including directives, statements of wishes, beliefs and values, triggeringstatements, oral statements, notes of a discussion, or the nominatingof a representative. It includes sections on the current legal position,the drafting of such statements and directives, assessing capacity, andimplementation. Two handy flowcharts are provided - one on the typesof statement (reproduced opposite) and one on the decision-makingprocess the health care team should follow when confronted by sucha document. The health care team must ask if the statement is aclear and applicable refusal of treatment, and address such questionsas, is it is valid? is it an emergency? is the patient pregnant? and soon. A clear framework is given showing when the advance statementshould or shouldn't be followed, and how to act in each particular setof circumstances. The differences between Scotland, England andWales are considered, the liability of health professionals, and the -situation with regards to conscientious objection. Finally a veryresponsible nine-point minimum requirements list isappended. All in all the booklet seems set to have a profound effect on theattitude of health professionals towards the implementation of livingwills. The BMA clearly have done their homework very well; aware ofsome of the pitfalls that the USA has fallen into with its legislation on livingwills dating from 1990, the drafters of the new Code have gone backto basics to stress the underlying values of the patient that must berespected, and the place of advance statements in this process. It willhopefully prove a salutary lesson to the drafters of living wills thatproduce overly medicalized or quasi-legal documents, which researchindicates are so ineffective in practice. It will provide an unambiguousand easily digestible guide to health professionals that have struggledwith the quagmire of confusion and questions over what comprisesethical conduct and good medical practice if a living will is presented.Perhaps most importantly, by emphasising the underlying values aboutwhich there is in fact little argument, the Code is an inestimablyimportant step in reconciling the differences between the"pro" and "anti" lobbies on this important question.

The NorthernTerritory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 has been passed andis currently being put into force. It was also affirmed by a SupremeCourt of the Northern Territory Ruling . The Bill was not the work of a euthanasia society. A small right-to-diegroup has subsequently formed in the Territory, however, and there areestablished v.e. societies in other states. Amongst continuing battles over the new law, a Darwin man suffering fromprostate cancer became the first (publicly acknowledged) person to diewith Dr Nitschke's "death machine." He passed away on Sunday22nd September 1996. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA In America, a recent rulingof the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal, meant that assisted suicide(in the sense of a doctor prescribing lethal drugs for self-administrationby a patient) was no longer unconstitutional in the western states. (Asimilar decision was reached shortly afterwards by the east coast's 2ndCircuit.) The ruling was a result of an action brought in Washington by thesmall right-to-die group Compasssion In Dying which, together witha number of terminally ill individuals, challenged the constitutionalityof Washington's law against assisted suicide. The 9th Circuit also reversed an earlier ruling which had declared Oregon'sassisted suicide law TheDeath With Dignity Act (Measure 16) unconstitutional. Note: a stay was put on the 9th and 2nd Circuit decisions on 6th May 1996.The stay will remain in force until the decisions can be reviewed by theUS Supreme Court. Dr Kevorkian continues to assist in suicides in the state of Michigan.No court has been able successfully to prosecute him. For a quick update on US cases and laws, see the Choicein Dying site. Other countries Reports show that euthanasia and assisted suicide is practiced illegallyin many countries. Russell Ogden reported case studies in Canada of assistedsuicides with buddies helping terminally ill AIDS patients. A British MedicalJournal Report showed that many UK doctors who had been faced with a euthanasiahas acceded to the request. See: A-Z Index and Quotesdatabase. Some common fallacies (Note: "Assisting" suicide in the sense of general provisionof information on how to commit suicide is probably not illegal anywhere- except in France - especially if it is not directly and knowingly givento a person about to commit suicide. "Assisting" in the senseof being present varies from area to area in whether it is against thelaw.) "Assisting" in the sense of directly providing the means (asdoes Dr Kevorkian, or as provided by Oregon's Death With Dignity Act) iswhat is generally so controversial: Assisting suicide is not legal in Scotland. Suicide has never been a criminaloffence (unlike in England), but assisting a suicide would be prosecutedunder laws such as the law against culpable homicide. There are no laws to allow assisted suicide in practice in Germany or Switzerland,contrary to frequent claims. To see how cases are handled, students maywish to refer to our quotations database. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are not, and never have been, legal inthe Netherlands. Note: Serious students wishing to do original research on thelegal situation around the world are recommended to write to the relevantLaw Commissions etc, not to the euthansia societies, all of whom, it mustbe emphasised, are not an authority on the law.

I requested a ward job, and entered into the detailed induction. Even unpaid, and with a simple remit, we were required to be tutored in hospice philosophy and practice. Following on from this, the physical training in tray-setting (standardized to the last posy and matching cruet) was scarcely demanding. I was, however, daunted by the prospect of presenting these oh-so-correct trays to the terminally ill in the small wards. There was really nothing to fear; for the first few workshifts I was accompanied by an experienced volunteer, who emphasized a list of "nots". Not if the privacy curtain was drawn; not if the medical director was at a bedside; not if the chinagraph list in our preparation kitchen said not. The few patients with whom I initially conversed were, accordingly, reasonably able and showed no special discomfort. The building, purpose-built, had an open layout and common areas were skylit and sunny. If death was the ultimate business of the hospice, it visited quietly among the shadows. Preoccupied mainly with presenting the carefully researched menus in their dainty dishes, it was a few weeks into my stint before I discovered that one of my patients, John, with whom I had conversed on various subjects and habitually nipped in to see at spare moments, was getting worse. It began one day when he refused his customary pre-lunch gin and tonic. The cocktail round was a joky interlude amongst all the participating patients, and I, as the holder of the drinks cupboard key, was the butt of many well-meant jokes about my own sobriety. John's refusal of a drink was followed by his barely touching his lunch. During my next shift, I was distressed to see him still in bed, in his pyjamas, with a slack look about his face. He did, however, want lunch. How falsely reassured we are when a failing human requests nutrition! Again, though, he barely sampled each separately-served dish. When I collected his tray, he was dozing, with his legs, pyjamas and bedclothes akimbo. A urine tube extruded from his body. I noticed that his walking frame, with which he had previously managed to reach the bathroom, was missing. The proud man, who has dressed each day in shirt, tie, and pressed trousers, had, it seemed departed forever. Arriving for duty three days later, I signed in at our office, made my copy of the inpatients list, and noted with grief the red asterisk by John's name. I had seen such an asterisk before, but never really known the patient to whom it pertained. The red asterisk did not spare us from the dying room. It alerted us to the possible needs of "compassionate" visitors at the bedside. John's daughter, who had given me flower-arranging tips and swapped house-moving stories, was sitting as still as the shadows. At her feet were carrier bags filled with his precious photo-albums and an assortment of bundled clothing. A smell of faeces hung in the air, and I asked her if she would like a tea-tray in the lounge, euphemistically whilst the nurses made sure her father was comfortable. She appeared dazed as she followed me into the corridor. "He's a smart man" she said, "and very intelligent." Not, her eyes said, someone to soil themselves and lie in the mess. Mute with pity, I gripped her hand. She was chilled, and I wished I could wrap her in a blanket, or at least a cardigan. But in my designated role, tea and a shortbread finger were the best I could offer. As the deterioration continued, I wished John dead. I wished his room unshaded, with a fresh flower posy on the locker and Ruth, the perky Catering Manager, offering selections from the menu to a new patient still dazzled by our range of services and courtesies. These were, it has to be said, far superior to the hospital which had arranged the transfer. The red asterisk, and John's name, remained on the list for four more days. During that time the bedside company multiplied, alternated, slept on reclining chairs or in the lounge, ate exclusively from our snack menu, smoked outside on the terrace, but never, it seemed, showed much emotion. John, dehydrated, shrank to a bony huddle amongst the folds of the ripple bed. A nurse told me that scopalamine is given during the terminal stages, to dry secretions and quiet the death rattle. So, no opportunistic pneumonia for John. He died a few minutes into one of my shifts, and it fell to me to take tea and coffee orders from the assembly in the visitors' room. And suddenly the grief was all around me; John's elderly brothers crying openly, a nephew recalled from abroad hugging everyone, three genteel ladies sitting red-eyed in a neat row. John's daughter, by contrast, showed composure. Her hanky was crumpled but dry. "I'm glad it's over", she said quietly. Feedback from all readers is welcome.

In preparation for a paper for the 1994 World Congress on Medical Law in 1994 in Jerusalem, I engaged on a study of living wills and relevant legislation and strategies from around the world. In all, over 60 different documents have been collected, all currently in use, and translations into English obtained where appropriate. This work has been greatly facilitated by my post as Executive Secretary of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland (VESS),[1] itself a member of the World Federation of Right-To-Die Societies.[2] The study does not seek to promote the policies or documents of VESS however: the scientific presentation of such data collected is likely to suggest modifications to existing documents. 1b. The aim of this paper is an effort in cooperation to finding solutions to pressing problems; both the author and VESS wish to achieve progress through consultation and consensus wherever possible, rather than in any way taking a polarized stance. 1c. The Society has kept the word euthanasia in its title as it helps to provide a focal point for a great number of issues, but the word is open to a wide variety of definitions, many of which are contradictory and breed confusions. The areas considered in this submission may or may not be classified as euthanasia: to avoid unnecessary emotive distortions, the word has been generally avoided in the text, and phrases more conducive to consensus definition and medical understanding used. See also Para 13, infra. (Definitions of euthanasia that have a majority international and academic support are discussed in the Glossary). 1d. References to supporting documentation have been included, but with some regards to space and the short time available to prepare the submission. Further references and documentation are willingly offered, as are oral submissions. 2.Advance Directives 2a. In the context of health care, an Advance Directive is a document containing advance directions by the patient on health care treatment or non-treatment, or directions on how decisions concerning such treatment or non-treatment should be taken. Although these may include consent, or authority to consent, for particular treatments, they more commonly refer to non-treatment (or withdrawal of treatment). 2b. There are two main types of Advance Directive: a) A Living Will, and b) A Health Care Proxy Document. A third form, currently gaining acceptance abroad,[3] is a Pre-Hospital Do Not Resuscitate Form. 2c. These types of advance directives may operate independently or in conjunction with each other. 2d. In the presence or absence of legislation, or when legislation is being considered, accurate definitions will help to avoid confusion. The terms "Advance Directive", and, more particularly, &quotLiving Will", have already fallen into common parlance. In America the terms have specific legal meanings and in some states form part of the title of the statute. 2e. The suggestion by King's College/Terrence Higgins Trust,[4] based on a very limited study, and yet taken up by the British Medical Association,[5] that &quotadvance directives" pertain to documents for consent or refusal of treatment while &quotliving wills" refer only to refusal of treatment is not well supported. 2f. Similarly, the suggestion by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (VES) that use of the term &quotLiving Will" will lead to confusion with a &quotLast Will and Testament" has not been supported by developments in recent times. &quotLiving Wills" are widely discussed in the popular press and the term is now known to most health care workers. If it does not cause confusion to the man in the street, there is no reason it should do so to lawyers or law-makers. 2g. This submission proposes that the definitions already widespread in many parts of the world, both in law and in common use, accepted in common parlance in this country and following a semantic logic that is almost self-explanatory, be adopted and used (2a, 3a, et al.). 3. Living Wills 3a. Living Wills are advance directives made by a competent patient expressing that patient's wishes regarding health care, particularly with regards to refusal and/or consent to treatment(s), so that such wishes might become effective at a future time when that patient might have become incapacitated. 3b. As it is essential that a living will, to be of use, be readily accessible, rapid communication is a further argument for retaining this readily understood phrase, rather than the generic &quotAdvance Directive" - which could have diverse meanings unless qualified. 3c. The phrase &quotliving will" is internationally understood. It forms part of the wording (whether in English or in literal translation) of many documents currently in use in Canada, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Japan, South Africa, Spain, and Switzerland.[6] It is formally embodied in most American documents to distinguish them from Proxy Documents. It appears on the documents distributed in this country by the Terrence Higgins Trust, ARP over 50, the Natural Death Centre, and by Phyllis Goodheir.[7] 3.1 Model Forms 3.1a. Consideration has been given by the Law Commission[8] on whether a model form would be useful, and, if so, how it should be designed. Most attempts to design model forms to date have been fairly parochial - with or without expert legal[9] counsel. Many European and non-European countries now have experience of living wills. In America, there has been extensive legal experience, and the numerous modifications to improve on original statutes have shown excellent responses to difficulties that have occurred once legislation was in place (but perhaps could not reasonably have been foreseen).[10] American documents nevertheless remain largely legalistic in their appearance and have failed to incorporate many of the advances made in countries which do not have legislation. 3.1b. A consideration in the design of a living will model document might take into account that the health care profession is not likely to respond readily to legalistic documents that need a non-medical expertise to understand easily and at the same time are legally binding. This could create problems not only in a clinical setting when an urgent decision is required, but might also erode the doctor-patient relationship - an atmosphere of trust is easily disrupted by the threat of legal sanction. Furthermore, for a patient to make a competent decision in signing a living will, he or she should fully understand the document. Many elderly patients may have difficulty in prolonged concentration or in untangling the logics of a complex document. Poor eyesight may increase the strain of filling in such a document. Most patients will have little knowledge of medical or legal terminology.[11] Documents in Netherlands, France and Japan have developed a simple and highly empathetic style and language. This both aids understanding and encourages cooperation from doctors.[12] In Denmark, a very simple (and legally binding) document is supplemented by official guidelines to assist doctors in interpreting it.[13] In this country, the Terrence Higgins Trust Living Will[14] has a simple and empathetic style; although this was designed by a group not favouring legislation, certain stylistic merits could perhaps be incorporated in a legal model, for the reasons given above. Most importantly however, comparative study of extant living will designs to produce a model form should include both legally-binding and advisory-only documents. 3.1c. Cultural differences need to be allowed for by identifying those that might affect a document from another country, allowing for them when selecting potentially useful data or styles, and then overlaying British cultural idiosyncrasies. For example, in America, litigation is very common; in Japan, the opposite is the case. American precision might be usefully incorporated in Japanese documents if couched in suitable Japanese etiquette: non-antagonistic phraseology common in Japan might be used to advantage in American documents if precise definitions were appended in guideline procedures. In the U.K., the opposition of the BMA to legislation[15] demonstrates a corporate resentment by doctors to being restrained by legislation. The head-on legislation used in America is not seen as threatening in that country since American doctors are used to dealing with lawsuits. In Britain, part of the challenge is to devise legislation that will not incite divisiveness; the other aspect is to ensure that safeguards, whether in direct legislation or in guidelines allowed for by legislation, answer the many practical worries of health carers but still firmly protect the patient's autonomy and authority in making personal advance health care decisions, whether in a living will or by means of a proxy. 3.1d. A model form, within a statute but as a guide,[16] is preferable to an exact form laid down by legislation for many reasons. There are innumerable personalisations that might be desirable yet only applying to small groups of patients, referring to particular preferences for treatments for a certain type of illness (these might be anticipated, for instance, by a patient affected by AIDS or multiple sclerosis, where the general prognosis was already known); or to pregnancy waivers (for women of child-bearing age); or modifications might be needed in the light of new technology or available treatments. Legislation could perhaps address Guidelines so that these types of modifications were handled in a reasonable fashion.[17] 3.1e. There is much understandable resistance from bodies such as the BMA to entering into formal consultation with societies such as VESS or VES - partly because these societies affirm the need for reform in areas that are still controversial with some doctors, and partly because the very word &quoteuthanasia" in the title of the Society suggests measures that some[18] doctors (ie, and BMA members) would not wish to participate in (the progress of the argument recalls the opposition to contraception and abortion before these achieved more general acceptance). However, in designing model forms, it would be biassed and unscientific in the extreme to ignore the vast amount of data and experience built up by right-to-die societies,[19] whether in this country[20] or abroad.[21] 3.1f The suggestion that a model form could be dispensed with could lead to much confusion. Whilst many variations are possible, most G.P.s would find it a daunting task to draw up a living will from scratch at the request of a patient.[22] 3.2 Simple vs Complex Documents A recurring concern is that a simple document might be too vague to be helpful in a clinical situation; conversely, a complex and highly specific document may fail to accurately anticipate a specific situation. One of the most holistic and interdisciplinary of approaches is demonstrated in the evolution of the living will document used in the Netherlands. Over the years, this has progressed from a very simple statement to a document that covers various medical scenarios and areas where doubt might arise, and also allows the patient to add his or her own personalised paragraph (as a guide, several sample additions are suggested on a separate leaflet). 3.3 Register of Living Wills 3.3a. Even in the United States, where legislation has been in force for several years, a recurrent problem has been how to get enough people to make advance directives to make the system effective (so that health carers will have a clear guide as to the patient's wishes and not have to resort to surrogate decision making or judicial/clinical forums). 3.3b. In Denmark, registration of living wills has gone hand-in-hand with legislation. Three times the number of people anticipated registered living wills. It becomes a simple matter (a telephone call) for any doctor to check whether a patient has made a living will or not. If such registration are left to patients' groups or other organisation (permitted, yet not authorised by law), then lack of universal acceptance is liable to lead the system of registration into disuse.[23] 3.4 Medical CardsThe BMA[24] have recommended that patients carry a card indicating that a living will has been made and where it can be found. Medical cards currently issued by VESS and VES also include a brief, general statement of wishes regarding non-treatment. A number of medical cards in use in other countries[25] follow this model, whereas a number of cards issued by Canadian societies[26] specifically tell the person reading the card to consult the living will, lodged at such-and-such a place (or with such-and-such a G.P.) in relation to health care decisions. The latter design will perhaps be favoured as more practical by the BMA.[27] As one of the main suppliers of such cards, VESS is currently considering the format of its medical cards. Legislation could perhaps include the requirement that health care staff should make all reasonable efforts to obtain the living will if such a card was carried on the incapacitated patient. 3.5 Attention StickersAn idea which has received widespread support also relates to the ease with which a living will can be produced when required. VESS provides stickers for patients' notes or hospital charts to help to identify those patients that have living wills. VESS has a fund of experience that could be offered in addressing such practical questions, as well as the more fundamental ones. 4. Health Care Proxy Documents 4a. Like a living will, a health care proxy document is an advance directive made by the patient. A Health Care Proxy Document expresses advance directions, authorizing a competent patient to appoint an agent to make health care decisions for him or her, should the patient become incompetent. 4b. Although living wills and proxy authorizations have a number of similarities and are sometimes physically incorporated into one document, they also raise very differing questions and are perhaps best considered entirely separately. The present Bill[28] before parliament makes passing provision for proxy appointment and powers[29] and suggests them as part-and-parcel of the living will. An expansion, perhaps in a second Bill, concerning proxy appointment, powers and safeguards might be helpful. Primary emphasis on the living will directive as opposed to the proxy advance directive might be advantageously changed to give heavier emphasis to proxy power. If opposition to living will legislation becomes insurmountable for the time being, proxy legislation could stand alone.[30] In nearly all American states, the two legal instruments are quite distinct and one may operate in the absence of the other. Attention could be given in guidelines as to whether the proxy would have a final decision-making authority or whether the terms of the living will would take precedence. This is a question that has arisen in trying to implement advance directives in the U.S.A. and some provision should be made early on (for instance, by means of optional clauses in either document) for resolving it without the need to amend the urgently needed initial legislation. 4c. Both the living will and the proxy document have distinct and separate advantages[31] as legal instruments for ensuring the implementation of a patient's will. If legislators have not anticipated them, it is hardly reasonable to expect patients, or even doctors in consultation with patients, to anticipate them. Even without legislation, these questions need to be answered (as do many questions surrounding ways in which the patient's autonomous will may be implemented). The lack of legislation simply gives greater scope for medical paternalism in making decisions, or in deciding how decisions are to be made. 4d. The much sought-after &quotdoctor-patient cooperation" is hardly an equal partnership when the patient is lying comatose, and with no-one with legal authority to meet the doctor an equal footing. The importance of doctor-patient dialogue cannot be underestimated (or that of proxy-patient or proxy-doctor dialogue); but dialogue ceases to exist if one party is incapacitated and no legal instrument exists to vigourously uphold the patient's right to refuse treatment. While doctor-patient dialogue needs to be strengthened and not undermined, this is a separate issue, not one which is an alternative to advance directive legislation. As a society progresses from a rural &quotfamily doctor" norm to a high-tech, almost faceless plurality of health carers[32] there is an inevitable strain on such a dialogue. Studies have also demonstrated this progression, with a corresponding strain on the quality of individual health care, and also in societies in other parts of the world. 5. Withdrawal or Withholding of Treatment 5a. The differences between hastening death by withdrawing treatment, withholding treatment, and by administering drugs may have very little between them ethically[33] but the differences are strongly felt - the emotional trauma involved is very considerable. Lack of indication of the patient's wishes can introduce grave dilemmas for a doctor (this is reflected in the BMA's change of attitude towards living wills, which they had not seriously supported until 1992). Lack of ultimate legal power being invested in either the living will or the proxy may operate as a salve to the conscience of the doctor (at least he &quotconsidered" the patient's wishes) whilst protecting a paternalist status quo. It is hardly surprising that doctors, only newly shaking off their paternalist garb, find difficulty in accepting that the patient's wishes might take precedence over what the &quotdoctor thinks best". In fairness, a large proportion of doctors would welcome a more equal and open relationship with the patient, but are concerned about the adequacy of safeguards in proposed legislation, both against elder-abuse and against impractical living wills or proxies. Most of these fears are unfounded, and are allayed by careful, step-by-step, logical analysis, such as is being prepared by the Law Commission. In America, laws have been tempered and refined in the light of experience: while there might still be room for improvement on that path, there is not the self-delusion involved in the false optimism that says, &quotMaking laws to protect the wishes of the incapacitated patient might be difficult... maybe it's not necessary anyway". The VESS handles many cases in the course of its day-to-day work where the patient's wishes are ignored, or only respected because of strenuous insistence and protestation on the part of the patient or proxy. Pretending that it doesn't happen, or that it won't happen in a year or so if we (or the BMA) simply exhort doctors to respect patient autonomy, will not cure the problem. 5b. Advance directives also facilitate early decisions. In this respect, it should be noted that withholding treatment is far less traumatic for health-care staff, and far less demanding emotionally and intellectually, than withdrawing treatment that has been commenced, and perhaps continued for some period beyond initial stabilisation of the patient. 6. Physician-Assisted Suicide 6a. Physician-Assisted Suicide is the provision by a doctor, consciously and legally, to a patient who has competently requested it, the means[34] for that patient to end his or her own life.[35] Suicide is a non-criminal act, yet the law currently makes it illegal to assist, or even supply the means, for a competent adult to engage in this non-criminal act. 6b. In cases of unbearable and unrelievable suffering or indignity, physician-assisted suicide leaves no doubt as to the fact that the patient made the final decision. Doctors who commit suicide, statistically, are able to use sure and painless drugs. Those methods are not available to other members of society, and a doctor who makes them available is liable to criminal charges. Methods used by people who are not able to obtain such drugs need careful planning and preparation to avoid added suffering, pain and indignity. Killing oneself is easy (though not that easy); killing oneself painlessly and in a dignified manner that will not cause unnecessary suffering to oneself or others is a difficult business. This basically comes down to an equality which at present is tolerated by law. Laws are less severe in other European countries[36] although medical paternalism can still negate much of the law's rationale. The advantages of a physician prescribing drugs also include the prospect of dialogue, so that the patient can more fully examine and exhaust other options with the physician. The very prospect would mean a closer bond with the doctor - one less &quottaboo". One would know that if illness got so bad that life no longer held out any promise of meaningful existence, one could still turn to the doctor for support and respect, rather than the loneliness and pain of a bottle of paracetamol. Doctors I have spoken to are, by and large, remarkably uninformed about drugs that can reliably be taken orally to induce death. They know that many drugs might well cause death, that certain dosages are toxic, but they have received no training and have little or no knowledge of what amounts will reliably cause death. The &quotreliability" factor is the all-important one to the patient who wants to be 100% sure of the result. Prescribing drugs is far less traumatic a prospect for some doctors than giving a lethal injection (physician-aid-in-dying) and has the moral safeguard already mentioned of ensuring that the patient has the final control. It is seen by a number of states in America a more logical &quotnext step" than seeking immediate legislation on physician aid-in-dying (which has many practical advantages over physician-assisted-suicide). Legislation could be permissive in nature, so that a doctor with a conscientious objection to discussing such a request in an unbiassed fashion and subsequently perhaps prescribing the drugs, could refer a patient to another doctor, as happens with abortion. The ability to &quotleave by the door marked EXIT", should the final need arise, gives MANY patients the courage to go on much longer. This has been demonstrated in many cases known to staff at VESS, and is also well known in Netherlands (where the same sense of reassurance is conveyed by an approval of an application for physician aid-in-dying, so that the patient knows that such aid will definitely be available if his or her request continues). 7. Physician Aid-In-Dying 7a. Physician Aid-in-Dying is assistance by a qualified medical practitioner in implementing a patient's considered wish to end his or her own life, usually by means of lethal injection.[37] 7b. Although the possibility of physician-assisted suicide is welcome news to many people who may be facing the prospect of an agonising, humiliating and long drawn-out disease whilst still having some physical capabilities, it is of little reassurance to someone who is suffering from a wasting disease that will eventually rob them of the physical ability to commit suicide. Also, death by oral ingestion of drugs is far less sure than by skilful injection. A doctor on hand can make necessary adjustments of dosage for the patient's weight, condition, age, and history, and also take the necessary action if the something goes wrong. This, in essence, is the Dutch argument, and although drugs are often made available for the patient to take orally by his or her own hand, if and when desired and after due consultation, a physician is generally present to offer the technical support that a patient has the right to expect. 7c. The borders between physician-assisted suicide and physician aid-in-dying and the cruelty involved in their illegality has been recently highlighted by the public Appeal to the High Court of Canada by Sue Rodriguez, a young woman who is slowly, consciously, and in a most hideous fashion, suffering the unrelievable deterioration towards death produced by ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). Her remaining life expectancy is between three and fifteen months. She already has difficulty swallowing foods and experiences choking spells from time to time. She requires personal hygiene help. Very soon she will be completely unable to swallow, to speak, to walk and even turn over in bed without assistance. Soon she will be unable to breathe without a respirator. She will be totally dependent on others. The time is rapidly approaching when, to receive sustenance, she will require a gastrostomy. Armed with the knowledge that the end of her life is near, Sue Rodriguez wishes to exercise control over the timing and manner of her death. The problem facing her is that she does not wish to die while she has the capacity to enjoy life. In the result, by the time she is ready to die, her condition will be such that she will be physically unable to end her life without assistance. Accordingly, she seeks an order from the Court which will allow a qualified medical practitioner to set up technological means by which she might, by her own hand, at the time of her choosing, end her suffering, rather than prolong her death. 7d. The situation has been reecognised in many countries and was succinctly put by Justice Compton when he said, &quotThe right to die is an integral part of our right to control our own destinies so long as the rights of others are not affected. That right should, in my opinion, include the ability to enlist assistance from others, including the medical profession, in making death as painless and quick as possible."[38] 8. Pre-Hospital Non-Resuscitation 8a. Pre-Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Orders are a development in America to fill a gap that is left by Advance Directive legislation. If a patient is discovered in a critical state by ambulance crews, there is a prime duty to apply cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and attempt to stabilise the patient before any considered decisions, such as might be encompassed by a living will, are taken. This might be totally against the &quotbest interests" and/or wishes of the patient. In the U.K., guidelines have only recently been issued to correct the incredibly haphazard state of affairs that existed regarding DNR orders in hospitals. The problem of extending this to pre-hospital situations is primarily a practical one. It is being solved in America by the use of specific legislation or by official guidelines. Anything short of this is unlikely to produce the degree of uniform cooperation and understanding necessary in emergency crews. 8b. In Montana, U.S.A., a law has been passed authorizing the Department of Health and ENvironment Sciences to adopt a standard means of identification of individuals' wishes regarding life-sustaining procedures or &quotdo-not-resuscitate" to be met when emergency personnel are called. The program, called Comfort One, will be issuing bracelets similar to those manufactured by Medic-Alert. 8c. New York has enacted a similar law as an extension of its do-not-resuscitate law[39] and the bracelet will now allow individuals outside of hospitals and nursing homes to have their wishes met regarding cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. 8d. California and Connecticut have made similar provisions by means of regulations[40] rather than rather than statutes. All these measures have several advantages in common: they recognize the right of individuals to make decisions regarding their medical care, and they also free paramedics from the burden of providing treatment to those who do not want it or making subjective decisions about whether it would be wanted by, or be in the best interests of, the patient.[41] 9. Sanctity of Life & Personal Autonomy[42] 9a. The importance attached to these important moral principles, and the balance in which they are held by the people of Britain, has been succinctly and sensitively summed up by Lord Justice Hoffman[43] when he said that these principles are &quotdeeply rooted in our ways of thinking and that the law cannot possibly ignore them". He continued, &quotIn my view, the choice which the law makes must reassure people that the courts do have full respect for life, but that they do not pursue the principle to the point at which it has become almost empty of any real content and when it involves the sacrifice of other important values such as human dignity and freedom of choice." He concluded that English law, whilst paternalistic towards minors, respected the autonomy of adults, and quoted the decriminalization of suicide as a recognition that the principle of self-determination should in that case prevail over the sanctity of life. We should also remember that doctors generally are not trained as ethicists in any real sense of the word, even though many of them arrogate a high moral ground to their personal beliefs. 9b. It should be noted that legislation concerning advance directives in no way threatens the personal health care wishes of someone who believes in the sanctity of life over their own personal autonomy - they simply avoid making a living will or make an advance directive to indicate continued treatment in any circumstances (this need not place an unreasonable strain on health care resources, since an incapacitated patient has no authority to demand expensive or far-fetched treatments any more than a competent patient has; the advance directive may consent to treatment however.) 9c. In Japan, the moral dilemmas are similar, but for totally different reasons. The Japan Times noted, with that curious candour of an outside observer, that &quotThe view that all lives must be prolonged regardless of quality stems from the Judaeo-Christian tradition," and &quotthe notion of equality in Anglo-Australian law over-rides concerns with QOL (Quality of Life)". 10. The Doctor's Duty of Care 10a. The doctor's duty of care, and the type of care, is mostly fairly outlined if done so at the outset of the doctor-patient relationship. Thus a doctor with a conscientious objection to a patient's possible wishes in a living will should make this clear at the outset[44] to allow the patient the option of choosing a different doctor. Unless mutually agreed otherwise, the doctor's duty of care does not include extraordinary attempts to prolong life or actions contrary to the patient's express wishes. Some patients may not want to make decisions themselves, they may say, &quotDo whatever you think best, doctor." But patients who wish to assert their right to autonomy, recognized in common law, should not have this right subverted by the lack of legislation to ensure that the common law is implemented when the patient cannot vigourously protect his or her rights (by virtue of being incapacitated). 10b. Neither should a doctor lessen his efforts to reduce pain, discomfort or indignity simply because a patient has indicated that further life-prolonging treatment is not wanted. (This point is not particularly controversial, though inadequate pain care is all too common). 10c. The real controversy over the doctor as care giver arises over the question whether the doctor is the medical expert that a patient may consult and have the professional recommendations of the doctor implemented or not as the patient may choose (The patient is also free to get a second opinion or a different doctor). This open-market relationship is more common in America and leads to much greater openness in information disclosure between doctor and patient (if the incentive is financial, this should not detract from the nevertheless admirable result). It also engages the patient in the decision-making process on an equal, rather than prejudicial, footing, 10d. Similarly, just as if my doctor doesn't care to specialise in plastic surgery because he considers it unethical, I can go to another doctor if i feel I am going to nevertheless benefit from having a facial disfigurement corrected. I can even pay for the treatment if the NHS does not agree that it is necessary to my psychological well-being. A survey in the 1980's showed that 45% of doctors would at least seriously consider giving a fatal injection to one of their patients with an incurable illness that was intolerable to them.[45] A small study recently performed by the Oxford branch of the BMA found 3 out of 10 doctors would definitely be willing to do so. Both of these studies assumed immunity from prosecution. They show that a large number of doctors recognize that situations can arise that ethically demand such options be available to the patient who persistently requests them. Three out of ten doctors is more than enough for the relatively small number of cases that will arise, but they would mean the difference between a good and peaceful death and a long-drawn out period of degradation and suffering. 10e. A member of VESS did a small and unofficial survey of elderly people who had known persons close to them in the period before those people died.[46] She found that in nearly 70% of cases death was preceded by a period of painful illness. Only in 16% of cases had the patient died &quotquickly and peacefully". This contrasts sharply with the image we all like to believe when we announce in the paper that our loved one died quietly - probably the newspaper would be loathe to print an addition that said &quotafter a prolonged period of the most agonizing torment and degradation". The gap between the ideal, whether the pain control that might be available or the images we find comforting to believe, and the reality, is sometimes frightening, and a disturbing reflection on our claims to be a humane and caring society. 11. Withholding Treatment vs Deliberate Intervention The need for legislation to address this question so that an unbiassed doctor can be free to make a truly impartial and caring decision was highlighted by the remark of Lord Browne-Wilkinson when he asked,[47] How can it be lawful to allow a patient to die slowly, though painlessly, over a period of weeks from lack of food but unlawful to produce his immediate death by a lethal injection, thereby saving his family from yet another ordeal at add to the tragedy that has already struck them?" The same question could equally be asked in the case of a patient who was still conscious and having to bear the pain of lack of treatment as that was the only legal option to hasten an existence that had become intolerable to that patient. 12. Competent vs Incompetent Patients Respect for a patient's wishes, made after informed consultation, whether by the competent patient or by means of an advance directive from a patient who has subsequently become incompetent, solves most of the ethical difficulties on this question. The practical difficulty then becomes how to ensure sufficient numbers of people make advance directives - the most successful answer to date has been the example of Denmark (see 3.3 and 14.5). 13. The Courts and Changing Technology & Practice The attention of the Courts in the recent case of the Hillsborough disaster victim Tony Bland[48] have finally brought to bear the necessary acuity to bear on questions where the professional conclusions of bioethicists have all too readily been swept aside by false tabloid-like arguments. In that appeal, Lord Justice Butler-Sloss said, &quotdispassionate consideration of all the necessary components of the issues before us should not blind us to the anguish of the family for whom everyone feels the greatest sympathy. each court seized of these issues has an awesome task to face." Then, most importantly, he said, &quotIn doing so we have to rid ourselves of emotional overtones and emotive language which do not assist in elucidating the profound questions which require to be answered." 14. The Experience of Other Countries A summary of some of the more useful, and currently relevant, information on other countries follows. (See also 3.1c). 14.1 The American Experience General legislation on living wills was passed in 1991[49] and state-by-state legislation has been evolving since. Many proxy empowerment laws[50] were already in place, but their scope and refinement has been greatly improved by the incentive of living wills. The current trend is towards Proxy Empowerment with the living will as advisory, though in some states, or where the patient has so specified, the written living will takes precedence over proxy interpretation or decisions. Proxy decisions, as they can be taken within a relatively short time span, are in many ways more amenable to medical situations (which often require a rapid decision) than written documents that might need special study or even judicial enquiry to ascertain their applicability to a given situation. The U.K. lags behind many countries in that it has no Enduring Power of Attorney law that can be applied in such circumstances. As still not enough people sign advance directives, another growing trend is towards Substituted Judgement Statutes. In the case of an incompetent patient who has not made an advance directive, consultation is made to either a judicial or a clinical forum, which may in turn make medical decisions on behalf of the incapacitated patient or appoint a surrogate to do so. Current legislative focus in America is aimed largely at developing laws on physician-assisted suicide (the more radical referendums on physician aid-in-dying having been narrowly overturned by heavily funded pro-life disinformation campaigns).[51] The logical finesse, sharpened in America in the fire of practical experience, could usefully be imported.[52] 14.2 The Australian Experience There are five Australian States (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia) and two Territories (Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory) and there is no uniform law from State to State with regards to advance directives. However, if a doctor discontinues life-sustaining treatment, anywhere in Australia, at the patient's request, this does not constitute assisted suicide (for the purposes of law). Two States (Victoria and South Australia) and one Territory (the Northern Territory) have, in effect, legally recognized living wills. In Victoria, the relevant legal instrument is called an &quotEnduring Power of Attorney (Medical Treatment)", as set out in the Medical Treatment (Enduring Power of Attorney) Act 1988. It allows a competent person to appoint an &quotagent" who will be able to make treatment decisions for him/her when he/she is no longer able to do so. In South Australia, patients can sign an advance declaration as set out in the &quotNatural Death Act 1983" thereby refusing so-called &quotextraordinary treatments". Alternative legislation is being considered. in the Northern Territory, patients can sign an advance declaration as set out in the &quotNatural Death Act 1988" which will, like the South Australian instrument, allow the patient to refuse extraordinary treatment.[53] The Australian legislation bypasses the controversy over living wills as such - it simply extends the patient's right to refuse treatment when he or she is physically unable to sign the refusal of treatment form (and it does so by empowering the proxy to do so, within certain safeguards). 14.3 The Belgian Experience The Belgian living will,[54] whilst not legally binding, has developed with useful practical design features. Printed on durable yellow or green A4 card, it is sectioned to fold into 4, and with options to allow one of the five European languages in which it is printed to be the one which faces outwards (it then has the size that might fit into a bus pass or driving license wallet). At a time of increased mobility and trade between European countries, this has the advantage that it could be readily understood no matter what country the patient was taken ill in. In designing a &quotmodel" living will (3.1) international cooperation could also simplify inevitable legislation in respective countries. The Belgian document, in spite of its compact format, includes options to add extra directions or score out ones in the pre-printed form. It includes an identification section with spaces for the patient's photo and personal details as well as boxes for annual updating or re-affirmation of the living will. In Britain, official documents too often only receive the attention of design and marketing consultants when they have become unintelligible to everyone except the authors.[55] A lesson in humility from our European friends could introduce reasonable visual and design features from the start. 14.4 The Canadian Experience A small number of Canadian provinces have either succeeded in passing legislation or have proposed it. Legislation on living wills is still in its infancy. Canadian attention is currently focussed on the case of Sue Rodriguez (see Para 7c, supra). The Appeal Courts have so far dismissed her case and it is being taken to the Supreme Court of Canada. Opinions of judges deciding her case so far has not been unanimous - interestingly one of those opposed to her plea cited the (outdated, by the BMA's own admission) British Medical Association Ethics Handbook as current British Medical opinion - a very tangible reminder that situations and statements made at home or abroad need to be examined on their merits, not on the &quotauthority" of a particular organisation. 14.5 The Danish Experience In Denmark, living wills have been legally recognized since 1st October 1992. A brochure is available in libraries, chemists and doctors' surgeries. The brochure folds down neatly into a one-third-A4 size. It is visually appealing using colour and half tone and simple to understand. A tear off section can be filled in and mailed to Copenhagen University Hospital with an administration fee for registration. Various options on the living will allow for a degree of customisation. A doctor presented with a patient in a serious condition must telephone the directory to see if the patient has completed a living will. The Danish legislation has been considered very successful and a possible model for other countries. 14.6 The Dutch Experience The Dutch living will comes with an explanatory leaflet that includes sample paragraphs suggested for inclusion in the document if appropriate. A &quotrisk acceptance" clause acknowledges that no revocation could be made if the patient became incompetent and that this risk is outweighed by the risk of continued living in circumstances which the patient would find unnacceptable. In place of the American bracelets for DNR (see Para 8) a &quotnon-reanimation" medallion is available. Physician aid-in-dying is not subject to the abuses claimed by critics. The latest official publication in English[56] show that cases where death is induced by the physician relate almost entirely to cases where the patient had a few days or less to live, a practice commonplace in most advanced countries including Britain. The most severe criticism of the Dutch decriminalisation of physician aid-in-dying is that the system still leaves the threat of prosecution hanging over the head of doctors for unbearably long time; whilst this leads to abuse in not accurately reporting the action, no ethical abuse in the physician aid in dying practice itself can be deduced.[57] 14.7 The German Experience Physician-assisted suicide is legal but generally not practiced due to prejudice and fear of comparisons with Nazi practices. The German advance directive authorises the German Society for Humane Dying to take legal action if necessary to ensure that the Directive is honoured. [Note, 16 Jan '96: This is probably oversimplifying. In practice, if there were a case of asisting directly in a suicide, charges would probably be made. Physician assisted suicide is not specifically allowed or disallowed by statute but case law dissuades the practice.] 14.8 The Japanese Experience A tactfully worded living will, whilst not legally binding, is respected by doctors in almost all cases. 14.9 The Swiss Experience Physician-assisted suicide is legal and practiced by a few doctors.[58] 15. The UK Experience in Perspective Several attempts have been made so far in the U.K. to further the use of advance directives, and various lessons can be learnt from each. 15.1 The Kings College/THT Living Will A visually attractive and very user-friendly document with certain innovative features, yet also exceedingly long and rather bulky. 15.2 The Robertson Living Will Designed by Dr George Robertson of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and giving specific and easy-to-follow instructions to follow in the event of cerebral deterioration. About 3000 have been distributed. Dr Robertson has drawn on clinical experience for his international work in medical ethics. 15.3 The Goodheir Living Will Inspired by the Robertson model, Phyllis Goodheir hascampaigned vigourously and distributed over 8000 of this attractive, simple, and user-friendly document. 15.4 VES & VESS Living Wills The VES living will was designed on the basis of extensive expert legal counsel and covers a range of situations that would trigger the instructions. Over 15,000 distributed and used as a model in several other countries that are still seeking legislation. The VESS version attempts to incorporate a proxy by using a form of Tutor Dative applicable under Scots Law (although the proxy, once approved by the Court of Session, could theoretically enforce the living will, the cost of getting it to the Court could be prohibitive to a few patients). [Note, 16 Jan 1996: VESS no longer distributes this form, but uses the form produced by the Living WIll and Values History Project, which employed later and more advanced research than the one mentioned.] 15.5 The Natural Death Centre Living Will A simple version of the VES form, produced in response to demand. 16. Other U.K. Organisational Responses in Perspective 16.1 The British Medical Association The British Medical Association does not have an enduring policy on living wills, but has indicated it will not oppose legislation if its concerns are adequately covered (as the Law Commission is now doing). Whilst acting as something of a trade-union for doctors, the BMA is seen by laymen as much more than that, and every effort should be made to satisfy their concerns when enacting legislation. 16.2 The Law Commission The Law Commission is favouring legislation on living wills and proxy empowerment and is testing the completeness of its proposals by in-depth consultation. 16.3 The Royal College of NursingThe Royal College of Nursing has issued a Guidance for Nurses sheet on Living Wills. It has been widely criticised as inaccurate and insubstantial. This is not surprising however as nurses often bear the brunt of inadequate legislation. 16.4 The Institute of Medical Ethics The Institute of Medical Ethics Director of Research, Dr Kenneth Boyd, has said that it is difficult to see how a justifiable demand on many people's part can be met without some legal change. &quotSome immediate reform is needed to satisfy the legitimate demand of people in exceptional circumstances."[59] 16.5 Kings College & the Terrence Higgins Trust Kings College have worked on a number of occasions on living wills research and usually with people opposed to legislation. Their own recent research report however[60] indicated that patients, as opposed to doctors, wanted living wills to be legally binding. 16.6 The Institute of Law & Ethics in Medicine Professor Sheila McLean, Director of the Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine (Glasgow) has presented cogent and multi-disciplinary arguments in favour of legislation.[61] 16.7 The Hospices (General) The valuable work in pain control research done by the hospices is often overlooked. Their opposition to legislation stems from a religious inception of the movement. Their frequent claim that all pain is controllable is patently untrue, even with the advances that they themselves have made, and has forced them on at least one occasion to withdraw such disinformational advertising (following an appeal to the Advertising Standards). 16.8 Milestone House Hospice (AIDS Patients) A hospice in Edinburgh for AIDS patients that is not subject to the religious factors affecting official policy of other hospices uses detailed and personalised continual updating of patients' notes to indicate a patient's wishes. 16.9 The &quotPro-Life" Movement The vociferous minorities that are broadly called the &quotpro-life" lobby are supported, to the large extent, by the Roman Catholic Church and a few of its more extreme supporters. This is often disguised[62] as if it were &quotconcerned doctors" or &quotconcerned lawyers", not religious extremists. The misuse of professional garb by certain lawyers, doctors and parliamentarians to espouse extremist religious views is seen by many as highly unethical, especially when it involves conscious disinformation. Opinion polls show that the no religion espousing the &quotpro-life" policy has the support of its congregation as a whole on such issues. 16.10 The Opinion Polls All opinion polls have indicated broad support for legal reform. What excuse can there be for ignoring the persistent wishes of the large proportion of the population? 16.11 The Courts The courts, especially in the recent cases of Tony Bland and, last year, Dr Cox, have focussed public and professional opinion, and the Courts themselves have called for legislative reform. Deciding law by means of expensive test cases does not make sound policy. Legislation is necessary so that everybody knows where they stand. 17. Glossary/Discussion of Terms not Defined in the Main Text 17.1 MDELs Medical Decisions at the End of Life - usually means decisions taken by physicians concerning actions performed with the purpose of hastening the end of the life of the patient or decisions for which the physician has taken into account the probability that the end of life of the patient will be hastened. It covers withdrawing or withholding a treatment (including tube-feeding) and the administering, supplying or prescribing of drugs. Refusal of a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide and the decision not to resuscitate may also be considered MDELs. 17.2 QALYs Factors used in attempt to determine a patient'squality of life. 17.3 NTDs/DLTs Non-Treatment Decisions, that is, decisions to refrain from treatment that would have prolonged a patient's life. Some hospitals have developed specific policies with regards non-treatment in certain circumstances, based on severity of illness, prognosis, patient's wishes, wishes or opinions of relatives, and the attitude of the medical staff. Many hospitals, especially in the U.K., lag behind on the development of such guidelines. Dr George Robertson of Aberdeen has suggested &quotDLTs" - Decisions to Limit Treatment - as a more appropriate classification, since there is no suggestion that the patient is abandoned without adequate pain relief. 17.4 Euthanasia Dying well - a good and easy death. Death by an intentional act or omission in order that all suffering may be eliminated. Does not include irrational or emotional suicides or the forced killing of another person. 17.5 Voluntary Euthanasia Euthanasia; the word voluntary emphasizes the express intent of the person wanting to die, and distinguishes it from mercy killing or any other form of killing. Voluntary euthanasia is performed by, or at the autonomous request of, an informed and competent patient. In the Netherlands this phrase is not used - the word&quoteuthanasia" simply implying voluntary euthanasia, since if it is not voluntary it is not regarded in the Netherlands as euthanasia. 17.6 Non-Voluntary Euthanasia Similar to Mercy Killing inasmuch it is performed on someone who is, at the time of its performance, incompetent and therefore incapable of assenting to it. 17.7 Involuntary Euthanasia Generally indicates that the act is performed against their will on a competent patient who possesses the capacity to make a meaningful decision on the subject; in other words, where the patient is not consulted or where the patient's wish not to have euthanasia is ignored, whether or not it is on the assumption that it is in the person's best interests. 17.8 Active Euthanasia Actively accelerating a good death, by use of drugs or other methods, whether by oneself, or with the aid of a another. 17.9 Direct Euthanasia Actively accelerating a good death, by use of drugs or other methods, whether by oneself, or with the aid of a another. 17.10 Indirect Euthanasia/Passive Euthanasia Euthanasia without active intervention, relying onnon-treatment. Omission of life-sustaining treatment,whereby medications or procedures are withheld or withdrawn from a patient with the aim of hastening a patient's death. Note: this definition is not universal; persons opposed to the concept of euthanasia, but who endorse the withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment from a patient in some circumstances, vigourously oppose the use of the term passive euthanasia to describe the omission of life-sustaining treatment, contending that it is not euthanasia at all. The phrase passive euthanasia in Netherlands tends to imply involuntary euthanasia, which is a totally different concept. Indirect euthanasia may also be used to include the Principle of Double Effect. 17.11 Auto-Euthanasia (Self-Deliverance) Ending one's life without any direct assistance; rational suicide. 17.12 Euthanatic A drug suitable for inducing euthanasia. 17.13 Double Effect When drugs are administered to relieve pain but have the secondary effect of shortening life. Formalised as the Principle of Double Effect (See also Kuhse, Euthanasia, Supplement Appended.) 17.14 Mercy Killing Ending another person's suffering by ending his or her life. Different from voluntary euthanasia (where the dying person has been able to clearly state his or herwishes). 17.15 Suicide Ending one's own life. Rational suicide may be justifiably chosen in cases where there is no reasonableprospect of any quality of life left by the patient's standards. Irrational suicide includes cases of emotional trauma and incomplete diagnosis/prognosis. 17.16 World Federation of Right-to-Die Societies Formed in 1980. Member societies advocate passive euthanasia or active euthanasia or both.

The potentially very valuable scheme fell into disuse since not enough people registered on the computer their willingness to donate organs. 24.In BMA (1992) ibid. 25.Such as that issued by the South Africa voluntary Euthanasia Society. 26.E.g.

Consider also the fact that many hospital patients do not even know the name of their consultant, much less have a &quotdoctor-patient relationship". 33.Most bioethicists agree on this. See, for instance, Euthanasia, Helga Kuhse, appended as a Supplement, infra, which also examines the formal attempts to draw differences. 34.The &quotmeans" usually implies lethal drugs that can cause death painlessly, such as a large quantity of barbiturates, or else apparatus comprising carbon monoxide and inhaling mask, as provided by Dr Kevorkian of Michegan, U.S.A. 35.The phrase &quotPhysician-Assisted" rather than &quotDoctor-Assisted" is used, as the former is already in widely accepted parlance in the U.S.A. Etymologists will note, in passing, that the word &quotphysician" does not semantically imply the paternalism inherent in the word &quotdoctor" - which combines the superiority of the &quotteacher" with the &quotdocility" of the disciple... 36.Cf.

The Report covers more than just living wills - it looks, for instance, at protecting vulnerable people from harm. But the analysis of the situation regarding advance directives and the principles behind them is transforming and original; yet it is developed from a broad base and so offers little that will seem controversial. The remit of the Law Commission was set up in 1965 by Act of Parliament for the specific purpose of promoting the reform of the law. This current volume is an elegant example of the least amount of legislation to get the job done. Many bills have been put before parliament and rejected because they lacked foundation. The weight of these new statutory proposals derives largely from the excellent foundation, from which they proceed with a logic more like the force of gravity. Secondly they are minimalist: they do not so much suggest major revision of the law as overhaul and clarify existing law by way of statute. In a substantial chapter entitled Advance Statements about Health Care the report at a stroke cuts through and highlights the inadequacy of the long-standing debate over whether to use the term advance directive or living will. A disadvantage of both these phrases, says the Law Commission, is that they concentrate attention on the existence of a piece of paper. The fundamental question is not the piece of paper but the nature and legal effect of the views which have been expressed by the person concerned. There is a strong distinction (echoed by the BMA Code, see this issue) made between advance decisions and advance expressions of views and preferences. These differences are more important than whether they are enshrined in a written document, although a document will undoubtedly be an important piece of the picture.The Commission recommend that an advance refusal of treatment is defined as ...a refusal made by a person aged eighteen or over with the necessary capacity of any medical, surgical or dental treatment or other procedure and intended to have effect at any subsequent time when he or she may be without capacity to refuse consent. The authority to treat is then invalidated if ...an advance refusal of treatment by the person concerned applies to that treatment or procedure in the circumstances of the case. This approach is put forward as a way of superseding the tests for validity and applicability proposed in the case known as Re T (see Living Wills and the Law, DIDMSNJ Vol.1 No.1). An advance decision must be very specific and apply exactly to the situation that has arisen in order to be binding. The Commission recognise that many of the difficulties associated with this do not, fortunately, apply to statements of wishes; but, if the statement of wishes is a such favourable default mechanism, how is it possible to give it legal weight so that a doctor will not ignore it? The Commission's solution is an ingenious and lucid interpretation of the law as it now stands, developed into a recommendation that such rules be enshrined in a new law. If there is no valid refusal of treatment then anything done in relation to the health care of a person who lacks capacity to make his or her own decision about that matter must be (1) reasonable and (2) in the best interests of that person. But, you will object, many doctors feel that it is in the best interests of the patient to treat them irrespective of any living will, especially one that can be challenged as perhaps inapplicable to the exact circumstances that have arisen. So here we have some new rules on best interests. The report proposes that, in deciding what is in a person's best interests, regard must be had to four listed matters, namely: (1) the ascertainable past and present wishes and feelings of the person, and the factors he or she would consider, (2) the need to permit and encourage the person to participate, (3) the views of other appropriate people, and (4) the availability of an effective less restrictive option. What happens if these criteria are ignored? The conclusions drawn are powerful: As far as health care is concerned, these new rules mean that treatment will not be lawful unless it is both reasonable and in the best interests of the particular patient. It will not be in the best interests of the patient unless the doctor has taken into account the ascertainable past and present wishes and feelings of the patient and the factors he or she would have considered. If the treatment given is not lawful then the doctor is liable to an action in damages for battery if, as is likely, he or she has touched the patient. The new rules are a sensible legal framework from which the whole subject of living wills can be approached. It approaches an ethical structure upon which decisions can be made - this is something in which the legislation of America, Denmark and Australia has been singularly remiss. On the question of appointing proxies, or continuing powers of attorney (CPA) as the Law Commission would call them, the underpinning is far less rigorous. A loophole in the law, yes; most countries already have some way of allowing individuals to appoint a third party to make decisions of this nature for them, and many have enacted new laws specifically to look at health care decisions. Does the fact that most jurisdictions allow it mean it is right? Does it achieve the result that people assume it does? A great number of studies, several of them approaching statistical significance that cannot be ignored, suggest that the answer is no. When you appoint someone to make decisions for you, as you would have made them, are you simply abrogating your autonomy in favour of any decision that person would find acceptable, or do you have some sort of confidence that they would make the decision you would have made? Again, studies show that most people have confidence in their proxies to make a sort of substituted judgement decision - to put themselves in the patient's shoes - yet when presented with hypothetical scenarios proxies are able to score little better than chance. The disparity seems to arise because patients have discussed broad preferences with a proxy (I wouldn't want to be a vegetable) but have failed to throw light on the greyer, more difficult areas of, say, partial paralysis, bouts of dementia, or other variables that might be the possible outcomes of particular treatments. The popular misconception is perpetuated and remains popular not just with lawmakers but with patients who are inadequately informed about the extreme fallibility of such a decision making process. The House of Lords recognised the danger and did not favour the more widespread development of a system of proxy decision making, in spite of the strong current of supporting opinion. The Law Commission depart from this view and say that ...exactly the same arguments could be made against allowing people to delegate their financial powers. They draw up extensive safeguards and protections. They say that We recommend that, unless expressly authorised to do so, no attorney may consent to any treatment refused by the donor by an advance refusal of treatment. There is a presumption against allowing the CPA to make a refusal of life-sustaining treatment, but it can be specifically overridden by the authorisation of the declarant, so the Commission: ...recommend that, unless expressly authorised to do so, no attorney may refuse consent to any treatment necessary to sustain life. This still leaves the door open to allow patients to appoint and authorise proxies in the belief that the proxy will make the decisions about life-sustaining treatment as the patient would have done. A better safeguard would have called for communication of detailed values between patient and proxy as is done in the modern values history documents (living will type statements that concentrate on the specific, underlying values and life situations rather than medical treatments to be refused). If Parliament favours the Law Commission's recommendations on living wills a step forward will be made for patient autonomy; if it also accepts the recommendations on continuing powers of attorney, there is a risk that the good will be undone.

It seems to me that these could bedifficult to enforce even if fully supported by Act of Parliamentbecause in the event of an accident or sudden illness occurring awayfrom home or if unaccompanied by someone who knows your wishes,the last thing anyone arriving at the scene would think of is: doesthis person wish to be revived or not? I believe that the first thinganyone would do, instinctively, would be to to whatever they could topreserve life at all costs! - Jean Randall (The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society supplies its members with awallet to hold the living will and encourages them to carry it on their person,together with an "alert card" that fits in the wallet or purse. Decisions aboutwhether to continue, or instigate life-sustaining treatment are often madeonce a patient has been stabilised as far as possible, and by this time thebelongings may have been examined and the presence of a living willdiscovered, or so one hopes... - Ed.) I have worked as a Staff Nurse for many yearsand it never ceases to amaze me the pain and suffering people aremade to endure in the name of "humanity." I have seen people diein the most appalling circumstances, and would not like either myfamily or myself to suffer the same way. What particularly annoys me about this is, that to a certain extent,euthanasia exists in hospitals today. When people are dying (whetherfrom disease or accident) one of the first things the consultants do isto put them on a morphine pump. This is attached to the patient viaa needle in their abdomen and it gives a slow, continuous dose ofmorphine. Morphine is a respiratory depressant and causes the patientto die quicker than they normally would (with a few exceptions wherethey built up a resistance to the morphine). This is legal and basicallyamounts to a form of "helping people to die." However, if anyoneasks why the patient needs it, they are told it is because the patientis suffering from a great deal of pain and this relieves it. Now, ofcourse terminal patients have pain, but I have rarely seen a level ofpain that requires the dose and amount of morphine given. Themorphine dose is increased on a daily basis (again with a fewexceptions) whether the patient requires it or not. One surgeon Iworked with told me to increase the dose and "knock him over theedge... the quicker the better." The other way people are helped to die in hospitals is through thewithdrawal of all medical help. The patients are either N.F.R. (Not ForResuscitation) or N.C.O. (Nursing Care Only). It is the consultant thattakes this decision, and all forms of monitoring and medicalintervention are removed. This includes Total Parenteral Nutrition(T.P.N.) feeding. This is where somebody is fed through a catheterwhich goes straight into the bloodstream, usually via the sub-clavianroute. this happens often. So, what I would like to know is, why isall the fuss being made about removing naso-gastric feeding? Why isit all right to withdraw T.P.N. feeding but not N.G. feeding? Why is itacceptable to increase the dose of morphine someone is getting,when they have no more pain, but it is not acceptable to give thema lethal injection which would have the same effect, only quicker?I have seen too many people die in too many terrible ways. It wouldbe nice if the moralist do-gooders could see past their ownselfishness and allow people to die with dignity. it is the people whoare left that are hurt. When there is no hope the very least we cangive people is dignity. - Hazel Kerr Feedback from all readers is welcome. Submissions for the Journal (printed and electronic) will be accepted by email.

We think you will know that, during the few days prior to his death when he was in a high dependency ward, the consultant told my father-in-law that he would comply with his wishes as set out in the living will. The consultant commented that it was the best form of living will that he had seen. This assurance greatly eased my father-in-law's anxiety and enabled him and ourselves, his family, to be together honestly and peacefully. While clearing papers we found all your literature and information. We have destroyed it, as you would wish. Shiona Hall, Aboyne, Scotland I dread visiting Health Centres. I have a lifelong dislike of medical procedures of all types; and a long-standing opposition to surgical procedures and modern drugs; since the former owe much to vivisection experimentation, and the latter are invariably tested upon animals as a matter of course.Therefore, although a copy of my Living Will has been lodged in my Medical Records File for several years, that, and allied correspondence, was posted to my Health Centre, not personally delivered and discussed with the staff. Since the Health Centre personnel never acknowledged receipt of these documents, I have no idea of their views upon them, whether positive or negative. When the new format of Living Will came to hand, I decided that it would be lodged personally, and that I must eventually make an appointment to discuss it with one of the doctors in the relevant Practice. Because I am virtually never in a health Centre under normal circumstances, and my name was automatically transferred to the "list" of a doctor who "took over" when my choice of doctor retired several years ago, I really did not know any of the doctors in the Practice as it is now. I had to wait for the right time to translate my decision into action, and that time only arrived in August of '95. I put the documentation into order, delivered it to the health Centre so that the doctor whom I had elected to see could view it in advance, and made an appointment to discuss it with her. I am so glad I did this. The doctor could not have been more helpful and understanding, both of my own feelings and of the implications of the Living Will as it applies to me. The new format of Living Will is now lodged in my file and, for the first time, I know that its presence is approved by a doctor with whom I have discussed it; and to whose list, within the Practice, I have now been transferred. This is one more positive experience of the presentation of a Living Will to a modern medical practice, to add to the experiences of other VESS members, as recorded in recent Newsletters. It is good to know that such experiences are becoming more common. Surely, the more Living Wills are lodged in such positive circumstances, the stronger the case for granting them legal status will eventually become. Eve Macfarlane, St Andrews Enclosed please find my order for your booklet Supplement to How to Die With Dignity [Departing Drugs]. I congratulate you most warmly on the work you do. Knowing a society exists whose efforts are directed to providing peace of mind for people like me actually enhances one's enjoyment of living - it's such a strong feeling of independence and relief! Joan Jackson, New Zealand I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your work in the Right to Die movement, especially in the publication of Departing Drugs and Beyond Final Exit. The information contained in these books was most helpful in allowing a much-suffering stroke victim to achieve a peaceful self-deliverance. Here, with names changed, is a brief case history for your research. "Carol" suffered a severe stroke at the relatively young age of 51. The right side of her body was paralysed, and her speech and reading abilities were significantly impaired. Although initially depressed, she managed to make a partial recovery and was looking forward to returning to her home where she would be able to live with unskilled assistance. She then suffered a second stroke that destroyed much of the progress that she had made and left her incontinent. There was no option other than to place her in an assisted living home. Carol, always strong-willed and independent, soon realized that she was not making any progress in recovering, and that her future held nothing more than living as a virtual invalid in constant pain and discomfort. She made it known to me that she wanted to end her pain, and, as she put it, "go to heaven". My first reaction was to check with her physician to confirm that any further meaningful recovery was unlikely, and to make sure that she was on appropriate medication to reduce her pain and control her depression. Her physician did in fact confirm that her progress in recovering had levelled off, that she was on a number of medications for pain, and that several antidepressants had been tried to relieve her depression. I promised Carol that I would help her, but that it would take some time to research and implement a painless and effective way to die. I wanted to move slowly to give her every chance to reconsider her decision, and to give the various anti-depressant medications that she was taking a chance to take effect, but I did contact the Hemlock Society for information and eventually ended up with your two publications. The problem of how to best help Carol was compounded greatly by her residing in an assisted-living facility, which made it very difficult for me to be present to assist her without incurring legal risks, and the paralysis of her right side, which limited her ability to use a plastic bag. The only feasible method seemed to be an overdose of barbiturate/painkillers enhanced by alcohol. The next and probably the greatest problem was how to procure the necessary drugs. I sought the assistance of a physician/physiotherapist, Doctor X, that I had dealt with before. I wanted to allow this individual to help me with minimal personal risk, so I presented my problem as follows: I was distraught and frustrated over the condition of my loved one, Carol; she was suffering and wanted to end her misery. Legally, however, I could not help her, and I was therefore suffering severe headaches and sleepless nights. Would he please prescribe Darvon and Nembutal for my use? Fortunately, I struck gold. Dr X asked if I really wanted these drugs for myself, or to help Carol. When I told him the latter, we talked in detail about her condition, medications, and what had transpired so far. He was completely sympathetic, and agreed that my helping her would be an act of love. We had a frank discussion about the recommendations of your publication, and he prescribed for me Nembutal (100mg, 100 count) and Darvon (65mg, 50 count). He told me that he was willing to do this because he was sympathetic to Carol's plight, was convinced that I was acting responsibly, and was convinced that I would act discreetly and protect him. After telling Carol that I had managed to get the drugs that we needed, I insisted that she wait an additional two weeks to make sure that as we got closer to acting she did not have a change of heart. Shortly after I began investigating how to help Carol I began making a regular practice of bringing her a chilled cocktail when I saw her for our regular weekday visit. This practice turned out to be fortuitous when I found out that alcohol greatly enhances the potency of the drugs in question. The weekend before the day selected for her self-deliverance I took her out of her facility for a final visit to her home. This served several purposes: it gave her the opportunity to see what she was giving up and gave her another chance to change her mind; it gave me an opportunity to go over with her in detail the sequence of events needed for her deliverance; and finally, it provided a "cover" story to explain how she could have gotten (from her own home) the drugs used in her self-deliverance. The actual act was done in accordance with suggestions in your book. She ate a light meal several hours before I arrived for my visit. I gave her a Dramamine pill, which she took immediately, and a very weak martini to sip on while we visited. (I also had a cocktail, so we had a nice final visit/celebration.) I bought her some chilled, bottled water to make sure she had plenty of liquids to help her swallow the pills, and in an empty Evian bottle I left her about 3 ounces of a good stiff martini (extra dry, the way she liked it). I had previously counted out thirty Darvon and fifty Nembutal pills, and put them in old prescription containers found in my sister's home. After carefully wiping any fingerprints off these containers, I gave them to her with a reminder of how to take them: the Darvon first, followed by the Nembutal. Then, relax and celebrate with the martini. She hid the pills and martini in her nightstand, and I left. Her instructions were to shortly thereafter call the attendant and have them undress her and put her to bed. (After this, the door to her room was closed and she was generally left alone for the rest of the night.) After she was comfortable in her bed, she was to proceed as planned. She must have done this successfully, as I received a call from the facility the next morning advising me that she had passed away peacefully in her sleep. I hope that this account will be of some use to you in your work. Once again, I thank you sincerely. Nameless and Grateful in California.

The document of the Terrence Higgins Trust. Primarily designed for use by people with HIV or AIDS, adaptable for anyone else. Available from THT, 52-54 Gray's Inn Rd, London WC1X 8JU, United Kingdom. We also recommend a different type of document, known as a values history: This is suitable for use anywhere in the world. It is available as part of the Living Will Pack from VESS, or downloadable with instructions here. Is it binding? Requirements The living will can be written or oral. It must not have been made under pressure or coercion. The person must have been competent at that time to make the decisions involved (This is presumed unless there is evidence to the contrary). Note: a person may have a mental illness and still make a valid living will as long as they undertood the implications of what they were doing. Competency means competent to make the decision in question, not necessarily competent to make other decisions (eg, relating to financial affairs). If the living will applies exactly to the circumstances that subsequently arise, it must be followed by health care professionals. If it does not apply exactly, but describes a general wish, then the health care team should consider it among other evidence of what the patient would wish. Relatives may also be able to supply information on the patient's wishes. Having gathered all the information, a health care decision should be made on the basis of the patient's best interests with due regard to their wishes, as well as these can be ascertained. Notes: A living will can be revoked at any time. It is evidence of the patient's wish, and it is the patient's wish that has legal force, not the document. Living wills cannot request euthanasia or unreasonable treatment. Contrary to popular belief, relatives are not legally empowered to make treatment decisions on behalf of another adult. Responsibility rests with the health care team or the courts. Documents outside of the United Kingdom USA The status of living wills is governed by specific legislation in most states. Although generally you may use one of the above forms, state by state advice is strongly recommended. This can be obtained from Choice In Dying. The use of a values history is also strongly recommended. Documents enabling you to authorise someone else to make decisions for you (known often as Durable Powers of Attorney for Health Care) are common in America. There is often a prescribed form.

He continued, "In my view, the choice which the law makes must reassure people that the courts do have full respect for life, but that they do not pursue the principle to the point at which it has become almost empty of any real content and when it involves the sacrifice of other important values such as human dignity and freedom of choice." He concluded that English law, whilst paternalistic towards minors, respected the autonomy of adults, and quoted the decriminalization of suicide as a recognition that the principle of self-determination should in that case prevail over the sanctity of life. We should also remember that doctors generally are not trained as ethicists in any real sense of the word, even though many of them arrogate a high moral ground to their personal beliefs.Proposed legislation concerning advance directives in no way threatens the personal health care wishes of someone who believes in the sanctity of life over their own personal autonomy - they simply avoid making a living will or make an advance directive to indicate continued treatment in any circumstances (this need not place an unreasonable strain on health care resources, since an incapacitated patient has no authority to demand expensive or far-fetched treatments any more than a competent patient has; the advance directive may consent to treatment however.) In Japan, the moral dilemmas are similar, but for totally different reasons. The Japan Times noted, with that curious candour of an outside observer, that "The view that all lives must be prolonged regardless of quality stems from the Judaeo-Christian tradition," and "the notion of equality in Anglo-Australian law over-rides concerns with QOL (Quality of Life)".A recent paper on Bible suicides1 noted that the Bible treated suicide in a factual way and not as wrong or shameful. The word sanctity comes from the same root as the word saint - both sanctity and sainthood are determined by men and the priesthood by imposing the religious parameters of their particular faith on the object or person of their sanctification. This makes us all the willing or unwilling subjects of their deliberations if we're not careful. One recalls that a "saint" was once cynically defined as "a sinner revised and edited". The suggestion that the church cuts the trappings of sanctity according to the cloth is borne out by writers who affirm that suicide was not outlawed by the Church until the Council of Braga in AD 562 on account of the fact that Christians were martyring themselves in such large numbers, wiping out their sins and being glorified. Eusebius of Caesarea describes many of these in his Historia Ecclesiastica. With the suicide of St Pelagia, St John Chrysostom argued that it must have been carried out "nuto divino", that is, a result of supposed divine inspiration, to which the presumed martyr responded with an act of heroic obedience to the Absolute Will. This generous attitude was echoed by St Ambrose. (Only selfish suicide, as a consequence of some psychological condition, has always been frowned on). St Augustine, while admitting that the Church had honoured suicides in this way, promulgated a sceptical attitude towards such cases. The respectability of suicide was threatening to erode the power structure so carefully forged by the Roman-Alexandrine version of Christianity. The teachings of St Augustine were codified in the thirteenth century by St Thomas Aquinas. In St Thomas' day, suicidal martyrdom had again become common among the Albigensians or Cathars. He developed the idea that suicide was a sin. Unfortunately, all this is of little help to the modern day sincere Christian, especially Roman Catholic, who may have only the voices of conscience and reason as friends. One liberating school of Roman Catholic thought which is still considered acceptable is that of probabilism. This teaches that, on a debated issue, it is acceptable for the person concerned to act from a position that enjoyed solid probability of being correct even though he or she is aware that the more rigorous opinion was held to be more probable. This invokes common sense on such issues that do not have an irrefutable heritage. It might be of interest to note the finely balanced judgement of a modern day Roman Catholic professor of ethics, Dr Russell McIntyre, who came close to a personal confession of his understanding of the truth when he wrote, "My conservative nature requires that I cling fast to the sanctity of life principle, given to us in trust by a loving God. But I must also recognize that this gift, and the sacredness which accompanies it, also have limits; i.e, there comes a point in time when the gift is withdrawn and with that action the sacredness diminishes. For me, this Biblical distinction applies to life and death. The Spirit of God is given to create life; it is also withdrawn as life loses its vitality, its entelechy... My more moderate nature forces me to recognize that under the rubric of care excruciating and intractable pain is also destructive to the sanctity of life."

Newsletter Should we resuscitate? John Saunders Dr Saunders is a consultant physician at Nevill Hall Hospital inGwent, and is an Honorary Fellow at the Centre for Philosophy andHealth Care at University College, Swansea. This paper is a slightlyshortened version of his acclaimed seminar "Do not resuscitate orders- for whom?" at the 10th International Conference of Right to DieSocieties in Bath in 1994. [EXTRACT:]Techniques for reversing cardiac arrest (Cardio-PulmonaryResuscitation - CPR) developed 35 years ago to prevent suddenunexpected death. More widespread use led to lower success ratesand inappropriate use. The inappropriate "crash call" looms large inBritish hospital folklore. A junior nurse finds an apparently dead patientand puts out a call. The team rushes to the ward, scattering all intheir path. After prolonged efforts a pulse is reestablished only todiscover that the patient is demented with metastatic carcinoma. No-one's interests have been served. The patient's last hours are anundignified trauma; the relatives are distressed; the doctors irritatedand disillusioned and the junior nurses probably disciplined byunimaginative seniors for their actions. UK surveys suggest that about 25% of CPR attempts may be"inappropriate." British practice was formerly characterized by either anabsence of policies or unwritten, covert policies. Even so, there didseem to be a fear that too much CPR was occurring. A Lanceteditorial in 1982 was actually entitled "Cardiac resuscitation in hospital:more restraint needed?" A more recent editorial in the British MedicalJournal was frankly paternalistic: "In Britain, sound unhurried clinicaljudgement, sympathy, understanding and mutual trust, rather thanabstract principles and printed policy statements have in general stoodpatients in good stead.... Better than anyone else the consultant andhis team know the nature of the patient's disease or diseases andthe likelihood of responding to treatment. Quality of life is relative andshould be assessed in relation to the age, state of health andpersonal aptitudes and interests of each individual patient."In reality, judgements were often simply not made or were delegatedto junior staff. The decision was sometimes left to some unfortunatenurse to make on the spur of the moment. The British approach wascomplacent. This complacency was punctured by the report of theParliamentary Commissioner or Ombudsman in 1991. He drewattention to the case of a woman of 88 admitted to hospital withpneumonia. The patient was designated not for resuscitation. Thepatient's son discovered and complained. The Ombudsman commentedthat he "found surprising the novelty of establishing a writtenresuscitation policy." After discussion by a parliamentary committee, thegovernment's Chief Medical Officer wrote to all consultants pointing outtheir responsibilities. Official bodies responded with guidelines andpolicy recommendations. Since the alternative to CPR is death, it is easy to assume thatCPR can do no harm. The assumption is wrong. Harm may result tothe patient, to the family, to health carers and to society. Clearpolicies are therefore needed in institutions such as hospitals andnursing homes, to determine "do not resuscitate" (DNR) orders.Many have suggested that a value judgement can be avoided bywithholding CPR from those in whom it simply will not work - socalled physiological futility. I do not believe this is true. Even fiveminutes more life might be valued in some (perhaps rather fantastic)scenarios. Many will find it repugnant to give CPR to someone in thepersistent vegetative state. Yet the decision is not value free. It ispossible that such a life may be greatly valued, that such anindividual may still be the focus for someone's love and concern andthat an individual may have wanted continuing biological life as longas they could continue such a role. To decline CPR is to deny suchpossibilities. A few hours extra may enable affairs to be ordered,goodbyes to be made. The BMA/RCN guidelines state: "It is appropriate to consider aDNR decision... where the patient's condition indicates that effectiveCPR is unlikely to be successful.... When the basis for a DNR orderis the absence of any likely benefit, discussion with the patient, orothers close to the patients, should aim at securing an understandingand acceptance of the clinical decision that has been reached." Autonomy is not enhanced where one choice offers noreasonable prospect of a particular outcome. Doctors do need moreeducation in prognosis. It has been shown that cancer or AIDS areperceived to be terminal, while equally terminal conditions such ascirrhosis or cardiac failure are not. CPR is then inappropriately offeredto the latter and, quite correctly, not to the former. Both doctors andnurses in the UK and the US have an over-optimistic view of apatient's chances of surviving CPR. Resuscitation training programmesshould routinely include data on survival from CPR in differingcircumstances. Such data need to be distinguished from quality-of-lifeconsiderations. There is extreme variability in such estimates by healthcare professionals. The disabled value a quality of life that manyhealthy people might consider unacceptable: in a study of 21 patientswith spinal injuries requiring ventilation, for example, only one wishedto be allowed to die. © 1996 John Saunders You are the 156th person to browse through here since 6th Feb 1996 using the above URL WT02-B27-191IA007-000073-B040-51http://www.euthanasia.org:80/search.html 194.88.132.128 19970222054208 text/html 4771HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 05:50:15 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Are you an Web expert?

Why a Right-to-Die? Average life expectancy has risen greatly in prosperous countries. As long as we are healthy this is a wonderful blessing. But medical advances, which have helped to keep us healthy, can be used near the end of life to extend our dying. Our consent is needed before we are given medical treatment but most people automatically accept what the doctor offers. They may then spend months or even years with such poor quality of life that they long for death. What most people want Wherever surveys have been done the majority think that doctors should be allowed to help an incurably ill patient to die, at that patient's considered request. In nearly all countries a doctor who does so may be accused of murder. The right to choose Worldwide groups of people concerned about this state of affairs have formed Right-to-Die Societies. Many are called Voluntary Euthanasia Societies. Some prefer to think of the help to a good death that they aim for as a form of assisted suicide. What have Right-to-Die Societies achieved? Members of these societies receive a Living Will or Advance Directive which states how much treatment they want (and what life-prolonging procedures they forbid) towards the end of life. In the Netherlands cooperation between the medical profession and the courts has reached the stage where doctors are not prosecuted for administering the drugs (if necessary) provided they follow very strict Guidelines. Doctors in the Netherlands only treat their own patients. If you live elsewhere and would like such an option at the end of YOUR life the legal situation will have to be changed in your country. You may want to help this process. The first step is to contact your local Right-to-Die Society (see overleaf). If there isn't one, contact the one that seems to you to be nearest, geographically or by language. Or contact: The WFRDS Secretary: Mr Malcolm Hurwitt, 61 Minterne Avenue, Norwood Green, Southall, Middx UB2 4HP, United Kingdom.

Each package contains two sections that you can download separately: AN ADVANCED LIVING WILL DOCUMENT. This living will is the result of much research by the the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland and The Living Will & Values History Project, publishers of the first ever volume of Collected Living Wills from around the world. The document is the result of considerable research and wide consultation and avoids most of the pitfalls of many living wills, even those compiled by lawyers and legislators. It is suitable for use anywhere in the world, but if you live in the UNITED STATES we recommend that you also consider the state-specific legislation and documents which can be obtained directly from Choice In Dying. The use of a values history is also strongly recommended. Documents enabling you to authorise someone else to make decisions for you (known often as Durable Powers of Attorney for Health Care) are common in America. There is often a prescribed form. If you use one of these, we advise you to also employ a values history to help your proxy understand your wishes more fully. The values history section of the Project's document may also be useful to explain to your proxy how you would feel about specific medical scenarios. For DENMARK, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, NETHERLANDS we also recommend you to obtain local advice. A GUIDANCE SHEET to help you customize your living will.

If your doctor is any good though, he or she will probably allow you to have a second opinion if you're concerned about the diagnosis or treatment. Many doctors will even encourage it for your peace of mind. My GP refuses to see me Your GP can refuse to see you if you have not made an appointment or if he or she believes you don't need treatment. In an emergency you have a right to see a doctor - but not necessarily your own GP. I want to change doctors but the new doctor won't take me Tough. You have to do your best to find a doctor who will. If you really can't get any doctor to accept you, the Health Board is legally obliged to find you one and can force a doctor to accept you. You can write to the Health Board (in England: The Family Health Services Authority) and ask for a list of doctors in your area. The Health Board keeps a register with the doctors' gender, age, qualifications and the services offered at that practice. A GP can remove you from his/her list without giving a reason. Help your GP to help you With today's heavy work loads, he or she probably has between six and nine minutes to see you. Taking up more time may mean depriving someone else of the benefit of the doctor's time without improving the treatment you receive. If you are ill, then make a list of symptoms, the frequency, if they are getting worse or staying the same, and if other aspects of your life have changed and may be influencing your health. Use the list to explain yourself clearly and concisely, and be honest and open. If something's not clear If you don't understand the doctor's advice, ask questions, and then follow instructions carefully. If you want a general discussion - for instance, about filling in your living will, explain the need and make an appointment. Get your doctor to advise you on preventative measures and about smoking, exercise, diet and depression. Don't bother your doctor about colds and flu when the only advice is going to be rest, lots of liquid and an aspirin! Choosing a doctor Make a short list of surgeries and visit them to get a practice leaflet and see what the waiting rooms are like. What are the surgery hours? Are the staff courteous and helpful? Don't fill in a registration on the spot - consider arranging a pre-registration interview (you may have to pay a small fee for this) to see if you feel comfortable and confident about that doctor. Ask if the GP is a fund holder: it might make the difference between the doctor being able to buy the treatment required or waiting in line for the local health authority to make it available. I want to see my medical records You have a right to see them unless a) your doctor thinks it would he harmful to you or someone else; b) it would breach the confidentiality of a third party; c) the records were handwritten before November 1991. It may be very necessary' to see your records if you are thinking of taking legal action against your doctors. If you are refused the records then a court order will be needed to ensure their release. I have a complaint There are different ways to complain. Many problems arise from lack of communication Your GP may not even be aware that there is a problem. Make an appointment to discuss the matter, or write a letter. You can also address your letter to the Complaints Officer, c/o the GP's practice, NHS Trust or Local Health Board. You should make your complaint no later than six months after the event. If this fails you may want to submit your complaint for Independent Review to the Health Board (Scotland) or Family Health Services (England & Wales) - find the address in your local telephone directory. You must not leave it longer than four weeks from the letter from the Complaints Officer (see above). Further advice on complaints procedures can be found in the Department of Health's leaflet on Complaints (phone 0800-22-44-88 for a free copy). The Health Board may take action against the doctor if there has been a breach of the doctor's contract with the Board. They could, for example, limit the number of patients on a doctor's list. No compensation is available to you as the patient. If you are still dissatisfied, you can also ask the Health Service Commissioner (Ombudsman) to investigate. Complaints to the GMC A second course is to complain to the General Medical Council (not the British Medical Association!) if you believe a doctor is guilty of serious professional misconduct or has failed to meet the required professional standards. In serious cases, the GMC could reprimand or even suspend the doctor, but no direct compensation is available to the patient. Legal action If you believe the doctor has been negligent, legal action is a third route. You should consult a solicitor experienced in medical negligence and who practices under the Legal Aid Scheme. The time limit for raising a court action is three years from the alleged incident. It is very difficult to win such an action but you may receive financial compensation if you succeed. Finally, if you are a patient in hospital, you can also make a complaint to the designated officer for each hospital or group of hospitals within the Health Authority or Board. Admission to Hospital Admission to hospital is on the recommendation of a GP, your family doctor, who should already know about your wishes and, if you have completed such documents, have a copy of your Living Will and/or Values History in the medical records. In unforseen circumstances - if, for example, you are in a traffic accident - you would of course be given emergency treatment on admission to hospital. The doctors will generally act under the assumption that you would opt for life. Some people carry their living will on their person, as this could assist decisionmaking, especially after initial emergency treatment. Emergency treatment should be given when a)the patient is incapable of consenting, b) immediately necessary, c)it cannot reasonably be postponed to seek the patient's consent, and d)there is no indication that the patient would have refused consent. Providing you are able to communicate, doctors must seek your informed consent before commencing further treatment. They have to give you enough information so that your consent can really be "informed". They should tell you about possible treatment alternatives and the likelihood of any side effects. They should also be willing to discuss the probable outcome(s) of treatment with you. They should explain the nature, likely outcome, and any possible outcomes of any operation they propose. This information must be given in lay person's language. If you do not understand any aspect of the doctor's explanation, ask him or her to put it in lay person's language. You have the right to withhold consent for treatment, or for an operation, even if by doing so you are likely to shorten your life. You also have the right to discharge yourself unless you have been detained under the compulsory powers of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 (or England: Mental Health Act 1983) or have a notifiable infectious disease. If you are admitted to a teaching hospital, you have the right to refuse permission to have students examine you. Your own wishes are paramount. The doctors must listen to you, no matter what the rest of your family says. Family members may play a significant role in drawing attention to the wishes in a your living will and insisting that those wishes are respected. Above all, you have the right to have your personal dignity and self esteem respected at all times. Useful names and addresses Health Boards - see the phone book.

Religious questions involving euthanasia and suicide mustbe individually resolved, with or without one's spiritual adviser, andaccording to one's belief. Opinion polls consistentlyshow a majority of people professing all variety of faiths support a changein the law for voluntary euthanasia. Even amongst Roman Catholics, morepeople support euthanasia than oppose it (a poll in Scotland showed over50% support, in spite of the church's opposition). Official church policiesusually oppose euthanasia. The Roman Catholic Church is thelargest single funder opposed to euthanasia. It invests more money in itsfight against euthanasia than all the combined resources of right to diesocieties around the world many times over. Tactics insupport of the Roman Catholic Church's position apparently include disinformation(usually claiming no safeguards) and threats of excommunication - thiswas well documented in the heated campaigns of the USA and elsewhere. Of the other churches,the Episcopalian (Anglican) Unitarian, Methodist, Presbyterian and Quakermovements are amongst the most liberal, allowing at least individual decisionmaking in cases of active euthanasia. Hindu and Sikh Dharma may also leaveit to individual conscience. Nowadays, fewfaiths prohibit passive euthanasia, or refusal of treatment decisions.Those that do tend to oppose it include conservative Evangelicals, Islam,and the Mormon Church. Suicide (self-deliverance)is accepted by a number of faiths. There is a Jaina ethic of voluntarydeath through fasting, for instance. It is often thought that the RomanCatholic Church absolutely prohibits suicide, but Catholic theologianshave confirmed that the prohibition, whilst being the Vatican's currentposition, is not an inviolable one. Church hierarchies aregenerally not amenable to reasoning and arguments, however well they areconstructed, from the laity. Cultural forces and public opinion appearto have an effect over time. Although accepted bythe very early church, mainstream Christian beliefs concerning suicidewere well documented by Thomas Aquinas (circa 1225-1274) who condemnedsuicide because: "it violates one's natural desire to live" "it harms other people" "life is the gift of God and is thus only to be taken by God" Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592)was the first major dissenter among European writers. He wrote 5 essayswhich touched on the subject of suicide, arguing that suicide should beconsidered a matter of personal choice, and that it is a rational optionunder some circumstances. In the U.S.,TheUnitarian-Universalist Association, a liberal group, issued a statementin 1988 in support of euthanasia and assisted suicide choice, if thereare proper precautions in place to avoid abuse. Similar statements weremade by the United Church of Christ, and the Methodist Church on the USWest coast. In Netherlands 1972the Dutch Reformed Church published a paper in which euthanasia was conditionallyaccepted as a humane way of dying. In the Netherlands, Catholic or DutchReformed clergymen may be present at VE deaths. Many religious ordersin the United States invite (in some cases require) their membersto consider a living will of some kind. Many prominent clericssupport euthanasia - the Bishop of Durham (Dr David Jenkins),Bishop Alastair Haggart (VESS Convener), Bishop Hare Duke (VESS member),the Reverend Andrew Hill (VESS Committee Member), Lord Soper (MethodistLife Peer), Canon William Purcell (ex-president of VES), Canon Dick Shepherdand Dean Ing (founding fathers of the voluntary euthanasia movement in1935), Revd John Brooke (United Church of Christ Minister and Directorof Americans for Dying With Dignity). "A common objection in religious quarters is that sufferingis part of the divine plan for the good of man's soul, and must thereforebe accepted. Does this mean that the physician's Hippocratic Oath is opposedto Christian virtue and doctrine? If this simple and naive idea of sufferingwere a valid one, then one would not be able to give our moral approvalto anaesthetics, or to provide any medical relief for human suffering.Such has been the objection of many religionists at every stage of medicalconquest, for example the use of anaesthetics at childbirth." -the ethicist, Joseph Fletcher "Abortion and euthanasia are thus crimes which no humanlaw can claim to legitimize. There is no obligation in conscience to obeysuch laws; instead there is a grave and clear obligation to oppose themby conscientious objection. ... In the case of an intrinsically unjustlaw, such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia, it is therefore neverlicit to obey it, or to "take part in a propaganda campaign in favourof such a law, or vote for it". - John Paul II, On the Value andInviolability of Human Life, Evangelium Vitae, 73.

Although winning prizes in music and literature, he decidedto study law and, repelled by the sterility of practices he experiencedfirst hand in a law firm, even when involved in defending a local murdercase, he soon specialised in medical law and ethics as an area more ripefor original thought. Currently studying for a Doctorate, he now has two part-time jobs -one involves tutoring in law and ethics, whilst the other is as ResearchAssistant for VESS. "It's a refreshing challenge, dealing with thepublic and putting the dilemmas into accessible language." His dutiesinvolve not only answering queries and attending the membership database,but preparing material for the Newsletter deadlines in a variety of formats."It's also enjoyable working part of a small team in the Office -a Ph.D can be a very solitary experience." Colin is no stranger to controversy. He was a founder member of a Glasgowphilosophy group which explored current issues on television such as theprevalence of political bias in the media. His other interests includegenetics (several of his articles are in press) Humanism, the anti-censorshipcampaign and the development of reproductive technologies. "I'm pro-choicein the widest sense: technologies should expand choice. Humanism attractsme not because of religious or anti-religious feelings, but because thelaw doesn't always allow the freedom of choice that should be available;Humanism should be about accepting a plurality of views." Since joining the VESS team he has proved himself invaluable, not onlyin his methodical approach to the work, but in his energy and enthusiasmto take up v.e. issues in his spare time. Debating was always his forteat University - now he is using his skills to debate v.e. publicly againstsuch anti-choice luminaries as Father Morrow. Gavaghan is optimistic about the work from Glasgow University on PhysicianAssisted Suicide. "Should we work on many fronts or focus on thisnew bill? It's difficult to say, but this is probably the best researchin the UK so far. The bill could well become law in a few years." Colin Gavaghan - writings on v.e. can be found in thisand earlier editions of VESS Newsletter.

Yes, it's true. "My congregationwould expect me to take a fairly liberal view on moral issues," saysReverend Andrew Hill. In his 22 years as minister at St Marks UnitarianChurch in Edinburgh, he can't recall strong opposition to his views oneuthanasia, many of which were shared by his early role models while studyingfor the ministry. Andrew is a 5th generation Unitarian minister - followingin the footsteps of his family to his great grandfather. He is no born-againv.e. supporter - rather his views have become pragmatic over the yearsas he looks for ways to further the responsible moral environment thatmade such an impression on him in his formative years. "I've not somuch changed my position as changed the way it's expressed." Graduating with a Degree in Theology at Manchester, he recently spentsix years compiling the Unitarian manual on births, deaths and unions.Not missing out on the latest technology, he is has been using the Internetto begin looking at the possibility of an inter-faith group for assistedsuicide. He describes the religious right as "possibly the most intolerantorganised body of opinion that exists." In America, church attendanceis very high, but does it build a better nation? Andrew thinks not. Heis put off by the refusal of the anti-euthanasia groups to consider opposingarguments. When the founder of VESS, Sheila Little, died, he conductedher (Humanist) funeral. "For the Christian, people come before principlesany day," he wrote in VESS Newsletter back in 1982. Later, as a VESSmember, he says that later years on the Executive Committee gave him agreater knowledge of the problems. Just three years after his latest sermonon euthanasia, he is planning another - this time on assisted suicide andin the light of the new research from Glasgow University. How does he feel about the current campaign? "I prefer the Dutchmodel to the one recently tried in Australia. We constantly talk of 'autonomy',but no-one lives in isolation in this world. In the Netherlands, everyoneis involved - the family are consulted and the doctor must know the patientwell; in Northern Territory, an unknown foreigner can apply for euthanasia." Andrew Hill - writings on euthanasia can be found in VESSNewsletter Spring 1982 Half a Case Against, and Sep 1993 Living Good Deaths.

For Andrew McLeman, it wasthe interest of his father, now 87 and virtually housebound, that awakenedhis own feelings on the matter. "He has all his faculties at presentand is greatly assured by the fact he can plan his own exit if his qualityof life deteriorates significantly in the future." Andrew has, unfortunately, also recently experienced the other sideof suicide - from the death of a relative who was undergoing an emotionaltrauma. This is something we strive to protect against in VESS, but toget real safeguards legislation is necessary. Andrew is optimistic aboutlegal change but admits he is "still learning about v.e." A newcomerto the VESS Committee he is still feeling his way, urged on by his father'sinvolvement. Many people join VESS after watching the declining health of a familymember or a drawn-out death (his mother in law died two years ago - "Herquality of life was very poor towards the end.") But digging beneaththe surface we find more than family experiences behind Andrew's concernto be part of the v.e. battle. He has always been interested in ways ofquietly improving things. As an Elder of the Kirk in the Church of Scotlandhe's already involved with the local people. "Without being over-religious,I like to see the church doing some good in the community." He isperhaps representative of many Christians who are more concerned with basichuman goodness than being obsessed with church dogma. Andrew has spent a lot of time working in different parts of Scotland- he's happy to be more settled now (in Mid Calder) and have time to devoteto his family and causes such as VESS. Andrew's already offered his serviceon the new "enabling courses" VESS plans to run for members,both on and off the committee, to better prepare them for speaking aboutv.e. in public. "When I was President of Strathkelvin Junior Chamberof Commerce, I gained some public speaking experience which I would bepleased to pass on."

Peta Sandars had worked inaccounts and teaching before her talents as a writer kept her busy in magazineand stage work - then her first novel was very successful. Her second novel,Gone Tomorrow, is a historical saga features a very independent woman dyingof pancreatic cancer: she asks people to help her commit suicide but eventuallyhas to resort to assistance from an unscrupulous character. She says, "Iwrite what makes me angry." Moral dilemmas feature strongly in herwork - a fellow novelist even said she "hijacks the genre"! But it is Peta's own health that has brought the issues of v.e. intosharper focus. She suffers from a mild form of MS - fortunately it is notdebilitating, but it is sufficiently scary to make her intimately awareof the situations that can drive people to self-deliverance. "Forsomeone like myself, the fact that Departing Drugs exists is a major advantage." In spite of working long hours (she travels the country doing researchfor her writing), Peta Sandars always seems to have been involved in humanitariancauses: Campaign Against the Arms Trade, Amnesty, the Green Party, Friendsof the Earth and, more recently, VESS. She was soon reported around theworld for her pithy comments on v.e. ("The slippery slopes argumentcould be used to prohibit the manufacture of Doc Marten's boots becausesome psychopaths might conceivably use them to kick people's heads in.")Soon, she was one of the most active of our public speakers, learning thetechniques necessary to convince on television and radio. But, like Beloff, she has involved herself in the day-to-day work atgrass-roots level. Using her early experience in accounts, Peta Sandarsas Treasurer has modernised the VESS book-keeping methods and now spendsmany hours in the Office preparing reports and helping in other, mundaneways. Immersing herself in the work at the coal-face helps her to counteropposition effectively. On television she demonstrates adroitness bothwith technical data and quickly switches where necessary to more emotiveuse of words. "People abandon reason for emotion - you have to meetthem on their own terms." Peta Sandars - writings on v.e. can be found in VESS NewsletterApril 1995, Facing the Reality, and in the Dying in Dignity Mensa NewsJournal 1995 2(1), pp14-16. A biographical article has also appeared inMensa Magazine. Gone Tomorrow is published by Bantam, May 1997 under herpen name, Jane Gurney.

Dr Libby Wilson knows. Shortly after a friend had introduced her toVESS, she accepted a post in Sierra Leone, for which she was paid a pittance.In her subsequent book Unexpected Always Happen, she tells the tale ofher adventure there. It took her back, in some ways, to 1946, when shewas studying in a Kings College Hospital, London, when the five senseswere used for diagnosis rather than sophisticated technology. "Therewere hardly any diseases we had treatment for that worked." It isin the last 50 years, leading to her retirement a few years ago, that shehas seen the big changes. "In those days, we no longer 'tasted theurine', but apart from that medicine was just as it had been for 200 years."In those years end-of-life decisions just didn't happen: people eitherlived or died. Her interest in v.e came into sharper focus when her husband died in1977. He had been a professor of medicine and knew exactly what was happeningwhen he was dying of stomach cancer. The heroic surgery failed. Beforethis, working as a part-time G.P. for 18 years, Libby rarely came intoclose contact with death. But human issues had always concerned her. Shecan feel justifiably proud of fighting the good fight on women's issueswhere she has worked in community care, providing support for prostitutesand rape victims and, in the area of her especial expertise, contraceptiveadvice. Controversy is no stranger to her and she hopes she lives to seev.e. reform. Since being coopted onto the VESS Committee in 1990, Libby'smain contribution has been the Glasgow & West of Scotland Group andits newsletter Views & News. She feels the campaign for v.e. is goingwell but, from her background in community care, is especially concernedthat the caring side is not neglected, and has helped to initiate supportvisits, for instance, for Glasgow VESS members who are alone in hospital. Libby Wilson - writings on v.e. can be found in Views& News, the newsletter of the Glasgow & West of Scotland localgroup of VESS. See also Visiting the Netherlands in VESS Newsletter April1995.

They quote the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition): The hero "is a man of action rather than thought and lives by a personal code of honour that admits of no qualification. His responses are usually instinctive, predictable and inevitable. He accepts challenge and sometimes even courts disaster." Whilst the British Medical Association has always expressed condemnation of assisted suicide, the BMJ occasionally differs: on this occasion they have shown a rare stroke of liberalism. They point out that no one has demonstrated any discernible motive from him except that he believes his work is right. Greed for money is absent because he has charged no fees. Greed for fame, too, seems unlikely because he has shunned the media except to explain his position. And no one has accused him of sadism in ending the lives and, according to him, the suffering of his patients. Kevorkian began his right-to-die crusade in Michigan in June 1990 when he helped Oregon resident Janet Adkins end her life in the back of his battered, 1968 Volkswagen van with his lethal injection machine, the "mercitron" (formerly called the "thanatron"). There have been many critics of Kevorkian, not least by right-to-die activists who have seen him as "rocking the boat" or expressed concern at apparent lack of safeguards. But these are words from people who talk - Kevorkian acts. He has acted to end what he perceived as suffering and then turned to the law and said, "I dare you to stop me." And he seems to have won his dare. In the name of the people of the state of Michigan, prosecutors sought to jail him six times, and the juries that represent the people of Michigan six times said "No." Kevorkian has lived "by a personal code of honour that admits of no qualification." His actions have been "instinctive, predictable, and inevitable." He has accepted challenge and even courted disaster. "Consider how rare such heroism is in medicine." says the BMJ. "Conservatism is usually a noble path, especially when we consider the harm that we can do. Secrecy, too, is usually a virtue that protects the vulnerable patient. But doctors see injustice every day from patients suffering pain unnecessarily to those who cannot afford doctors' care to those who are sick due solely to the ills of society." The BMJ puts him in a long line of heroes who have been reviled in their time. To be a hero, it says, means being honest with yourself and acting on your own morality, risking the fall from the pinnacle on which society has placed doctors. "We need the hero to make us uncomfortable... Medicine needs heroes today." Years before he reached national prominence around 1990, Kevorkian was known in medical ethics circles for his curious beliefs regarding death and dying. In a 1960 book he published "Medical Research andthe Death Penalty," in which he posed arguments in supportof medical experiments using prisoners condemned to death. The prisoners could be rendered unconscious, hesuggested, and could be experimented on for weeks beforetheir execution, permitting research not otherwise possible. Kevorkian had widespread support from prisoners on death row, many of whom saw his plans as a way to leave some lasting good after a life of crime. Kevorkian remains fairly neutral on the morality of capital punishment, but has written at length exposing the inhumanity of many methods of execution. In 1961 Time magazine ran an article on his proposal toexsanguinate dead bodies and use the blood intransfusions. Critics say such proposals show that Kevorkian is obsessed with death. Kevorkian was in fact firstnicknamed "Dr. Death" as a medical school student at the University of Michigan in the early 1950s after he reportedly roamed hospital corridors, seeking dying patients so he could be present at the moment of death. More recently, some of his critics have taken to calling him"Mr. Death," since his licenses to practice medicine in Michigan and California have been revoked. But Dr Kevorkian maintains that making the dead useful forthe living, not death itself, informs his work. Hiscause, he said, prompted him to send letters todeath-row inmates, encouraging them to donate their organs, if the method of execution permitted. Kevorkian has called for a new medical subspecialty for assisted death ("obitiatry") and a chain of suicideclinics ("obitoria"). He has also proposed ideas that have repelled even some of the most fervent supporters of the assisted suicide movement. He wantedto exhibit paintings by Hitler, later explaining that theshow would have included works by Churchill andEisenhower as well and that the idea would be that viewers would try to tell who painted which. Kevorkian is an accomplished painter and musician himself. His own dark paintings evoke the nightmarish masterpieces of Hieronymous Bosch, and his private musical concerts in Michigan are well received. In February, he struck back at his critics by filing a lawsuit for $10 million against the American Medical Association for calling him a "killer". He plans to use any damages he might receive from the lawsuit to help fund his "Mercy Clinic." Kevorkian wants to set up the clinic as a place where sick people could come to die with a physician's assistance. On May 14th Kevorkian was acquitted yet again on charges of assisting suicides. Even opponents conceded this time that he is unlikely to be charged again. The Oakland County Circuit Court jury acquitted him again, accepting his argument that he intended to relieve pain and suffering, not cause death (The same defence also won him acquittals last March, and in 1994.) Just before the Oakland jury announced its verdict, Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, said over lunch in the courthouse cafeteria that he was beginning to fear he would be convicted. Moments later, his meal was interrupted by news of the verdict. "What this proves is that while this may be a sin to you," Kevorkian said to reporters minutes later, "one thing is clear: For any enlightened human being, this can never be a crime." Lawrence Bunting, the chief assistant prosecutor who argued the case, would not say whether his office would again charge Kevorkian, who had assisted in Canadian campaigner Austin Bastable's suicide by slipping away between sessions on the witness stand. For several years, 53-year old Ontario resident Austin Bastable, a tool-and-die maker crippled by multiple sclerosis, had fought unsuccessfully to change Canadian law to permit a doctor to help him die. Soon after the Michigan court recessed for the night, Bastable, who by this time could move only his head and part of his left arm, was driven across the Detroit River to the suburban home of Janet Good (herself a right-to-die activist who is dying of pancraetic cancer.) In a small room off the garage, Kevorkian, with Austin's wife, Nina, a tank of carbon monoxide gas and five sympathetic physicians at his side, granted Austin Bastable's last wish. A friend of Kevorkian's provided a death certificate, and a funeral director from Windsor, just across the border in Canada, retrieved the body. Cause of death was listed as "patholysis" -- a term invented by Kevorkian for medically-assisted suicide. "I owe my release from suffering to two people," Bastable said on a videotape in Toronto. "To Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who is one of the most courageous but misunderstood physicians in America, and to John Hofsess of the Right to Die Society of Canada. Together they gave me hope, and a practical plan for action." Michael Modelski, a former Oakland County assistant prosecutor who is a Kevorkian foe, thought that this would probably be the last time Kevorkian would be tried for assisting in a suicide. Prosecutors have not filed charges against him in any of the last eight suicides he has attended; this was the last outstanding legal proceeding against him. Legal experts, including Oakland County's just-defeated prosecutor, Richard Thompson, said the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately have to decide whether there is a constitutional right to assisted suicide. All jurors said they were moved by the videotapes made by two women assisted by Kevorkian, in which they talked of their misery, and begged to be allowed to die. None said they thought the fact that the women were not terminally ill was an issue. Kevorkian, who turned 68 last May 19th, declined to attend a victory dinner, saying, with a grin, "It's my poker night."

A snapshot as of 10 June In the Northern Territory of Australia, those of us who have been closely involved in supporting our voluntary euthanasia legislation are anxiously pacing the floor like expectant parents awaiting the birth of a child. However, there are those even closer to the issue than ourselves - the terminally ill people waiting and hoping for a lawful and merciful death when their suffering becomes too great to bear. What these final weeks of waiting and hoping must be like for them we can only imagine. Two months ago, and after other earlier dates had been given and changed, the NT Government announced a commencement date of 1 July. This time it sounded for real - no ifs, buts or maybes - a firm commencement date. This acted as a catalyst for some of the more hardline opponents to increase the tempo of their campaign. An opposition MP vehemently opposed to the legislation introduced a long foreshadowed repeal bill into Parliament; attempts to have it pass through all stages in the same sitting, however, failed. The repeal Bill has been adjourned and is not expected to be debated until September, at least two months after the Act is scheduled to come into operation. ...actual injection of the death inducing substances... with computer software called Deliverance But will the Act become operational on 1 July as announced? Perhaps by the time you read this, we will know the answer. We think it will, despite the biggest threat of all now hanging over us - the threat of a legal injunction against the Act. Within the last week, media speculation has been building that the Coalition Against Euthanasia (a group including the Australian Medical Association, the Catholic, Anglican and Uniting churches, and the various Right to Life Associations) is backing action through the courts. This has since been confirmed by the local Catholic Bishop, and a press conference is being held on Tuesday June 18 to announce the details. These rapid changes make it extremely difficult to write a current account of the legislation, because the only thing we can be sure of is that the ground shifts under our feet almost daily. A brief history In February of 1995, Marshall Perron, the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, foreshadowed the introduction of a Private Members Bill to allow voluntary euthanasia in controlled circumstances. The Bill, called The Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill, was introduced into parliament later the same month, and the media went wild. Some politicians immediately announced how they would vote on the Bill, but some kept their own counsel and it was impossible to anticipate how the vote would go. This didn't stop various reporters predicting different outcomes - seemingly aligned with their personal views on the matter and giving an impression of "wish-fulfilment" rather than unbiased reporting. There was no right-to-die organisation in the Territory at that time, but by late February a small community group had established itself, with the aim of circulating a petition to determine the extent of community support. The group called itself Operation TIAP for "Terminally Ill Act Petition", although it soon expanded in scope to include many other related activities. The opponents ran a similar campaign, enjoying the advantage of extensive funding through their powerful backers. Prior to the parliamentary debate on 24 May 1995, Marshall Perron announced his resignation from Parliament - timed to ensure that no-one could suggest that his position as Chief Minister would influence the conscience vote to be exercised by members of his party. In the early hours of 25 May 1995, after a marathon debate, the legislation was passed by a vote of 15 to 10. No-one was more stunned than this writer, who sat through the debate in the public gallery with other members of Operation TIAP. As we went down the staircase towards the waiting media, I said to a friend "Thank goodness that's over". She looked at me wisely, slowly shook her head, and said "Lynda, this is just the beginning". How right she was. Since then we have had many months of work to hold the hard won ground. The government established a working party to develop regulations and guidelines for the operation of the Act, and Operation TIAP became the Northern Territory Voluntary Euthanasia Society (NTVES) - with Marshall Perron as its Patron. Along with a number of other community organisations, the NTVES provided extensive input and feedback to the government working party. During this period the wording of the psychiatric qualification was questioned, resulting in an Amendment Bill being introduced in November. The Amendment Bill was subsequently passed in February 1996 - despite extensive efforts by some of the opponents to use the Amendment Bill as an opportunity to abort the Act. There are no residency requirements, although doctors may be less inclined to assist patients they do not know. Overseas people may face difficulties obtaining visas. During this time too, we saw our first sad suicides by people who could not wait for legal assistance. One desperate cancer victim, Marta Alfonso-Bowes, came to the NT after hearing that the Act had been passed, not realising that it was not yet operational. Marta attended the inaugural meeting of the NTVES in September and suicided alone in a hotel room the following day. Her memory lives on in a memorial award currently being administered by the NTVES for a poem/essay on voluntary euthanasia. A key campaigner throughout the last 15 months has been Dr Philip Nitschke. An articulate medical practitioner (who also has a PhD in Nuclear Physics) with a strong social conscience, Dr Nitschke took up the baton on behalf of supporting doctors. As a result, a group of 22 doctors, calling themselves Doctors for Change, advertised their names and their support in Northern Territory newspapers. More recently, Dr Nitschke has received widespread attention for his development of a computer driven device which would enable a patient to have control over the actual injection of the death inducing substances. Dubbed the death machine by the media, it is activated after confirmation by the patient in a dialogue with computer software called Deliverance. The Act The following is a lay-person's overview of the Act and its proposed operation and no responsibility can be taken for errors or omissions. It is provided as a guide only. Interested persons should obtain a copy of the Act, and/or the explanatory brochure published by the Northern Territory Health Services Department. Very briefly, the act allows for terminally ill persons, at least 18 years of age who are not suffering from treatable clinical depression, and who are experiencing pain or suffering, to receive medical assistance in terminating their life. A second doctor with prescribed qualifications in the illness must confirm the diagnosis and prognosis. The assistance may be direct, such as a lethal injection given by the medical practitioner, or may be indirect - such as the medical practitioner prescribing the substances to be used. In either case, the doctor must be present during the delivery of the assistance and must remain until death occurs and for a reasonable period afterwards with family/friends. Family and friends can be present if the patient wishes. The patient must be advised of palliative care options, but as with any treatment has the right to refuse palliative care. Doctors or other health care workers are not obliged to assist, and no reason need be given. There are no residency requirements, although doctors may be less inclined to assist patients they do not know. Overseas people may face difficulties obtaining visas. Where to from here? As highlighted in the first section, the legislation is once again threatened by those who would cruelly impose their own values and beliefs on the rest of us. But as Marshall Perron, in a message to NTVES members, after noting the conditions under which world history has been made by this overdue social reform, said: "These same circumstances were no doubt applicable when, as part of the fledgling self governing colonies, the tiny colony of South Australia [which then included the Northern Territory] passed ground breaking legislation to give women the right to vote and stand for parliament for the first time anywhere in the world. Detractors predicted disaster and chaos would flow from such irresponsible legislation. What actually happened was that the whole western world followed suit!" We hope detractors of this legislation will suffer a similar fate, and that in a 100 years time we will find it hard to comprehend a society which did not allow a compassionate dignified choice in the manner of our death. When that day comes it will be inconceivable that the right be taken away. © 1996 Lynda Cracknell You are the 91st person to browse through here since 5 July 1996 using the above URL
