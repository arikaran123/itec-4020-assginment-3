The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly cash benefits for disabled workers under age 65 and their dependents. Benefits were provided to disabled workers age 50 or older by the 1956 Social Security amendments; benefits for their dependents were provided by the 1958 Social Security amendments; and benefits to disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments. In 1993, there were 5.2 million persons in current payment status. Twenty-six percent were disabled by reason of mental illness. Many provisions of the DI program are identical to those of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), commonly referred to as Social Security. The purpose of both OASI and DI benefits is to replace income lost when the wage-earner is no longer able to work. The DI program insures against the loss of income due to the worker's physical or mental disability. What is the definition of disability? Generally, disability is defined as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or mental impairment. The impairment must be medically determinable and expected to last for not less than 12 months or to result in death. Claimants may be determined to be disabled only if, due to such an impairment, they are unable to engage in any kind of substantial gainful work, considering their age, education, and work experience, which exists in the national economy. The work need not exist in the immediate area in which the claimant lives, nor must a specific job vacancy exist for the individual. Moreover, no showing is required that the worker would be hired for the job if he or she applied. What are the DI benefits? In general, DI monthly cash benefits are paid and computed on the same basis as in the OASI program. Benefit amounts are related to the past earning of the insured worker. Medicare is provided to disabled workers, widow(er)s, or adult children after they have been entitled to disability benefits for 24 months. In December 1993 there were 5.2 million DI beneficiaries in current-payment status. The total monthly benefits paid out were $2.6 billion. Table 1 summarizes various types of beneficiaries of the DI program currently receiving benefits, average benefit amounts, and the number of new awards during 1993. What are the major benefit types relevant to persons with mental illness? The major benefit types include: 1. Disabled-worker benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to a disabled worker under age 65 insured for disability. 2. Disabled adult child's benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to a disabled person aged 18 or over--a son or daughter or eligible grandson or granddaughter of a retired, deceased, or disabled worker--whose disability began before age 22. What is Supplemental Security Income? The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a means-tested, federally administered income assistance program authorized by title XVI of the Social Security Act. Begun in 1974, SSI provides monthly cash payments in accordance with uniform, nationwide eligibility requirements to needy aged, blind, and disabled persons. In 1993, nearly six million persons were receiving SSI. Of these, 1,471,000 (or 28.1 percent) were disabled by a mental disorder other than retardation. What has been the trend in SSI recipients? The number of recipients on SSI has risen from nearly 4 million in 1974 to nearly 6 million in December 1993. From 1984 through 1993, the disabled population on SSI grew at an annual average rate of about 9.2 percent. The monthly federal benefit rates for individuals and couples rose from $140 and $210 in 1974 to $446 and $669 in 1994, respectively. The proportion of SSI recipients receiving Social Security benefits declined from nearly 53 percent in 1974 to about 40 percent in 1993. The fraction of SSI recipients receiving some other type of unearned income rose from about 11 percent in 1974 to 13 percent in 1993, and the fraction with earnings jumped from about 3 percent to 1974 to more than 4 percent in December 1993. What about children and SSI payments? In June 1993, 732,000 blind and disabled children were eligible for SSI payments. These children made up 12.6 percent of the over 5.8 million SSI recipients in June, and they represent a fast-growing segment of the SSI population. To be eligible for SSI payments as a child, an individual must be under age 18 (or under 22 if he or she is a full-time student, unmarried, and must meet the SSI disability, citizenship/residency, and income and resources criteria (applicable to adults). The Zabley Supreme Court decision required "individual functional assessments for children, not just conformity to one diagnosis in the adult listings. In June 1993, almost 61 percent of the SSI children were 12 years old or less, and an estimated 20 percent of the children were under age 6. About 28 percent (or about 199,000) were between the ages of 13 and 17. More than half (61 percent) of the SSI children were medically eligible based on a mental disorder, and most of these (43 percent) were mentally retarded. The remaining 18 percent (61 minus 43)--or 131,760--are eligible based on mental disorders other than retardation.

In late March, 75 state campaign and media market coordinators met at the first state campaign coordinators training meeting in St. Louis, Missouri. Each state-appointed coordinator is the contact for campaign activities and will work with the state AMI affiliate and local affiliates to get as many people as possible involved in the campaign. This year's goal is to introduce parity legislation in as many states as possible. And while doing this, we will also educate legislators, insurers, and other persons and groups who need the facts about brain disorders and the justice of parity in health insurance. Materials such as brochures, buttons, posters, mini-cards, and postcards are available to local affiliates that have planned parity activities. (Your state coordinator will track activities.)

Reported in the American Journal of Public Health (February 1994), this study found that few homeless children escaped emotional, behavioral, and academic problems and few received help for them. About 170 children were evaluated, and most parents in the study (93 percent) were minority women living in extreme poverty (annual income under $10,000). More than a third (37 percent) of the children had depression scores high enough to warrant a psychiatric evaluation, and more than a quarter (28 percent) were in the borderline range for serious behavioral problems. Few of the children were receiving any treatment; and among those depressed enough to warrant psychiatric evaluation, only about one-quarter (30 percent) had ever received counseling. The researchers suggest that mental health and education services should be part of a comprehensive package of services for homeless children. PLAN FOR SINGLE HOUSING PROGRAM [Return to Top] Advocates for housing for people with severe mental illness should be alert to a significant change in the way monies from certain key federal housing programs will be administered and awarded at local levels. Under the "Consolidated Plan" recommended by HUD and approved by Congress, four distinct housing and community development funding streams have been combined into one massive program. These four programs are the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME, Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) and Housing Opportunities for People with Aids (HOPWA). Authority will be vested in local communities to develop one consolidated plan to identify priorities for spending monies from this large new program. Communities will be required to hold public hearings and seek input from local advocates as they develop these plans. Local Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) plans have been eliminated and folded into this larger planning process. The new consolidated planning process is potentially problematic in that it creates possible competition for these federal monies among a large number of advocates for various low-income interests. However, it also creates opportunities for advocates on behalf of housing for people with severe mental illness to be at the table when crucial planning and funding decisions occur. Historically, in many local jurisdictions, little money from the four programs included in the consolidation have been used for housing for people with severe mental illness. During the recently completed session, Congress also considered legislation that would have consolidated all funding streams within the McKinney Act into one large block grant. This legislation did not pass, but it is expected to be taken up again when the new Congress reconvenes. Information about local consolidated planning processes should be available from low-income housing advocates in your communities. NAMI housing advocates are urged to participate in the development of these plans. Additional information about the Consolidated Plan and the possible creation of a McKinney block grant will be provided in a future issue of the NAMI Advocate. by Ron Honberg director, NAMI Legal Affairs CONTACT | MEMBERSHIP | WEBMASTER Copyright © 1996 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill - All Rights ReservedWT02-B26-4IA008-000082-B045-230http://www.nami.org:80/update/addfund.htm 38.250.129.71 19970222095905 text/html 9881HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 09:57:21 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Congress Appropriates Additional Funding For Housing NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Congress Appropriates Additional Funding For Housing by Andrew Sperling, NAMI Director Of Public Policy As part of the recently enacted 1997 budget for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Congress began the process of funding replacement housing resources for people with disabilities who are likely to be harmed by recent changes in the law that allows an increase in "elderly only" housing designations. For fiscal year 1997, Congress appropriated $50 million for tenant-based rental assistance for people with disabilities who are adversely affected by "elderly only" housing designations. As a result of Congressional changes enacted in 1992 and expanded in 1996, public-housing authorities (PHAs) and assisted-housing providers now have tremendous freedom to exclude non-elderly people with disabilities by designating buildings and developments as "elderly only." Such "elderly only" housing designations are expected to have a devastating impact on the availability of decent, safe, and affordable housing for people with disabilities. While the law does contain certain protections for current lease-compliant tenants, people with disabilities on public and assisted-housing waiting lists are particularly vulnerable--especially people with severe and persistent mental illness who already face stigma and discrimination both in public housing and the private rental market. This erosion of housing resources is compounded by recently enacted changes that repeal federal preferences in tenant-selection policies and place tight restrictions on eligibility for individuals with a history of substance abuse. The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) housing task force estimates that by the year 2000 there will be a decrease of at least 273,000 units that would otherwise have been occupied by non-elderly people with disabilities in the absence of "elderly only" housing designations. This $50-million allocation (estimated to fund as many as 10,000 one-year certificates and vouchers) will not come close to meeting the increase in demand for affordable housing expected over the next few years. However, it does amount to the first time that Congress has recognized the need to make replacement resources available for the disability community. The $50-million appropriation was included in the HUD budget through the efforts of Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and John Kerry (D-MA). Even with this modest infusion of new resources, the public mental health system is likely to face greater difficulty trying to cope with the loss of affordable housing. As Congress moves to devolve responsibilities for housing programs to state and local governments, state mental health agencies (SMHAs) and local mental health authorities will need to intervene with state housing-finance agencies and PHAs at the community level to ensure that people with brain disorders have a voice in local planning decisions. While the 104th Congress did not follow through on proposals to abolish HUD as a federal agency, the department's budget was cut by nearly 20 percent (down to $20 billion). In addition, other important changes were made that have moved the federal government almost completely out of the business of producing new housing units and further away from any role supervising how federal funds are allocated at the local level. Thus, these modest increases in funding for housing for people with disabilities are an important accomplishment for disability advocates. The expanded authority for PHAs to designate housing as "elderly only" was contained in a bill signed by President Clinton in March 1996 extending the authority for certain expiring HUD programs. A separate bill reforming public housing programs by converting numerous federal programs into block grants died in a House-Senate conference committee immediately prior to final adjournment. Nevertheless, the next Congress is expected to continue to push toward consolidating federal housing programs and passing the responsibility for housing policy down to state and local government. For example, homeless-service programs under the McKinney Act are likely to be block-granted and could be cut below their current level of $823 million (after having been cut by nearly $300 million over the past two years). Another important program serving the housing needs of people with brain disorders is Section 811. Since 1994, the Section 811 program has been cut by nearly $40 million, down to its current level of $194 million. (The Section 811 program funds capital advances and project-based certificates for non-profit groups that serve the housing needs of people with disabilities.) Congress also granted HUD new authority to transfer up to 25 percent of the funds appropriated under the 811 program to tenant-based rental assistance. This change is designed to allow HUD to fund roughly the same number of units (2,915) as it did in 1995 and 1996. While these new housing resources for people with disabilities are a positive development, the long-term trend for solutions at the federal level is not encouraging. As with all other discretionary programs within the federal budget, HUD funding will be facing severe constraints over the next five to seven years. If, as expected, the HUD budget is further squeezed between now and the year 2000, responses to the housing crisis facing people with disabilities will have to come through creative approaches at all levels. Beyond Section 811 and Section 8 certificates and vouchers for people with disabilities, there are other federal resources that SMHAs and local mental health authorities can tap. The Low-income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs both enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress, and their funding is likely to remain stable. Both programs are administered by state housing finance authorities and state and local economic development agencies rather than by HUD. Thus, SMHAs and their allies in the provider community as well as families and consumers can play an important role in deciding how these resources are spent at the community level. State and local officials that administer programs such as LIHTC and CDBG must go through a planning process and a local housing assessment that require a survey of the housing needs of people with disabilities and input from concerned parties. Proactive engagement on the part of the entire mental health community with state housing finance authorities and local economic development officials will help ensure that resources keep pace with increased demand for housing. Finally, the public mental health system must look toward creative solutions at the local level and through partnerships with the private sector. Increasingly, managed care firms that have won contracts to serve clients in the public mental health system are investing resources in community-based housing. While some states have included housing or residential services in contracts, many managed care firms view access to decent, safe, and affordable housing as an important part of preventing expensive inpatient hospitalization.

Since 1989 NAMI has advocated on behalf ofthese populations because they are often not included in the overallcivilian planning and development of community-based treatmentand services for which they, as citizens, ought to be eligible. What are some examples of how NAMI advocates on behalf of veterans,active-duty military, and/or their dependents with severe mentalillness? --In 1990 NAMI's alert helped reverse the congressional decisionto cut $800,000,000 in psychiatric care for dependents of active-dutymilitary. --In 1991 NAMI supported the Disabled American Veterans [DAV]class-action lawsuit to restore $125,000,000 for 13,500 "incompetentveterans." --Since 1994 NAMI has had representatives on the VA Undersecretaryfor Health's Special Committee for the Seriously Mentally IllVeteran. --Since 1994 NAMI has sent presenters to the VA National TrainingProgram continuing education workshops ["Strengthening Systemsfor the Primary Care of Veterans with Psychiatric Disorders"]. --Each year NAMI provides expert testimony at congressional committeehearings regarding veterans with serious mental illness.

NAMI can provide the latest data about serious mental illnessand serve as an information clearinghouse. NAMI's Homeless and Missing service can assist families of the200,000 homeless veterans with chronic mental illness. I am a veteran. How can I or my family get help for my medicalproblems? Medical care (including psychiatric care) is just one of the many benefits and services to which a veteran may be entitled. However, the federal government does not grant veteran'sbenefits automatically. You must apply for them. Eligibility mustbe verified and justified. How do I become eligible for medical care? Consult your local telephone directory under United States Government,Department of Veterans Affairs, for the number to reach a VA representative. Toll-free telephone service is available in all 50 states, WashingtonD.C., and Puerto Rico. You must supply information that you were honorably discharged(Form DD-214). You must complete a financial statement (a financialmeans test) for the past year. This statement will be auditedby the IRS. Upon verification of your discharge status and financial status,you should qualify for inpatient and outpatient medical care. Note, however, that not all benefits may be available to youif you enlisted for the first time on or after September 8, 1980,and have not completed at least two years of that enlistment. For officers, the two year requirement applies on or after October17, 1981. My psychiatric disorder began while I was on active duty. AmI eligible for financial compensation in addition to VA medicalcare? VA pays compensation if you are disabled by injury or diseaseincurred in or aggravated by active service in the line of duty. Payments are based on the degree of disability. VA pays additionalmoney for your dependents if your service-connected disabilitiesare evaluated as 30 percent or more disabling. In addition, if you are 30 percent or more disabled and your spouseis in need of regular aid, an increased dependency allowance ispayable for your spouse. Remember--getting service-connectedcompensation (or a nonservice-connected pension) can be a difficultand complicated process. Qualifying for VA medical care does not automatically qualifyyou for financial compensation or pension. When in doubt, apply! You may want to get a representative (see below) to assist youin applying for these benefits. A rating as low as 10 percentmay qualify for financial benefits. All service-connected veterans rated 50 percent or higher andlow-income nonservice-connected veterans are eligible for freeinpatient and outpatient care at VA medical centers and clinics. If VA facilities and resources are available, VA may providemedical care for higher-income nonservice-connected veterans. They will be billed $39/outpatient visit; $719 per inpatientadmission; plus $10/day nursing care. Check with your VA medicalcenter to see if this care is available. Where can I go to get someone to represent me in applying forfinancial benefits? NAMI in the past has worked closely with the Disabled AmericanVeterans [DAV] organization. DAV is independent of the federalgovernment. DAV will help you file your claim for benefits bybuilding your case from the ground up--reviewing all pertinentlaws, regulations, precedents, and medical histories. DAV prepares claim forms and briefs. They help you assemble therequired paperwork. If necessary, DAV will represent you beforegovernment boards. They also review government decisions, takeappropriate action, and advise you if appeals are warranted. Remember--NAMI does not have staff trained to provide this comprehensiverepresentation. While we are confident in recommending DAV, thereare a number of other veterans' service organizations [VSOs] whichwill represent you without charge: AMVETS, American Legion, Veteransof Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and others.

The NIMH study and other research was reported in a special November 1993 issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders devoted to women and depression. "Research into the biological and psychological underpinnings of depression is beginning to yield findings that help to explain why women are twice as likely to develop depression," said former NIMH Director Frederick K. Goodwin, M.D. "As we learn more about gender-specific factors in the development of depression, we will be better able to design specialized and more effective treatments for both women and men with the disorder. Findings reported in this issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders are reported below. Dr. Myrna M. Weissman of Columbia University's New York State Psychiatric Institute and colleagues examined sex differences in the rates of depressive illnesses in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. Across the four countries, they found almost the same rates of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder in men and women, but higher rates of major depression and dysthymia in women. Major depression first strikes in the mid- to late-20s for both sexes, and while the rate of depression in the United States in men born since 1945 has been rising, it appears to have stabilized in women. In research on biological mechanisms underlying depression, Dr. Uriel Halbreich and Lucille A. Lumley, M.S., both of the State University of New York at Buffalo, compared neurochemical and neuroendocrine function in men and women. They found gender differences in several functions of the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, in activities of dopamine and acetylcholine, and in certain operations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression, as well as its actual expression, might be related to short- and long-term effects of gonadal hormones. These hormones probably play an important role in the multi-faceted and multi-dimensional mechanisms underlying mood and behavior. Dr. Diane N. Ruble of the New York University and colleagues, in a literature review of socialization processes in childhood, discussed various social factors that may lead to girls' greater vulnerability to depression. For example, girls are usually more closely watched and protected than boys, making them less likely to develop an independent sense of mastery. This low sense of self-efficacy, the researchers reported, may lead to feelings of little control, pessimism, and hopelessness. Theorists of learned helplessness believe all of these are related to the development of depression. This review also suggested that pre-pubertal girls sometimes have more depressive symptoms than boys. This finding supports the view that women's higher rates of depression cannot be solely explained by hormone-related changes associated with the onset of puberty. This is important because it suggests that prevention and intervention efforts should be directed at socialization processes during the early school years. Dr. Ronald Kessler of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and colleagues reported that there is no difference between the sexes in the overall course of depression once it occurs. Men and women who had a history of depression were equally likely to have been chronically depressed or to have experienced an acute recurrence of a depressive episode in the past year. This finding comes from the National Comorbidity Survey, which was conducted in the United States from 1990 to 1992 and involved nearly 8,100 respondents.

BRAIN DONATIONS [Return to Top] THE HARVARD PSYCHIATRY BRAIN COLLECTION The Harvard Psychiatry Brain Collection has been specificallytrying to collect brain tissue from families with serious mental illness.There has been a special focus on the membership of the National Alliancefor the Mentally Ill (NAMI), the organization for families with braindisorders. Our "Brain Bank" functions as a repository for brain tissuethat is used for scientific investigations of the underlying causes ofneuropsychiatric brain disorders. Toward this end, we distribute donatedtissue to qualified investigators throughout the country. For research purposes, it is important that we collect tissue from:A. Individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia,manic-depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder); B. First degreerelatives (parents, siblings, offspring) of individuals with a psychiatricdiagnosis; and C. "Normal Control" individuals who have no family historyof mental illness. The Harvard "Brain Bank", which is centered at McLean Hospital, isfederally funded to undertake the processing and distribution of donatedbrain specimens. Unfortunately, the government does not provide sufficientfunding to cover the costs associated with brain removal which, may in somecases be as much as $200-300. In the past, these costs have generally beenassumed by the family members interested in brain donation. However,because of the severe shortage of brain tissue donated by individuals witha serious psychiatric illness, we have established a special fund in orderto cover the costs of brain removal for individuals with a psychiatricdiagnosis (category A above). In addition, as long as there is adequatefunding available, we will also cover such costs for the donation of brainsfrom first degree relatives (parents, sibling, offspring) of individualswith schizophrenia, manic-depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder(category B above). The spouse of an individual with a serious mentalillness, who has no other blood relatives with a serious mental illness,can donate brain tissue in the category of "Normal Control" (category Cabove), and as long as there is adequate funding available, we will agreeto cover the associated costs of donation. Pre-registration for brain donation is encouraged, but notnecessary. When an individual dies, the surviving family members make thedecision to donate. We do, however, encourage families to openly plan forbrain donation and to pre-register with the Brain Bank.

STUDY FINDS AFTERCARE LACKING [Return to Top] A national study of psychiatric aftercare has found that patients leaving psychiatric hospitals often receive inadequate or uneven transitional services. "Because psychiatric care has increasingly been provided in community-based settings rather than in hospitals, there must be greater coordination between hospitals discharging patients and the local mental health centers and clinics providing care after they leave," said Dr. Robert Dorwart, a co-author of the study published in the August 1994 issue of the American Journal of Public Health. "Right now they are falling through the cracks," he continued. The Harvard-based study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that half of the facilities surveyed provided patient follow-up of one week or less. While nine out of ten hospitals reported making discharge plans for patients leaving the hospital, 75 percent provided no case-management services, the most intensive form of aftercare. And although 60 percent of hospitals said they arranged a follow-up appointment for patients leaving the hospital, just 10 percent made telephone calls to see if the appointment was kept.

VIOLENCE AND THE MENTALLY ILL [Return to Top] "The perceived association between violent behavior and serious mental illness was explored to determine the validity of claims by mental health advocates that individuals with serious mental illness are no more dangerous than members of the general population," wrote E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., in conjunction with his article, "Violent Behavior by Individuals with Serious Mental Illness," published in the July 1994 issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry. Torrey reviewed recent studies and media accounts of violent behavior by individuals with serious mental illness and found that "although the vast majority of [such individuals] are not more dangerous than members of the general population, recent findings suggest the existence of a subgroup that is more dangerous. A history of violent behavior, noncompliance with medications, and substance abuse are important predictors of violent behavior in this subgroup....Until the problem of violence by this subgroup is addressed, it will be difficult to substantially decrease the stigma associated with serious mental illness," concluded Torrey.

The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly cash benefitsfor disabled workers under age 65 and their dependents. Benefitswere provided to disabled workers age 50 or older by the 1956Social Security amendments; benefits for their dependents wereprovided by the 1958 Social Security amendments; and benefitsto disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments. In 1993, there were 5.2 million persons in current payment status. Twenty-six percent were disabled by reason of mental illness. Many provisions of the DI program are identical to those of theOld Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), commonly referred to asSocial Security. The purpose of both OASI and DI benefits isto replace income lost when the wage-earner is no longer ableto work. The DI program insures against the loss of income dueto the worker's physical or mental disability. What is the definition of disability? Generally, disability is defined as an inability to engage insubstantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or mentalimpairment. The impairment must be medically determinable andexpected to last for not less than 12 months or to result in death. Claimants may be determined to be disabled only if, due to suchan impairment, they are unable to engage in any kind of substantialgainful work, considering their age, education, and work experience,which exists in the national economy. The work need not existin the immediate area in which the claimant lives, nor must aspecific job vacancy exist for the individual. Moreover, no showingis required that the worker would be hired for the job if he orshe applied. What are the DI benefits? In general, DI monthly cash benefits are paid and computed onthe same basis as in the OASI program. Benefit amounts are relatedto the past earning of the insured worker. Medicare is providedto disabled workers, widow(er)s, or adult children after theyhave been entitled to disability benefits for 24 months. In December1993 there were 5.2 million DI beneficiaries in current-paymentstatus. The total monthly benefits paid out were $2.6 billion. Table 1 summarizes various types of beneficiaries of the DI programcurrently receiving benefits, average benefit amounts, and thenumber of new awards during 1993. What are the major benefit types relevant to persons with mentalillness? The major benefit types include: 1. Disabled-worker benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to adisabled worker under age 65 insured for disability. 2. Disabled adult child's benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to a disabled person aged 18 or over--a son or daughter or eligiblegrandson or granddaughter of a retired, deceased, or disabledworker--whose disability began before age 22. What is Supplemental Security Income? The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a means-tested,federally administered income assistance program authorized bytitle XVI of the Social Security Act. Begun in 1974, SSI providesmonthly cash payments in accordance with uniform, nationwide eligibilityrequirements to needy aged, blind, and disabled persons. In 1993,nearly six million persons were receiving SSI. Of these, 1,471,000(or 28.1 percent) were disabled by a mental disorder other thanretardation. What has been the trend in SSI recipients? The number of recipients on SSI has risen from nearly 4 millionin 1974 to nearly 6 million in December 1993. From 1984 through1993, the disabled population on SSI grew at an annual averagerate of about 9.2 percent. The monthly federal benefit ratesfor individuals and couples rose from $140 and $210 in 1974 to$446 and $669 in 1994, respectively. The proportion of SSI recipients receiving Social Security benefitsdeclined from nearly 53 percent in 1974 to about 40 percent in1993. The fraction of SSI recipients receiving some other typeof unearned income rose from about 11 percent in 1974 to 13 percentin 1993, and the fraction with earnings jumped from about 3 percentto 1974 to more than 4 percent in December 1993. What about children and SSI payments? In June 1993, 732,000 blind and disabled children were eligiblefor SSI payments. These children made up 12.6 percent of theover 5.8 million SSI recipients in June, and they represent afast-growing segment of the SSI population. To be eligible for SSI payments as a child, an individual mustbe under age 18 (or under 22 if he or she is a full-time student,unmarried, and must meet the SSI disability, citizenship/residency,and income and resources criteria (applicable to adults). TheZabley Supreme Court decision required "individual functionalassessments for children, not just conformity to one diagnosisin the adult listings. In June 1993, almost 61 percent of the SSI children were 12 yearsold or less, and an estimated 20 percent of the children wereunder age 6. About 28 percent (or about 199,000) were betweenthe ages of 13 and 17. More than half (61 percent) of the SSI children were medicallyeligible based on a mental disorder, and most of these (43 percent)were mentally retarded. The remaining 18 percent (61 minus 43)--or131,760--are eligible based on mental disorders other than retardation.

We are reporting that, after a great deal of study, the NAMI Board of Directors has approved a policy on involuntary commitment and court-ordered treatment. This policy was developed after a year of analysis with input from grassroots members around the country. The final text, approved by the board, is printed below. In passing this policy, the board re-emphasized its belief that "the availability of effective, comprehensive, community-based systmes of care for persons suffering from brain disorders will diminish the need for involuntary commitment and court-ordered treatment." We also agree that court-ordered treatment should only be used as a "last resort." On the other hand, the board is cognizant of the fact "that there are certain individuals with brain disorders who at times, due to their illness, lack insight or judgment about their need for medical treatment." We believe the following policy does a good job of balancing an individual's civil rights with society's obligation to provide kind and compassionate care to those in need. Policy On Involuntary Commitment And Court Ordered Treatment Approved by NAMI Board of Directors on October 7,1995 The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) believes that all people should have the right to make their own decisions about medical treatment. However, NAMI is aware that there are certain individuals with brain disorders (also known as severe mental illnesses) such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness who, at times, due to their illness, lack insight or judgement about their need for medical treatment. NAMI is also aware that, in many states, laws and policies governing involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment are inadequate. NAMI, therefore, adopts the following policy: 1. The availability of effective, comprehensive community-based systems of care for persons suffering from biological brain disorders will diminish the need for involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment. 2. Methods for facilitating communications about treatment preferences among individuals with biological brain disorders, family members, and treatment providers should be adopted and promoted in all states. 3. Involuntary commitment and court-ordered treatment decisions must be made expeditiously and simultaneously in a single hearing so that individuals can receive treatment in a timely manner. The role of courts should be limited to review to ensure that procedures used in making these determinations comply with individual rights and due process requirements, and not to make medical decisions. 4. Involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and court-ordered treatment should be used as a last resort and only when it is believed to be in the best interests of the individual in need. 5.States should adopt broader, more flexible standards that would provide for involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment when an individual: (A). Is gravely disabled, which means that the person is substantially unable, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for any of his or her basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health or safety, or (B). Is likely to substantially deteriorate if not provided with timely treatment, or (C). Lacks capacity, which means that as a result of the brain disorder the person is unable to fully understand or lacks judgment to make an informed decision regarding his or her need for treatment, care or supervision. 6. Current interpretations of laws that require proof of dangerousness often produce unsatisfactory outcomes because individuals are allowed to deteriorate needlessly before involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment can be instituted. When the "dangerousness standard" is used, it must be interpreted more broadly than "imminently" and/or "provably" dangerous. 7. State laws should also allow for consideration of past history in making determinations about involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment, since past history is often a reliable way to anticipate the future course of illness. 8. An independent administrative and/or judicial review must be guaranteed in all involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment determinations. Individuals must be afforded access to appropriate representation knowledgeable about brain disorders and provided opportunities to submit evidence in opposition to involuntary commitment and/or court-ordered treatment. 9. Responsibility for determining court-ordered treatment should always be vested with medical professionals, who, in conjunction with the individual, family, and other interested parties, must develop a plan for treatment. 10. The legal standard for states to meet in order to justify emergency commitments for initial 24 to 72 hours should be "information and belief." For involuntary commitments beyond the initial period, the standard should be "clear and convincing evidence." Involuntary commitments and/or court-ordered treatment must be periodically subject to administrative or judicial review to ascertain whether circumstances justify the continuation of these orders. 11. Court-ordered outpatient treatment should be considered as a less restrictive, more beneficial, and less costly treatment alternative to involuntary inpatient treatment. 12. Efforts must be undertaken to better educate justice systems and law enforcement professionals about the relationship between severe brain disorders and the application of involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and court-ordered treatment. 13. Private and public health insurance plans must cover the costs of involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and/or court-ordered treatment.

Recently, NAMI filed an amicus ("friend of the court") brief in a case considering this very issue. In Klebe v. Mitre Health Care Plan, a self-insured group health plan contained a lower lifetime maximum for "mental health benefits" than for "medical" benefits. After exhausting all administrative appeals, the policy-holders filed suit in federal court arguing that their son's schizophrenia should be covered under the lifetime maximum for "medical treatment," not that for "mental health treatment." After the federal district court granted summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the policyholders appealed to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where oral arguments are currently pending. NAMI's brief was submitted to the Fourth Circuit in support of the policy holders. In granting summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the district court refused to accept evidence offered by the policyholders that schizophrenia is a biological disorder of the brain and is therefore a medical disorder. Instead, the court determined that benefits under the plan should be classified based on the nature of treatment rendered, not by the nature of the particular illness itself. In the court's view, the particular treatments received by the son of the policyholders (psychotropic medication, psychotherapy, etc.) fell into the category of "mental health treatment" not "medical treatment." In its brief, NAMI argued that the district court's application of a "treatment determinative" method of classifying mental health vs. medical benefits was incorrect based both on construction of the particular insurance policy and on court cases in other jurisdictions that have considered this issue. There have been several cases around the country in which courts have recognized that distinctions between "mental health" and "medical" benefits should be based on the nature and etiology of particular disorders, not on specific treatments received for those disorders. For example, in Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield v. Doe, 733 S.W.2d 429 (Ark. App. 1987), an Arkansas court of appeals held that bipolar affective disorder is a physical condition and should therefore be covered (in the particular insurance policy in question) as a medical, not a mental health disorder. Similar decisions have been reached in cases involving autism, Kunin v. Benefit Trust Life Insurance Co., 910 F. 2d 534 (9th Cir. 1990), and organic brain syndrome, Phillips v. Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., 978 F.2d 302 (7th Cir. 1992) and Malerbi v. Central Reserve Life of North America Insurance Co., 225 Neb. 543 (1987). Having cited these cases, NAMI's brief asserted that the district court was mistaken in its failure to consider evidence submitted by several scientific experts who presented affidavits in this case. Both of these experts, reflecting virtual consensus within science, concluded that schizophrenia is a physical disorder. This clearly establishes, NAMI argued, that "as a brain disorder, schizophrenia has far more in common with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Tourette's syndrome and Parkinson's disease than it does with mental health problems and conditions related to life stressors or environmental factors....As a disorder affecting the brain, schizophrenia is a medical disorder, just as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are medical disorders. This case, like the others cited above, unfortunately reflects the limitations of arguing that health insurance policies should cover disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and major depression as "medical disorders" based on the language of the insurance policies themselves. Even when these arguments succeed, insurance companies simply change the language of their policies to list specific diagnostic categories that will be covered at lower levels. Consequently, these cases have not heralded the end of discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance policies, even in the states in which the decisions have occurred. To date, there have been no major cases that have held that lower levels of coverage of brain disorders in health insurance policies constitutes discrimination. And the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) has issued interim guidelines that stipulate that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to lower levels of coverage of "mental nervous disorders" in health insurance policies. Consequently, although these guidelines are not binding on courts, it will be difficult to succeed with an argument that Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination of this nature. Despite their limited precedential value, court cases such as the one discussed here, coupled with ongoing efforts by AMI advocates to achieve passage of insurance parity bills in states, can be valuable tools for educating policy makers, judges, and the public about the historical inequities in coverage of biological brain disorders. Moreover, a few highly publicized court cases can serve to spur legislative bodies to enact legislation concerning practices identified as inequitable and unfair. Consequently, a comprehensive assault on ending the historical discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance should involve both legislative efforts and, where necessary, legal challenges. A copy of the brief submitted by NAMI in this case can be obtained by contacting Sue Medford at 703/524-7600. In granting summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the district court refused to accept evidence offered by the policyholders that schizophrenia is a biological disorder of the brain and is therefore a medical disorder.

The Center is jointly funded by the Center for Mental Health Services, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and the National Institute of Corrections. GAINS Center staff and consultants will collect information designed to influence the range and scope of mental health and substance abuse services provided in jails, prisons, and community corrections; tailor these materials to the specific needs of localities; and help localities plan, implement, and operate appropriate, cost-effective programs. Additionally, GAINS Center staff will collaborate with national experts, policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, consumers, and family members from the mental health, substance abuse, and criminal justice fields. They will use the information they assemble to create innovative programs, provide technical assistance, convene interagency groups, develop a bibliographic database, and generate policy statements on key issues affecting the treatment and management of people with co-occurring disorders in the justice system. Inadequate, fragmented community services increase the likelihood that people with co-occurring disorders will be arrested and unnecessarily confined. A lack of knowledge about mental illness and substance abuse disorders on the part of police, courts, and corrections staff means that people with co-occurring disorders may receive few, in any, services within the justice system, or they may be forced to accept treatment that is inappropriate for their needs. And without appropriate treatment, the individual's symptoms may worsen. To address these issues, the GAINS Center will help localities design, implement, and operate integrated systems of services for the treatment and management of individuals in the justice system.

These sanctions are apparently the most drastic penalties ever imposed by a state against a managed behavioral health care company. The investigation was conducted by the Rhode Island Department of Health after numerous complaints were filed by consumers, family members, and advocates about the practices of United Behavioral Systems (UBS), a subsidiary corporation of United Health Plans of New England. These complaints specifically articulated concerns about arbitrary restrictions imposed on inpatient and outpatient care and treatment for severe brain disorders such as schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, and major depression as well as other mental health and substance abuse disorders. Upon completion of its investigation, the Department of Health issued a lengthy report detailing improper practices and recommending revocation of UBS' right to operate in the state. According to the Providence Journal, the report cited numerous deficiencies and improper practices by UBS, including denial of medically necessary treatment based on inadequate information, bonus payments to UBS' medical and executive directors for denying care, decisions to deny care by non-physicians, withholding of information about appeals procedures from patients whose requests for care were denied, and inconsistent application of "medical necessity" criteria. Many of these practices were direct violations of state law. Consumers, family members, and advocates praised the report, stating that it highlighted UBS' practice of erecting bureaucratic roadblocks for vulnerable individuals with critical treatment needs and thereby discouraging all but the most assertive individuals from pursuing their rights under their health insurance policies. The health department's investigation was conducted under the authority of a state law regulating utilization review practices in Rhode Island. That law requires the certification of all companies and agents conducting utilization review in Rhode Island and sets forth certain requirements for certification. The law also authorizes the health department to impose sanctions, including monetary penalties and revocation of certification, for failure to comply with the standards in the statute and implementing regulations. In July 1995, UBS entered into a consent agreement with the Department of Health. Under the terms of this agreement, UBS may continue to provide services in Rhode Island on a one-year, probationary basis. In return, UBS agreed to pay $100,000 in fines to the health department, $50,000 of which has gone into a study to ascertain "best practices" for providing managed mental health and substance abuse services. Additionally, UBS agreed to terminate the contracts of their medical and executive directors. According to Bill Emmet, executive director of the AMI of Rhode Island, the investigation and resulting sanctions have facilitated more cooperative, patient-oriented attitudes on the part of UBS. However, Emmet is quick to note that the rest of the managed care industry in the state has not necessarily gotten the message. "UBS seems to understand that it needs to be accountable to the consumers it serves. However, this is not necessarily true for the entire managed care industry in Rhode Island." Following issuance of its report, the health department held public hearings on managed mental health and substance abuse care in Rhode Island with the intent to ascertain how best to regulate this industry. Most of the speakers at this hearing were consumers, family members, and treatment providers. According to the Providence Journal, treatment providers have "shied away" from criticizing insurance companies. However, the health department's report and recommended penalties encouraged many of these providers to come forward and articulate their concerns about managed care practices. Interestingly, a number of speakers at the hearing expressed their belief that a 1994 law that requires coverage of severe brain disorders in health insurance policies equal to that of other physical disorders prohibits utilization review practices by managed care providers that single out people with severe brain disorders for discriminatory or inequitable treatment. According to Bill Emmet, this highlights the value of insurance parity laws as anti-discrimination measures. "It is now evident to most people in this state that the managed care companies have indeed treated people with mental illnesses unfairly, and as they look for ways to rectify that situation, many are citing the parity law." (See article on New Hampshire and Rhode Island parity bills in the July/August 1994 Advocate.) The sanctions imposed on UBS in Rhode Island illustrate the importance of laws that regulate the way managed care companies conduct their activities. According to the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project, a number of states have enacted laws regulating certain aspects of managed care practices during the past few years. For example, in 1995 at least three states--Maryland, Arizona, and Indiana--enacted laws regulating utilization review practices. These were added to similar laws passed in four states--Kansas, Vermont, Maine, and California--in 1994. The 1994 Vermont law was enacted specifically to address mental health services in managed care plans. Additionally, legislation addressing protections for patients in managed care plans was considered in twenty states in 1995 and enacted in two of these states, New Hampshire and Maryland. These laws, modeled after legislation developed by the American Medical Association, address issues such as certification requirements for managed care plans, managed care standards, notification and appeals procedures, and other aspects of patient rights. A patient protection act was also passed in 1995 by the Texas legislature, but was subsequently vetoed by Governor George Bush, Jr. CONTACT | MEMBERSHIP | WEBMASTER Copyright © 1996 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill - All Rights ReservedWT02-B26-17IA008-000085-B047-153http://www.nami.org:80/update/poster.html 38.250.129.71 19970222102759 text/html 4000HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 10:26:17 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Anti-stigma Poster Makes A Difference NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Anti-stigma Poster Makes A Difference by Stephanie Naso, NAMI intern The stigma surrounding people with brain disorders is painful and frustrating and all too evident in our daily lives. NAMI and other advocacy organizations constantly struggle to end the shame felt by those of us who have brain disorders. One of NAMI's most popular stigma-busting tools is our "People with Mental Illness Enrich Our Lives" poster, which features names of famous artists and academia who have had brain disorders and have also made an impression on all of our lives. Mitch Vesaas is the director of Tellurian/UCAN, an agency in Dane County, Wisconsin, that serves people who have brain disorders and problems with substance abuse and are oftentimes homeless. He said that last year Tellurian bought several of NAMI's "People with Mental Illness Enrich Our Lives" posters and hung them throughout their group homes and shelters with the hope that residents would appreciate the message that they are not alone in their struggle and their brain disorder does not diminish their self-worth. Within days, the names on the posters began to grow. The residents had signed their own names to the list of famous people with brain disorders who have contributed to our society. They, too, have something valuable to offer and wanted it to be recognized. Tellurian not only framed the posters with the additional names, but arranged to have a billboard with a new, added-names poster and local AMI information erected in Madison, Wisconsin, during Mental Illness Awareness Week. NAMI was thrilled to learn about this positive action in our struggle against discrimination. Stories like this one encourage us all to keep fighting for the rights of people with brain disorders.

"This initiative is an historic attempt to end the stigma that has plagued our families and loved ones for centuries," said NAMI President Rona Purdy. "We are letting the world know that it is not acceptable to discriminate against us anymore!" NAMI Board Member Fred Frese of Ohio addressed the media with his family to tell the world what it is like to experience neurological brain disorders. Dr. Rex Cowdry, acting director of the National Institute of Mental Health, provided the medical and scientific data supporting mental illnesses as treatable brain disorders. NAMI's campaign will work with the grassroots membership to tell the public that mental illnesses are brain disorders. Year-one efforts will confront discrimination against people with these illnesses--illnesses just like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease--in health care, reimbursement programs, employment practices, education, and housing. "I am delighted at the success of the press conference in terms of both the tremendous interest we generated and in the apparent societal readiness to receive our very important message--which we will continue to send throughout our entire campaign," said NAMI Executive Director Laurie Flynn.

This legislation affects both those currently receiving benefits and those applying for them. The new law applies to people whose "drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to their disability." Those who qualify for SSDI or SSI benefits based on another disability will retain their eligibility. This legislation applies immediately to any new or pending benefits claims, and individuals currently receiving disability benefits based on DAA will have their benefits terminated on January 1, 1997. Those now receiving benefits that will terminate because of the new DAA provisions will be notified; however, they may reapply to determine whether they have another disabling impairment that would make them eligible to receive SSDI or SSI benefits. Individuals will also be able to appeal ineligibility determinations or termination of benefits. The new law also requires those who are receiving SSDI or SSI benefits due to another disabling impairment and who also have a DAA condition and cannot manage their own benefits to have a representative payee. Presumably, individuals who do not identify a representative payee will be assigned one. A representative payee may be a nonprofit social service agency, a governmental social service agency or public guardian, a family member, or other interested person. Additionally, all SSI and SSDI beneficiaries with DAA conditions will be referred to a state drug and alcoholism agency for treatment. P.L.104-121 was driven by both cost containment and policy concerns. From a policy perspective, it is the stated belief of Congress that providing SSDI and SSI benefits to alcoholics and/or drug addicts "fails to serve the interests of addicts and alcoholics, many of whom use their disability checks to purchase drugs and alcohol." This may be true; however, NAMI is concerned that the new law could easily be misapplied to individuals dually diagnosed with severe mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders. The prevalence of co-occurring substance abuse disorders among people with severe mental illnesses is quite high. In fact, it is estimated that substance abuse disorders among young people with severe mental illnesses may exceed 50 percent, and the rates may be even higher among people who are homeless and severely mentally ill or who are not linked up with treatment. Consumers with dual diagnoses who are currently SSDI or SSI recipients or applicants for these benefits should obtain documentation from their psychiatrist or physician that states that they are disabled due to severe mental illness. This letter should clearly confirm that mental illness is the contributing factor to disability and that, without SSI or SSDI benefits, essential psychiatric care may not be available.

As is being widely reported in the press, the plan is designed to eliminate the federal budget deficit by 2002, offer targeted tax cuts and a reduction of $100 billion from the future growth of Medicare. The President's budget contains a range of policy proposals of importance to people with serious brain disorders. It also includes a range of proposed budget cuts and increases in critical programs of concern to NAMI. Included below is a program-by-program analysis of the budget plan. NIMH For FY 1998, The Administration is proposing an overall NIH budget of $13.1 billion, an increase of $337 million (2.6 percent) over this year. $271 million of this increase is directed toward research project grants ($1.5 billion of which is earmarked for AIDS research), with $90 million directed toward the second phase of construction of the new Clinical Research Center. The Administration is proposing $630 million for NIMH, a $26 million increase over FY 1997 (a 4% increase). This about average for the increases proposed for NIH's 13 institutes. The Administration is requesting a 9% increase for NIDA, but only 3% increases for the Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Heart, Lung and Blood and Cancer Institutes. However, these proposed increases are far below the increases that key congressional leaders such as Rep. John Edward Porter (R-IL) and Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) have pledged to push for. Senator Specter intends to increase NIH by 7.5% in FY 1998 and Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) has introduced a resolution to double NIH's budget over the next 5 years. The Administration's budget does not contain any substantive proposals relating to NIH's mission or its pending authorization bill. Medicaid The President's budget contains a proposal to trim future Medicaid spending by $22 billion through imposition of a "per capita cap" on federal spending and reform of the Disproportionate Share (DSH) program. These savings are partially offset by changes to the current welfare reform initiative (including protecting eligibility for children and legal immigrants) which cost $13 billion. This results in a net savings of $9 billion between 1998 and 2002. Overall, the federal share of Medicaid is projected to be $104 billion in FY 1998. This follows the current trend of slowing in program growth over the past few years - down to a 3.5% growth rate in 1996, from double digit growth in the late 80's and early 90's. This recent slow down in growth rates has largely accomplished the cuts that Congress and the President considered as part of deficit reduction plans considered in 1995 and 1996. Per Capita Cap Proposal - The per capita cap plan would place strict state-by-state limits on federal Medicaid spending. Each state's per capita cap would be set on the basis of a complicated assessment of current Medicaid spending. States would be responsible for any spending beyond the federally capped contribution. As such, the proposal's main purpose is simply to set an outer limit on federal spending. In order to help states cope with impact of fewer federal dollars going into their Medicaid programs, the budget proposes several important programmatic changes. Under the Administration's proposal, states would no longer have to seek federal approval, through the Section 1115 waiver process, in order to require beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans. Repeal of the Section 1115 waiver process would eliminate what little federal oversight that has been exercised over the Medicaid managed care "behavioral health carve outs" that people with serious brain disorders are joining in increasing numbers. This process would accelerate in increasing numbers if states were allowed to compel participation as the Administration is requesting. President Clinton is also seeking repeal of the Boren Amendment - the provision in current law that requires Medicaid to pay providers at comparable rates to the private market. The prospects for the per capita cap plan in Congress are dim. On a bipartisan basis, the nation's governors have expressed strong opposition to the proposal. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) has also made clear his misgivings. In addition, regional disparities in health care spending are likely to crease huge difficulties for Congress in trying to determine the basis for each state's cap level, thereby making interstate disputes over funding nearly impossible to resolve. Medicaid Expansions - As noted above, the per capita cap and DSH reforms would save the federal government $22 billion over 6 years. This is offset by $13 billion in increased Medicaid spending in several important areas. First, the Administration is proposing to protect Medicaid eligibility for legal immigrants and children who are set to lose eligibility for SSI benefits under the welfare reform law signed into law last summer (P.L. 104-193). The cost for protecting SSI Children losing cash benefits is projected to be $300 million over 6 years. A relatively small total since 85,000 of the 135,000 children likely to be cut off would retain Medicaid eligibility on the basis of their family's low-income status. A more detailed analysis of the just released Childrens' SSI changes is available on the NAMI Net. Continuing eligibility for legal aliens is more costly since the welfare law gave states tremendous leeway on whether to grant eligibility for persons entering the U.S. after enactment of the welfare bill. Of critical importance to NAMI is a proposal to allow states to establish an income related premium "buy-in" for people with disabilities who leave the SSI rolls for employment. It would allow SSI beneficiaries who earn more than certain (yet to be specified) amounts to purchase Medicaid coverage by paying a premium that states would set on an income related scale. This proposal is part of a Social Security "return to work" plan which is referenced below. The other major Medicaid expansion relates to the President's Childrens' Health Care initiative detailed below. Childrens' Health Both the Administration and Congress are interested in expanding access to health coverage for low-income children of working families. It is estimated that 80% of the 10 million uninsured children have at least 1 parent in the workforce. These workers either do not have employer provided coverage or are offered "individual only" policies in the workplace. There are 3 parts to the Administration's "Kiddie Care" plan: a) children of workers between jobs (coverage financed by annual state grants to cover premium costs for up to 6 months), b) children whose parents earn too much for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health insurance (coverage financed through discretionary grants to the states for innovative programs), and c) children eligible for Medicaid, but not currently enrolled (1-year of extended coverage for children only in cases where parents are at risk of losing coverage because of higher earnings or other change in circumstances). This latter category also includes the so-called "Waxman Kids", i.e. children ages 13-18 who were to be phased in over the next 5 years. Neither the Clinton proposal for expanding coverage for uninsured children, or the current congressional alternatives, specify the scope of benefits that private health plans would be required to make available to eligible children. Thus, there is currently no requirement in the proposal for mental illness parity for children with brain disorders. HUD The Clinton Administration is proposing $24.753 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development for FY 1998. This is a $5.5 billion increase over current year levels, with most of the increase going to renewal of expiring Section 8 rental contracts, expansion of tenant-based rental assistance for welfare recipients who are required to work and replacement of the most troubled public housing projects. It is highly unlikely that Congress would support efforts to increase HUD's budget in FY 1998. In fact, HUD programs are likely to be squeezed further this year as Congress struggles to find the funds necessary to deal with Section 8 renewals and expiring 30-year rental contracts and federally insured mortgages, all while avoiding cuts to politically popular programs such as CDBG and HOME. For housing programs serving people with brain disorders, the Administration is proposing substantial cuts. The Section 811 program is slated for a $20 million cut, down from its current total of $194 million to $174 million. This continues the current downward trend in funding for Section 811, which was funded at $233 million just two years ago. Likewise, the Section 202 program (which serves the elderly) is slated for an even larger cut of $345 million - a cut of more than 50%. The Administration is proposing no funding for tenant-based rental assistance for non-elderly people with disabilities (including individuals with serious brain disorders). For the current year, Congress appropriated $50 million for "non-elderly disabled" who are adversely impacted by designation of public and assisted housing as "elderly only." This means that for the first time in several years, HUD is not proposing any new resources to deal with the emerging housing crisis facing non-elderly people with disabilities as they are deemed ineligible for a growing share of public and assisted housing. The one bright spot in the budget proposal is a $9 million increase for fair housing enforcement (up to $39 million). Social Security For the coming year, Social Security will be largest (and fastest growing) federal program, up to $414 billion in FY 1998. This includes $25.4 billion for the SSI program (for more than 5 million eligible recipients) and $36 billion for SSDI benefits (for 4.5 million eligible recipients). The budget also includes more than $70 million in payments to state VR agencies for rehabilitation services for beneficiaries (covering services for only 6,000 people). The President's budget includes a "Ticket To Independence" proposal designed to promote work among beneficiaries and help move people off the disability rolls. Currently, less than 1% of beneficiaries leave the rolls. This despite the fact that many beneficiaries, including people with serious brain disorders, want to work. "Ticket To Independence" Plan - Specifically, the "Ticket To Independence" proposal includes a pilot in 5 to 10 states. It would allow people with disabilities to use their "ticket" with any participating public or private employment or rehabilitation provider of their choice (thus eroding the current state VR monopoly). Providers would be paid only when clients are placed in jobs and are removed from the disability rolls. A new demonstration program would allow eligible SSDI beneficiaries to extend Medicare coverage beyond the current trial work period once earnings surpass substantial gainful activity (SGA). States would be allowed to extend Medicaid coverage for SSI beneficiaries beyond current limits that wipe out eligibility once SGA is achieved. While the Clinton Administration's proposal has not been fully fleshed out, there are several important qualifications. SSA cannot move forward without congressional authorization. Also, for SSI beneficiaries, there is nothing that would allow the federal government to compel states to extend Medicaid coverage for beneficiaries whose earnings are above SGA. From NAMI's perspective, the proposal appears to fall short of the recommendations in the recently released report on the state VR system. First, it does not include protections that would allow people with brain disorders to maintain an "open file" that would protect eligibility after achieving SGA and losing cash benefits (such an approach would respond to the episodic nature of severe mental illness by allowing people to have cash benefits quickly restored). Second, by paying providers only for clients who reach the current definition of SGA, the Administration's plan discourages providers from serving people with the most severe illnesses and conditions. Finally, nothing in the proposal requires providers to offer long-term supports and services for clients after they have been successfully placed in jobs. SSI Benefits for Legal Immigrants - The Clinton budget proposes to restore SSI eligibility for legal immigrants and refugees who were to be cut off later this year under the welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). Provisions in the welfare law were designed to deny SSI benefits to 500,000 legal aliens, producing a savings of $2.2 billion in FY 1998. It is interesting to note that unlike recent changes to the SSI program aimed at persons with substance abuse disorders and children, the legal immigrant changes apply regardless of the severity of the individual's illness or impairment. Specifically, the proposal would a) protect all immigrants who become disabled after entry into the U.S. and b) repeal a requirement in the law for "deeming" of sponsors' income in determining SSI eligibility and c) remove the mandate for sponsors to reimburse the government for SSI benefits that immigrants receive. However, these new exceptions would not apply if an immigrant was "disabled" prior to entering the U.S. The Administration's proposal also extends for two years SSI eligibility for certain refugees and asylees who are currently in the citizenship application pipeline. These changes are estimated to cost $9.9 billion over the next 6 years. Because of this high cost and resistance on the part of GOP leaders to opening up in the welfare reform law to changes, passage of the proposal is considered remote. Thus, legal immigrants with brain disorders and their families should continue moving forward with their naturalization and citizenship applications. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is now moving to expedite applications. The INS also recently put in place new regulations designed to provide exceptions to the naturalization exam and oath requirements for persons with severe mental illness. SAMHSA - For FY 1998, the Administration is proposing $2.2 billion for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This is a $35 million increase over what Congress appropriated for the current fiscal year. All of this increase is directed toward the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) -- $10 million for the Substance Abuse Block Grant and $28 million for data collection (substance abuse prevention is slated for a $5 million cut). The Administration is proposing to freeze all programs under the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS): $275.4 million for the Mental Health Block Grant, $58 million for consolidated mental health demonstration grants (known as "Knowledge Development and Application" or KDAs), $70 million for the Childrens' Mental Health program, $20 million for PATH and $22 for PAIMI.

By Daniel J. kevles Out of the Shadows Confronting America's Mental Illness Crisis. By E. Fuller Torrey. 244 pp. New York: John Wiley & Sons. $27.95 In New York City, the bag lady roams the streets scavenging in trash cans while she talks with the President of the United States.One day she is found raped and stabbed to death. In a hospital emergency room, a man with symptoms of acute manic depression rejectsthe advice of the resident and the urgings of his family and walks out. Several hours later, he hangs himself. A woman with a history of schizophrenia walks into a shopping mall and shoots at everyone in sight, killing three. What these tales have in common is that severely mentallyill people declined treatment and that no one could force them to be hospitalized or take medication. In "Out of the Shadows," E. Fuller Torrey compiles these cases and many more like them into a powerful indictment of how we treat people suffering from acute mental disease. A psychiatrist specializing in schizophrenia, he draws on years of experience working in a public psychiatric hospital in Washington and at a clinic for the homeless who are mentally ill. His new book is written with a passionate combativeness that borders on polemic, but thecrisis he delineates should stir any halfway sensitive human being to anger. Today, in the United States, some five and a half million people over the age of 9 are estimated to suffer from severe mental illness,almost half of them enduring without treatment. The proportion, once large, of such people kept in state psychiatric hospitals hasfallen drastically, the result of a 40-year movement known as "deinstitutionalization." Nowadays, many mentally ill Americans are in nursing homesthat can provide custodial attention but little else. Roughly 159,000 of the untreated acutely ill are in prison, mostly for minor crimeslike shoplifting; another 150,000 of them are homeless, and they make up about one-third of those outcasts of our affluence. Dr. Torrey attributes the horrific situation to three causes. First, income security and disability programs like Medicaid fostereddeinstitutionalization -- far more of it, he argues, than did the advent of antipsychotic drugs like Thorazine -- because they encouraged state authorities to shift patients into programs like nursing home care that the Federal Government pays for. Second, civil liberties lawyers fought successfully against involuntary commitment. For exceptions to be made in cases wherepeople are a danger to themselves or society, Dr. Torrey notes, you either have to try to kill the judge or attempt suicide beforethe bench. Third, American culture has come to define severe mental illness as just one point on a broad spectrum of"mental health" problems that run from mild neurosis to manic depression, the product of environmental stresses of a Freudian or socioeconomic nature. Dr. Torrey insists that severe mental illnesses are measurable neurobiological disorders and in most cases are treatablewith drugs. He quotes the psychiatrist Darold Treffert in arguing against civil libertarian dogmatism: "The liberty to benaked in a padded cell in a county jail, hallucinating and tormented, without treatment that ought to be given is not liberty; it is another form of imprisonment -- imprisonment for the crime of being ill." Dr. Torrey urges that the criteria for involuntarycommitment should include the need for treatment. And he advocates consolidating responsibilities for the mentally illat the state level, to reduce the practice of shifting costs. But Dr. Torrey neglects to peer behind his premises. Although we know more every day about the correlation ofbiology and mental illness, it is not always clear what is cause and what is effect. Then, too, commitment based on need fortreatment could invite abuse, especially if hearsay evidence is allowed, a position that Dr. Torrey seems to endorse. And the record of psychiatric hospitals falls somewhat short of ideal. Like all polemics, "Out of the Shadows" should be read with caution, but its analyses deserves attention. Daniel J. Kevles is the author of "In the Name of Eugenics" and other works on issues in science, medicine, and society.

NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Risperidone for bipolar disorder? Risperidone (Risperdal) may be an effective treatment for bipolar disorder, according to a McLean Hospital study reported by Psychopharmacology Update (PU) (September 1996). The study involved 15 persons with acute mania with psychotic features who did not respond well to traditional therapy. "Of the 13 patients who completed two weeks of risperidone treatment, eight had a 50 percent improvement in scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, with all the patients having at least a 25 percent improvement," reported PU, which added that "In addition to the improvement noted in all patients using risperidone, researchers emphasized that the medication was well-tolerated and that no patient worsened under the treatment."

Attendees will have the opportunity to network and share resources with members from other states and to sharpen organizational, technical, and leadership skills. Every AMI in each region (see below) will receive a registration packet with additional information. The dates and locations for the upcoming Regional Leadership Conferences are listed below. Please mark your calendars for the site nearest you. If you have any questions or would like more information about the program agenda, you may contact Jennifer Nevins, NAMI Regional Meetings Coordinator, at (703) 516-7967.

July 9, 1997 - Albuquerque Pre-Conference Program. The Phonetree AMI of Wisconsin uses a Phonetree to reach more than 200 members of the Advocacy Network in less than a day. Unlike a typical phone tree, AMI-WI's system doesn't rely on dozens of volunteers to be home to get the word out. The Phonetree (with a capital "P") is an automated voice mail broadcast system. This piece of electronic equipment is no larger than a conventional answering machine, yet it is very powerful. It can be programmed to contact ten groups of people with up to 500 people in each group. When the phone is answered, the Phonetree broadcasts a pre-recorded message of up to three minutes. If it is picked up by an answering machine, the recipient can play it back as often as needed to get all the details. If the phone is answered in person, the individual can press a key to have the message repeated. When the phone is not answered at all or is busy, the Phonetree makes note of that and periodically retries that number until it gets through. The machine costs approximately $500 and pays for itself pretty quickly because it saves so much staff time, copying, and postage.

Both have lost some functioning in a portion of the brain--one's loss affects motor control and the other's loss affects control of thoughts and emotions. Both take medications to relieve their symptoms. Neither disorder is curable, nor are the causes of either's disorder completely known. Both see specialists for their treatment, both need supports to make it possible for them to live at home, and both work at recovery and at learning to live with and surmount their disorders. One has Parkinson's, and the other has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Try to imagine a world in which these disorders have the same public acceptance and equality in insurance, treatment and recovery options, job training and opportunities, and housing. Distance yourself just once from the "mental illness" mindset and envision a world in which our disorders are brain disorders, in which the steps are diagnosis, treatment, supports, and then getting on with life. Picture not being stuck forever in the mental illness quagmire. Some would say this is an impossible dream, that the term brain disorder doesn't sound serious enough, and that we must cling to the word mental because somehow our disorders are different. Our membership was divided 50-50 in the vote on this subject at the recent NAMI annual convention. Neither Parkinson's nor schizophrenia is fully characterized by the term brain disorder, for their impact on lives goes far beyond that. Neither my sister with schizophrenia nor my mother with Parkinson's is completely described by the term person with a brain disorder. Yet why should it be more acceptable to call Parkinson's a brain disorder and not schizophrenia? To insist that schizophrenia is mental, psychiatric, or behavioral is equivalent to calling Parkinson's a motor control, a stiff-limbs, or a trembling disorder. Because of the discriminations we have experienced, the need for protected funding for mental illness has been important. In a short time we have seen that eroded as managed care has taken over. We will likely see more erosion as block grants are deemed the solution to necessary budget cuts. Mental illness is being mainstreamed, whether we like it or not. Which is more likely to be understood by our legislators as they make the difficult decisions? Mental illness, which becomes confused with mental health and gets written off as too expensive? Or brain disorders, which forces them to recognize the discrimination they are perpetuating if they do not support our efforts? I often compare my family's reaction when my sister was diagnosed with the reaction to my mother's diagnosis. In my sister's case we felt the emotional equivalent of an atomic bomb and wandered like its victims through the rubble of our lives. We were dismayed to learn of my mother's diagnosis, but we knew so much more about what to expect. And the stigma was non-existent. I envision a day when the impact on a family of a mental illness diagnosis is no different from that of all other brain disorders; when the professionals treating these disorders are not viewed differently; when the treatment and recovery supports for these disorders have parity. One step toward this vision--Open your mind: mental illnesses are brain disorders.

Owen, Ph.D. Review by William Zaccagnino, Froma Lippman, and Marianne Thomas I Can See Tomorrow--A Guide For Living with Depression by Patricia L. Owen, Ph.D., is a very complete book on depression with informative addenda that include resources and agencies throughout the nation to help people with depression and bipolar disorder. Dr. Owen has provided a helpful guide for those who recognize or suspect that they have depression. From the start, readers who may only suspect they have depression can hold themselves up against the measures of the types and symptoms of depression to make that first judgment about obtaining appropriate treatment, whether that is medications, psychotherapy, or both. The book is especially valuable for those who also are recovering alcoholics or substance abusers. Dr. Owen offers an assortment of information about the defining features of depression, the causes of depression, therapy, medications, relationships with family, and the spiritual dimensions of this disorder. Each of her chapters discusses a topic and includes questions readers may ask about themselves relative to the topic and what they may do to help themselves. Because stigma still surrounds depression as it does other psychiatric disorders, Dr. Owen's discussions about common misperceptions and myths may be particularly helpful. This information can be central to readers' accepting their depression, the causes of depression, selecting a psychotherapist, accepting the need for using an antidepressant, and finding a comfortable position in the family, with friends, and in organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous. The battle against depression is formidable, but the barrier of stigma significantly magnifies it. Owen also has complied an appendix listing some of the common antidepressants. She includes information about how the medications work, side effects, dosages, and specific pointers for recovering alcoholics and substance abusers. Dr. Owen comments on the theoretical nature of chemical imbalance as a cause of brain disorders and on persons with depression having the right to contribute to treatment decisions about their own care. The reviewers believe, however, that putting too much emphasis on the empowerment of the person as opposed to the value of the medication may lead to some depressed persons deciding against needed medication, temporarily or permanently, because of their depressed mood. They may act out of simple dislike of taking medications rather than out of clear thinking about the therapeutic value of the prescribed drug. Overall, Dr. Owen provides valuable information about depression and offers individuals and their families or significant others support and hope for future recovery and relief from illness.

It's Nobody's Fault: New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents by Harold Koplewicz Reviewed by Harriet Bladwin, NAMI Literature Committee, and Brenda Souto and Dee Mukherjee, NAMI staff It's Nobody's Fault could not have been written 25 years ago. It reflects the monumental change that has taken place in understanding all mental illnesses--that they are brain disorders, disturbances in brain chemistry, and nobody's fault. This work deals with serious brain disorders in children and adolescents. Its author is an experienced clinician, Chief of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Koplewicz is upbeat, authoritative, and empowering. And his book is interesting and readable. It's Nobody's Fault has three parts. "Living with a Child's Brain Disorder" sets out Dr. Koplewicz's general views: that parents don't cause serious mental disorders, but they are responsible for getting their ill children into treatment. "DNA Roulette and the Role of Medication" explains the role of genetics in brain disorders in children and adolescents, the ways in which those disorders affect brain chemistry, and the role of medications in treatment. "No-Fault Brain Disorders" discusses 13 specific disorders commonly found in children and adolescents--symptoms, diagnosis, brain chemistry, treatment, and parenting. There are three appendices. The first reviews technical terms used in the book; the second lists organizations that provide educational and support services; and the last consists of charts that summarize the medications (by brand and generic names) used in treating the discussed disorders as well as their possible side effects. Koplewicz is "must reading" for parents who feel guilt and remorse about the brain disorder of a child. The author emphasizes that child and adolescent disorders are the result of genetic predispositions and that medications, often offered with psychotherapy, sometimes transform lives and usually make disorders more manageable. This is one book every NAMI family will wish it had discovered when a child first showed symptoms of abnormality. It belongs in every affiliate library and every public library. Many NAMI families report that the professionals they meet often deny that prepubertal children can have serious brain disorders. Such families face not only stigma, lack of services, and inappropriate education settings, but they also face great difficulty in finding professionals who are in touch with current research and treatment practice. Furthermore, they are perplexed by misinformation about using medications in treating childhood-onset brain disorders. For such families, It's Nobody's Fault will bring refreshing good news. The only shortcoming of It's Nobody's Fault is that the chapters about specific disorders are necessarily brief. Suggestions about supplementary reading would have been a welcome addition. NAMI readers are encouraged to consult the new NAMI's Young Family Reading List for further reading. (For a copy, call Brenda Souto at 70/524-7600.) NAMI RDS No. 015.

The may be due to MTH's reputation for high abuse liability. In a recent issue of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, Dr. Paul Wender states that MTH "in clinical treatment of children is neither renegade nor experimental, and it should not be considered controversial."

NEW STUDY ON BIPOLAR DISORDER [Return to Top] A new treatment-outcome and research network dedicated to the study of manic-depressive illness, the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network, includes national and international researchers and expert clinicians working in close association with NAMI and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association (NDMDA). These groups will work together to assess the efficacy of existing treatments for bipolar disorder and the development of new therapeutic agents. Participating research centers will recruit and treat patients with bipolar illness using standard protocols and assessments within randomized clinical trials. "The mission of the bipolar network is to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of bipolar illness, its cause or causes, and its treatments with the goals of establishing optimal treatment strategies," said Robert Post, M.D., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Branch of NIMH. More information about this network is available in Bipolar Network News (BNN), a newsletter about the latest bipolar-disorder findings for patients and clinicians.

NONCOMPLIANCE AND SCHIZOPHRENIA [Return to Top] While many advances have been made in treating schizophrenia, much of the improvement has been rendered virtually meaningless in actual practice because of the persistently large percentage of patients who fail to take their medication, a researcher says. As estimated 74 percent of outpatients with schizophrenia stop taking neuroleptics--or anti-psychotic drugs--within two years of leaving a hospital or program, Peter Weiden told the American Medical Association's (AMA) 13th Annual Science Reporters Conference in Seattle in November. Weiden, director of the schizophrenia program at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and assistant clinical professor at Columbia University, said the 74 percent estimate is likely low because it does not take into account persons with schizophrenia who refuse treatment or drift from one place to another. Non-compliance is different in people suffering from schizophrenia than in those with other chronic problems (such as diabetes) who "eventually figure out they need medicine," Weiden said. It has been shown that persons with schizophrenia have the type of brain disorder that makes it difficult for them to learn from experience. "One of the symptoms of their illness is they don't know they're sick," according to Weiden. Non-compliance accounts for at least 40 percent of all episodes of schizophrenic relapse and subsequent rehospitalization, Weiden says, and the relapses suffered by persons off their medication are often more severe and difficult to treat. Resources devoted to developing new drugs should be coupled with research on why patients stop taking their medication. "The difference between being on treatment and off treatment magnifies as drugs get better," Weiden told his audience. Research into the non-compliance problem is "virtually non-existent," he said. For more information, contact the AMA's Science News Department at 312/464-5374. OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER [Return to Top] -- A woman visits her dermatologist, complaining of extremely dryskin and seldom feeling clean. She showers for two hours everyday. -- A lawyer insists on making coffee several times each day. Hiscolleagues do not realize that he lives in fear that the coffeewill be poisoned, and he feels compelled to pour most of it downthe drain. The lawyer is so obsessed with these thoughts that hespends 12 hours a day at work -- four of them worrying aboutcontaminated coffee. -- A man cannot bear to throw anything away. Junk mail, oldnewspapers, empty milk cartons all "could contain somethingvaluable that might be useful some day." If he throws thingsaway, "something terrible will happen." He hoards so much clutterthat he can no longer walk through his house. Insisting thatnothing be thrown away, he moves to another house where hecontinues to hoard. These people suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. TheNational Institute of Mental Health estimates that more than 2percent of the U.S. population, or nearly one out of every 40people, will suffer from OCD at some point in their lives. Thedisorder is two or three times more common than schizophrenia andmanic depressive illness. What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder? Obsessions are intrusive, irrational thoughts--un wanted ideas orimpulses that repeatedly well up in the victim's mind. Again andagain, the person experiences disturbing thoughts, such as "Myhands must be contaminated; I must wash them"; "I may have leftthe gas stove on"; or "I am going to injure my child." On onelevel, the sufferer knows these obsessive thoughts areirrational. But on another level, he/she fears these thoughtsmight be true. Trying to avoid such thoughts creates greatanxiety. Compulsions are repetitive rituals such as hand washing,counting, checking, hoarding, or arranging. An individual repeatsthese actions, perhaps feeling momentary relief but withoutfeeling satisfaction or a sense of completion. OCD victims feelthey must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad willhappen. Most people at one time or another experience obsessive thoughtsor compulsive behaviors. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder occurswhen an individual experiences obsessions and compulsions formore than an hour each day, in a way that interferes with his/herlife. OCD is often described as "a disease of doubt." Sufferersexperience "pathological doubt," unable to distinguish betweenwhat is possible, what is probable, and what is unlikely tohappen. Who gets OCD? People of all ages and from all walks of life can get OCD. Itstrikes people of all ethic groups, and both males and females.Symptoms typically begin during the teenage years or youngadulthood. What causes OCD? The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that OCDresults from a chemical imbalance in the brain For years, mentalhealth professionals assumed OCD resulted from bad parenting orpersonality defects. This theory has been disproven over the last 20 years. OCDsymptoms have not been relieved by psychoanalysis or other formsof "talk therapy". OCD patients can often articulate insight into "why" they haveobsessive thoughts or why they behave compulsively. But thethoughts and the behavior continue. People whose brains are injured often develop OCD, suggestingthat it's a physical condition. If a placebo is given to peoplewho are depressed or who experience panic attacks, 40 percentwill say they feel better. If a placebo is given to people who experienceobsessive-compulsive disorder, only about 2 percent say they feelbetter. This also suggests a physical condition. Brain scientists have identified the part of the brain thatcauses OCD. They have discovered a strong link between OCD and abrain chemical called serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitterthat helps nerve cells communicate. Scientists have also observed that people with OCD have increasedmetabolism in the basal ganglia and in the frontal lobes of thebrain. This, scientists believe, causes repetitive movements, rigidthinking and a lack of spontaneity. People with OCD often havehigh levels of the hormone Vasopressin. In layman's terms, something in the brain is stuck, like a brokenrecord. Judith Rapoport, MD, describes it in her book, The BoyWho Couldn't Stop Washing, as "grooming behaviors gone wild." How do people with OCD typically react to their disorder? People with OCD generally attempt to hide their problem ratherthan seek help. Often they are remarkably successful inconcealing their obsessive compulsive symptoms from friends andco-workers. An unfortunate consequence of this secrecy is that people withOCD generally do not receive professional help until years afterthe onset of their disease. By that time, obsessive-compulsivehabits may be deeply ingrained and very difficult to change. How long does OCD last? For years, even decades. The symptoms may be come less severefrom time to time, and there may be long intervals when thesymptoms are mild, but generally OCD is a chronic disease. Is age a factor in OCD? OCD usually starts at an early age, often before adolescence.Left untreated, it usually grows worse with age. It may first manifest as autism, pervasive developmentaldisorder, or Tourette's Syndrome (in which the patient feelscompelled to shout obscenities and insults at random). Or it canevolve into Tourette's Syndrome, depression and anxiety. Like depression, OCD tends to worsen with age. But scientistshope that if OCD patients are treated at an early age, theirsymptoms won't necessarily worsen as they age. What are some more examples of people who suffer from OCD? People who: -- repeatedly check things, perhaps dozens of times beforefeeling secure enough to go to sleep or to leave the house. Isthe stove off? Is the door locked? Is the alarm set? -- fear they will harm others. Example:A man's car hits a potholeon a city street and he fears it was actually a body. -- feel dirty and contaminated. Example: A women is fearful oftouching her baby because she might contaminate it. -- constantly arrange and order things. Example: A child can't goto sleep unless he lines up all his shoes correctly. -- are excessively concerned with body imperfections (who insistson numerous plastic surgeries or spend hours a daybody-building). -- are ruled by numbers, believing that certain numbers representgood and other numbers represent evil. -- are excessively concerned with sin or blasphemy. Is OCD commonly recognized by professionals? Not nearly enough. OCD is often misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed.Many people have dual diagnoses of OCD and schizophrenia, or OCDand manic-depressive illness, but the OCD component is notdiagnosed or treated. Researchers believe OCD, anxiety disorders and eating disorderslike anorexia and bulimia can be triggered by the same chemicalmal functioning of the brain. Is heredity a factor in OCD? Yes. Heredity appears to be a strong factor. If you have OCD,there's a 25 percent chance that one of your immediate familymembers will have it. It definitely seems to run in families. Can OCD be effectively treated? Yes, with medication and behavior therapy. Medication canregulate serotonin, reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsivebehavior. In the last few years, several medications have beendeveloped that relieve many of the symptoms of OCD. Three are particularly recommended as "serotonin selectors": Clomipramine (brand name: Anafranil): This medication has beenused in Europe for more than 20 years, and is now available inthe United States. There is little evidence that clomipramine hasadverse long term negative effects, particularly no increasedrate of birth-defects. But it can produce side effects: dry mouth, constipation,tiredness, fatigue, slight hand trembling, sexual dysfunction,severe weight gain. There is also the possibility of seizures inhigh dos ages. Fluoxetine (brand name: Prozac) and Sertraline (brand name:Zoloft) are viewed as effective in some OCD patients but with farfewer side-effects for most patients. Fluoxetine occasionallycauses nausea, weight loss, insomnia. Despite sensationalized re ports that fluoxetine causes violentbehavior, the drug has been examined on numerous occasions by theUS Food and Drug Administration, and is deemed safe andeffective. Sertraline is a relatively new drug that so far has shown fewerside effects than fluoxetine and is substantially cheaper. How long should an individual take medication before judging itseffectiveness? Some physicians make the mistake of prescribing it for only threeor four weeks. That really isn't long enough. Medication shouldbe tried consistently for 10 or 12 weeks before judging itseffectiveness. What is "behavior therapy" and can it effectively relievesymptoms of OCD? Behavior therapy is not traditional psychotherapy. It is"exposure and response prevention," and has been found to beeffective for many people with OCD. Patients are deliberately exposed to a feared object or idea,either directly or by imagination, and are then discouraged orprevented from carrying out the usual compulsive response. For example, a compulsive hand-washer may be urged to touch anobject believed to be contaminated, and then may be denied theopportunity to wash for several hours. When the treatment works well, the patient gradually experiencesless anxiety from the obsessive thoughts and becomes able torefrain from the compulsive actions for extended periods of time. Several studies suggest that medication and behavior therapy areequally effective in alleviating symptoms of OCD. About half thepatients improve substantially with behavior therapy; the restimprove moderately with it. If my relative with OCD refuses to take medication and won'tparticipate in behavioral therapy, are there any othertreatments? Your relative could be a candidate for brain surgery. Neurosurgeons in recent years have developed a finely-tunedprocedure with Magnetic Resonance Imaging to identify the part ofthe brain that may be involved in expressing OCD. A surgeon canmake microscopic cuts in the brain, which often lead to adecrease in OCD. Will OCD symptoms go away completely with medication and behaviortherapy? Response to treatment varies from person to person. Most peopletreated with effective medications find their symptoms arereduced by about 40 percent or 50 percent. That can often beenough to change their lives, to transform them into functioningindividuals. Some people are fortunate enough to go into total remission whentreated with effective medication and/or behavior therapy.Unfortunately, some people find neither medication nor behaviortherapy has positive effects.

Using three independent data sets--including more than 380 families in 10 countries--scientists provide evidence that a region of chromosome 6 carries a gene involved in schizophrenia. This statistically significant finding builds on a large body of evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies, showing that schizophrenia has a genetic component. It signals real scientific progress and an ever-increasing understanding of the biology of this severely disabling brain disorder. These findings, while strong, do not eradicate the complexities of schizophrenia genetics. A specific gene on chromosome 6 has not been identified. And three other studies reported in the same issue of Nature Genetics failed to detect any linkage between the region of chromosome 6 found by the other research groups and schizophrenia. In one of the studies, which positively identified chromosome 6, four other chromosomal regions were identified as well. The slow progress in the molecular genetics of schizophrenia does not reflect a lack of evidence that genes play a role in this brain disorder, but rather the complexities of schizophrenia in terms of its diagnosis, relationship to other diseases, the likely involvement of more than one gene and different genes in different families, and the undoubtable role of nongenetic factors. So, complications and complexities of schizophrenia genetics still exist. Further study will be required to reconfirm the chromosome 6 location as well as other chromosome locations involved in schizophrenia and to identity specific genes in this brain disorder. But for all of the complexities, scientists have produced the best data to date showing a linkage between a chromosome region and schizophrenia. NOTE: The "Ask the Doctor" section of the January/February issue of the Advocate will provide more information about schizophrenia genetics and gene searches.

Severe mental illnesses are biological brain diseases that cancritically interfere with a person's ability to think, feel andrelate to other people and the environment. The U.S. Congress Office of Technology and Assessment, inSeptember, reported "evidence that biological factors areinvolved in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder...otherareas of research provide evidence about correlated biologicalfactors and suggest testable hypotheses to causation." What are some of the more disabling mental illnesses? How commonare they? Schizophrenia is a brain disease that often strikes young peoplebetween the ages of 16 and 25. A debilitating thought disorder,schizophrenia causes some people to experience delusions andauditory and visual hallucinations. They cannot distinguish what is real from what is not. Specificcauses are yet unknown, but are believed to be biological,sometimes involving genetic or viral factors. Depressive disorders -- including major depression and bipolardisorder (manic-depressive illness) -- are very common and rangewidely in severity. In any given year, about 5 million Americans, or 2.8 percent ofthe adult population, suffer from severe mental illnesses. The number one reason for hospital admissions nationwide ispsychiatric disorder. At any moment, almost 21 percent of allhospital beds are filled by people with mental illness. Severe mental illnesses are more common than diabetes, cancer orheart disease. How many children and adolescents have severe mental illnesses? Children, although often misdiagnosed, suffer from the samesevere mental illnesses -- schizophrenia, depressive disorders,OCD and panic disorder -- as adults do. In any given year, 3.2 percent of children and adolescentsbetween the ages of 9 and 17 are diagnosed with a severe mentalillness. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is a commonbehavioral disorder which affects 3-5 percent of the nation'syouth under 13. A conservative estimate is that a total of 12 percent or 7.5million of the country's 63 million youths under age 18 havemental, behavioral or developmental disorders. Only about a fifth of the 7.5 million children and adolescentswho need mental health treatment receive it. What are the costs of severe mental illness? In 1990, mental illnesses cost the nation an estimated $74billion, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Treating severe mental illnesses cost the nation approximately$27 billion, including long-term nursing home care. One quarter of all Social Security Disability payments are forindividuals with severe mental illnesses. How are persons with severe mental illnesses stigmatized? People with mental illness are feared or stereotyped asdangerous, aggressive and violent. In fact, they are more likelyto be isolated, passive and withdrawn. Often they are blamed fortheir illness. They are denied opportunities to rebuild their lives in thecommunity because of discrimination in housing, employment andhealth insurance coverage. Is there hope for persons suffering from severe mental illness? Yes! Through research, scientists have made great advances inunderstanding the nature of severe mental illnesses in the lastten years. The development of sophisticated scanning deviceswhich take "pictures" of the brain bring us closer tounderstanding the role of brain structure and chemistry in thecausation of mental illness. Genetic mapping may determine other causes. Research into newtreatments have significantly improved the lives of people whonow suffer from these devastating illnesses. The treatment success rate for schizophrenia is 60 percent, 80percent for bipolar disorder and 65 percent for major depression.Comparatively, the success rate for treatments of heart diseaseranges from 41-52 percent. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is a grassrootsself-help, support and advocacy organization of families, friendsand people suffering from severe mental illnesses. Dedicated to improving the lives of people with severe,biological brain diseases, NAMI works on the national, state andlocal level through 140,000 members and 1,000 affiliates toprovide education about severe mental illnesses and to supportincreased funding for research and quality services.

Conducted by the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation, the study asked how having a OCD relative affected family life and how families coped. Respondents reported that, to cope, they relied on lectures, reading materials, and sympathetic friends and relatives. Almost 60 percent of family members used individual therapy to help deal with an OCD situation. Eighty percent of the survey respondents said that disruption of family life was a result of the disorder. Three-fourths of family members had difficulty with their OCD relative's self-involvement, and 70 percent were bothered by the relative's lack of motivation. About 63 percent were concerned about inconsiderate behavior, excessive arguing, and being drawn into ritualizing behavior by OCD relatives; and 66 percent cited OCD-related financial difficulties as a problem. Concerns of family members included dealing with the relative's lost potential; the uncertainty about what would happen to the OCD relative when the caretakers were gone; the difficulty of enjoying life while the OCD sufferer was in pain; the envy of normal families; and anger at relatives. GENE FOR MANIC DEPRESSION [Return to Top] A gene, or possibly two, that could contribute to as many as one in four cases of manic depression may be on a region of chromosome 18, according to a study of 395 members of 22 families by Wade H. Berrettini and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Manic depression or recurrent depression afflicted 167 participants in the study; in eight of the families, similar genetic variations on chromosome 18 were identified. Although this means almost two-thirds of the families had no evidence of involvement by chromosome 18, that alone would not rule out the locations: Most scientists seeking the genetic basis of manic-depressive illness agree that more than one genetic miscue probably can set the state for, or cause, the disorder. The study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (June 21), noted two genes worthy of suspicion out of the approximately 100 genes on chromosome 18. One codes for a protein that plays a specific part in chemical signal reception; the other is involved in stress hormone production, a physiological function that has been shown to go into overdrive in both depression and manic depression. --Reprinted from Brain Work: The Neuroscience Newsletter CONTACT | MEMBERSHIP | WEBMASTER Copyright © 1996 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill - All Rights ReservedWT02-B26-32IA008-000083-B005-109http://www.nami.org:80/medicat/medicat2.htm 38.250.129.71 19970222101853 text/html 17047HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 10:17:18 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Medications - Clozapine, Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial . . . NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics [Clozapine] [Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial . . .] CLOZAPINE What is Clozapine? Clozapine has attracted interest and curiosity from manyconsumers and family members. The drug was approved for thetreatment of patients with severe and persistent schizophrenia,who either have not adequately responded to, or cannot tolerate,standard antipsychotic drugs. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals manufactures and markets clozapine underthe product name Clozaril. What is new about clozapine? Clozapine has unique benefits and unique risks. The benefits makeit the first major innovation in anti-psychotic drugs since theintroduction of neuroleptics nearly thirty years ago. The systemdesigned to manage the risks associated with clozapine use makeit an innovation in treatment modalities. How long does it take patients to respond to clozapine? Often patients respond in as little as a week. Some may require amuch longer period, and many of those who do show the greatestimprovement. About six months is a good trial period. Once apatient responds, he/she may continue to improve for up to ayear. What are the benefits? The benefits of clozapine are its superior effectiveness and itsunique side effects profile. It treats the positive symptoms ofschizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, blunted affect,and hostility better than any other drug. It is also the first drug which effectively treats the negativesymptoms -- apathy, withdrawal, blunted emotional response, andanxiety. It accomplishes this with 30 to 60 percent of the patients whowere previously considered refractory, that is patients who wereunresponsive to standard antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine has virtually no incidence of the muscle spasms,cramps, and posturing movements common to neuroleptic drugs, andminimal incidence of the less serious neurological side effectssuch as restlessness, muscle rigidity, and tremor. Nor has thereever been a case of tardive dyskinesia associated with clozapine. What is tardive dyskinesia? Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disfiguring side effect which ischaracterized by involuntary movements such as grimacing, suckingand smacking of lips, and spasmodic movements of the extremities. For every year that a group of patients is on neuroleptic drugs,four to five percent develop TD (20-25 percent, for example,after five years). In the past, tardive dyskinesia was thought to be irreversible.The symptoms of TD patients who are put on clozapine, however,sometimes diminish, disappear, and do not reappear if they arewithdrawn from clozapine. How can clozapine treat both positive and negative symptomsbetter than any other drug? Clozapine poses a unique risk. Consequently, the FDA would notapprove the drug unless its effectiveness could be proven clearlysuperior to that of current antipsychotic drugs. This was done conclusively in a 16-center study involving over300 severely ill patients. These patients had all been ill formany years and had failed to respond to at least three potentdrugs. What is the "unique risk"? Approximately two percent of patients who take clozapine willdevelop a condition called agranulocytosis. The white blood cellcount drops to such a low level that the patient becomesextremely vulnerable to infections and no longer has the abilityto fight them off. Isn't agranulocytosis associated with standard antipsychoticdrugs as well? Yes, but the incidence with clozapine is over 10 times that ofother neuroleptics. Is agranulocytosis fatal? If detected early enough, the condition can be reversed by simplywithdrawing the patient from clozapine. If it goes undetecteduntil infections develop, the patient can die. A number of suchdeaths occurred outside the U.S. before the link withagranulocytosis was understood. We now know that to maintain patient safety, we must check thepatient's white blood cell count each week. Is there a way to minimize the risk of clozapine? Yes. Patients must have weekly blood tests, and the results sentto the patient's pharmacy before the next week's supply can bepicked up. Are other risks associated with clozapine? Other serious side effects include seizures, lowered bloodpressure, and increased heart rate. Seizures are also common toall antipsychotic drugs, but in the higher dosage ranges they aremuch more prevalent with clozapine. Lowered blood pressure and increased heart rate can usually bemanaged by gradually increasing a patient's clozapine dosage froman initially minimal level. Money Available for Clozapine Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., manufacturers of the medicationclozapine to treat schizophrenia, has settled an anti-trustlawsuit over marketing the medication by agreeing to pay $21million to increase access to the drug. All 50 states sued the pharmaceutical corporation in 1990because, until 1991, the drug was distributed only if patientsalso purchased a blood monitoring service from a Sandozaffiliate, Caremark Inc. The drug and the blood monitoringtogether, under the Sandoz plan, cost $9,000 a year per patient. Under the settlement agreement, Sandoz and Caremark will rebate$38.92 a week, or $10 million to clozapine users, $3 million tothe states to pay for new patients who might benefit from themedication, and $3 million to the National Organization for RareDisorders to provide clozapine scholarships for indigentpatients. Another $1 million will pay for patients in VeteransAdministration hospitals and other facilities. About $4 millionwill go to legal fees. Both parties declared victory in the settlement agreement. "This is one of the highest monetary awards for an anti-trustsettlement that we've ever achieved," said Jim Spencer, specialassistant attorney general in Minnesota who led the plaintiffs. "The lawsuit was dragging on and on, and the settlement is lessthan our legal fees would have been if we had continued to pursuethe case," said Gil Honigfeld, director of scientific affairs forSandoz. "We have a long history of providing medication to peoplewho can't afford it. In addition to rebates for patients and vouchers for state mentalhealth agencies to buy more clozapine, Spencer said thesettlement requires Sandoz to share its research database withresearchers for other pharmaceutical firms who may develop afinancial competitor to Clozaril, the Sandoz brand namefor clozapine. Sandoz has an exclusive patent on the drug untilSeptember, 1994. The average cost of clozapine and blood monitoring is now $100 aweek, down from $172 a week under the old arrangement, Spencersaid. The price is based on $2.85 per pill, or 400 milligrams aday, the most common dosage. But Honigfeld said the price ofclozapine and blood monitoring have actually increased in someareas of the country since the drug was separated from theCaremark blood monitoring system. Now the drug costs $4,160 per year for the typical dose,Honigfeld said. Weekly blood monitoring, which is essential toprevent blood clots, can cost $4,900 a year. Spencer said clozapine use is not nearly what it should bebecause Sandoz keeps the price too high. Sandoz has estimatedthat more than 200,000 people could eventually benefit from thedrug. Honigfeld said clozapine use in the United States has nearlydoubled in the last year. More than 30,000 patients now benefitfrom the drug, according to Sandoz records. In Massachusetts, forexample, 28 percent of the people who could benefit from the drugare receiving it. In Louisiana, however, only 3 percent of the people who couldbenefit from clozapine are receiving it. By the time Sandoz'sexclusive patent on the medication ends in 1994, Honigfeldprojects that 60,000 patients will be using it. Clozapine has been especially effective in treating people withschizophrenia who do not respond well to other medications. Honigfeld believes clozapine is one of several medications tocome in the next decade that will treat mental illness moreeffectively, with fewer side effects. The official settlement of the lawsuit is expected at the end ofNovember, and Honigfeld said checks and vouchers should bearriving by the end of 1992. What You Can Do 1.

Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial Tics, Body Tremors? by Allan Safferman, M.D. and Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D. Safferman is research psychiatrist at Hillside Hospital, LongIsland Jewish Medical Center, in Glen Oaks, NY. Lieberman isdirector of research in the Department of Psychiatry at HillsideHospital. One of the major concerns associated with the chronic use ofneuroleptic drugs is the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD),an abnormal, involuntary movement disorder that can affect thefacial region, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremities. The incidence of TD varies in different populations: in non-elderly adult psychiatric patients it occurs in 18.5 percentafter four years of neuroleptic drug treatment, and in 44 percentafter eight years of treatment. Among the elderly, the risk of TD has been found to be over 30percent after 43 weeks of neuroleptic drug treatment. Abnormal movements may be caused by a variety of neurologicalillnesses, and the clinician should carefully consider andexclude other reasonable possibilities before making a diagnosisof TD. The majority of TD cases are mild, and if caught in time, arereversible. But a small percentage of patients may actually pose a medicalrisk to the patient. The movements are often cosmeticallydisfiguring and may be functionally disabling. Patients with TD may be embarrassed by these movements and theirpresence may cause anxiety and alarm to patients. These patientsmay be shunned by those who are ignorant about this neurologicalproblem, thereby hampering the patient's efforts to reintegrateinto the community. If anti-psychotic medications are discontinued early at the onsetof TD, a significant number of patients will spontaneouslyimprove and perhaps even remit after a few months. Unfortunately, for many patients, neuroleptic discontinuation isnot a viable option as the relapse rate for patients sufferingfrom schizophrenia exceeds 60 percent and 80 percent after oneand two years of medication respectively. Various efforts to treat TD have been met with inconsistentresults. Some of these measures have included: benzodiazepines,lithium, bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, reserpine, lecithin,clonidin, and high does anticholinergics, to name a few. Some recent intriguing approaches have included the use ofVitamin E, and selegiline. It appears that all medications that block D-2 dopamine receptorsin the brain have the potential of producing extrapyramidalsymptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity) and may cause TD. Clozapine is very interesting in this regard. Clozapine has avery weak affinity for D-2 dopamine receptors, and therefore,rarely produces significant extrapyramidal symptoms attherapeutic doses. While there have been a few isolated cases of dyskinesiasassociated with clozapine, in these instances patients hadreceived traditional neuroleptic drugs prior to clozapine. Todate, there have been no confirmed case of TD caused by clozapinealone. For this reason, clozapine is a very appealing drug in that itcan effectively control psychotic symptoms and yet has a very lowrisks, if any at all, of producing TD. It has been observed that moderate to high dozes of clozapine(between 500 MG to 900 mg per day) may partially or completelyalleviate symptoms of TD -- especially in those patients withtardive dystonia. At Hillside Hospital in New York, we are currently conducting astudy to determine if clozapine is an effective treatment forpatients with moderate to sever tardive dyskinesia. Preliminary results indicate that most of the TD patients showdramatic improvement in their abnormal body movements. This project is currently ongoing and we are seeking morepatients for this study to help us determine if clozapine merelysuppresses TD, treats TD, or spares the brain from intense D-2dopamine receptor blockage thereby allowing spontanwous "healing"of dopamine neurons in the brain.

Kane, M.D. It has been apparent from twin, family, and adoption studies that schizophrenia is a disease with important genetic factors. The recent advances in molecular genetic technology are now permitting much more rapid and precise analysis of potential linkages between specific chromosomes or regions of chromosomes and schizophrenia. Although there are as yet no proven linkages, there have been a number of interesting leads. Important developments that will facilitate further progress in this area are the mapping of the entire human genome and the establishment of large national and international data bases derived from persons with schizophrenia and their families. The fact that schizophrenia may not be a single disease with one cause makes finding the potential genetic factors more difficult. It is possible that environmental factors (e.g., infectious agents) and other prenatal events may contribute. It is likely that some aspect of the brains' actual development is affected in individuals with schizophrenia. Potential evidence for specific problems include the possible effects of "unstable genes" similar to those observed in some neurologic diseases. In these instances, genes fail to work properly and lead to abnormalities in the way the brain develops. Another area of possible dysfunction is the way nerve cells grow together and along the right pathways. Investigators are beginning to identify molecules that may be important in this process and that might be altered in some way in schizophrenia. It has also been established that brain maturation involves the "pruning" of neurons, a normal process of eliminating extra nerve cells that occurs during adolescence. This is a process that might be abnormal in schizophrenia and, if so, would help to explain why the disease usually becomes apparent in late adolescence or early adulthood. Molecular genetic techniques have been applied to the "dopamine hypothesis" of schizophrenia. Since all proven-effective antipsychotic drugs block some type of dopamine receptor, new studies now being performed are attempting to link or associate the genes coding for specific dopamine receptors and schizophrenia. Some groups, for example, have been able to predict clozapine response from studying genetic information relating to dopamine receptors in patients treated with this drug; however, other groups have not replicated those findings. The fact that multiple dopamine receptors exist has been well established. In addition, there are other receptors in the brain that may be important in the etiology and/or treatment of schizophrenia. The serotonin receptors have received increasing attention because of clozapine's effects. There are now at least seven subtypes of serotonin receptors that can be studied. Other receptors that may be important include norepinephrine, GABA and NMDA. Studies of these receptors are now contributing to the development of new generations of drugs to treat schizophrenia that will have greater or lesser effects on specific receptors. For example, a recent study suggesting that oral glycine might improve negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia supports the possible role of the NMDA receptor. Studies of brain structure and function have also advanced rapidly, benefiting from new technology in imaging techniques as well as post-mortem investigations. Studies of first-episode patients at the onset of the illness (and prior to any medication treatment) have shown differences in specific brain regions as compared to control subjects. Now such studies are even showing possible alterations in the functioning of cell membranes. Such membranes are involved not only in how cells communicate with each other, but also in the energy metabolism on which cell survival depends. Studies employing other imaging techniques have shown alterations in brain metabolism in specific regions. In some cases these abnormalities have correlated with the severity of specific symptoms. Investigators have also found relationships between brain imaging measures and performance on tests of memory and thinking. Techniques for measuring brain waves or electrical impulses in the brain have also demonstrated abnormalities that may be related to the difficulty many patients have in processing sensory inputs and integrating them with or distinguishing them from their own thoughts. It is apparent from the findings in genetics, imaging, neuropsychology, and neurochemistry that there are biologically based core abnormalities in schizophrenia that are in all likelihood present before the obvious onset of the disease. The fact that the human brain is so complex and that we are probably not dealing with a single disease under the heading of schizophrenia adds to the challenge of research in this area. Nevertheless, enormous progress is being made, and the rate of advance is likely to increase. About the author: John M.

This award recognizes outstanding, long-term contributions made by scientists in understanding and treating mental illness. Dr. Janssen has devoted his scientific career to easing the severe symptoms of psychosis. The following interview with Dr. Janssen provides some answers to questions about his ground-breaking work. You are known worldwide for synthesizing haloperidol (Haldol) in 1958. Can you tell us how your discovery revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia? The synthesis of chlorpromazine, the first phenothiazine neuroleptic, began the revolution in the treatment of schizophrenia in the early 1950s. Yet, chlorpromazine has many undesirable side effects--sedation, anticholinergic (hallucinations, anxiety, short-term memory loss, disorientation, and agitation), cardiovascular, and neurological--to name a few, that limit the scope of its use. Consequently, a sequence of phenothiazine derivatives were tested as possible alternatives to chlorpromazine. The goal was to retain chlorpromazine's efficacy and to strip off some of its adverse reactions. When haloperidol was marketed, it was possible for psychiatrists to treat schizophrenia with a high-potency neuroleptic that was less likely to cause the adverse reactions associated with chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine and non-phenothiazine neuroleptics. Haloperidol was made available in a variety of formulations: liquid, tablets of different milligram strengths, a short-acting formulation for intramuscular injection, and a formulation for intravenous use. These diverse formulations, coupled with haloperidol's pharmacological effects, made it possible to treat a larger number of people with schizophrenia than ever before. Furthermore, haloperidol offered the advantage of being an effective treatment of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and, secondarily, of some of its negative symptoms. It can be safety coadministered with a large number of drugs that psychiatric patients--especially those with comorbid medical illnesses--must take. Although haloperidol can evoke a variety of neurological side effects that are often dose-related, these can be managed by dose reduction or by counteracting drugs. Finally, haloperidol maintenance therapy, properly administered, has proven to be safe and to preserve the benefits of haloperidol therapy. Haloperidol's efficacy, safety, and assets are the reasons it has been used to treat millions of patients of all ages in the past 37 years, worldwide. These properties of the drug account for it being the "gold standard" against which all new neuroleptics and antipsychotics are compared. Why does your newest discovery, the antipsychotic medicine risperidone (Risperdal), represent a progressive step in the evolution of treatment for schizophrenia? Risperidone, like clozapine, is a novel, atypical antipsychotic. Each of these new medicines has advanced the treatment of schizophrenia. Each is an effective therapy for acute schizophrenia, and each is also effective for chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Risperidone and clozapine relieve both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Risperidone and clozapine also are effective for a broad range of psychotic disorders besides schizophrenia. The potentials of these two atypical antipsychotics make them true breakthroughs in the treatment of schizophrenia. They make possible therapeutic achievements that have never been attained by their predecessors, the conventional, typical neuroleptics. Risperidone and clozapine differ from their predecessors because each has different modes of action. They affect not only the neurotransmitter dopamine, but also the neurotransmitter serotonin. Risperidone represents a true progressive step in the evolution of the treatment of schizophrenia for a number of reasons. First, risperidone is effective against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Second, risperidone's pharmacological properties make it safer than other atypical antipsychotics. Unlike clozapine, it doesn't cause sedation, blood-pressure lowering, agranulocytosis (a dramatic drop in white blood cell count), seizures, excessive salivation, and other undesirable reactions. In high doses, risperidone can cause neurological side effects, but these are infrequent because only a minority of patients require doses of risperidone high enough to evoke them. In addition, these side effects are usually mild and readily managed by dosage reduction or by counteracting medicines. Risperidone's efficacy, safety, and tolerability make it an acceptable drug to a large number of patients with schizophrenia. As psychiatrists become more skilled in the selection of candidates for risperidone and in managing its dose, it is reasonable to anticipate that--like haloperidol--it will become a leading drug for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses and for a variety of other serious psychiatric illnesses. In layman's terms, how does risperidone differ from haloperidol? Risperidone differs from haloperidol in many very important ways. Risperidone is unique. It is a novel, atypical antipsychotic, whereas haloperidol is a typical neuroleptic. Because risperidone is novel, it offers hope of relief from the suffering, anguish, and disability due to a variety of serious psychiatric illnesses without the adverse effects of typical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol. Risperidone can be used to treat not only the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but also to treat serious mood disorders, such as psychotic depression. Like haloperidol, risperidone has anti-manic effects. But unlike haloperidol, the dose of risperidone required to relieve mania is less likely to cause troublesome side effects. Risperidone can be used for a variety of psychotic disorders, including psychoses induced by drugs. Risperidone and haloperidol are very good medications for treating the aggression resulting from many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Because risperidone is less likely to cause certain side effects than haloperidol, risperidone can benefit elderly patients with dementia and organic brain disorders, adults and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and adolescents with Tourette's syndrome. In short, risperidone has a broader range of application than haloperidol because of its unique pharmacological properties and better side-effect profile. Do you see even more breakthroughs in drug therapy for serious mental illnesses? Breakthroughs in drug therapy for serious mental illnesses are the hope and dream of dedicated pharmaceutical researchers everywhere. Because there are many potential obstacles to the realizations of these aspirations, discoveries in this field are rare. Proving that newly developed chemicals are potential antipsychotic, antidepressant, or antianxiety medications--or a mood stabilizer--is very time-consuming and costly because of the basic preclinical research and the extensive clinical and toxicological research that proof requires. Nevertheless, there are valid reasons for researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to be sanguine about the future. Yes, I foresee breakthroughs, but realistically they probably will be few and far between. You yourself hold more than 100 patents, more than any other scientist in the world, and Pharmaceutical Executive magazine called your company "the most productive research-based drug company world-wide in the last 35 years." Although you are formally retired, you remain involved in the research at the Janssen Pharmaceutica labs. What keeps you so vitally interested in the work of your scientists? I have been told I have an inquisitive mind and an insatiable desire to use my talents to develop new and better medicines to alleviate or minimize the ravages of the illnesses to which all people are prone. It is true that I hold more patents than any other scientist in the world. These are not just the fruits of my research alone. Pharmaceutical research is very complex. It requires the coordinated efforts of scientists, well-trained men and women whose vocations are to discover and develop new medicines for the welfare of mankind. Yes, although I am retired, I remain involved in research because it is challenging, exciting, and rewarding. It also is a privilege to be associated with, and to exchange ideas and concepts with, loyal and dedicated employees who share my visions and dreams.

Hogarty, M.S.W. Since the introduction of effective antipsychotic medications, thousands if not millions of people world-wide who suffer from schizophrenia have been able to spend an increasing proportion of their lives outside the confines of a mental hospital. In turn, quality of life has often improved with the availability of job clubs, resocialization groups, case management, sheltered or supported employment, residential opportunities, as well as legal and financial assistance. These necessary services are not always available to all who need them, and even the more fortunate beneficiaries continue to experience periodic relapse and abiding cognitive impairments that conspire against a fuller social and vocational life. It will come as no surprise to people and families who live day-to-day with schizophrenia to learn that only 10 percent to 30 percent of patients with schizophrenia are, on average, employed at any given time and that even a majority of those "successfully rehabilitated" though formal training programs often return to where they began one and two years later. This is especially true when the rehabilitation support system ends its active involvement once a patient finds a job. The promise of a better outcome can likely be found in the emerging science of "treatment development" that is being shaped and directed by contributions from the social, behavioral, and neurosciences. These new approaches could more accurately be described as therapeutic interventions than mental health services because they are theoretically tied to the very impairments and disabilities of schizophrenia itself. By contrast, "services" are usually atheoretical activities that are useful for all disabled human beings, whether the disability is mental or physical. The following paragraphs will attempt to summarize a few of the more recent psychosocial treatment developments and provide a glimpse into what the future might hold. Schizophrenia is a brain disorder and not the result of bad habits, bad parents, or bad friends. What might be less well known is that the disease process itself (called the pathophysiology) can result in considerable vulnerability to what are often the "ordinary" events of daily life. Thus, when social scientists set about the task of psychosocial treatment development nearly 20 years ago, they began with the notion that schizophrenia was an "environmentally sensitive" brain disorder. Both good and bad experiences had the potential to seriously disrupt important psychobiological functions, such as attention and arousal, needed to process information about the world and to regulate one's emotional response. These disturbances were believed to lie at the core of a psychotic episode. Environmental stress that was capable of provoking episodes of schizophrenia could just as likely be found in the treatment environment itself (including one of our own early studies) as in the work environment, culture, or even normal family life. In short, the cognitive demands associated with normal vocational and personal life could quickly exceed the capacity of many people with schizophrenia to respond appropriately. Psychoeducation As simple as it now seems, basic information provided to patients and their families about the nature of schizophrenia, its treatment, how medication and psychosocial treatments work, and survival skills that enable them to better manage the illness have had important effects on reducing relapse and enhancing adjustment. Not all psychoeducation studies have been positive, but the majority are encouraging. Much like generic services, however, when the support of psychoeducational interventions ended, the treatment effect often did so as well. Further, it has become clear that professional training and relevant credentials are required to accurately provide this needed information as well as the skill to "bridge the gap" between acquiring knowledge and applying it in everyday life. Trips to the library are largely insufficient. When we started "psychoeducation" in 1978, we encountered more than a bit of professional skepticism because the prevailing opinion at the time was that "families needed therapy, not advice." But as often happens, the subsequent weight of research evidence gave lie to this popular myth. Social Skills Training Well-regarded attempts to improve the schizophrenic patient's ability to correctly understand, "digest," and respond to information from friends, family, and coworkers has also led to a reduction in schizophrenic relapse and to better adjustment. Yet, many researchers continue to question whether the skills acquired in negotiating specific tasks involving specific people always transferred (or "generalized") to other social situations for which training had not been provided. Quite simply, it would be nearly impossible to train a person to cope with every conceivable life experience, one at a time. Unfortunately the story of our skills-training study was much like the psychoeducational approach: when the support of the skills-training program ended, too often the good effects ultimately terminated as well. Personal Therapy In response to the short-term nature of treatment gains associated with educational and skills-training programs, we have recently completed the study of a new individual treatment for schizophrenia that comes a bit closer to what might be going on in the brain prior to a new episode. The availability of an effective individual approach seemed of particular necessity in those parts of the country where mental health services were in short and diminishing supply or were not readily accessible. Personal therapy was designed following a careful analysis of the internal (subjective) state and thinking among persons with a history of schizophrenia as they faced the beginning of a psychotic relapse. Surprisingly, various studies suggested that psychotic symptoms themselves were not always the initial signs that a person was slipping into a new episode. Rather, disturbances in feelings such as anxiety and restlessness or depression and sleep disturbance were frequently the first "symptoms" to appear. These early warning signs, called "prodromes," were often the heralds of a serious and highly individual emotional upheaval, one that we have called "affect dysregulation." In the first three-year controlled trial of a psychosocial treatment ever attempted, personal therapy (PT) sought to help patients identify these very early subjective experiences (troublesome thoughts, body sensations, or emotions) and--depending on how well they had recovered from their last psychotic episode-- to teach them how to manage these prodromes before they escalated into a full-blown episode. Early in the process of recovery, simple exercises such as avoiding "hot" situations were taught. Over time, patients learned the techniques of relaxation as well as ways to rob a situation of its threat by means of re-evaluation, called "cognitive reframing." Later, for those more fully recovered, strategies for managing criticism and unreasonable requests were introduced. A deeper understanding of how one's feelings and their expression influenced the behavior of others was encouraged as well. Unlike skills training that focused on the specific reaction to a particular stressor, PT addressed the more common and predictable reaction that a patient might typically have to any source of stress. A very preliminary (unpublished) examination of an extensive database representing 150 patients has revealed some good--and some not so good--outcomes. For patients living with their families, PT did significantly lower relapse over time. But for those "living tough" on their own, it did not. In fact, the practical problems related to obtaining stable housing, basic health care, and access to needed entitlements appear to have presented such a "full plate" to many patients that psychosocial attempts to develop management skills and greater awareness of their illness might have represented a destabilizing, cognitive "overload" for some of them. When families were available to assist in the acquisition of basic human needs, patients seemed better able to make use of and profit from personal therapy in terms of lower relapse. For the first time, we have also been able to statistically isolate the independent effects of treatment on social recovery in a way that was not confused with marked treatment differences in relapse. (In past studies, if one treatment had more relapses than another, then obviously this treatment would also have reduced the chance for social recovery.) A very preliminary analysis suggests that personal therapy has had a positive influence--one that increases over time--on various aspects of social adjustment, particularly among patients living with family. Ultimately, we hope to identify individual patients for whom PT has had the greatest effects. In general, while most patients have been observed to be "better but not well," little positive improvement has been seen in the important area of work performance. With the support of a NIMH Merit Award, my colleagues and I have recently decided to address the very core of schizophrenic impairments, disabilities, and social handicaps that underlie poor social and vocational performance. A new intervention has been designed and called cognitive enhancement therapy. We hope to test and evaluate it over the remaining years of the Decade of the Brain. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy Antipsychotic medications, including the newer "atypical" antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and risperidone, have now made it possible for many more patients with schizophrenia to resolve the most prominent symptoms of their illness (e.g., hallucinations and delusions). "But why," families and professionals ask, "do patients frequently continue to be unable to acquire a better social and vocational life, even though psychotic symptoms fade away?" Over the century, cognitive scientists have identified many "neuropsychological" problems that persist after symptom remission. These frequently include difficulties in establishing, maintaining, or shifting attention, screening out or "inhibiting" less important information, using one's memory efficiently, problem solving, and most often, being able to process information about themselves and the world other than in a very slow and very "effortful" way. As provocative as these findings in basic cognitive impairment have been, patients with schizophrenia nonetheless are not routinely hospitalized or isolated from friends and family "because their reaction time is slow," as one noted psychologist once remarked. Rather, we now tend to regard these neuropsychological impairments as the smoke signals of what might be a far more serious cognitive fire. Closer to the real-life consequences of these basic impairments are the practical disabilities demonstrated in the patients' "cognitive styles" of thinking. Some styles are "impoverished," and persons with this cognitive style often have great difficulty giving a full and rich description of their own and another's ideas and behavior. Another style is "disorganized," and these patients seem to get "off-track" quickly and easily digress into irrelevant discussions. Often such patients "fail to edit" the first and often unrelated idea that pops into their heads. Still other patients are disabled by a "rigid" cognitive style, one that makes it difficult to entertain more than a single, strongly held view of a problem, its solution, or for that matter, an alternative plan for getting on with life. In trying to understand the source of these impairments and disabilities, we were struck by the fact that normal children, especially those between the ages of seven and nine, also showed many of the same poor neuropsychological test scores as adult patients with schizophrenia. This led us to examine the social cognitive development of these pre-adolescents, and once again we concluded that their interpersonal behavior shared many similarities to those of adult persons with schizophrenia. Perhaps, we thought, these social cognitive problems were the "inferno" that accounted for the everyday social handicaps of schizophrenia. We concluded that many patients with schizophrenia (much like those who had "recovered" from traumatic brain injury) seemed to have lost, or failed to acquire, two essential social cognitive abilities needed for a fuller personal and vocational life. First, much like normal children, patients seemed to have difficulty in taking the view of another person, called "second-person perspective taking," or--better yet--taking "a third person-perspective" whereby one could examine their own and another's relationship from a "detached" point of view. They appeared unable to see the big picture. Second, and perhaps even more importantly, profound similarities between patients and normal children appeared in the form of difficulty "reading" or interpreting the informal and often subtle rules of conduct as social situations changed in an unpredictable way. Social scientists have called this ability "secondary socialization." For example, a patient being prepared for a library job was told that the general rule of the library limited the number of borrowed books to four at any given time. One day, the director of the institution walked in and wanted to borrow a book. The patient told him he couldn't have it because he has already taken out the allotted four books. Needless to say, such misreadings of complex social situations can have disastrous vocational consequences. Being able to take the place of another person and read social cues correctly are the foundations necessary for foresightful planning and a successful life. Gratefully, modern cognitive theorists have shown that as a child's social cognition develops, mother nature provides an easy way out of the problem of trying to remember too many things (verbatim memory) and remembering them one piece at a time (serial processing). As the child reaches adolescence, there is a slow emergence of abstract thinking where only the most important ideas, or rules, or principles underlying bits and pieces of information are remembered. The irrelevant details are mostly forgotten. The principles that are remembered are called "gists" as in, "I think he got the gist of it." The brain process whereby this abstracting facility grows and develops is thought to be very complex. What likely happens is that the development of essential brain circuits or "neural connections" increases during adolescence, while unnecessary circuits are eliminated--a process that could well be impaired in schizophrenia. With this as background, and in spite of very real and obvious obstacles, we have developed cognitive enhancement therapy in an attempt to "jump start" the process that nature originally intended, but that schizophrenia might have disrupted. Using interactive computers, patients are first trained in "basic" cognitive exercises. This training does not have the unrealistic goal of completely eliminating problems in attention and memory, but rather patients are trained to learn to get the "gist" needed to solve a problem. Many props and aids are offered initially, but they are gradually faded out as the patient learns to internalize "the gist" or the rule governing the successful completion of a task. Next, patients are paired in a way designed to help them "empathically" assist another patient as he or she also struggles to acquire the "gist" underlying a test. Empathy is among the most unique and abstract of human abilities, yet is an essential behavior often ignored by health professionals during traditional psychosocial therapies. Finally, working in small groups, patients engage in exercises to help them acquire the ability to "get the gist" of rules that govern behavior in different social contexts. Therapists gradually change the nature and the difficulty of these social cognitive exercises as patients begin to develop skills for the much needed "second person perspective" and "secondary socialization" abilities. Throughout the program, these group experiences are supplemented by exercises in reading comprehension and "gist extraction" that often begin with the editorial pages of USA Today and proceed to the New York Times. We have only recently begun to treat patients in a formal, scientific study, but our pilot studies have shown some improvement, at least among selected patients. Will it ultimately work for most? Only time and a careful investigation will tell. While some experts remain appropriately skeptical about the promise of cognitive rehabilitation itself, we are reminded of a remark made by a colleague who once said, "You only need to see one fly walk across the ceiling upside-down to know that it can be done". We are also duly cautious about the future. But with the abiding support of taxpayers and their elected representatives, this new era of cognitive rehabilitation does appear to offer hopefulness for a more lasting recovery from schizophrenia, an outcome that could exceed the limitations of existing mental health services. About the author: Gerard E. Hogarty, M.S.W., is a professor of psychiatry at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. With degrees in philosophy and social work, Hogarty first held an appointment at NIMH, then joined the Friends Medical Science Research Center in Baltimore, where he conducted the first post-hospital, controlled-maintenance studies of drug and psychosocial interventions with patients with schizophrenia. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1974, and he and his colleagues have continued to develop and test integrated medication and family psychoeducation as well as individual approaches to the care of patients with schizophrenia. Among these were attempts to establish minimum effective dosing strategies for acute and maintenance treatment as well as studies addressed to the nature and treatment of impaired affect in those recovering from schizophrenia. His current research program centers on the development of disorder-relevant, individual psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia, including a novel cognitive-rehabilitation approach.

I am the research--a volunteer subject at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), living for a year at their clinical center in Maryland. I'm in the biological psychiatry research unit for affective disorders and participate in everything from medicine trials to PET scans, from memory and neuropsychological testing to blood and spinal-fluid testing, from MRIs to activity monitoring, from magnesium infusion studies to sleep and sleep-deprivation studies. Because I am a research subject, I am not given information that might affect the research results. Most test results are blinded. There are similarities in the patients who are selected. We have all suffered with a bipolar I, bipolar II, or unipolar mood disorder and have tried standard treatments including medications, psychotherapy, and ECT. Many are rapid cyclers; that is, the ups and downs of the illness cycle many times a year. For a few, they actually cycle a couple of times a day. Otherwise, we are all healthy people. It would be misleading to tell you we have volunteered purely for research and the advancement of science. Even though most of us would say, "I'm trading my time and body for research in exchange for the treatment I can't get back home," we are not as self-centered as that statement suggests. I've seen patients go through a great deal of discomfort for research studies that will not benefit them directly. While NIMH allows us to refuse any test, patients try very hard to participate in them all. For example, one patient with a phobia about small places successfully completed an MRI after several very scary attempts. Her comment: "I really wanted to do this because I know it's an important piece of research data." I am 48 years old, married with no children. I have a Masters degree and, when well, I hold a responsible marketing position with a large manufacturer of computer systems in New England. I consider myself to be quite successful. I also play hard whether I'm whitewater canoeing, skiing, or, before my illness, flying a small plane. The other patients in my group range in age from their early 20s to their mid-50s. There are men and women--some single, some married--from all over the country. They are well-read, bright, and knowledgeable about their illness. Because the group is highly motivated, we've taken advantage of the resources at NIMH to learn more about our illness, particularly the weekly meeting led by our unit's research director. After delivering the week's research schedule, he discusses research topics of interest to us, including recent discoveries. Believe me, we get as excited as the researchers with every discovery. Because our data are included, we take pride in the findings. We helped, and maybe someday our help will in turn help us. One of the hard parts is remembering that in research some of the most exciting discoveries involve simply understanding the right questions to ask and investigate. Many results will not become useful in treatment for a long time. We do learn much about ourselves. That's part of the return for volunteering. Many of us are initially taken off meds for a "washout period." While uncomfortable, it's often the first time in many years we've been medication-free, and it therefore provides an opportunity to re-observe our symptoms. Sometimes it even results in a change in our diagnosis. Throughout the year we do ratings of mood, symptoms, and side effects several times a day. We wear activity monitors to measure motor activity so it can be correlated with mood. A life chart is prepared to record each participant's major life events as well as the course and treatment of the illness. A life chart can be an eye-opener. Some of us discover that the onset of our illness occurred much earlier than we thought, a fact that then becomes grist for future treatment. About the future: I anticipate leaving the program in close to a balanced state. In my months here I've seen a number of patients discharged, and all of them were doing well when they left. Some have had relapses, but their ups and downs aren't as intense. With the NIMH data, their doctors at home are making treatment modifications that are generally working for them. And best of all, NIMH follows each of us for life; and our at-home doctors can consult with the NIMH doctors about our treatment. We have access to the best of the best and the newest of the newest all the time. I'm hopeful about what lies ahead. I may not be able to continue with the demanding job I had; but I can still be productive, still be a good wife, and best of all, use the best treatments science has to offer for what looks like a lifelong illness for me. by Margaret Brender ALTERNATIVE DRUG FOR ADHD [Return to Top] Though the results are only preliminary, research has identified a potential new treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that is just as effective as the controversial stimulant Ritalin and has few side effects. The blood pressure drug Tenex significantly improved symptoms of ADHD in thirteen children and young adults, according to a study published in the January 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Parents reported significant improvements in their children's overall behavior as well as in the specific symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and immaturity, after one month of Tenex treatment. Tenex had few side effects. The children were not sedated or impaired in their functional ability. They became significantly less restless, frustrated, and anxious, had less excessive energy, and were better able to finish projects. They were more attentive, able to work with less supervision, and improved in some aspects of social skills. Patients with the highest levels of irritability and hyperactivity seemed to benefit more from Tenex treatment.

Rothschild, M.D., clinical director of the mood and anxiety program at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., suggests that briefly discontinuing intake of certain antidepressants, or taking a "drug holiday," can improve a patient's sex life. Drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil can reduce sex drive to a point at which some patients actually consider ending their relationship or quitting their treatment, researchers say. Thirty volunteers taking either Zoloft, Paxil, or Prozac participated in Rothschild's study. Not including the 10 subjects taking Prozac, 50 percent of the others reported a marked increase in satisfaction with sexual activity over the course of the four-weekend study. All participants reported a return to previous sexual-dysfunction status after resuming antidepressant treatment. The lack of a difference in results for persons taking Prozac, Rothschild said, "is presumably due to the longer period of time required for that medication to leave the individual's body once discontinued." --Reprinted by permission from Mental Health Weekly (vol. 5, no. 40) CONTACT | MEMBERSHIP | WEBMASTER Copyright © 1996 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill - All Rights ReservedWT02-B26-38IA008-000083-B003-130http://www.nami.org:80/disorder/disordb.htm 38.250.129.71 19970222101359 text/html 6909HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 10:12:24 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Crisis Care for the Child or Adolescent With a Neurobiological Disorder NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Crisis Care for the Child or Adolescent With a Neurobiological Disorder If severely ill and in risk of injuring himself or someone else, your child may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital or a residential treatment program. As the child's parent or guardian, you should expect to be part of the treatment plan, be told of all changes in medication and therapy plans, and, take part in the discharge plan. Generally, hospitalization for children and adolescents is brief. Make sure that you know what alternative schooling programs are available and most appropriate for your child when he or she is discharged, especially if he or she is unable to return to his regular school program. How do I pay for services for my child? Mental health services, such as therapy, may be covered by your insurance plan. Look at the mental health section of your plan to see what services it covers. Many HMOs now require a gatekeeper other than a primary care physician be involved in determining whether mental health services will be provided. If you, or your child is currently covered by a Medicaid program, some mental health services may be available. Find out more about insurance plans and Medicaid from your local AMI or AMI-CAN affiliate. While hospitalized, special education programs mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) are paid for under a set formula of county, state, and federal dollars. I am told I must give up custody of my child because I cannot pay for services. Some states require this; others do not. The problem is how states interpret the law. Treatment providers, as well as state child welfare authorities often explain that relinquishment is required by the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (also known as P. L 96-272, or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) or that treatment needs are best served if parents do not have the authority to remove their children from a treatment setting. In fact, such relinquishment is not required by federal law. What do I do if I am not satisfied with a professional or a program where my child is placed for treatment or educational services? Try to learn all you can about what the program or professional is supposed to do so you can judge carefully whether or not it's the right place or person to help your child. If you are not satisfied, you need to express specifically what your concerns are. You may need to seek a second opinion. Learn about the laws that protect you and your child. Speak up. Ask questions. Join an advocacy organization such as your local AMI and AMI-CAN that seeks better services in your community. But most importantly, don't give up; your child needs your persistence. Now, more than ever before, there are appropriate placements in schools. If faced with serious unresolved concerns, you may need to consult a special-education lawyer to get the services your child needs. Where can I find a support group of families whose children have neurobiological disorders? Contact your local AMI affiliate. (There are more than 1,000 affiliates throughout the U.S.) They will tell you whether a child and adolescent group has formed in your area and where local support groups meet. If you would like to form a support group for parents of children and adolescents, write to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and ask for the children and adolescent start-up packet. This kit will enable you to start a group in your community as well as provide resource lists and ideas about advocating for the services you may need. What are the advocacy goals of these groups? Young families with children with neurobiological disorders are already advocating at all levels of government for improved services and access to services for children and adolescents. The goals of advocacy include: a total range of individualized and appropriate educational, treatment, and rehabilitative services; a comprehensive, community-based system of care available to every child and adolescent in need of such services; an end to the practice of forcing parents to give up custody of their children to obtain needed services; the rights of children and adolescents to a free, appropriate public education and related services as mandated by federal, state, and local laws; a change in public policy so that the needs of children and adolescents with neurobiological disorders are placed among the top priorities of the nation; full family participation in planning for education and treatment; full equity for children and adolescents with these disorders in the nation's healthcare and insurance systems; research into causes, improved treatments, prevention, and cures for neurobiological disorders; research into the most effective educational strategies, and improvement in the transition between adolescent and adult services.

For Rockville mother Brenda Souto, whose son was so despondent teachers once feared he might attempt suicide at school, raising a depressed youngster can be a terrifying struggle. For Susan Dubuque, whose son held the toy gun to his head, her son's battle with depression was a hellish journey that nearly ruined him. Today, Souto and Dubuque are among other parents who credit antidepressant medication like Prozac and similar drugs for literally saving their children's lives. "If he hadn't had this medication [Prozac], I think he probably would have eventually become so miserable . . . he would be one of the suicide statistics," says Souto of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Arlington. Up to 8 million youngsters suffer from depression in this country, according to Peter Jensen of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda. Increasingly, children as young as 4 and 5 years old are being treated with Prozac and other antidepressants that belong to the new breed of drugs called SSRIs, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. Though it's difficult to determine exactly how many children in this country are treated with antidepressants for either depression or other mental problems, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, doctors have some clue by reviewing information collected by IMS America, a firm that tracks data from the pharmaceutical industry. IMS, since 1992, has tracked the number of times, called "mentions," that physicians prescribed, refilled, recommended or administered SSRIs to children. For children in the 5- to 10-year-old age group, IMS found that the number of "mentions" of Prozac grew from 61,000 to 220,000 between 1992 and 1994. The most recent figures -- for June 1995 to June 1996 -- show 3,000 SSRI drug "mentions" for children up to age 4. For youngsters ages 5-10, the number of times doctors prescribed, refilled or administered the drugs was 116,000. The number of "mentions" for ages 16-20 was 899,000 in that 12-month period, according to IMS figures. Though Jensen and other mental health experts believe antidepressants can be highly effective for some children who have been properly diagnosed, there still is concern that not enough is known about the safety and efficacy of these drugs for young children and that more research is needed. Research involving children and drugs like Prozac has been scant compared with studies on adult usage, says Jensen, chief of Child and Adolescent Disorders Research at NIMH in Rockville. Nevertheless, Jensen says he, like other doctors, resorts to medication for a depressed youngster when all other behavioral therapies and counseling have failed to lift the child from the depths of serious depression. "I cannot allow this child to suffer longer," says Jensen. "If we've given it our best shot, then we'll do a therapeutic trial of medication, even though we do not have all the firm evidence we would like to have." Harold S. Koplewicz, vice chairman of psychiatry and director of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, worries that mentally and emotionally disturbed children who could greatly benefit from medication are not being treated because of the stigma attached to giving children antidepressants and a failure to accept that the child's problems may stem from a mental illness or brain disorder. "People actually believe that parents are the cause of the children's problems and if the parent is giving a pill or medicine to the child, it's because you haven't been a good parent," said Koplewicz, author of "It's Nobody's Fault, New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents" (Times Books, Random House 1996). "The real dilemma is not are we over-medicating our kids, but are we under-treating them," says Koplewicz. "If these children have a real depression, a real illness and it is unresponsive to psychosocial interventions, they need a treatment that will make it go away." Left untreated, the results can be disastrous, he warns. "If teenagers feel bad and we don't help them with this depression, they will go and treat themselves. They will find `medicines' they think will work -- cocaine, alcohol and marijuana. Then you have a kid that is not only depressed, but suffering from substance abuse." Results of an important new study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas -- yet to be published -- may provide doctors with the best recommendation so far for prescribing the SSRIs to youngsters. Conducted by Graham Emslie, a professor of psychiatry, and funded by the NIMH, the study showed Prozac to be effective in treating depressed children and teenagers. Ninety-six patients suffering from severe and persistent depression, ages 8 to 18, were studied for eight weeks. Fifty-six percent of those who had received Prozac responded to treatment, compared with 33 percent in a group that received a placebo. It's the first study -- especially with young children -- that showed Prozac was more effective than the placebo, according to Emslie. Hopefully, he says, this will foster more research in this age group and result in more depressed children receiving treatment. Despite these results, Emslie also worries about possible long-term effects. "The difficulty with children is clearly that the brain is still developing. So, we don't know how the medications affect that. We have no data that says it's harmful. But it's always a concern." "On the other hand," says Emslie, "we have some data that suggests being depressed for a period of time can affect your brain functioning over time." Data show changing of blood flow to the brain and other neurological signs, so researchers can see "biological changes occurring in the state of depression," he says. "So, if you don't treat it you have danger of more permanent changes in the brain occurring." Mental health experts like Neal Ryan, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, stress that the newer SSRIs are much safer than the older group of antidepressants called tricyclics. "I think they (SSRIs) will be the first-line treatment everywhere," Ryan predicts. SSRIs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for adult use only. The drugs carry a warning label that they have not been tested on children. Doctors, however, can prescribe for children. "Medication has taken such a lambasting," says parent Susan Dubuque of Richmond, whose son, Nicholas, now 12, has taken Ritalin, Prozac and other antidepressants over the years to treat disorders. "There have been certain cases of abuse and misuse. But I'll tell you when it works it really works," says Dubuque, who has written "A Parent's Survival Guide to Childhood Depression," published this year by the Center for Applied Psychology Inc. Burned into her memory is that terrifying night Nicholas cowered in a closet, pointed a toy gun to his head and threatened to kill himself if it were real. She said he was hysterical, crying and pleading, "Please help me." After years of dealing with a child's anger and sadness and seeking medical help, Dubuque says it's frustrating to deal with critics who don't understand the severity of depression in children and what it is like to raise such a child. "People say, `Instead of giving the child a pill, why don't you find out what is wrong with him.' I just want to say, `I did. I have. And the problem is he's depressed.' The reality is it's a physical disorder. You wouldn't say, `Don't give your child insulin if he is a diabetic.' " A Bethesda mother said her young son's depression became so deep that by the age of 12 he was suicidal and she had to "hide all the knives in the house." "It was scary. He talked about feeling useless and [that it was] not worth living. He left the house one day for a long walk and later told his therapist that his plan had been to walk out in front of cars and be killed." He has since been treated off and on with Prozac and Zoloft for depression and the stimulant Dexedrine for attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. Though his bouts with depression have lifted somewhat, "I'm afraid to take him off medication," she says. "I fear the risk of suicide. If I can just get him through the teenage years alive, then the rest of his life may work out." It was long thought that young children could not be depressed, so depression in children was likely misdiagnosed or overlooked, according to Jensen. In the last couple of decades that all has changed, and now there is a sense of urgency in the medical field to diagnose and treat children who suffer from depression. In fact, beginning in 1997, the most comprehensive nationwide study on children and mental disorders in this country will be conducted by the NIMH, in conjunction with other agencies, including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Department of Education, and Center for Mental Health Services. The study will survey about 14,000 children, ages 4 to 17, and monitor them for a minimum of two years, according to Jensen. The goal is to learn more about the causes of mental disorders in children, how they are being treated, the quality of care, and why some kids are falling through the cracks either through misdiagnosis, insurance problems or other faults in the system. Children under stress, who experience a traumatic loss, or who have learning, attention or conduct disorders are typically at a higher risk for depression, according to experts at the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical for children suffering from depression. The behavior of depressed children often can differ from the behavior of depressed adults, say doctors. Signs of depression in youngsters can include persistent sadness, boredom or low energy; inability to enjoy previously favorite activities; increased irritability; frequent complaints of physical illnesses; major changes in sleeping or eating patterns; frequent absences from school or poor performance in school. Children and adolescents who are depressed may say they want to be dead or talk about suicide. Depressed adolescents may abuse alcohol or drugs as a way to feel better. And sometimes children who cause trouble at home or school may be depressed but not know it, according to the Academy. School educators, counselors and psychologists often are among the first to observe symptoms of depression or other disorders in children. Fairfax County school psychologist Martha Ozer is among those who have seen the heartbreak of childhood depression. "I've seen where a child writes `I wish I were dead' or `I'm going to kill myself' on a paper that they were going to turn in and they knew the teacher would see it," recalls Ozer, who works with elementary school children . "We take it very seriously because very young children don't really understand death and they don't understand that when people die it is final," she says. When a child talks of suicide, parents are asked to take their child for an emergency evaluation by a mental health professional. If they refuse to address the problem, Ozer says the school must call Child Protective Services for the child's own safety. "Lots of times it is just so horrifying to a parent that a child would talk of killing [himself] that they just can't believe it so they may not actually follow up immediately." She recalled one child who made an attempt -- a suicidal gesture -- in class. "It was a cry for help. It could have been more serious than it was." In another case, a 5-year-old distraught over family problems lay down in front of his school bus in an attempt to kill himself. Fortunately he was not injured, says Ozer. Another suicide threat came from a child whose family was having financial difficulties, and the youngster "thought it would just be best for the family not to have her around any more." "Today, some children are under tremendous stress . . . certainly more so than 20 years ago," says Ozer. "Children and families live very fast-paced lives and many times both parents work outside the home and there are child-care givers. Just the issue of who cares for the child is an issue that can cause stress." "School curriculums are at a faster pace and lots of activities sometimes leave kids stretched to the limit and it's difficult for them," Ozer says. "It can leave them with not enough down time or enough time when a child can actually relate to the parent." Jensen also cites societal changes like divorce rates and increased mobility as possible factors that can lead to depression. "One might argue that life is more complex and more difficult and in some ways more stressful than in earlier years," says Jensen. Environmental factors, like kids' exposure to lead, have been shown to result in more behavioral problems, he says. Since depression can be biological, doctors note that depressed children often have a parent who has suffered from the disorder. Elizabeth Weller, professor of psychiatry, pediatrics and neuroscience at Ohio State University, worries that not all children are being properly evaluated and diagnosed before being prescribed antidepressant medication. "When you look at the average pediatrician who spends around 11 minutes per patient and a family practitioner, seven minutes . . . you can't diagnose a little kid in that period of time. Paper-pencil tests are not even made to make the diagnosis and come up with a score saying this kid is depressed. But based on that they give the medication. It is really sad," says Weller. "If you give it to the properly diagnosed child it really helps," she adds. But constraints placed by managed care often bar doctors from being able to spend enough time with young patients to reach a clear diagnosis. Even Dubuque has worried about the uncertainty over possible long-term drug risks. "I'd be stupid not to," she says. "But when you are dealing with a child who is suffering from an acute bout of an emotional problem, you take crisis action. If we wouldn't have, there may not have been a long term to worry about."

Of all the psychiatric disorders, sorting out the hereditary basis of bipolar disorder has proven tremendously difficult, with one claim after another proving inconclusive or unconfirmed. The new studies--using various strategies in different population groups--provide strong clues on where to focus the gene search, although the situation in clearly complex. Researchers Blackwood and colleagues in Edinburgh focussed on one large family of more than 100 individuals, with 11 suffering from bipolar disorder, and found strong evidence for a gene on the short arm of chromosome 4, which held up when the study was expanded to include 12 other families. Ginns and an intramural team at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) looked at 551 genetic markers in affected Amish families (long popular with geneticists because of their large size and excellent genealogical records). Their results suggest that three locations--on chromosomes 6, 13, and 15--may harbor susceptibility genes. Finally Freimer (an NIMH grantee) and his colleagues examined an isolated population in Costa Rica, resulting in evidence of a gene on the long arm of chromosome 18.

Neuroscientists think they have an answer. They believe they have located what amounts to the brain's scratch pad, where information is held temporarily when it is needed for some current task. New techniques for observing the brain in action are revealing that neurons in the prefrontal lobes, just behind the forehead, hold specific kinds of information for short-term use. These neurons appear to be the neural basis for the mind's "working memory," which operates, say, when you dial a phone number. "We've found cells for working memory in the prefrontal cortex that retrieve and temporarily hold information pulled from long-term memory stores that are dispersed throughout the brain," said Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic, a neuroscientist at Yale Medical School who has done much of the research. The neurology of working memory, which is more widely known by the now outmoded term "short term" memory, may hold a vital clue to what goes wrong in the thinking of people with schizophrenia. "Working memory is the mental glue that links a though through time from its beginning to its end," said Dr. Goldman-Rakic. "The bizarre thought disorders in schizophrenia, especially the inability to keep a train of thought from getting derailed, could be due to a defect in working memory." The new findings are consistent with theories of neuropsychology, largely based on clinical studies of brain-damaged patients, that view the prefrontal region as the brain's executive center for making decisions, planning, and executing behavior. The key executive function of the prefrontal cortex, Dr. Goldman-Rakic argues, is working memory. One clinical implication of the work on the prefrontal cortex and working memory is the potential for a better understanding of some schizophrenia symptoms, such as the derailment of the train of thought. Blood-flow studies of people with schizophrenia have shown that the prefrontal areas are often interactive, and these people also have difficulty in the same visual tracking tasks that Goldman-Rakic has used in her studies of working memory. "The prefrontal areas receive a high concentration of dopamine, and drugs effective in treating schizophrenia act on dopamine receptors," said Goldman-Rakic. She points out that a fairly new drug for schizophrenia, Clozapine, both increases dopamine release in the prefrontal areas and improves patients' thinking and memory.

In the study reported in the February issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, doctors from the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, and the University of Pittsburgh compared six healthy people to six people with major depression who had not been medicated for at least two weeks.

Mood Disorders: Depression & Manic Depression "Recurrent mood disorders," "major affective disorder," "majordepression," and "manic depressive illness" are terms used todescribe the most common group of serious psychiatric conditions. These conditions involve periodic disturbances in mood,concentration, sleep, activity, appetite, and social behavior. Inthe United States alone more than 20 million people willexperience a mood disorder during their lifetime. Many cases,unfortunately, go unrecognized and untreated. The most common types of these illnesses are: Major depression(non-bipolar or unipolar), Bipolar disorder (manic depression) In the last 10 years much time and energy have been spent bymedical researchers to understand better these disorders and tofind more effective means of treating them. Modern treatments are effective and safe and usually allowpersons with a recurrent mood disorder to live useful andproductive lives. This pamphlet was prepared to help explain the course of thesedisorders, how they may affect one's life, and how they can betreated. What is "affective disorder"? The term "affect" refers to one's mood or "spirits." "Affectivedisorder" refers to changes in mood that occur during an episodeof illness marked by extreme sadness (depression) or excitement(mania) or both. "Mania" describes periods of abnormal elation and increasedactivity while "depression" describes an abnormal degree ofsadness and melancholy. The same person may have periods of maniaand depression. Occasionally, the disease presents a combination of manic anddepressive symptoms. If untreated, these episodes tend to recuror persist throughout life. What are the symptoms? The most common symptoms are changes in sleep pattern, level ofdaily activity and energy, appetite, mood, self-esteem, thinking,speech, sex drive, and interpersonal relations. In periods of excitement (hypomania) an exaggerated sense ofwell-being (euphoria) or irritability may be experienced. Therate of thinking is markedly increased. Intellectual activity takes place with lightning speed, and thereis great frustration with family and friends who do notimmediately accept or become engaged with such "flights ofideas." During a period of depression there may be persistent feelings ofsadness and emptiness, tearfulness for no apparent reason, orirritability and hostility toward others. Mental speed and activity are usually lowered; ideas are fewer.There is a poverty of thought, and responses to the environmentare painfully slowed. Family members may be surprised by dramatic changes in mood thatseem to have no obvious association with life events. Although nearly everyone experiences periods of sadness as wellas periods of well being, people with affective disorders duringan episode of illness experience these emotions to an extremedegree. There are two basic types of episodes -- periods of depressionand periods of mania. Periods of depression are characterized by: -- Poor appetite and weight loss or the opposite, increased appetite and weight gain -- Sleep disturbance: sleeping too little or sleeping too much in an irregular pattern -- Loss of energy: excessive fatigue or tiredness -- Change in activity level, either increased or decreased -- Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities -- Decreased sexual drive -- Diminished ability to think or concentrate -- Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt which may reach grossly unreasonable (delusional) proportions -- Recurrent thoughts of death or self harm, wishing to be dead or contemplating or attempting suicide Periods of hypomania or the more severe state of mania arecharacterized by: -- Persistently "high" (euphoric) or irritable mood states -- Appetite disturbance -- Decreased need for sleep -- Increased activity -- Increased sexuality -- Pressured speech -- Racing thoughts -- Loss of self-control and judgment In the bipolar or manic-depressive form of affective disorder,both depressive and manic cycles occur. Usually a period ofdepression follows a period of hypomania or mania, or thereverse. Sometimes they are separated by periods of normal ornear normal functioning. Does it go away? The onset of the first episode of an affective disorder may notbe obvious. Some people have infrequent brief, mild episodes donot seek treatment or even recognize that they are ill. Typically, episodes of illness are time-limited: they come andgo, last from several days to several months, and are followed byrelatively normal periods of mood behavior. Without treatment, the frequency of illness, as well as theseverity of symptoms, tends to increase over the years. Lessoften, a person may have only rare episodes of illness. Manic and depressive episodes present differently in differentpersons, and there are even differences in one person from oneepisode to the next. Does being depressed change feelings about oneself? Mood has a strong influence on what one thinks from moment tomoment. During periods of depression one often dwells on memoriesof losses or failures. Negative thoughts may take over, such as: "I can't be worthmuch," "No one really cares about me," "The world is terrible,"or "My parents hate me." Since these episodes may last for several months or longer, one'smorale or self esteem may become seriously impaired. Prolongedperiods of depression can lead to the wish to die or even tothoughts of killing oneself. If one goes through cycles of being "up," does that change theway one things and feels about oneself? Many individuals who have experienced the "highs" ofmanic-depressive illness describe feeling better than at anyother time of their life. They cannot understand why anyone would call their experienceabnormal or part of an illness. They feel excited, have surges ofenergy, describe feeling more creative, active, more intelligent,more sexual, able to accomplish things they never thoughtpossible. Sleep seems unnecessary. Life plans and decisions areoften out of proportion with the individual's realistic abilitiesand resources. Thus, the "high" periods of hypomania and mania can leave a falsesense of one's abilities that may be difficult to give up. Theymay be followed by crashing into despondency after the "high" hasrun its course. Decisions made during these periods are typically impulsive andreckless. Spending sprees and other indiscretions (sexual,alcoholic, etc.) are common. These periods of feeling great exaltation, self-importance andpower can cause confusion and loss of contact with reality --often more obvious to others than to the person experiencingthis elated mood state. This unrealistic euphoria seems to be a common cause of notcomplying with recommended treatment -- a lapse that can,unfortunately, lead to recurrent and incapacitating illness. What is the usual outcome of a mood disorder? More than 75 percent of individuals with the illness respond wellto medical treatment; nearly all patients respond at leastpartly. Most individuals who seek treatment and follow therecommendations of their doctor can lead productive, useful, andreasonably stable and satisfying lives. Without proper medical treatment, many such persons sufferrepeated periods of illness, hospitalization, and loss ofproductive living. What are the treatments for mood disorders? Mood disorders are medical illnesses that produce emotionalsymptoms. A common-sense treatment plan involves treating themedical symptoms as well as learning how to recognize one's ownpatterns of illness and developing ways of coping with them. In addition to taking the medication prescribed by the doctor,many patients and their families find it helpful to obtainsupportive counseling. Treatment is directed at lessening the duration and intensity ofthe episodes and preventing recurrences. It is helpful to haveaccurate records of the intensity and duration of past episodesto provide comparisons for current treatment efforts and todetermine whether there is a regular seasonal vulnerability. What medication is taken for bipolar disorder? The medication lithium carbonate was introduced for the treatmentof mania and bipolar affective disorder in the early 1950's. Ithas a powerful mood stabilizing effect and can be used safely. Itis not a sedative, but prevents extremes of mood, either high orlow. Lithium's main benefit lies in the prevention of episodes and intreating an episode after it has occurred. Manic and depressiveattacks occur less frequently and are less severe when lithium istaken regularly. Individuals with recurring manic depressive (bipolar) and someforms of recurring depressive (unipolar) illness are oftentreated with lithium. When taken regularly and at a correctdosage, there is no sedation or other effects on awareness ormental functioning. What medical tests are needed before on starts taking lithium? A medical evaluation including medical history, physicalexamination, and simple laboratory tests of blood and urine areneeded. Because lithium is almost entirely eliminated from the body bythe kidneys, laboratory tests of kidney function are done beforestarting lithium and at regular intervals thereafter. Tests of thyroid function are also advised since lithium mayoccasionally cause goiter (a harmless, treatable enlargement ofthe thyroid gland) or a mild decrease in thyroid function(hypothyroidism). A blood test of the level of thyroid hormonesis usually done at regular intervals. How is a lithium dosage determined? There is a simple, inexpensive blood test to measure the level oflithium in the blood, so the correct dosage can be preciselydetermined for each patient. Initially lithium levels are checked every few days (taking ablood sample about 12 hours after the last evening dose). Oncethe correct blood lithium level is reached, lithium levelstypically are measured monthly or less often. The day of a bloodtest, no lithium should be taken until after the test. How long will one need to take lithium? Whether a person should remain on long-term therapy after anepisode has ended depends on many individual factors. It is a decision requiring close cooperation and discussionbetween a medical specialist, the individual, and the family. Many individuals need not be on long-term lithium treatment.Treating someone for a mild illness or one that is not likely torecur for many years, if ever, unnecessarily exposes him to allthe potential risks and expenses that come with prolonged use ofany drug. Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to predict with confidencewho will fall into this more favorable group. Some individuals may have only a single episode of affectiveillness. How long someone remains on lithium following a singleepisode of mania or hypomania involves a careful individualdecision, usually based on the previous severity, duration, andpattern of recurrence of illness in the patient. If episodes are minor or widely separated, long-term medicationmay not be necessary. It is usually best to continue treatmentfor at least a few months after recovery from an acute episode ofmania, especially if it is severe enough to requirehospitalization. Those with more severe and frequent episodeswill likely need to take lithium indefinitely. What kinds of lithium preparations are available? Several preparations of lithium are available. Most are simple300 mg lithium carbonate tablets or capsules. Others are inslow-release form, and a liquid preparation of lithium citrate issometimes used. The choice of lithium preparations is based on individualpreference and cost. Capsules are sometimes preferred becausetablets may have an unpleasant taste. When it is necessary toregulate the dose in 150 mg rather that 300 mg increments, scoredtablets or liquid preparations are used. Individual requirements for lithium vary consider ably. Somepatients take 900 mg or 1200 mg of lithium carbonate in a singledose without distress, while others require several small dosesof 150 mg to 300 mg over the course of the day. What are the side effects of lithium? Can they be prevented? Lithium is non-sedating and side effects are rare. It is notaddicting. It is safe at appropriate dosages, although when takenin excess it can produce intoxication and potentially dangerousside effects. While common, most side effects are both harm less and easilydealt with. Stopping treatment is rarely necessary. The following early side-effects are common and usually subsidein several days: -- Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,stomach ache (such side effects can usually be alleviated throughadjustments of dosage and timing of administration. Simple changes, such as taking few tablets or capsules at onetime, taking them on a full stomach, or with a glass of milk, areoften effective.) -- Hand tremor -- Fine tremor of the hands at rest (It usually be gins early in treatment, although it may appear at any time, may vary, and may or may not go away over time.) -- Thirst and frequent urination -- Fatigue, a dazed feeling, muscle weakness Late side effects include: -- Hand tremor (Individuals inconvenienced by continued tremor beyond the first weeks of treatment should seek relief of the condition without interrupting their treatment. In consultation with physician, a lower dose may prove effective. If this is not possible, the addition of small doses of propranolol (Inderal) often produces a beneficial effect.) -- Severe thirst and frequent urination (These symptoms may be reversed by waiting a few weeks, lowering the dose of lithium, or by careful use of a thiazide diuretic (water pill) such as Diuril, under doctor's supervision.) -- Urinary incontinence (This may occur in some women. It can usually be helped by decreasing the dose of lithium or adding other medicine (with anticholinergic action) under a doctor's advice.) These common side effects of lithium therapy occur in perhaps 40percent of those using this medicine. Symptoms usually beginearly in treatment, although they may appear for the first timeafter months or even years of treatment. Although they may not pose a great concern, they should bepromptly reported because they may signal a change in the levelof lithium in the blood. What are the dangers of taking too much lithium? With the exception of single large overdosages, lithium poisoningor intoxication is usually of gradual onset. The signs ofbeginning lithium intoxication include loss of appetite, vomitingand diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, unsteadiness, slurred speech,muscle twitching, and severe shakiness. Although poisoning is rare with careful medical supervision, itis important to be aware of these symptoms and to recognize them. Severe intoxication or poisoning can lead to seizures, confusion,coma, and possibly death. Clearly, the daily lithium intake mustnot be increased without consulting the doctor. What about taking other medications while on lithium? Those receiving lithium, especially for the long term, may needto take other medication at some time. Other drugs may be used tosupplement lithium in treating a mood disorder, or they may beused coincidentally with lithium to treat unrelated medicalconditions. Lithium and diuretics (water pills for high blood pressure): Theelimination of lithium from the body is linked to removal ofsodium by the kidneys. Most diuretic drugs (water pills) alter this excretion pattern ofboth sodium and lithium. A decrease in dietary sodium intake canresult in a potentially dangerous increase in lithium in theblood. Dietary extremes of sodium (salt) intake should be avoided. Lowsalt diets, especially when combined with water pills, can resultin lithium retention to the point of intoxication. Most diuretics get rid of sodium from the body and can causeretention of lithium. Since these drugs are usually prescribed bygeneral physicians or internists, it is important that patientsand their doctors be aware of this interaction. Lithium need not be stopped when diuretic drugs are used but thelithium dose will almost certainly have to be lowered to maintainserum levels of lithium in a safe, therapeutic range. Lithium and Antipsychotic Medicines: Lithium is sometimes usedtogether with major tranquilizers (such as Mellaril, Thorazine,Prolixin, Haldol, and Navane), or benzodiazepines -- Valium-likedrugs -- (Klonopin and Ativan) especially in the initial phase oftreatment of acute mania. These two classes of drugs have beensafely used together for years in thousands of patients. Are there reasons not to take lithium? Lithium may be harmful to a developing fetus. Every effort shouldbe make to avoid taking lithium during early pregnancy. Women planning to get pregnant or who become pregnant whiletaking lithium, should tell their doctor immediately so lithiumcan be stopped. Similarly, a mother should not breast teed herbaby it she is taking lithium. It a doctor advises that it is not sate to stop lithium duringpregnancy, the dose should be the smallest possible to provide alow but therapeutic level. Because of changes in the way the body deals with lithium duringpregnancy and at delivery, serum determination of lithium is bestchecked frequently. Wide fluctuations in the mother's bloodlithium concentration are best avoided by use of repeated smalldoses. Some patients may be unable to take lithium because of sideeffects or medical contraindications. For others, lithium may beineffective or may produce an incomplete response. There arealternatives for these individuals. Studies completed in the past few years in Japan and the U.S.show that two drugs introduced for the treatment of epilepsy,carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproic acid (Depakene) can beeffective for acute mania, perhaps have antidepressant propertiesand work to prevent future episodes. A number of patients who failed to respond to carbamazepinealone have responded well to a combination of lithium andcarbamazepine. What are treatments for major depression? For individuals who have infrequent or recurrent periods ofdepression only, anti-depressant medication is effective.Research shows that medication coupled with supportive counselingprovides the most effective treatment. Some depressed patients have only one episode of major depressionand never relapse. In such cases, long-term anti-depressant usewould not be necessary. Who should have continued drug treatment has not been definedexactly. The number of depressive episodes and their severityhelp decide the benefits and risks. Lithium seems to prevent relapses of recurrent depression in someunipolar patients. Electroconvulsive therapy may be effective inserious cases resistant to other treatments. Recent clinical experiences sounds a cautionary note for bipolarpatients using tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidaseinhibitors during their depressions. For some, their use may inducehypomania or mania, and over time the frequency of cycles may beincreased. Careful monitoring and restricted use for limited periodsof time in bipolar patients is indicated. Several types of drugs are used in the treatment of acute orrecurrent depression. All share similar beneficial side effects,but may have different side effects. The usual daily oral dosage for a typical antidepressant(Imipramine, Tofranil, and others) is about 150 to 300 mg. Formost age groups, antidepressants may be taken safely at one time,usually at bedtime. Antidepressants typically take effect slowly. It may take 3 to 4 weeks or longer for the relief of somesymptoms of depression (especially low energy and depressed orirritable mood) while insomnia may improve within a few days. Sometimes patients think that the medicine is not helping if theydon't feel better immediately, but they should keep taking it forat least several weeks at an adequate blood level. Some of the most commonly prescribed preparations of the mostcommon type of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) are: -- Amitriptyline (Amitril, Amitriptyline, Elavil, Endep) -- Desipramine (Pertofrane; Norpramine) -- Doxepin (Sinequan) -- Imipramine (Antipress, Imavate, Imipramine, Presanubem SK-Praamine, Tofranil) -- Nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor) -- Protriptyline (Vivactyl) What are the side effects of antidepressants? Before starting antidepressant treatment, a doctor should explainthe possible side effects of the prescribed antidepressant. Ifnot, ask about them! The most common are: -- Dry mouth -- Blurred vision -- Sweating -- Dizziness when moving from a sitting to a standing position, sedation or over-stimulation -- Difficulty urinating; constipation -- Rapid pulse, or rarely, irregular heart rhythms -- Tremor -- Weight gain These side effects often decrease with time, or can be diminishedby lowering the dosage or changing to another antidepressant. Are there other kinds of antidepressants? Some studies have shown that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitorsare effective in individuals who have "atypical" depressions withmarked anxiety, hypersomnia, and craving for sweets, who may haveaccompanying preoccupation with their health (hypochondriasis),irritability, agoraphobia (fear of open or crowded spaces),social phobias or lack of energy. What are the possible side effect of MAO inhibitors? -- Postural hypotension (dizziness when standing up) -- Headaches -- Flushing -- Sedation -- Severe high blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) if certain foods, beverages, or medicines containing tyramine are taken What are the dietary and drug restrictions when taking MAOinhibitors? Certain foods and medicines can interact with MAO inhibitors toproduce potentially dangerous high blood pressure. These foodsare: -- Aged cheeses (cottage cheese and cream cheese are safe) -- Beer and wine (especially Chianti) -- Chopped liver -- Yeast products (e.g. Bovril used in gravies, Marmite) -- Sour cream and yogurt -- Broad beans (fava beans) -- Pickled herring -- Chocolate -- Medicines that can produce hypertensive crisis in combination with MAO inhibitors (including stimulants and anti asthma medicines) These foods and medicines should be avoided. Over-the-countermedicines (including sleeping pills and cold tablets) or anyprescribed medicines should not be used without checking with thepsychiatrist or family doctor. Serotonin uptake inhibitors are among the newly developedantidepressants that act selectively on a specificneurotransmitter system. The first antidepressant of its type to be marketed in the UnitedStates, Flouxetine (Prozac) acts directly on the serotonergicsystem, has relatively few side effects and for this reason hasbecome widely prescribed. The dosage is between 20 mg to 80 mg a day, with most individualsrequiring no more than 20 mg for the relief of symptoms. Usually3 to 5 weeks are required for antidepressant effect.

Flory There is growing evidence that there is a subgroup of persons with severe brain disorders (mental illnesses) whose symptoms are largely untouched by current treatment or rehabilitation efforts and who may require long-term supervised living arrangements. The term "the forgotten population" seems appropriate for this group because their needs are often overlooked in the closure of hospitals and the planning and implementation of community services. These individuals can be found in jails and prisons, among the homeless, in nursing homes and care facilities, and even in family homes. They remain largely hidden from view and forgotten. Although the exact number of individuals who are the most severely affected by deinstitutionalization and inadequate community resources for long-term care is unknown, a preliminary sense of this population follows: Diagnosis of schizophrenia Persons with schizophrenia are the severely mentally ill group most at risk for chronicity and severity of symptoms. Because of lack of adequate community services they are often homeless, imprisoned and in nursing homes. Approximately 40 percent of persons with schizophrenia do not respond well to current treatment. This is equal to approximately 720,000 persons. Seventy-four percent of neuroleptic-responsive outpatients become noncompliant within two years. The consequence of noncompliance accounts for at least 40 percent of all episodes of schizophrenia relapse and at least one-third of all acute inpatient costs. Diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder Approximately 20 percent of persons with bipolar affective disorder do not respond well to current treatment. This is equal to approximately 220,000 persons. Although the majority of persons with this disorder lead essentially normal lives, they too are among those in nursing homes and imprisoned as a result of inadequate community resources. Concurrent alcoholism/substance abuse An estimated 50 percent to 60 percent of brain-disordered inpatients have co-existing alcoholism or substance abuse. Concurrent chronic medical diagnosis Impairments of daily living are often compounded by physical incapacities among persons with severe brain disorders. Chronic brain disorders frequently go undiagnosed and untreated. Little health-services research has been done in this area. Deinstitutionalization has severely reduced access to inpatient care that extends beyond a few weeks' time. The magnitude of deinstitutionalization is evidenced by the following: The average daily census of state psychiatric hospitals dropped from 559,000 in 1955 to 92,000 in 1990, an 83.5 percent decrease. The availability of psychiatric beds has been reduced from 11 per 100,000 in 1986 to 5.2 per 100,000 in 1990 in spite of the concurrent reduction in availability of state hospital capacity. The average length of stay in hospitals has been dramatically reduced. From 1969 to 1988 the average stay in private hospitals went from 39 days to 26 days--a reduction of 33 percent. Since 1988 there have been further drastic reductions in length of stay in psychiatric units in private and general hospitals. Community resources have failed to compensate for the decline in hospital care. In many cases, resources are not available to meet basic human needs (shelter, food, and medical care). Rehabilitation services are largely unavailable, leaving persons with little or no ongoing care. This failure has resulted in: Jailed severely mentally ill: At least 30,700 severely mentally ill are in jail, and approximately twice that number are in prison. Schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder are the major diagnoses of those incarcerated. Homeless severely mentally ill: One third of 600,000 homeless suffer from severe brain disorders. Schizophrenia is common among the long-term homeless. Nursing homes: Approximately 194,300 persons with severe brain disorders live in nursing homes. Of those, 27 percent (52,451) are under 65 years of age. Nursing homes house large numbers of individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. Household population: As many as two-thirds of persons with severe brain disorders live with their families, who often become service providers by default because of the gaps in existing mental health services. The impact on families is enormous, leading to physical illnesses and severe psychological stress among family members. Group homes: Of particular concern is the limited number of group homes. Only 32,328 live in this setting. In spite of positive outcomes from a structured environment for those who are the most severely ill, there is a growing movement to locate this population in independent living arrangements with limited support. Suicides: Suicide is an increasingly common outcome of failed deinstitutionalization and lack of adequate community services. About 10 percent of those with schizophrenia and 15 percent of those with mood disorders commit suicide. This is in contrast to the rate of 1 percent for the general population. Rehospitalizations: The rate of rehospitalizations is increasing, with many readmitted 20 to 30 times.

Dual Diagnosis: Substance Abuse And Mental Illness By Agnes B. Hatfield, Ph.D. Families who have mentally ill relatives whose problems arecompounded by substance abuse face problems of enormousproportions. Mental health services are not well prepared to deal withpatients having both afflictions. Often only one of the twoproblems is identified. If both are recognized, the individual may be bounced back andforth between services for mental illness and those for substanceabuse, or they may be refused treatment by each of them. While the picture regarding dual diagnosis has not been verypositive at this point, there are now signs that the problem isbeing recognized and there is an increasing number of programstrying to address the treatment needs of people with bothproblems. Research studies are beginning to help us understand the scope ofthe problem. It is now generally agreed that as much as 50percent of the mentally ill population also has a substance abuseproblem. The drug most commonly used is alcohol, followed by marijuana andcocaine. Prescription drugs such as tranquilizers and sleepingmedicines may also be abused. The incidence of abuse is greateramong males and those in the age bracket of 18 to 44. People with mental illnesses may abuse drugs covertly withouttheir families knowing it. It is now reported that both familiesof mentally ill relatives and mental health professionalsunderestimate the amount of drug dependency among people in theircare. There may be several reasons for this. It may be difficultto separate the behaviors due to mental illness from those due todrugs. There may be a degree of denial of the problem because wehave had so little to offer people with the combined illnesses. Caregivers might prefer not to acknowledge such a frighteningproblem when so little hope has been offered. Substance abuse complicates almost every aspect of care for theperson with mental illness. First of all, of course, theseindividuals are very difficult to engage in treatment. Diagnosis is difficult because it takes time to unravel theinteracting effects of substance abuse and the mental illness. They may have difficulty being accommodated at home and may notbe tolerated in community residences of rehabilitation programs. They lose their support systems and suffer frequent relapses andhospitalizations. Violence is more prevalent among the dually diagnosed population. Both domestic violence and suicide attempts are more common, andof the mentally ill who wind up in jails and prisons, there is ahigh percentage of drug abusers. Given severe consequences of drug abuse for the mentally ill, itis reasonable to ask: "Why do they do it?" Some of them may begin to use drugs or alcohol for recreationaluse, the same as many other people do. Various factors mayaccount for their continued use. Probably many people continue their use as a misguided attempt totreat symptoms of the illness or the side effects of theirmedications. They find that they can reduce the level of anxietyor depression -- at least for the short term. Some professionals speculate that there may be some underlyingvulnerability of the individual that precipitates both mentalillness and substance abuse. They believe that these individualsmay be at risk with even mild drug use. Social factors may also play a part in continued use. Peoplewith mental illnesses suffer from what has been called "downwarddrift." This means that as a consequence of their illness they may findthemselves living in marginal neighborhoods where drug useprevails. Having great difficulty developing social relationships, somepeople find themselves more easily accepted by groups whosesocial activity is based on drug use. Some may believe that anidentity based on drug addiction is more acceptable than onebased on mental illness. We realize that this overview of the problem of drugs and mentalillness is not a very positive one. However, we believe thereare some encouraging signs that better understanding of theproblem and potential treatments are on the way. Just as families have faced other very troublesome problems inthe past and developed adequate responses to them, we believethat they can learn to deal with this one in a way that theirlives become less troubled and their relatives begin receivingbetter treatment. Treatment Programs For The Dually Diagnosed As many families have probably discovered, service systems havenot been well designed with this population in mind. Typically acommunity has treatment services for people with mental illnessin one agency and treatment for substance abuse in another. Clients are referred back and forth between them in what somehave called "ping-pong" therapy. What is needed are "hybrid"programs that address both illnesses together. Development ofthese programs locally requires considerable advocacy efforts. Limitations Of Traditional Drug Treatment Programs Treatment programs designed for people whose problems areprimarily substance abuse are generally not recommended forpeople who also have a mental illness. These programs tend to be confrontive and coercive and mostpeople with severe mental illnesses are too fragile to benefitfrom them. Heavy confrontation, intense emotional jolting, anddiscouragement of the use of medications tend to be detrimental. These treatments may produce levels of stress that exacerbatesymptoms or cause relapse. Characteristics Of Appropriate Programs Desirable programs for this population should take a more gradualapproach. Staff should recognize that denial is an inherent partof the problem. Patients often do not have insight as to the seriousness andscope of the problem. Abstinence may be a goal of the programbut should not be a precondition for entering treatment. If dually diagnosed clients do not fit into local AlcoholicsAnonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups, special peergroups based on AA principles might be developed. Clients with dual diagnosis have to proceed at their own pace intreatment. An illness model of the problem should be used ratherthan a moralistic one. Staff needs to convey understanding of how hard it is to end anaddiction problem and give credit for any accomplishments. Attention should be given to social networks that can serve asimportant reinforcers. Clients should be given opportunities tosocialize, have access to recreational activities, and developpeer relationships. Their families should be offered support andeducation. Advocacy For Effective Treatment If no appropriate programs exist in the community, families ofdually diagnosed persons may need to advocate for them. References at the end of the paper describe a number ofexperimental programs that can serve as sources of information. Advocacy should also be directed at research and training. An example of a recommended program is one conceptualized bySciacca (1987). It uses an educational approach and recognizesthe tendency for dually diagnosed individuals to deny theirproblem. The patient does not have to recognize or publicly acknowledgethat he or she has a problem. Patients meet in a group and talkabout the issue of substance abuse, view videotapes and involvethemselves in helping others. Only later do members get around to talking about their problemand the potential for treatment. A nonconfrontational style ismaintained throughout. Rather than send participants to AA or NA, members of thesegroups are invited to visit the agency. Eventually some ofSciacca's groups do go to AA and NA. Family Management And Coping It is difficult enough to cope with problems presented by arelative's mental illness, but when substance abuse is also aproblem, family stress can be multiplied. These families needall the help they can get to help them cope with the additionalburdens they face. Recognizing The Problem It was stated earlier than many families do not recognize thattheir mentally ill member also has a substance abuse problem. This is not surprising because many of the behavioral changesthat lead to suspicion of drug problems in other people, alreadyexist in persons with mental illness. Therefore, such behaviors as rebelliousness and argumentivenessor being "spacey" may be less reliable clues in this group.Observation of some of the following behaviors, however, may putfamilies on the alert: -- Suddenly having money problems -- Appearance of new friends -- Valuables disappearing from the house -- Drug paraphernalia in the house -- Long periods of time in the bathroom -- Dilated or pinpointed eyes -- Needle marks Of course, there are also those individuals who react strongly todrugs and alcohol and whose unusually chaotic behaviors leavelittle doubt regarding the use of drugs. Confronting The Problem Confronting the problem may or may not involve confronting theindividual. It is usually best not to immediately and directlyaccuse the individual of using drugs because denial is a likelyresponse. Unless one has irrefutable evidence, the person is entitled to bepresumed innocent. What one can object to are behaviors, whetheror not they are known to be influenced by drugs, which areinterfering with family life. These behaviors may take any number of forms: apathy,irritability, neglect of personal hygiene, belligerence,argumentiveness, and so forth. Since the problem of drug use is a very serious and complicatedmatter, it should be addressed in a careful deliberate manner. It is best not to try to deal with the individual when he or sheappears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, nor whenfamily members are feeling most emotionally upset about thesituation. Avoid making dire threats such as calling the police, resortingto hospitalization, or exclusion from the home unless you reallymean to do it. There is a risk that you may say things under the stress of thesituation that you don't mean. It is important that yourrelative knows where he or she stands with you and that you meanwhat you say. Develop A Plan Of Action Since it is likely to be difficult at best, select a time whenthings are relatively calm to decide what to do. Involve as manymembers of the family as possible and develop an approach all canagree upon. The following set of guidelines may help you come upwith a plan: 1. Be sure that all members agree on what the problem is. Whatexactly have members observed that has to be dealt with? Is itsome unacceptable behavior that might be caused by drugs or isthere clear evidence of drugs? What is the evidence? 2. Generate a number of possible solutions to the problem withthe goal of acting on the one(s) that all agree are the bestone(s). Of course, families will differ a great deal in what theythink is possible in their situation. What follows is a hypothetical family who might come up with someof the following suggestions: -- Relate your concerns to your relative's psychiatrist ortherapist. -- Confront him or her with your observations and request veryspecific changes in behavior. -- Plan ways to reduce access to money that might be going fordrugs. -- Do anything possible to reduce his or her needs for orinterest insocial groups that use drugs. -- Confront the person with clear evidence that he or she isusingdrugs and suggest treatment. 3. Come to an agreement about what may be the best approach totry first. 4. Develop very specific steps to carrying out your plans. Decide what role each member will have in implementing the plan. If there is a decision to confront the person directly about druguse, be prepared to give the evidence. State calmly that you believe drug use is occurring, provide theevidence, and what you want the person to do about it. Refuse toget in an argument with the person. Have a definite plan in mind, including a contact with anavailable treatment center, telephone numbers, etc., so you canproceed immediately if he or she should agree to treatment. It is important to avoid a moralistic tone about drug use. It isbetter to focus on the consequences that you have observed forthe person and for his or her family. If the family decides that the problem is serious and theindividual is likely to be lax about compliance with the family'sreasonable requests, then negative consequences may be consideredfor failure to comply. This must be weighed very carefully. It is not easy to think ofnegative consequences for adults that one can enforce and, as wehave said before, it is never wise to make threats that you don'tintend to carry out. For the usual misbehaviors, the person should be asked to makeamends or the person may lose a privilege he or she enjoys. Whenproblems get so severe that other members are at risk, the personmay be forewarned that he or she will be asked to leave. Then the family must follow through. This works better ifalternate housing can be arranged ahead of time so that thestreets do not become the only option. Families often ask if the family should insist on totalabstinence from all drug use. While authorities in the field point out that abstinence is byfar the safest option, some families may find that tolerance ofoccasional use or agreement to cut back may get reasonablecooperation whereas insistence on total abstinence will result indenial and inability to communicate further on the subject. Recreational drugs and alcohol and prescribed medications mighthave serious interactive effects. Clients and families need tobe fully informed about these possibilities. Support And Self-Care For The Rest Of The Family Coming to terms with chemical dependency of a mentally illrelative does not come easily. For a time, it just feels toopainful, too bewildering, too overwhelming to face. The family may feel terribly angry at the person and blame him orher for seeming so stupid, so weak willed as to add problems ofsubstance abuse to an already highly disturbed life. Feeling angry and rejecting unfortunately does not help thesituation and delays rational thinking about how to approach thesituation. Parents and siblings may be hurt because the addicted personblames others for his or her problems and breaks trust by lyingand stealing, and in general, creates chaos throughout thehousehold. A great deal of fear and uncertainty may prevail as behaviorbecomes more irrational and violence or threats of violenceincreases. Members of the family may feel guilty because theyfeel their relative's substance abuse is in some way their fault. It is important, first of all, to realize that substance abuse isa disease. The person who is truly addicted is no more able totake control of this problem without help than he or she is ableto take control of his mental illness. Thinking of this problem as a disease may reduce the sense ofanger and blame. Family members may learn to take negativebehaviors less personally and feel less hurt. People may cease blaming themselves and each other for a disorderthat no one could have caused or prevented. Coming to terms with substance abuse in someone you love willtake time. It will be easier if the family can close ranks,avoid blaming each other, agree on a plan of action, and providesupport to each other. It is also important to seek support from other families who aredealing with dually diagnosed relatives. This subset of familiesin the local Alliance of the Mentally Ill may find it beneficialto meet separately at times to provide support in a way best doneby other people who also have the problem. Families may want to investigate their local Alcoholic Anonymous(Al-Non) and/or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups. These supportgroups have proven to be immensely helpful to some families. Finally, it is important to say that families cannot stop theirrelative's substance abuse. They can, however, avoid covering itup or doing things that make it easy for the person to continuethe denial. Families can learn what they can do about the problem, but theymust be realistic that much of it is out of their hands. Withgreat efforts some of the painful emotions will subside, memberswill feel more serene, and life can be worthwhile again. Twelve Things To Do If Your Loved One Is Addicted To Drugs And/OrAlcohol 1. Don't regard this as a family disgrace. Recovery from anaddiction can come about just as with other illnesses. 2. Don't nag, preach or lecture to the addict/alcoholic. Chances are he/she has already told him or herself everything youcan tell them. He/she will take just so much and shut out therest. You may only increase their need to lie or force one tomake promises that cannot possibly be kept. 3. Guard against the "holier-than-thou" or martyr-like attitude. It is possible to create this impression without saying a word. An addict's sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people'sattitudes toward him/her more by small things than spoken words. 4. Don't use the "if you loved me" appeal. Since theaddict/alcoholic is compulsive and cannot be controlled bywillpower, this approach only increases guilt. It is likesaying, "If you loved me, you would not have tuberculosis." 5. Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully anddefinitely intend to carry them out. There may be times, ofcourse, when a specific action is necessary to protect children. Idle threats only make the addict/alcoholic feel you don't meanwhat you say. 6. Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it. Usuallythis only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state ofdesperation. In the end he/she will simply find news ways ofgetting more drugs/liquor. 7. Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs ordrink with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her useless. It rarely does. Besides, when you condone theusing/drinking, he/she puts off doing something to get help. 8. Don't be jealous of the method of recovery theaddict/alcoholic chooses. The tendency is to think that love ofhome and family is enough incentive for seeking recovery. Frequently the motivation of regaining self respect is morecompelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption of familyresponsibilities. You may feel left out when theaddict/alcoholic turns to other people for helping stay sober. You wouldn't be jealous of the doctor of someone needing medicalcare, would you? 9. Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery. In anyillness, there is a period of convalescence. There may berelapses and times of tension and resentment. 10. Don't try to protect the recovering person fromusing/drinking situations. It's one of the quickest ways to pushone into relapse. They must learn on their own to say "no"gracefully. If you warn people against serving him/her drinks,you will stir up old feelings of resentment and inadequacy. 11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can dofor him/herself. You cannot take the medicine for him/her. Don't remove the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it,solve it or suffer the consequences. 12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery.

(Information from NARSAD Research Newsletter, summer 1994.) Seroquel (dibenzothiazepine) Seroquel is a novel anti-psychotic agent intended for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It exhibits a high affinity for brain serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors and a low affinity for D2 receptors, a profile similar to that of clozapine. In early clinical trials, Seroquel appears to be a safe an well-tolerated agent with low EPS (extra pyramidal syndrome). Like clozapine, Seroquel does not appear to cause increase serum prolactin levels. (Elevated serum prolactin levels are frequently associated with standard anti-psychotic agents and can result in unwanted side effects in women such as breast tenderness and milk discharge.) The most frequently reported adverse effects in initial clinical trials include somnolence, dizziness, agitation, insomnia, and headache. Unlike clozapine, agranulocytosis has not been observed on Seroquel, and it is hoped that routine monitoring of the white blood cell count will not be required. Zenaca Pharmaceuticals expects Seroquel to be available in the marketplace in late 1995. Lanzac (olanzapine) Olanzapine possesses anti-psychotic activity with a low tendency to evoke EPS. In its early trials, Lanzac is showing promise a an atypical anti-psychotic. Unlike standard anti-psychotics, which improve mainly positive symptoms, patients taking Lanzac exhibited fewer positive and negative symptoms. Thus far, no agranulocytosis and only transient increases in prolactin levels have been reported. Eli Lily is in phase III of its clinical trials for Lanzac. Sertindole Sertindole has been shown in animal studies to have selectivity for the dopamine neurons that project to the limbic system (thought to be involved in the production of psychotic systems) rather than the dopaminergic neurons that project to the basal ganglia (believed to be involved in the production of EPS). It has been suggested that clozapine acts in a similar way. Serindole has been found to be generally well tolerated with minimal EPS side effects during the phase II trials just completed. Discovered and patented by H. Lundbect A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark), Serindole is licensed to Abbott Laboratories for development in the United States and Canada. A new drug application is expected to be filed in 1995. Ziprasidone (CP-88,059) Ziprasidone, a combined 5HT2/D2 antagonist (meaning it blocks these particular receptors), bears some pharmacological similarity to respiridone, a newly approved anti-psychotic with a low incidence of EPS when taken at low to moderate doses. Ziprasidone is an inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake, a property it shares with some antidepressant medications. Pfizer has just initiated phase III trials in the United States and Europe.

Already approved for routine clinical use in Canada and the United Kingdom, nefazadone's dual mechanism of action could be related to the fact that it poses a reduced risk of an array of side effects that have been associated with increases in postsynaptic 5-HT2 stimulation. These include the agitation now associated with a number of SSRI agents, the sleep disturbances associated with both depression and use of SSRI agents, and suicide ideation, which has also been associated with an up-regulation of 5-HT2. BENZODIAZEPINES What You Need to Know About Benzodiazepines Common benzodiazepines: BRAND NAME...GENERIC NAME Ativan ..... lorazepam Azene ..... chlorazepate Centrax ..... prazepam Clonopin ..... clonazepam Dalmane ..... flurazepam Halcion ..... triazolam Librium ..... chlordiazepoxide Paxipam ..... halazepam Restoril ..... temazepam Serax ..... oxazepam Valium ..... diazepam Xanax ..... alprazolam Everyone experiences anxiety at one time or an other --"butterflies in the stomach" before giving a speech, sweatypalms during a job interview, or occasional sleeplessness. Othersymptoms of anxiety include irritability, uneasiness, jumpiness,feelings of apprehension, tight muscles, rapid or irregularheartbeat, stomach ache, nausea, faintness, and breathingproblems. Anxiety is often manageable and mild. But some times it canpresent serious problems. A high level or prolonged state ofanxiety can be very incapacitating, making the activities ofdaily life difficult or impossible. A number of treatments are available to people who suffer fromanxiety disorders and insomnia. Physicians most widely recommendeither an anti-anxiety medication or behavioral therapy, orboth. The most commonly prescribed drugs for anxiety disorders arebenzodiazepines. They are also used as muscle relaxants, totreat insomnia, and to control severe epileptic seizures. Theyare effective in treating some forms of depression, and anxietyassociated with depression and schizophrenia. What are benzodiazepines? Benzodiazepines are a class of medicines with a similar chemicalstructure. There are a number of brand name medicines within thebenzodiazepine category(e.g. Ativan, Halcion, Restoril, Valiumand Zanies). Each of the brand products has slightly differentproperties. Benzodiazepines are relatively fast-acting drugs. Most begin totake effect within hours, some in even less time. Dosagegenerally starts at a low level and is gradually increased untilsymptoms diminish. Dosage varies a great deal depending onsymptoms and an individual's body chemistry. What do they do to the brain? People with serious forms of anxiety demonstrate chronicoveractivity in the areas of the brain associated with fear ornervousness. An inhibitory neurotransmitter, gammaaminobutyricacid (GABA) works in these areas to diminish thisexcessive nerve cell activity. There is evidence that benzodiazepines cause an increase inthe activity of GABA, thereby returning the system to a normallevel and reducing the associated symptoms of anxiety.They arealso believed to decrease the turnover rate of theneurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine. Are they also useful in treating muscle spasms and epilepticattacks? Yes. And they've been successful in treating the toxic psychosescaused by hallucinogenic drugs. They have many possible safemedical uses. Are they also effective in treating Insomnia? Yes. However, sleeping problems are often a symptom of othermedical conditions. It is important that the cause of poor sleepis diagnosed so that appropriate treatment can be given. Oncediagnosed and treated, sleep generally returns to normal. Are benzodiazepines used effectively to treat major mentalillness? Benzodiazepines may be useful, in low doses, for patients withschizophrenia who are beginning to show signs of relapse, and mayhelp to avoid the necessity of major in creases in neurolepticmedication. They may also be useful in treating mania. What are common side effects of benzodiazepines? Benzodiazepines generally have few side effects. Drowsiness andloss of coordination are sometimes reported. Most common isdaytime fatigue that many people find subsides within a week ortwo. Other less frequent side effects include headache, loss ofconcentration and memory problems, nervousness, depression,dizziness, dry mouth and nausea. Benzodiazepines are not recommended during the first three monthsof pregnancy. If side effects are severe or persistent, see yourphysician. Is there a potential for dependence on these drugs? What aboutaddiction to benzodiazepines? Dependence on benzodiazepines has been reported when they havebeen used continuously for many months or years. This does notmean that patients are "addicted" to their medication. Addiction is a pattern of drug abuse characterized by anoverwhelming preoccupation with the use of a drug, includingbuildup of a physical tolerance to the drug's effects and intensedrug-seeking behavior. Addiction to benzodiazepines is considered rare, except amongpersons who have been addicted to other sub stances, such ascocaine or alcohol. Evidence indicates that the great majority of patients who usebenzodiazepines appropriately for long periods do not tend toincrease their doses, do not use medicines for recreationalpurposes and do not be come dependent on them. In some cases, patients requiring long-term benzodiazepinetherapy can become dependent on their medication to functionnormally, in the same way a diabetic patient is dependent oninsulin to function normally. What If the drug is abruptly stopped? It is important to know that a sudden stop in taking the drug canproduce a seizure. Patients should discontinue the medicinegradually, under a doctor's supervision. When the dosage is tapered off gradually, the effects areminimal. Discontinuation symptoms are frequently con fused withrebound symptoms and relapse. Consult with the doctor beforediscontinuing a benzodiazepine. What are the symptoms of withdrawal? Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, shakiness, head ache,dizziness, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and in more severecases, fever, seizures, and psychosis. A withdrawal reaction maybe mistaken for a return of the anxiety, since many of thesymptoms are similar.

Introduction With the introduction of clozapine (Clozaril) in 1990 and then risperidone (Risperdal), launched in 1994, we entered a new era in the treatment of psychosis. Olanzapine (Zyprexa), just approved in September 1996, and sertindole (Serlect), to be approved soon, add to the list of what are known as the "atypical" or "new" medications. Research concerning all of these new medications indicates that they may treat a broader range of symptoms than the traditional antipsychotic medications and with fewer side effects. In all likelihood, there now will be a substantial flurry of information about new treatments for schizophrenia. Clinicians, consumers, and families have awaited improved treatments, so there will be substantial excitement when these new interventions are all available. We have listed, below, questions we believe are appropriate for consumers and their families to discuss with their doctor when making decisions about treatment with antipsychotic medication. These questions and answers are based on our clinical experience, participation in medication studies, and our literature review. Note that clinical practice has a legitimate variability, and the points made in our discussion are our opinions. We recognize that many consumers are doing well on current standard treatment. Also, the Q & A that follows presumes that consumers, family members, and physicians ought to be involved in open, candid, and clinically relevant discussions of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. 1. Is the medicine effective? All FDA-approved antipsychotic medications have been through rigorous testing and deemed effective, meaning that an antipsychotic medication reduces symptoms of psychosis statistically better than placebo. Many of the new medications--risperidone, olanzapine, and sertindole--have also been compared to traditional antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol (Haldol). All three new medicines have shown themselves to be better than placebo and at least as good, if not better than, haloperidol. It is appropriate to discuss efficacy with treating psychiatrists. 2. What range of symptoms do the antipsychotic medications treat? Over the last four decades, psychiatrists have become accustomed to focusing on positive symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and delusions. Early studies with the new medications indicate the possibility that negative symptoms may be improved, too. Discussing this with your psychiatrist is very important. In addition, the impact of the new medications on neuropsychological measures--the ability to maintain sustained attention, short-term memory, and decision-making--have been studied, so discuss these issues with your prescribing physician also. Broadly speaking, the atypical antipsychotic medicines treat a broader range of symptoms of schizophrenia than just hallucinations and delusions, or positive symptoms. The atypicals also address negative symptoms such as social withdrawal. A thoughtful discussion with your psychiatrist about which of the antipsychotic medications can best address your individual symptoms is important. 3. What is the risk of movement disorders with an antipsychotic medication? Movement-disorder side effects are a frequent consequence of the typical or traditional antipsychotics, specifically dystonia (muscle spasm); Parkinsonism (tremor, slow movements); and akathisia (restlessness). Doctors minimize these effects by trying low doses of antipsychotics or using medicines to decrease movement symptoms. The "atypical" antipsychotics got their name because they can decrease psychosis without causing movement disorders. In our experience, risperidone has few side effects at low doses, but can lead to movement-disorder symptoms in higher doses. Data from studies on sertindole and olanzapine indicate very low rates of movement side effects. Epidemiologic studies show that traditional antipsychotic medications are associated with tardive dyskinesia (uncontrollable muscle spasms resulting in a twisting of the body or neck). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) will occur in four percent of patients each year that they are exposed to the traditional antipsychotics. Put another way, after seven years of steady treatment with traditional antipsychotic medications, a person has a nearly 30 percent chance of developing TD. Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic medication, does not lead to tardive dyskinesia. Ripseridone, the first atypical antipsychotic medication for first-line use since 1994, may be associated with tardive dyskinesia in less that one percent of patients per year. The newest antipsychotic medications, olanzapine and sertindole, have probably not been tested long enough to make an estimate of their risk for TD; however, because they have low rates of Parkinsonism, we expect that the risk for tardive dyskinesia will be quite low. 4. What about other side effects and how long do they last? Briefly, the traditional antipsychotic medications can lead to side effects of sedation, galactorrhea (stimulation of milk secretions in females), sexual dysfunction in males, and, rarely, liver disorder. Because the traditional antipsychotic medications have movement-disorder side effects, psychiatrists frequently use anticholinergic medications such as benztropine (Cogentin) to treat them. These medications may lead to dry mouth, constipation, and diminished memory skills. Most people are aware that clozapine is associated with a less than one percent chance of agranulocytosis (loss of production of white blood cells). To prevent a serious outcome such as life-threatening infection, assessment of the white blood count is performed weekly for consumers on clozapine. Clozapine is also associated with seizures, sedation, drooling, and increased heart rate. However, when a patient and physician decide that clozapine is appropriate for treatment-refractory schizophrenia or antipsychotic medication and tolerance, the benefits frequently outweigh the risks. After two and one-half years of availability--during which time about one million patients have been treated with it--risperidone has proven to have few non-movement disorder side-effects; however, it can cause gastric distress and mild sedation. The medications just approved or expected to be available in late 1996--olanzapine and sertindole--have few movement-disorder side effects; nevertheless, they may have non-movement-disorder side effects such as sexual dysfunction and minor EKG abnormalities with sertindole and possible mild liver dysfunction with olanzapine. As these two medicines are quite new, doctors' experience with them is limited. When a patient talks with a physician about the choice of these new medicines, discussing side effects is appropriate. Many side effects, such as sedation, improve with time. 5. Do I have to take a combination of medicines, and do they interact? Your psychiatrist may consider using other medications with an antipsychotic medication to treat psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia. For example, lorazepam (Ativan), an anti-anxiety agent, can be used for distress or agitation. Because it is important to treat mood symptoms when they occur with psychosis, your psychiatrist may use antidepressants or mood-stabilizing agents with an antipsychotic medication. It is appropriate for the consumer and his or her psychiatrist to discuss why an added medication is used and what side effects result from the combination. For another example, when the anticonvulsant medicine, carbamazepine (Tegretol), is used with a traditional antipsychotic medication like haloperidol, the carbamazepine leads to increased metabolism of the haloperidol, and there can be reemergence of psychotic symptoms. The new antidepressant medications, specifically serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), may diminish the metabolism of other medications and increase their blood levels. Consumers and doctors certainly should review the effects of combinations of psychiatric medications. 6. What are the dosing and follow-up instructions? Some antipsychotic medications are initially administered at the dose that proves most appropriate for a consumer. As an example, haloperidol may be given at 10 mg. per day, and this may be the long-term dose for an individual consumer. For other medications, an upward titration can frequently be employed. In our opinion, starting at a somewhat lower dose of risperidone and titrating upward as needed has led to symptom reduction while diminishing side-effects. Because of symptoms of hypotension (low blood pressure): tachycardia (rapid heart beat); and sedation, clozapine is administered in a slowly increasing dosing strategy. Consumers and psychiatrists need to communicate about these side-effects so that titration can be performed appropriately. With new medications, pharmaceutical companies assess the results of clinical trials and suggest dosing strategies. However, the initial strategy may change as many thousands of people are given a new medication in clinical practice. For example, the dosing strategy for risperidone is generally different now than when it was first approved. Most clinical researchers feel that there will be adjustments in dosing strategies with the newly released olanzapine and the soon-to-be-released sertindole. This underscores the point that doctors and consumers as well as family members need to communicate clearly about dosing and follow-up instructions. 7. What should a family know? The NAMI movement has stressed psycho-education as a major tenant. Most psychiatrists working with consumers who have schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders think it is appropriate to openly discuss diagnosis, prognosis, and pharmacologic issues with these consumers and their family members. In our opinion, when a consumer and a psychiatrist talk about the choice of an antipsychotic medication, family members should be included in the discussion so that they are informed about the issues described above and that everyone hears the same information. Many clinics have printed medication information cards, and it is appropriate to ask your psychiatrist if any are available. We also encourage participation in support groups designed for consumers and families so that experiences with medications can be shared. In summary, consumers, family members, and psychiatrists are excited about the potential for fundamentally new treatments for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Although the new treatments are a step forward, their safe use does not occur in a vacuum. Meaningful communication about what the medicines can do to diminish symptoms, what the side-effects are, and how the medicines should be used are crucial for best success.

People with schizophrenia often withdraw from the world and suffer terrifying psychotic symptoms--hearing voices or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thinking, or plotting to harm them. Speech and behavior may become so disorganized that the person's actions and communications become incomprehensible and sometimes frightening to others. Even with available treatments, most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer chronically or episodically a large part of their lives. For many such individuals, the illness' persisting consequences--lost opportunities, residual symptoms, stigma, and medication side effects--may be as troubling as the psychotic symptoms. It is estimated that no more than one of every five people with schizophrenia completely recovers, while one in ten eventually commits suicide. As NAMI members know, schizophrenia research has been a top priority of the National Institute of Mental Health for almost a decade now. Rather than focusing on a summary of one research group's work, it may be most useful to highlight a number of scientific approaches being pursued around the world. Most of these studies are NIMH grant-funded research, some are done by the institute's Intramural Research Program, and some with NAMI-affiliated foundation support, such as NARSAD and the Stanley Foundation. Some of the studies described below were adapted from the recent NIMH Annual Report. Research on the Causes of Schizophrenia Schizophrenia has been the subject of considerable clinical research, yet in many ways it remains a medical mystery. Perhaps the best clue we have about the underlying causes of schizophrenia is that it runs in certain families. Twin and adoption studies have generally confirmed that genetic factors play a major role, and they may well produce the neurobiological vulnerability to schizophrenia. An international team of researchers has recently confirmed earlier reports that the frequency of schizophrenia is higher among the biological relatives than among the adoptive relatives of adoptees with schizophrenia. More specifically, the study found increased rates of chronic schizophrenia (and related schizophrenia-spectrum disorders) in the biological relatives of adoptees with chronic schizophrenia. In fact, in this Danish national sample of adoptees with chronic schizophrenia, the disorder was found ten times more often in their biological relatives than in biological relatives of normal control adoptees. This study supports the idea that familial clustering in schizophrenia is an expression of shared genetic factors. Genetic studies of large families affected by this disorder have shown that is unlikely that a single gene accounts for a majority of cases of schizophrenia. It is more likely that schizophrenia is caused by the interaction of several genes with environmental factors, perhaps those influencing brain development and function. While earlier reports of chromosome 5 linkage for genes associated with schizophrenia have turned out to be inaccurate, more recently there have been several exciting leads. A number of research groups have been studying specific markers on chromosome 6, and several are confirming linkage results in the same region of that chromosome. Thus, we may soon be able to focus research on well-documented "schizophrenia vulnerability genes." In addition to the chromosome 6 results, there are also several reports of "hot spots" for potential linkage on other chromosomes. During the remaining years of this Decade of the Brain, we can expect many exciting discoveries about schizophrenia's complex genetic mechanisms. While some scientists investigate the role of genetic factors in causing schizophrenia, others are searching for a mechanism that would explain why most people with this disorder do not first show psychotic symptoms until they reach their teen or twenties. Several have reviewed the literature on neurobiological abnormalities found in schizophrenia and concluded that abnormal pruning of neurons (the elimination of extra neurons) during adolescence may occur in susceptible individuals and that these abnormalities might then interact with other factors to produce the symptoms of schizophrenia. New neuropathological, obstetrical, and epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal factors (e.g., flu during pregnancy) may play a role in some cases of adult-onset schizophrenia. E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., and a group of NIMH scientists evaluated data on 23 identical twin pairs in which only one twin had schizophrenia to determine at what age they markedly and permanently began diverging from each other in motor skills or unusual behavior. Seven of the twins who later developed schizophrenia had become permanently different from their co-twins by age five. The other 16 twins differentiated from their co-twins between the ages of 13 and 27. The early-divergence group differed from the others on minor physical anomalies and total finger ridge counts, both of which are believed to be determined by the end of the second trimester of fetal development. As a result, the researchers concluded that some cases of adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with early prenatal events, which may include neurodevelopmental abnormalities and/or infections. One of the aims of longitudinal research in schizophrenia has been to discover early indicators of adult psychopathology. Towards this end, NIMH-Israeli High Risk Study scientists followed a group of 50 children at genetic risk for schizophrenia (having a parent with the disorder), and 50 matched controls for 25 years. The children at risk were more likely to develop schizophrenia (as well as mood and personality disorders) than were age-matched control subjects. This study also found that the information-processing abilities of adult children of subjects with schizophrenia fall in between those of patients with schizophrenia and those of controls and that measures of sustained attention and ability to focus provided the best discrimination between groups. Further analysis showed that among those genetically "at risk," poor childhood scores on tests of mental focusing were associated with the development of schizophrenia and related disorders in adulthood. Research on Treatments Clinical experience during the past 30 years has shown that the first-generation, "typical" antipsychotic medications, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, control many of the psychotic (or "positive") symptoms in most people with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the "negative" symptoms--such as emotional withdrawal and decreased motivation, communication, and social skills--are generally far less responsive to these drugs. This Decade of the Brain has brought us to the threshold of some really dramatic changes in medications available for people with schizophrenia. Typical antipsychotic agents now in use may before long be drugs of the past, thanks to a group of "atypical" (or second-generation) medications. Clozapine, the first of these "atypical" antipsychotics, appears to affect both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without the neurological (extrapyramidal) side effects associated with older drugs. Clozapine can, however, produce a life-threatening side effect (called agranulocytosis) in about one percent of patients. A newer antipsychotic called risperidone was introduced in 1994, and several experimental medications (such as olanzapine, seroquel, sertindole, and ziprasidone) are now in clinical trials and may be available in the U.S. within a year or two. The atypical antipsychotic drugs offer the possibility of better control of both positive and negative symptoms with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and probably a lower risk for later development of tardive dyskinesia. (Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by persistent, abnormal, involuntary movements, typically of the mouth or face. Extrapyramidal symptoms resemble those associated with Parkinson's disease.) Newer drugs have not been found to cause agranulocytosis. Research continues, meanwhile, on pinpointing those parts of the brain that respond to antipsychotic agents. Researchers have long assumed that the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic medications result from their binding to the D2 class of dopamine receptors in the brain. However, research on clozapine found little evidence that this drug was tightly bound to D2 sites in parts of the brain, and some have suggested that effects on serotonin may be important for antipsychotic effects of the atypical medications. NIMH-funded researchers in Sweden have used positron emission tomography (PET) scans, a neuroimaging technique, to examine the connection between the ability of a drug to bind to D2 receptors and its antipsychotic and extrapyramidal effects. They have found that extrapyramidal side effects were associated with higher D2 binding. This study suggests that efforts to develop antipsychotic drugs that have relatively low affinity for the D2 receptor may produce new medications with fewer side effects. Conclusions Research on the neurobiology of schizophrenia has accelerated, and the results of the studies may soon lead to improved treatments and new avenues for research on the origins of this disorder. A growing body of evidence from neurochemical and developmental studies suggests that some types of schizophrenia may result from prenatal pathological processes and genetic abnormalities that affect the brain. It is also becoming clearer that, while the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a role in the expression of the symptoms in persons with schizophrenia, other neurotransmitter systems are likely to be involved. These findings are now playing a key role in the testing of new medications that should prove better at reducing both positive and negative symptoms, while causing fewer troublesome side effects.

On Research Day at the NAMI convention, these researchers spoke of promising new discoveries, but also about the problems of stigma, uncertainties in healthcare financing, and mental health systems that fail to put into practice services that we already know will work. Dr. Coyle reviewed recent research on severe mental illness, stating that the function and structure of neuroanatomy in schizophrenia is now known. According to Dr. Coyle, these advances in research were made possible because of the involvement of scientists who are able to build on foundations laid by basic neuroscience research and the new powerful technologies such as mapping of gene expression in the brain and mapping of brain function. Researchers at NIMH have accomplished the steady erosion of the mind-brain dichotomy, bringing clinicians, behavioral neuroscientists, and molecular neuroscience together to solve the most elusive problems in medicine: psychiatric disorders. Dr. Coyle observed that "While the NIMH suffers from all the problems of a Washington-based bureaucracy, it has accomplished amazing science. I think it is now the time to stand by it." He added that the ridicule of scientologists should be recognized for what it is--an attempt to stop research on the biological basis of psychiatric disorder. According to Dr. Kane, we are at a very exciting time in research in mental illness. "There have been substantial achievements, and there is the likelihood that we can expect even greater achievements in the not-too-distant future. At the same time, there are threats to our ability both to conduct research and to support the kind of integration that is necessary between research in mental illness and research in other areas of medicine." Dr. Kane pointed to exciting developments in genetic linkage studies and to the development of the first new drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia in 15 years. Advances are being made in understanding abnormal brain function in disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and panic disorder. A tremendous amount of work has been done in relapse prevention in schizophrenia, and scientists are trying to better understand the strategies that are effective in preventing relapse and rehospitalization. Dr. Shern warned that changes being made by Congress are "shifting responsibility for the most vulnerable populations--which includes persons with severe mental disorders--from federal responsibility for provision of services through Medicaid and other federal programs to states. At the same time, states are changing their responsibilities, and medicine is becoming corporatized, privatized." "NAMI has made an enormous difference," said Dr. Shern. "[You have made an] enormous difference locally and nationally in focusing on the issues of persons with severe mental disorders and making systems become responsive to the needs of consumers and families." Depakote Approved For Manic Episodes Of Bipolar Disorder Depakote (divalproex sodium, a derivative of valproic acid) tablets--long a popular seizure medication--have been appproved by the FDA for the treatment of manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Marketed by Abbott Laboratories, it is the first medication indicated for manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder in 25 years. Significant improvement of manic symptoms was found in two, 21-day placebo-controlled clinical trials, and the rate of discontinuation in these trials was not statistically different between placebo, Depakote, or the active control. Depakote, which can begin alleviating symptoms in 10 days and has few side effects, offers an alternative to lithium, which has numerous side effects and can take weeks to work. With FDA approval, insurance companies will cover it and more doctors will prescribe it. Further information is available to physicians only at 708/937-2667. Depakote Found Effective For Adolescents With Mania Studying 15 patients over two years, George Papatheodorou and associates of Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Science Center found that valproic acid (Depakote) may be effective for treating mania in adolescents. The 13 females and two males, 15- to 20-years-old, had diagnoses of bipolar disorder, manic subtype, and were treated for seven weeks with Depakote, which was coadministered with other medications. Among the 13 patients completing the study, eight showed "marked" improvement, four showed "moderate" improvement, and one showed "some" improvement. Depakote was well tolerated by these 13 patients, who reported that somatic symptoms lessened by the end of treatment. The researchers believe their work holds "initial evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of divalproex sodium in the acute treatment of adolescent mania." ("The Efficacy and Safety of Divalproex Sodium in the treatment of Acute Mania in Adolescents and Young Adults: An Open Clinical Trial," G. Papatheodorou, et al, Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology 155:2, 1995.) Lithium May Help Some Children With Aggression The psychoactive drug lithium appears to be effective in treating children with aggressive-type conduct disorder severe enough to require psychiatric hospitalization, suggests a study in the April 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Lithium may be particularly helpful treating children with the affective or hostile subtype of aggression who have characteristic anger, irritability or rage, not necessarily provoked by any specific event. In contrast, a "predatory" type of aggression is often brought on by specific stimuli. The neurochemical basis of the two subtypes may be different, and the evidence suggests that the affective type may respond to lithium. In a double-blind study, 50 children diagnosed as having conduct disorder with affective subtype aggression were treated for six weeks using either lithium or placebo. Each child's condition previously failed to respond to the usual treatments and was so severe that admission to a psychiatric hospital was required. Following treatment, 68 percent of the children treated with lithium showed at least moderate improvement, compared with 40 percent of those receiving the placebo. Forty percent of the lithium-treated children displayed marked improvement, compared to only 4 percent of the placebo-treated patients. For more information, call the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 202/966-7300. Antidepressant As Good As Ritalin For ADHD Kids The antidepressant bupropion appears to be as effective as Ritalin in treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to a study published in the May issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Fifteen children between the ages of seven and seventeen were studied throughout drug treatment and a two-week "wash out' period during which they received no drug treatment. Both bupropion and Ritalin significantly improved attention and conduct in these children, as judged by their parents, teachers, and physicians. Both drugs produced similar improvements on a wide range of behavioral and psychiatric tests. Where there were differences, Ritalin tended to be more effective, though differences were slight and considered insignificant. There were few side effects with either drug. Study findings suggest that bupropion is a useful alternative for those who either do not respond to Ritalin or who cannot take it due to allergy or side effects. For further information, call the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 202-966-7300. Clozapine As A Mood Stabilizer? Researchers Carlos Zarate, Jr., and associates studied a group of patients (nine men and eight women with a mean age of 39 years) with diagnoses of "bipolar disorder (manic or mixed)" or "schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type" who had been discharged from McLean Hospital while taking clozapine alone. Eleven of 17 patients (65 percent) had been rated (by raters blind to diagnosis and baseline data) "much" or "very much" improved (according to the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale) at the time of hospital discharge, when the patients' mean clozapine dosage was 182 mg/day). Further, the researchers performed a variety of outcome measures by face-to-face or telephone interviews eight to 24 months after discharge and found that 15 of 17 (88 percent) were rated as much or very much improved on the CGI-I. This occurred when the patients' mean clozapine dosage was 304 mg/day (and six of 17 had been started on adjunctive medication). This follow-up also found that 65 percent of the patients had no "hospitalizations, affective episodes, or need of concomitant medications." Although their study was retrospective, incompletely blind, and uncontrolled, the researchers believe that some patients with severe, treatment-refractory bipolar or schizoaffective disorder may respond to clozapine acutely and derive significant mood stabilization over the long term. ("Is Clozapine a Mood Stabilizer?" C.A. Zarate, Jr., et al, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 56:3, 1995.) Promising, Unique Antidepressant Has Fewer Side Effects Recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Serzone (nefazodone HCI) is the first of a new class of dual-action antidepressants to produce the effects of both serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics. According to Jan Fawcett, M.D., professor and chair of Rush-Presbyterian-St Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, Serzone increases brain levels of serotonin (mood regulators) as the SSRI drugs do, and it blocks serotonin receptors like the tricyclics, specifically 5HT2, one of the most important depression receptors. Although no head-to-head comparisons have been done, Serzone's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, claims that Serzone combines the optimum benefits of SSRIs like Prozac with an additional boost, fewer side-effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. It also costs 10 percent to 20 percent less than other antidepressants. Clinical trials indicate that Serzone is as effective at alleviating depression as other drugs.Source: Associated Press What You Should Know Before Participating In A Research Program by Vera Hassner Sharav, quality of treatment chair, AMI-NYS Until safeguards for psychiatric patients in experimental research are improved and full disclosure requirements are universally implemented, we suggest that the following questions be asked by potential subjects of research, their families, or significant others, prior to signing consent forms. 1. Is there an independent monitor (who is not connected with the research team) assigned to ensure that patient safeguards are followed? What authority does that individual have? How will this person ensure the patient-subject's continued consent? 2. Who is authorized and available during off hours (i.e., weekends, evenings, holidays) for patients to contact in the event they wish to withdraw from a protocol. 3. During participation in a research protocol, what services and activities are available to the patient? Are these services part of the institution's normal rehabilitation and treatment program or are they available only to research subjects? 4. Are drug wash-outs required? For how long? Is it a placebo-control study? 5. If symptoms return and I am uncomfortable, will I be given medications immediately? Who is authorized to prescribe therapeutic medications upon my (or my family's) request? 6. Are non-FDA approved, investigation medications given in this protocol? Is this study being funded by the pharmaceutical company? If yes, ask to meet with a member of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) to discuss the known and potential risks involved. 7. If non-investigation drugs are involved, are these drugs approved (by the FDA) for my condition? Ask for a photocopy of the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) reference discussing the risks and side effects of this medication and ask whether you will be given the standard recommended dose. 8. If the drugs used in the study prove to be beneficial to me, am I assured that I will continue to be treated with the medication after completing the study? 9. Are there procedures that involve radiation in this study? If yes, ask to speak to the chairman of the IRB to discuss the limitations of risks. 10. Will this experiment involve any procedures that are painful or uncomfortable (e.g., injections or I-V studies, spinal taps, long periods of immobilization, sleep deprivation, dietary restrictions, bed/unit restrictions)? 11. Does the consent form cover more than one study? Is this an "umbrella" consent that will allow several procedures to be performed concomitantly or successively? 12. If there are any therapeutic benefits learned from the protocol, will I and my family be informed of this in writing? Will my patient record indicate these beneficial findings for the purpose of follow-up care? 13. What follow-up care is offered to patients who complete a study? To those who drop out?

In The American Journal of Psychiatry (November 1995), Gitlin et al. reported a study of 82 outpatients with bipolar disorder for an average of more than four years. There was a 73 percent probability that over five years a patient with bipolar disorder would relapse into an episode of mania or depression, and very likely more than once. Even subjects who did not relapse reported a considerable amount of depressive symptoms. Poor psychosocial functioning, particularly unemployment, accompanied poor syndromal course and predicted a shorter time to relapse.

Co-authors Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., director of research at NAMI, and Tami L. Mark, Ph.D., a senior research director at Project Hope examine data from the most rigorous reviews of randomized controlled trials of schizophrenia treatment. The data show that medications and psychosocial interventions--such as skills training, intensive case management, and supported employment--reduce symptoms, relapse, and hospitalization and improve functioning, quality of life, employment status, and satisfaction. "People with schizophrenia and their family members can find hope in these data," said Dr. Hall. "Treatments that work for many individuals with this severe brain disorder do exist. These data showing the effectiveness of schizophrenia treatments and supports provide an overwhelming rationale for the end of insurance discrimination based on the false notion that there is no effective treatment for schizophrenia. Furthermore, effectiveness data should increase access to treatment by informing the delivery and financing of care for people with schizophrenia. For example, these data can serve as the scientific foundation for managed care organizations to match effective and necessary treatment to those who need it."

How can I help my child to get the education he or she needs? Learn about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Your local librarian can help you locate this information, or you can contact the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities, P.O. Box 1492, Washington, DC 20013-1492. Tel: (202) 416-0300. You can also learn about IDEA from other parents through organizations such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. Call the NAMI Helpline at 1-800-950-6264 to find the telephone number of your local affiliate. What are the provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)? IDEA mandates that all children with disabilities, including those with serious emotional disturbances, must receive a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting. The key is to get services for your child at the lowest intensity of service that will meet your child's needs. Often this means bringing new services into schools that have never provided those services. The fact that the school system "never did it that way before" is no excuse. The school system is required to provide supplementary aids and services to your child to help him or her be educated in the least restrictive setting possible. Such aids and services may include (but are not limited to) a classroom or one-to-one aide, curriculum modifications, peer tutoring, untimed tests, or the provision of a tape recorder, computer, or typewriter. Your child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is the plan for his or her special education. You, as parent or guardian, have the right to attend meetings to develop the IEP that specifies exactly what your child must be taught, where and how he or she must be taught and what kind of accommodations and related services are needed to give him or her the most appropriate education. Teaching strategies and behavior-management strategies developed for children with serious emotional disorders are sometimes used inappropriately for children with NBD. You and the child's psychiatrist should work with the school system to develop an IEP tailored to your child's needs. Is therapy available in schools? IDEA is responsible for meeting only the educational needs of your child. Related services are those services that must be provided to your child so that he or she can benefit from special education instruction. Therapy is one such related service that your child may need to benefit from his or her special education. If your child needs related services, these services must be part of your child's IEP. Some school districts are collaborating with their local mental health administration, and now offer some forms of therapy through the schools. However, psychiatrists are very often not part of this team. My child has been placed on home instruction. How long can the schools system keep him at home? If your child is receiving home teaching, the home teaching can be provided for no more than 60 school days while the school system looks for an appropriate special education program, unless your child's IEP allows for an extension beyond 60 days. What happens if a public placement cannot be found? The school system must place your child in an appropriate program. If the school system cannot provide an appropriate public program, the school system must place your child in a non-public (private) school and pay for it. The school system must pay all the costs of the placement. This includes transportation. My child is an adolescent with a severe neurobiological disorder. What services are available to my son or daughter as he or she reaches adulthood? If your child is "coded," or identified with a disability such as SED under the IDEA, he or she is eligible for educational services until age 21--in most States. In addition, IDEA specifically states that transition goals should be part of a students IEP, in some children as young as 14. Nationwide there is a drop out rate of over 50% for children coded SED. If you believe your child is in risk of dropping out, insist that transition planning begin as early as possible. Transition goals and objectives will lead to the development of marketable job skills and independent living skills. Find out what opportunities exist in your community for persons with NBD to receive psychiatric rehabilitation services. Contact a local representative of your state's vocational rehabilitation program office (part of State Department of Education). Find out about the application process and what information they require to determine eligibility for your son or daughter. Usually they fund a variety of services and some may meet your child's needs as he or she becomes an adult. In addition, investigate appropriate post-secondary educational opportunities and housing options in your community. Make sure that your child is linked with adult services. If your child has dropped out, investigate the possibility of his earning a GED certificate. The adult education program of your local public schools may provide evening or weekend preparation classes for individuals over the age of 16.

This laboratory is using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans to show that individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder have increased metabolic activity and blood flow to part of their brains. "Our study shows that the obsessive-compulsive group had a 125 percent increase in the brain's frontal blood flow," says Gordon Harris, Ph.D., director of the neuroimaging lab. "For the first time, patients can see that there is a physical explanation for their disorder and that it's not purely psychological as was once believed. The test may also show how well medicines and therapy can alter the change in blood flow to the brain.

The most common side effects associated with olanzapine were insomnia, dry mouth, akathisia, and nervousness. There were no reported cases of agranulocytosis, a sometimes fatal blood disorder that has been reported in 1 to 2 percent of patients who take clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic used as a treatment for schizophrenia.

Guard against the "holier-than-thou" or martyr-like attitude.It is possible to create this impression without saying a word.An addict's sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people'sattitudes toward him/her more by small things than spoken words. 4. Don't use the "if you loved me" appeal. Since theaddict/alcoholic is compulsive and cannot be controlled bywillpower, this approach only increases guilt. It is likesaying, "If you loved me, you would not have tuberculosis." 5. Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully anddefinitely intend to carry them out. There may be times, ofcourse, when a specific action is necessary to protect children. Idle threats only make the addict/alcoholic feel you don't meanwhat you say. 6. Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it. Usuallythis only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state ofdesperation. In the end he/she will simply find news ways ofgetting more drugs/liquor. 7. Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs ordrink with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her useless. It rarely does. Besides, when you condone theusing/drinking, he/she puts off doing something to get help. 8. Don't be jealous of the method of recovery theaddict/alcoholic chooses. The tendency is to think that love ofhome and family is enough incentive for seeking recovery. Frequently the motivation of regaining self respect is morecompelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption of familyresponsibilities. You may feel left out when the addict/alcoholicturns to other people for helping stay sober. You wouldn't bejealous of the doctor of someone needing medical care, would you? 9. Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery. In anyillness, there is a period of convalescence. There may berelapses and times of tension and resentment. 10. Don't try to protect the recovering person fromusing/drinking situations. It's one of the quickest ways to pushone into relapse. They must learn on their own to say "no" gracefully. If you warnpeople against serving him/her drinks, you will stir up oldfeelings of resentment and inadequacy. 11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can dofor him/herself. You cannot take the medicine for him/her. Don't remove the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it,solve it or suffer the consequences. 12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery. ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY . . . [Return to Top] Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder What Is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed behavior disorder inchildren. The core symptoms are inattention, impulsivity, andhyperactivity. Children with ADHD are restless and fidgety,interrupt conversations, call out in class, and have difficultycompleting school assignments. They often do not have appropriatesocial skills for their age group. Although ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, it can persistinto adolescence and adulthood. As individuals with ADHD growolder, they are vulnerable to antisocial behavior, impulsiveness,and educational failure. What are the symptoms of ADHD? A child who has ADHD shows several of the followingcharacteristics: -- has difficulty organizing work and gives the impression he or she has not heard instructions. -- is easily distracted. -- makes careless, impulsive errors. -- frequently calls out in class. -- has difficulty awaiting his/her turn in groups. -- fails to follow through on parents' requests. -- is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other children of the same age. -- feels socially isolated from peers. Is ADHD associated with other neurological, biological, andbehavioral disorders? Yes. ADHD is closely associated with: 1. At least 25 percent of children with ADHD suffer from sometype of communication/learning disability. 2. Approximately 40 percent of children with ADHD exhibit signsof Conduct Disorder (starting fights, lying, stealing) orOppositional Defiant Disorder (disobedience, defiance, and rulebreaking). 3. There is a strong correlation between the neurobiologicaldisorder called Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. At least half ofpatients with Tourette's also have ADHD, (but the opposite is nottrue: half of ADHD patients do not have Tourette's). What causes ADHD? We don't fully know yet, but it clearly has biologicalunderpinnings. Many people -- including some medicalprofessionals, teachers, parents, and peers -- do not understandthese biological under pinnings. They often mislabel children with ADHD as undisciplined, stupid,lazy, or simply bad. In fact, strong scientific evidence supportsthe conclusion that persons with ADHD suffer from a brain-basedbiological disorder. Examples: 1. Biochemical studies have documented that children with ADHDhave lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. 2. Laboratory animal models relevant to ADHD reveal deficienciesin a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine. 3. Successful medications for ADHD affect the levels of severalneurotransmitters in the brain. 4. Brain imaging studies using PET scanners have shown that brainmetabolism is lower in patients with ADHD than in normalcontrols. More important, these studies show significantly lowermetabolic activity in regions of the brain that controlattention, social judgment, and movement. 5. There is strong evidence that ADHD has a genetic basis in somecases. 6. Environmental factors associated with ADHD include low birthweight, hypoxia (too little oxygen) at birth, and exposure inutero to a number of toxins including alcohol, cocaine, andnicotine. Although the possible relationship between ADHD and dietaryfactors and food additives has been widely discussed, scientificstudies have not verified dietary factors as a main cause ofADHD. What treatment is available for ADHD? A comprehensive approach is the key to successful treatment forindividuals with ADHD. Parents should derive hope from the factthat the vast majority of patients with ADHD benefit fromtreatment. Medication is successful in more than 67 percent of all ADHDindividuals, but is best managed by a specialist in this area,such as a child psychiatrist. Successful medications include stimulants such asmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemoline, plusantidepressants such as imipramine. Proper medication therapy improves attention span, controlsimpulses, dampens restlessness, improves school performance,decreases aggression, and enhances the quality of family life. Formal educational testing and an evaluation for speech andlanguage disorders should be performed. Where appropriate,parents should work with the school district to plan anindividualized education program (IEP) for their child. Behavioral modification strategies and special programsaddressing the cognitive deficits in children with ADHD may beuseful. Children can be offered specific incentives and rewardsfor changing behavior, and specific games and exercises toaddress cognitive deficits. Children with ADHD are particularly in need of support andencouragement. Since academics are frequently difficult for them,they must often find other avenues to build self-esteem, such asthrough sports, art, music or other special interests. There is little evidence that psychodynamic psychotherapy aloneis effective in children with ADHD who suffer from a truebiological disorder, but there is scientific evidence for theefficacy of several cognitive and behavioral therapies. What can I do if a family member has ADHD? First, cooperation and collaboration among an experiencedclinician, the school system, and the family are the keys todeveloping a comprehensive, successful treatment strategy for achild with ADHD. Seek the advice of your child's pediatrician, school personnel,knowledgeable friends, and national organizations such asNAMI-CAN for a referral to a clinician who specializes in thepharmacologic treatment of ADHD. Educate yourself about special education programs in your state.A new federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities EducationAct (Public Law 101 476) mandates that all disabled children areentitled to "a free appropriate public education which emphasizesspecial education and related services designed to meet theirunique needs." Work with your local school district to plan a special educationprogram for your child. Glossary of Terms Conduct Disorder: Children with this disorder persistentlydisregard rules and violate other's rights. The most common behaviors are stealing, running away, lying, firesetting, truancy from school or work, breaking into cars orbuildings, deliberate destruction of property, cruelty to animalsor people, fighting, and stealing with confrontation. Dopamine: An important neurotransmitter in the brain. Abnormaldopamine function has been implicated in a variety ofneurobiological disorders including ADHD, Tourette's Syndrome,schizophrenia, and autism. Neurotransmitter: Chemicals released from a neuron (nerve cell)in the brain to communicate with other neurons. This chemicaltransfer of information takes place in a structure called thesynapse, where parts of the neurons lie very close to oneanother. Tourette's Syndrome: An uncommon familial neurological disordercharacterized by waxing and waning motor and phonic tics pluscomplex behavioral symptoms. It is likely that Tourette's isrelated to abnormal functioning of several neurotransmitters inspecific parts of the brain.

BIPOLAR DISORDER AND DEPRESSION [Return to Top] Almost one-third of six-to-twelve-year-old children diagnosed with major depression will develop bipolar disorders within a few years, according to a study of 79 depressed children over two-to-five years reported in the May 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Most became bipolar before the onset of puberty, and 32% became bipolar at an average age of 11 years. The researchers recommend that those caring for depressed children should be on the lookout for symptoms of manic-depressive illness. They also suggested that--because antidepressants may worsen certain forms of manic illness in adults--prescribing antidepressants for children should be done with care. DEPRESSION AND THE ELDERLY [Return to Top] Oregon psychiatrists fear that severe depression can lead some elderly patients to make deadly, inappropriate decisions about continuation of medical treatment, according to a survey by researchers at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center reported in the November 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry. More than 75 percent of Americans favor legislation allowing terminally ill patients or their family members to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, but the researchers argue that severe depression may influence patients to reject medical care they might otherwise accept if their depression were treated. "Hopelessness leads to undervaluing all possible good outcomes for a medical treatment," said Linda Ganzini, M.D., and colleagues. " This study supports the hypothesis that in many depressed persons, hopelessness, pessimism and excessive emphasis on the burdens of treatment temporarily alter the person's personal formula for weighing risks and benefits of medical treatment." Ganzini's findings offer hope that psychiatrists and other physicians can predict which depressed patients are likely to have stable or unstable preferences regarding life-sustaining therapies.

NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Do Neuroleptics Help Negative Symptoms? Positron emission tomography (PET) scans can monitor the effects of antipsychotic medication by visualizing the regions in the brain where the drugs block dopamine receptors. In a report by Wolkin et al published in the March 1996 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, the researchers hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia with prominent negative symptoms would have a poorer response to treatment with the neuroleptic haloperidol. They compared cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia before and after haloperidol treatment. While haloperidol caused a decrease in prefrontal glucose metabolism and an increase in basal ganglia, this response was blunted in the patients with prominent negative symptoms (withdrawal, social problems, lack of energy, lack of concern about personal appearance, reduced ability to express emotion). These patients also performed worse on tests of cognitive ability than those with less severe negative symptoms, whose scores improved after treatment. These results suggest that patients with prominent negative symptoms may have a poorer response to neuroleptic treatment because of differences in brain metabolism.

RISPERIDONE [Return to Top] In two 8-0 votes, a panel of the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration voted on April 29 that risperidone is safe andeffective in treating schizophrenia. The medication, much cheaper than clozapine and without thedangerous side effect of agranulocytosis, could reach theAmerican market in a matter of months. The FDA is still negotiating with risperidone's manufacturer,Janssen Pharmaceutica, over guidelines for marketing the drug inthe United States. Great Britain and Canada recently approved it,and Mexico is expected to do so shortly. Risperidone is said to reduce or eliminate psychosis and voices,and it does not appear to cause sedation, blurred vision,impaired memory, or muscle stiffness. FDA approval of risperidone will mean that "thousands of youngpeople suffering from the life-threatening illness (ofschizophrenia) can have a chance to improve their lives -- livesthat have been too often ended or totally devastated by itssymptoms," declared Martin S. Willick, a psychiatrist, lecturerat Columbia University and NAMI member, at the FDA hearing. Speaking "as a parent of a schizophrenic son whose life hasbeen overwhelmingly affected by this disease," Willick notedthat consumers, family members and mental health professionalswere "enormously encouraged by the introduction of clozapine afew years ago. We have seen some dramatic improvements and verymany good, though modest improvements." But hundreds of thousands of patients -- including his son --did not sufficiently respond to clozapine or other medications.His son improved, but developed a potentially fatal bloodcomplication, and had to stop taking clozapine. Still, "theimprovement we saw...has given us hope that new drugs likerisperidone will help him as well," Willick said. Thousands of Dollars Cheaper No price has yet been established for risperidone in the U.S.,which will be sold under the brand name Risperdal. But it isexpected to be cheaper than the average price of clozapine,which requires expensive weekly blood monitoring, and togetherthe cost is more than $8,000 year. Risperdal is priced at lessthan $800 in Canadian dollars for a year's supply. Clinical trials of risperidone have inspired cautious optimism.Wayne Fenton, MD and Beth Lee, RN at Chestnut Lodge ResearchInstitute in Rockville, MD report that several patients who havenot responded to other medications are responding well torisperidone. One of the patients at Chestnut Lodge said in a telephoneinterview that she began to feel better after two weeks of takingthe medication. Now, after eight months, she feels like a different per son:"It's better than anything I've ever been on, and I've been oneverything. I don't hallucinate any more. I don't have delusionsor stereotyped thinking. I have a sense of humor now. I'm able tocommunicate with people. I have a life now," she exclaimed. Before risperidone, "I was pretty much a vegetable." She hasa volunteer job now, and hopes to go back to school in thefall. Between episodes of her illness, she attended medicalschool. "I want to catch up on lost time." One NAMI member from Tennessee who has taken risperidone for ayear said in a telephone inter view that the medication hasalleviated his depression and "I'm thinking about getting ajob." Risperidone, he said, "is a pretty good medication, but I'mstill looking for a better one. It has caused me to gain a lot ofweight, and may be causing visual hallucinations." His doctor speculates that the hallucinations may result morefrom "the course of the illness than the risperidone," the NAMImember noted. Not a Miracle Drug But neither Lee, the nurse at Chestnut Lodge, nor Kenneth Jobsan,a psychopharmacologist in Knoxville, TN want to raise hopes toohigh. Some patients in Chestnut Lodge's relatively small study did notrespond well to risperidone, Lee said, and Jobson said only a fewof his patients have done better on it than on clozapine. Three people who took risperidone "had a brief dramatic responseand then lost that response. We don't quite know why," Jobsonsaid. Jobson did relate the story of a patient whose life may have beensaved by risperidone. The patient had to stop taking clozapinewhen he was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer, for fear ofdangerous complications between clozapine and chemotherapy. Risperidone was substituted while the patient underwentchemotherapy. Jobson said the lung cancer remains in remission,and the patient has felt much better on risperidone than he everdid on clozapine. Families of people with schizophrenia have been anxious to seerisperidone available on the U.S. market for more than a year. Many have expressed impatience with the FDA approval process."Several times a week, we get calls from family members who aredesperate because their relatives can't take clozapine or can'tafford it. They want to know how they can get risperidone, andhow soon other medications will be available," said NAMI ResearchAdvocate James Cromwell. "We have to say, 'It's up to the FDA. But we are encouraged bythe action of the advisory committee.'" Other Drugs in Pipeline About 16 new medications to treat mental illnesses are indevelopment, according to the Pharmaceutical ManufacturersAssociation. NAMI has asked the FDA to speed up its approvalprocess for these drugs on the grounds that mental illnesses are"life-threatening diseases." Between 10 and 15 percent of patients with schizophrenia, forexample, commit suicide. If the FDA put drugs to treat mentalillness on a "fast track," they could be approved in six months. In testimony before the FDA, NAMI Legal Affairs Director RonHonberg urged the FDA to ensure that "promising new treatmentsfor (mental) disorders are made available to those who need themas quickly as possible." The FDA should "place the same emphasis and priority on researchand development of new treatments for schizophrenia as is putinto finding cures for other devastating illnesses such as heartdisease, cancer and HIV. The magnitude and impact ofschizophrenia and other severe mental illness on society and onthe individuals who suffer from them is as profound as any otherdisease affecting Americans today... "New medications can mean the difference between suicide orlife-long suffering in back wards of state institutions on theone hand and opportunities to live meaningful, independent andproductive lives in society on the other ... "These treatments will also lead to decreases in indirect costsrelated to dependence on entitlements and lost productivity,"Honberg said. What You Can Do?

STARTING RISPERIDONE AFTER CLOZAPINE [Return to Top] What is the concern about stopping clozapine to startrisperidone? On September 21, 1994, in response to concerns expressed by thefamilies of people with schizophrenia, the National Institute ofMental Health (NIMH) sponsored a workshop to explore the effectsof clozapine discontinuation and the availability of risperidone(Risperdal), co-chaired by the authors. During July and Augustof 1994, NIMH began receiving telephone reports from patients'families describing individuals with schizophrenia who had beentreated with clozapine and who were abruptly discontinued from itand started on the newly available antipsychotic risperidone. In several cases, this rapid shift in medication was associatedwith dramatic increases in clinical symptoms requiringrehospitalization. Existing guidelines for clozapinediscontinuation indicate that gradual tapering over one or twoweeks should take place. Abrupt discontinuation shouldonly occur in response to severe side effects. NIMH staff notified the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),conducted a literature review, and contacted a number of clinicalinvestigators who have studied these drugs as well asrepresentatives of Janssen and Sandoz pharmaceutical companies(the makers of risperidone and clozapine, respectively). The literature search revealed several case studies reportingwhat was described as "rebounding psychosis" followingdiscontinuation of clozapine and one controlled clinical trialcomparing clinical symptomatology following abruptdiscontinuation of chlorpromazine vs. clozapine. Inthe latter study, a subgroup of patients experienced symptomincreases that exceeded the levels originally present. What have clinicians found? Several leading clinical scientists attending the workshoprecounted their experience with clozapine discontinuation. Somenoted that patients might experience an increase in symptoms(following withdrawal of clozapine) more rapidly than withstandard antipsychotic (AP) medications due to clozapine'sshorter elimination half-life and the more rapid dissipation ofits clinical effects. Investigators discussed several instances involving peopleabruptly discontinued from clozapine who then deterioratedclinically. In some cases, there were physical reactionsincluding nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms that mightrepresent withdrawal of a medication with stronganticholinergic effects. Increases in schizophrenia symptoms,which in a few patients were reported to be more severe thanthose prior to beginning clozapine, were also reported by severalclinical researchers. It is not known whether worsening of clinical symptoms is moreproblematic when discontinuing clozapine than standardanti-psychotic medication, and there is very little hard data onthis subject, a point emphasized by representatives of Sandoz andthe FDA. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty that clinicaldeterioration is more rapid, severe, or frequent following abruptclozapine discontinuation, despite anecdotal and small-sampleevidence noted above. Additional clinical observations suggested that some patientsrecently taken off clozapine could also be at increased risk fordeveloping extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). It was noted thatsome people who had never experienced severe EPS were quitesensitive to them as they were taken off clozapine, although thissensitivity was temporary. If such patients were switched to risperidone, there could bepotential problems with the interpretation of these symptoms. Since much of the information on risperidone has emphasizedits relative lack of EPS, motor side effects and excitement mightbe misinterpreted as a worsening of psychosis rather thanakathisia, a form a EPS. What do NAMI and Janssen say? Dr. Dale Johnson, representing NAMI, indicated that NAMI too hadheard reports of clinical deterioration in people removed fromclozapine. He noted that a number of people withschizophrenia are bothered by the requirement for weekly blooddrawing as well as the side effects of clozapine and may want totry new medications. In some cases, people may be subjectto abrupt discontinuation of clozapine in order to switch toalternative treatments. Dr. Jennifer Hardin, representing Janssen, indicated that whilemany patients are now being treated with risperidone, clinicaltrials prior to marketing did not use large numbers of patientswho had been treated with clozapine (or were non-responders tostandard AP treatment), so they could not evaluate its value forsuch patients. Language in the risperidone packaging originally indicated thatpatients should be discontinued from other AP medicationsimmediately before starting risperidone. Dr. Hardin noted thatlabeling instructions were being modified to indicate thatpatients beginning risperidone should no longer be rapidlydiscontinued from previous AP treatments. The package insert nowstates: There are no systematically collected data to specificallyaddress switching from other antipsychotics to Risperdal, orconcerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotictreatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradualdiscontinuation may be most appropriate for other patients. Inall cases, the period overlapping antipsychotic administrationshould be minimized....The need for continuing existing EPSmedication should be reevaluated periodically. What should consumers and families watch for? To summarize, the NIMH recently brought together a group ofpsychopharmacology research experts to discuss reports ofclinical deterioration (psychotic symptom increases, physicalwithdrawal symptoms, and EPS) in some individuals withschizophrenia who had been abruptly discontinued from clozapine. Consumers and families are reminded that the recommendedwithdrawal schedule for clozapine indicates that ONE TO TWO weeksshould be expected for tapering off clozapine, and someclinical researchers have suggested longer taper durations. SWITCHING FROM CLOZAPINETO RISPERIDONE DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH TAPERING IS UNNECESSARY. We have no evidence that risperidone is responsible for producingthe clinical problems reported, as similar reactions have beendescribed in some individuals abruptly discontinued fromclozapine due to side effects (prior to the introduction ofrisperidone). Those who wish to try risperidoneshould also be aware that it may not produce all of the samebenefits as clozapine, and it has not been proven effective fortreatment-resistant schizophrenia. People who are doing well on clozapine and are able to tolerateits side effects may not be goodcandidates for clozapine discontinuation. Questions raised byfamily members about how best to make transitions from onetreatment to another may now stimulate much-needed studies onthese important issues and thereby help shape future researchdesigns. by David Shore, M.D., and Jeffrey A.

TARDIVE DYSKINESIA (TD) [Return to Top] What is TD? Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a term coined in 1964, describes a setof abnormal, involuntary movements of the orofacial area orextremities. TD is thought to result from prolonged treatment with theneuroleptic (anti-psychotic) medications that help to controlsymptoms of severe mental illnesses, particularly schizophrenia.Tardive means "late"; dyskinesia means "movement disorder." What are the symptoms of TD? The symptoms of TD range from occasional to continuous, and frombarely perceptible to blatant. At one extreme are slightmovements such as involuntary blinking, lip-licking,tongue-twitching or foot tapping -- symptoms that may gounnoticed even by the patient, his/her family or doctor. At the other extreme are conspicuous movements such as writhing,rocking, twisting, jerking, flexing and stiffening of virtuallyany or all parts of the body. Fortunately, the occurrence of severe cases of TD is relativelyrare (about 5 percent). How do anti-psychotic drugs increase the risk of TD? No one knows for sure, yet, how anti-psychotic drugs do whatthey're supposed to do, much less how they increase the risk ofTD. This, however, is clear: antipsychotic drugs change how nerveimpulses jump from one set of nerve cells (pre-synaptic neurons)across a gap (synapse) to another set of nerve cells(post-synaptic receptors). The impulses are carried by substances called"neurotransmitters". Anti-psychotic drugs block a particularneurotransmitter called "dopamine," allowing little of it toreach the post-synaptic receptors. It is assumed (but not proven) that dopamine blockades invarious nerve pathways of the brain cause the unwanted effects ofanti-psychotic drugs. However, dopamine blockades in one keynerve path way may also be responsible for movement disordersincluding TD. According to one hypothesis, the dopamine blockade results in thepost-synaptic receptors becoming hypersensitive to the littledopamine that does leak through. Constant (and possibly in creasing) doses of medications may beneeded to keep dopamine from playing havoc with the hypersensitive receptors. Perhaps no single hypothesis will ever fully explain TD becauseit may not be a single disorder. Instead, TD may encompass two ormore disorders -- each with a different cause and treatment. Recent studies suggest that other neurotransmitters such asnorepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA may play a role in thedevelopment of TD. To date, it is thought that all commercially availableneuroleptic medications cause TD. The experimental neurolepticclozapine, which is scheduled to become available for use inselected patients in the U.S.A., is thought to not cause TD. This observation lends considerable hope to the possibility thatbetter anti-psychotic agents will be developed. If anti-psychotic drugs can cause TD, why use them? Research literature provides ample evidence that for most chronicpatients, anti-psychotic drugs offer higher reliability, greatereffectiveness, easier accessibility, and fewer hazards than anyother treatment. One study indicates that the relapse rate of acute mentalillness in a group staying on anti-psychotic drugs in a one yearperiod is about seven to 10 percent. For those going offmedication, the recurrence rate is between 70 to 80 percent witha year. What can patients and their families do about TD? Maintain frequent contact with a psychiatrist well trained in theuse of anti-psychotic drugs. Maintenance dosages should be keptas low as possible and still control symptoms. New research is finding that doses can be reduced if carefulattention is paid to "prodromal" or early warning signs ofpsychosis. They should be discontinued when no longer need ed. No one shouldtake these medicines if they are not benefiting from them.Usually neuroleptic medications are prescribed on a long-termbasis for diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,depression with psychotic features, bipolar illness and organicbrain syndromes. Certainly, neuroleptics may be prescribed for additionaldiagnoses, but if they are, it is important to discuss thestrategy with the prescribing psychiatrist. Ask the psychiatrist to discuss the "risk-benefit ratio" of theparticular medication that is prescribed. Be alert to thesymptoms of TD as described in this pamphlet. Promptly call themto the attention of your doctor. Support studies of TD and newerneuroleptic medications. How common is TD? Long-term studies have determined that TD develops in 15 to 20percent of the patients taking anti-psychotic drugs for severalyears. In the United States, where there are about 2 million peopleafflicted with schizophrenia, that means at least 300,000 peoplewith TD. Recent studies indicate that the average yearly incidence rate(new cases) ranges from .04 to .08 per year. We see a relativelyconstant rate of new cases during at least the first seven yearsof treatment with neuroleptics. It is still unclear if this ratecontinues to climb after this period of exposure. Can patients at risk for developing TD be identified? The risk of developing TD appears to be highest among elderly,chronic patients who have taken the drugs for the longestperiods. That is all that is known at this time. Is anyone doing research on TD? Because of the increasing magnitude of the problem, much researchis underway. For example, the National Institute of MentalHealth has given a research team at Yale University almost$1 million to find ways to decrease the major side effects ofantipsychotic drugs. These researchers are developing alternate treatments, studyingrisk factors, and experimenting with lowered drug doses to findthe point at which side effects disappear but the drugs are stilleffective.

NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Neurobiological Brain Disorders: Does my child have one? If you are a parent or guardian of a child that has been identified with a serious emotional disorder (SED), a neurobiological brain disorder (NBD), or mental illness, you are the best judge of your child's special needs and particular strengths. Your direct and active participation in his or her treatment is essential to successful outcomes as your child receives services from the mental health and educational communities. I've been told my child is seriously emotionally disturbed. What does that mean? Serious emotional disturbance (SED) is a broad term used by school systems to classify students that exhibit any of a wide variety of behavioral disorders or mental health problems. These problems may be due to sociological or environmental causes (such as abuse, neglect, crime, poverty, or emotional, neurotic, or life-adjustment issues) but SED also includes children with neurobiological brain disorders (NBD). What are neurobiological disorders, or mental illnesses in children? Neurobiological disorders, neurobiological brain disorders (NBD), and mental illness are terms used for a group of brain disorders that cause disturbances in thinking, feeling, or relating. These disorders result in a substantially reduced capacity for coping with the ordinary demands of everyday life. Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, including children and adolescents. They can occur in any family, and they are not anyone's fault. What specific disorders, sometimes referred to by professionals as diagnostic categories, are considered neurobiological disorders? Schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, bipolar disorder (manic depression), major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, borderline personality disorder, autism, pervasive developmental disorders, Tourette's syndrome, and attention deficit disorder (with or without hyperactivity) are a class of severe and persistent neurobiological brain disorders. You can learn more about these disorders by consulting The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (referred to as "DSM-IV"), published by the American Psychiatric Association. It is available in the reference section of most public libraries and in Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AMI) libraries.How do I know if my child is affected? If you suspect your child is ill, or if a teacher or school counselor suggests that your child should be evaluated, you should seek a professional's advice. NAMI would recommend a psychiatric evaluation, preferably performed by a psychiatrist who specializes in children and adolescents. How can I get an accurate diagnosis for my child? Research in the biomedical field is ensuring more accurate diagnoses. Well-qualified and licensed psychiatrists that can evaluate and make a diagnosis can be found in university-affiliated schools and hospitals and in private practice. Most younger psychiatrists, trained in the past 10 to 15 years, recognize that all brain disorders have a biological underpinning. These medical doctors will outline the kind of treatment they believe will be most appropriate for your child. You will want to choose a professional who respects your role and views the family not as part of the child's problem, but as a strength the child can build on. What kind of treatments or programs should I be seeking for my child? If you have been able to get an accurate diagnosis, you are well on your way. Your child's psychiatrist may offer medication or a combination of medication and psychotherapy. The doctor may suggest that another person(such as a social worker or psychologist(provide the therapy while he overseas the medication. The therapist generally talks extensively with the child about his feelings and conflicts, his current problems, and how to establish good relationships with those around him. Parents need to be informed about the goals of psychotherapy, behavior-management techniques, and family therapy. Ask questions. Find out the qualifications of various therapists. Find out how long such therapies will last and how much they will cost. Who will pay if you cannot? Be an informed consumer. Ask other families who have been through similar situations. AMI and AMI-CAN families generally have answers to these and other questions you will have. Where can I find out about medications that have been prescribed for my child? First, ask the psychiatrist who prescribed them. Questions you will want to ask include: What symptoms might the medication alter? When and how should the medication be taken? What side effects should I be looking for? What are the short- and long-term effects of the medications? Are there any toxic side effects that the child may experience that I should tell the physician about immediately? What strategies will lessen the side-effects normally associated with the medication.

NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE TREATABLE . . . Mental Illnesses Are Treatable Neurobiological Disorders Our nation's investment in mental illness research has beenpaying outstanding dividends. New medications and psychosocialtreatments resulting from this investment will more than pay fortheir development costs by offsetting the tremendous burden nowborne by society. For example, the 1969 introduction of lithium to treatmanic-depressive illness resulted in average yearly savings intreatment costs of $290 million in the United States. In this, the "Decade of the Brain", research supported by thefederal National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -- now part ofthe world-renowned National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- hasspawned revolutionary breakthroughs in treatment so that millionsof Americans can be helped to lead more productive, less painfullives. The 1990 introduction of clozapine to the U.S. market haspermitted thousands of previously treatment-resistant personswith schizophrenia to regain social and economic productivity. While the causes of mental illnesses remain unknown, data fromseveral major studies illuminate the role of biological factorsin schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. The Cost Of Not Providing Care Untreated or under-treated mental illness results in enormouscosts to society, including lost work, reduced productivity, andprison recidivism. The number of persons with mental illness among the homeless isestimated to be between 200,000 and 350,000 persons. There is ashocking high rate of suicide among persons with severe mentalillnesses on our nation's streets, and in its shelters and jails. The recent federal Interagency Task Force Report on Homelessnessand Severe Mental Illness " Outcasts on Main Street " vividlydepicts the personal and societal consequences of this failedcommitment to a vulnerable class of citizens. In September, NAMI and Public Citizen Health Research Groupreleased a national study Criminalizing the Seriously MentallyIll: The Abuse of Jails as Mental Hospitals revealing that over37,000 mentally ill individuals are now in jails, most chargedwith simple misdemeanors such as loitering or trespassing. Nearly one third of these persons have not been charged with anycrime; they have been arrested on "mercy bookings" because accessto mental health care is restricted or denied. A pervasive public stigma against persons with mental illnessesmanifests itself in countless ways, only one of which is ininsurance coverage. Third-party payers typically cover the costs of treatment fornon-psychiatric or physical illnesses in full, or with minimumpatient contribution, while excluding or limiting coverage of thetreatment of mental (or psychiatric) illnesses. Schizophrenia and severe depressive illness are essentiallyviewed by private industry and government as second-classillnesses in this country. Often private coverage is limited to $1000 a year for outpatientcare and 30 days of annual hospitalization with a $25,000lifetime maximum, while similar limitations do not exist for thetreatment of cancer, diabetes or heart disease. These misguided restrictions often force families to depletetheir lifetime savings, liquidate their homes and personalbelongings, and ultimately rely upon an under-funded andoverburdened public system. For persons fortunate to be enrolled in a minimally-acceptableemployer-provided insurance program, the irony is thatprofessional mobility is restricted because of industry-wide"pre-existing condition" clauses. Persons with severe mental illnesses are particularly impacted bythese restrictions, as mental illness often strikes during thelate teen years and early adulthood. Many young persons find themselves in limbo -- too old tocontinue coverage under their parents' policy and too young to bein the workforce where insurance is generally purchased. Andmost persons diagnosed as mentally ill are unable to qualify forany form of health insurance. Insurance For Mental Illness Is Feasible The debate over national health care reveals a concern thatinsurance cannot support endless psychotherapy for "problems ofliving" that affect the so-called "worried well". NAMI agrees that such non-medical interventions are not vital tothe needs of persons who suffer severe mental illnesses. We do assert that advances in diagnosis and treatment forspecific, biologically-based, severe psychiatric disorders makethem relatively inexpensive additions to private coverage. The cost of caring for persons with mental illnesses in thecommunity in the PACT Program of Dane County, Wisconsin hasreduced costs by two-thirds. This model program, now 20 years old, is widely acknowledged tooffer state of the art treatment and support for persons withsevere mental illness. In the 102nd Congress, a bipartisan group of twenty-one U.S.Senators, led by Senator Pete V. Domenici and including thenSenator Albert Gore, Jr., co-sponsored legislation (S. 2696)which would establish a comprehensive federal policy with respectto provision of the health care coverage and services to personswith severe mental illnesses. Several state legislatures have either enacted or consideredproposed legislation covering the more severe mental illnesses,once presented with the relevant data outlining the incidence ofthese illnesses and the modest medical treatment costs associatedwith their management. Actuarial data on the costs/benefits associated with coverage ofthe most severe mental illnesses have been instrumental inconvincing policy-makers across the country that these illnessescan be included in insurance coverage at only a small additionalpremium cost when set against a large pool of insured persons. For example, the added cost of covering the biologically-basedmental illnesses on the same basis as other physical illnessesfor residents of the State of Maryland is estimated atapproximately $1.00 per covered person per month. A Coopers and Lybrand study of residents of the State ofCalifornia yielded a $0.78 increase in premium cost. The federalNIMH is currently evaluating national cost data for utilizationin the 103rd Congress. In order to keep total costs within tolerable limits the Domenicisponsors and certain state legislatures have recognized the needto draw some distinctions between the severe and persistentillnesses and emotional distress associated with life events. The costs of treatment of severe brain disorders are notexcessive as studies have proven, if the patient has available,and adheres to, an integrated regime of treatment withpharmacological agents, medical monitoring, and some supportiveservices. Cost Containment Strategy President Clinton has repeatedly stated his belief thatgovernment must first serve those in our society who are mostvulnerable. NAMI supports this position and believes that the direct andindirect costs associated with the lack of adequate health carecoverage for people with severe mental illnesses far exceed thecosts associated with providing treatment services. NAMI believes that mandating health insurance coverage for thesevere mental illnesses could slow the explosive growth ofMedicaid, SSI and SSDI since persons with mental illnesses arethe largest single group among those now covered. Over time, more equitable coverage of persons with severe mentalillnesses will also stem the tide of persons with mentalillnesses in crisis now pouring into jails, emergency rooms, andshelters. People with severe mental illnesses are a growing burden onpublic hospitals which face rapid escalation in the cost ofuncompensated care. By shifting those specific costs to the private sector andtreating severe mental illnesses like any other major illnesssuch as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, an entire group ofvulnerable disabled people can avoid descent into poverty whichtypically occurs when psychiatric benefits are exhausted but theillness continues. Managed Care And Managed Competition Given the dismal failure of our present fee-for-service thirdparty reimbursement system, NAMI members view with cautiousoptimism the new emphasis on organized systems of health caredelivery. The emphasis within these delivery systems on the total caremanagement for the individual seeking treatment services couldwell mitigate the problems associated with the fragmented fundingand delivery system which currently exists for persons withsevere mental illnesses and allow for a continuum ofmedically-necessary and appropriate services. In addition, the large health insurance purchasing groups shouldcertainly have the economic clout to negotiate more comprehensivecoverage of benefits than is presently available for smallemployers and individuals, thereby assuring greater consumeraccess to coverage. The fact that pre-existing condition exclusion clauses would berepealed also removes a widespread barrier to insurance coveragefor persons with disabilities. The managed competition model's reliance on treatment outcomesand practice guidelines should promote greater accountability toinsurers and consumers alike that limited health care dollars areutilized wisely and effectively. NAMI strongly calls for a role for consumers and family membersin the governance of these new health insuring structures as wellas in ongoing monitoring to assure high quality clinical servicesin both hospital and outpatient settings. At the same time, NAMI members join with our colleaguesthroughout the disability community in wishing to reservejudgement until a new delivery system is operational and fullyevaluated by consumers and their family members. Our primary concern at this time is whether specialty careservices -- such as those provided by a psychiatrist to anindividual with a severe mental illness -- can be integrated intothe core benefit package likely to be required in any accountablehealth plan. The range of treatment needs for persons disabled by illness ispresently provided through the state Medicaid program throughseveral optional benefits. Should Medicaid be repealed the discussion must immediatelycenter on how best to ensure access to rehabilitation,pharmaceuticals, case management and other support serviceswithin the framework of the managed care model. The acute care insurance model with its emphasis on physician andhospital services is critical to this population, but not nearlysufficient. The services provided through the public sector of government(Medicaid and the state hospital system ) must continue tobe provided, either through direct inclusion in the basicbenefits package or perhaps through contracts or otheraffiliations with existing public providers. For the longer term services needed for full consumer functioningin society, such as housing supports and vocationalrehabilitation services, NAMI insists that government continue tosupport them categorically and with sufficient funding. Continuous and timely access to specialized treatment andrehabilitative services must be assured if in fact these servicesare mandated within the managed care model. With the emphasis on pre-paid capitated financing, an incentiveis inherently created to prudently manage the fixed health carebudget, perhaps to the point of discouraging access topsychiatric specialty services. NAMI feels that for those individuals in need of more thanprimary care services consideration be given to assigning apsychiatrist as the primary care gatekeeper who would then beresponsible for managing that individual's treatment planning. All too often, our members report, general medical professionalsare poorly trained in the management of psychiatric illness andlacking the continuing education to stay abreast of moderneffective treatment interventions. While severe mental illnesses cannot be prevented with thecurrent state of medical science, specific, recurring episodes ofpsychosis, mania, depression and other aspects of the illnessescan be prevented by early identification and early initiation ofgood treatment regimens. Innovative programs such as those in Madison, Wisconsin andWaterloo, Iowa feature a central authority, like the managed care"gatekeeper" which is responsible for all aspects of treatmentand services provision. In these example areas, the cost of treatment was reduced by morethan two-thirds in the years following implementation. Importantto the success of these integrated services models is thecontinuous treatment, team concept which integrates and linksmedical and social support services. Summary Given the broad agreement that coverage of severe mental illnessreduces societal costs in terms of homelessness, reliance on thecriminal justice system, and other social and welfare programs,the following summarize NAMI policy objectives in health carereform efforts: -- Distinction between severe, disabling brain disorders andemotional distress associated with problems of living in order tokeep program costs within reasonable limits. -- Attention and resources must be devoted to the needs ofpersons with chronic and disabling illnesses in any acute caremodel. -- Integration of medical, rehabilitative and social supportservices in the delivery system. -- Attention to the needs of special populations, e.g. veterans,children and ethnic minorities. -- Attention to maintaining and equalizing guaranteed access tolong-term rehabilitation services when and if Medicaid support isphased out. -- Emphasis on treatment guidelines and treatment outcomes tocreate accountability. -- Consumer and family involvement in evaluation of programeffectiveness.

First-trimester use of Prozac was not associated with any problems. This new finding contrasts with data from several previous studies that failed to find a link between Prozac and birth defects or other problems for women and their offspring. Also, an accompanying editorial in the journal pointed out problems in the study. The research attracted publicity because of a press release from the March of Dimes urging pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant to avoid taking Prozac. The New England Journal study compared the birth outcomes of 482 women on Prozac with those taking no antidepressant medication at all. The pregnant women taking Prozac were divided into two groups: those taking the medication early in their pregnancy and those taking the medication throughout pregnancy. The women taking Prozac had the following primary diagnoses: depression (nearly 80 percent), panic disorder (6.4 percent); bipolar disorder (5.8 percent), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (4 percent). Other variables distinguished between the two groups of women. Women taking Prozac more frequently took other psychotropic medications, were older as a group, and smoked more frequently (especially women in their third trimester taking Prozac). These women, especially those who took the medication throughout pregnancy, may also have had a more severe and/or disabling illness. All of these factors could have influenced the results and limited the interpretation of the study's results. Women taking Prozac in their first trimester experienced no increase in major anomalies (such as cleft palate and heart defects) in their offspring, but there was an increase in multiple minor anomalies, which were not listed in the article. Taking any medication during pregnancy requires a careful risk analysis: the benefits of treatment versus no treatment. Because serious mood disorders can be life-threatening, effective treatment is important. Prozac's manufacturer (Eli Lilly) recommends that Prozac not be given to pregnant women, even though the majority of studies to date do not link Prozac with problems in pregnancy or birth defects. People with concerns about this or other medications for brain disorders should consult with their doctors and consider the risks and benefits for them as individuals.

D., and Jeffrey Draine, M.S.W., reported in the November 1995 issue of Psychiatric Services, sought to describe factors associated with adaptive coping by family members with a psychiatrically disabled relative. Study results showed that more adaptive coping was associated with increased social support as measured by the density of the social network, the extend of affirming social support, and participation in a support group for families. Better coping was also associated with a greater sense of self-efficacy in dealing with the relative's mental illness. Adaptive coping was not associated with the severity of the relative's illness. The findings suggest that families will benefit from joining support groups.

"Kids seek it out," writes Stepp, "believing it will help them study better and party harder. With more than two million children taking it legally, procuring it illegally is a cinch--a cousin's medicine cabinet, a deal cut in the school bathroom, a mother's bedside table." In a companion article in the Post on the same day, Stepp reported that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) holds that, if snorted or taken in larger-than-therapeutic does, methylphenidate can cause tremors, hypertension, even stroke. "Those who work with children taking methylphenidate say parents need to keep a tight lid on when and how the pills go out," says Stepp. CONTACT | MEMBERSHIP | WEBMASTER Copyright © 1996 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill - All Rights ReservedWT02-B26-72IA008-000083-B004-318http://www.nami.org:80/medicat/medicat7.htm 38.250.129.71 19970222101805 text/html 2682HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 10:16:33 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Mild Caution About Ritalin NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Mild Caution About Ritalin A New York Times article (1/13/96) reported that "Government scientists have uncovered a sign that the widely used children's drug Ritalin might cause cancer in mice.

The Times quoted Dr. Murray Lumpkin, the Food and Drug Administration's deputy drug director as saying, "We felt physicians and parents should know this and have a right to know this. But it's not enough of a signal that we think kids should be taken off the drug." "The agency said it had evidence that the drug was not carcinogenic, including the fact that in people there had been no increase in 20 years in the rare type of liver cancer involved in the study of mice," the Times reported.

GENE FOR MANIC DEPRESSION [Return to Top] A gene, or possibly two, that could contribute to as many as one in four cases of manic depression may be on a region of chromosome 18, according to a study of 395 members of 22 families by Wade H. Berrettini and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Manic depression or recurrent depression afflicted 167 participants in the study; in eight of the families, similar genetic variations on chromosome 18 were identified. Although this means almost two-thirds of the families had no evidence of involvement by chromosome 18, that alone would not rule out the locations: Most scientists seeking the genetic basis of manic-depressive illness agree that more than one genetic miscue probably can set the state for, or cause, the disorder. The study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (June 21), noted two genes worthy of suspicion out of the approximately 100 genes on chromosome 18. One codes for a protein that plays a specific part in chemical signal reception; the other is involved in stress hormone production, a physiological function that has been shown to go into overdrive in both depression and manic depression.--Reprinted from Brain Work: The Neuroscience Newsletter INADEQUATE DEPRESSION TREATMENT [Return to Top] A study of the recognition and treatment of depression has found that only 23 percent of depressed patients who could benefit from anti-depressants were receiving these medications and 39 percent of them were getting sub-therapeutic doses. Published in the May 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry, the study by Dr. Kenneth B. Wells of the RAND Corporation also found that patients of psychologists and allied mental health professionals were less likely to receive anti-depressants regardless of the severity of their illness. Additionally, depressed patients in HMOs were twice as likely to receive fewer visits and to be treated with anti-anxiety medications instead of anti-depressants. These results reinforce previous research showing that insufficient numbers of depressed patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that clinicians often fail to provide the kinds of treatment indicated by efficacy studies. LAB ZEROS IN ON MENTAL ILLNESS GENE [Return to Top] Wolfram syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that leads to an array of symptoms, including diabetes mellitus and blindness. More important, the syndrome's victims usually suffer from severe nervous system abnormalities that can be accompanied by behavior problems, psychiatric hospitalizations and--in 25 percent of cases--suicide attempts. Now scientists at the National Center for Human Genome Research's Laboratory of Genetic Disease Research and the New York Medical College have used a kind of genetic assessment called linkage analysis to home in on the likely location of the Wolfram gene: the short arm of chromosome 4. Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that to be affected, an individual must inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent. Between one in 50,000 to 100,000 people in this country inherit Wolfram syndrome. Although the syndrome itself is rare, experts estimate that about 1 in 100--or as many as 2.5 million Americans--possess a single copy of the mutated gene. Because these individuals, as well as close relatives of people with Wolfram syndrome, experience higher-than-normal rates of psychiatric illness, eventual isolation of the gene may shed light on the contribution of genes to psychiatric disorders. Armed with that information, investigators hope to identify the function of a gene that, they note, "may be responsible for a significant proportion of psychiatric illness in the general population." Senior author of the Wolfram gene study was Mihael H. Polymeropoulos of the Laboratory of Genetic Research at the Division of Intramural Research. It was published in the September 1994 issue of Nature Genetics. LYME DISEASE NOT NEW [Return to Top] Rodent pelts stored in museums since the late 1800s provide the first evidence that Lyme disease (borrelia burgdorferi) caused by tick bites has been around in the U.S. for at least 100 years. This disease, which is rapidly increasing in certain areas, has been shown to have neuropsychiatric manifestations in a paper by Brain A. Fallon, M.D., et al, titled "The Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis." The study can be obtained from Morris Area Lyme Support, P.O.Box 1483, Morristown, NJ 07960. 201/267-4251. MANIC DEPRESSION AND AUTISM [Return to Top] According to a recent study at the Duke University Medical Center, some cases of autism may be associated with a family history of depressive illness. Autism, a disorder marked by social withdrawal and an inability to interact with the environment, seems to appear more frequently in families with a strong history of bipolar illness, the study found. In connection with his study of 40 autistic children, Duke researcher Dr. Robert DeLong reported in the journal Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology that in 14 of the cases reviewed there was a strong family history of depression or manic depressive illness. The study hypothesized that when manic depression strikes in early infancy, it may blunt the child's cognitive, social, and emotional development irreversibly, so that the child's brain never develops the framework in which to build communications skills. In extreme cases, this may lead to clinical autism. (Reprinted from the National DMDA Newsletter, vol. 7, no. 1) MENTAL DISORDERS AND GENETICS [Return to Top] The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) recently published a background paper, Mental Disorders and Genetics: Bridging the Gap Between Research and Society, that reflects discussion at a 1993 workshop cosponsored by OTA and NIMH. The paper updates research on the genetics of selected mental disorders and considers the implications of these studies for future research, clinical practice, and society at large. Research makes clear that genetic factors contribute to many of the severe mental disorders discussed in the report. "Indeed, researchers have already located, and in some cases identified, specific genes involved in Alzheimer's disease. The consistent evidence for a genetic contribution to schizophrenia and major mood disorders, together with the rapid advances in molecular genetics, makes continued research in this area a promising endeavor. But progress is likely to be slow, given the complexity of theses conditions," write the authors. Workshop testimony also made clear that genetic research carries with it clinical, ethics, and social implications. People with mental disorders and their families worry about the genetic risk for a serious mental disorder that their family members may face. They welcome the de-stigmatizing influence of this research. Yet they fear its potential abuse. Unfortunately, a gap separates scientifically based information from the people who need it: people with mental disorders, their family members, care providers, and society in general.

The stock number is 052-003-01392-4 MURDERERS' BRAINS FOUND DIFFERENT [Return to Top] Comparing the brains of 22 men and women undergoing psychiatric evaluation in cases of murder or attempted murder with the brains of 22 control subjects, scientists at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California at Irvine (UCI) found significantly lower rates of glucose uptake in the medial and lateral sections of the prefrontal cortex brain regions of the research subjects compared to the controls. Researchers used positron emission tomography to measure glucose uptake in various brain areas during the performance of simple, repetitive tasks. Study director Adrian Raine, Ph.D., said the study--published in the July issue of Biological Psychiatry and reported in the September issues of the Psychiatric Times--is the first to establish an activity deficit in a group of severely violent criminals. Because of the selected nature of the sample, however, the findings cannot yet be generalized to other violent populations, nor can this test yet be used as a predictor. NEUROSCIENTIST LOOKS INSIDE... [Return to Top] Neuroscientist Looks Inside The Brain by Carol Rees, NAMI Board Member To Dr. Daniel Weinberger, schizophrenia is arguably the worstdisease affecting mankind, even including AIDS. The disease hasruined the lives of millions of people. That's why he's so excited about the research he's doing as chiefof the Clinical Brain Disorders branch at the National Instituteof Mental Health. In talks at the NAMI 1992 convention in Washington, and again onSeptember 16, 1992 at the University of Michigan Department ofPsychiatry, Weinberger discussed his hypotheses aboutschizophrenia as a brain disorder that alters the structure,function, and chemical mechanisms of the brain. New technology such as CAT scans (computerized axial tomography)and MRI's (magnetic resonance imaging) have taughtneuroscientists much about the brain, Weinberger says, as havetwo studies of identical and fraternal twins, and observations oflaboratory rats with behaviors that mimic schizophrenia. Schizophrenia changes the brain's anatomy, he says. Some of thechanges may be subtle, and include enlarged ventricles, decreasesin brain mass, and decreases in the size of a small structure atthe base of the brained call hippocampus. Such changes are present before symptoms first appear in patientswith schizophrenia, possibly from birth, Weinberger says. Functional alterations in the brain can be observed fromcommunication between the limbic system (of which the hippocampusis a part) and the prefrontal cerebral cortex ("gray matter"),where information processing takes place. Chemical alterations in the brain can be observed when aschizophrenic patient over-reacts to stress. These patients showa greater sensitivity to dopamine receptors in the brain. One underlying problem in schizophrenia, according to Dr.Weinberger, is a malfunction of nerve cells that connect thelimbic system to the pre-frontal cortex. This leads to a loss of ability to remember and to useinformation to guide decisions. This can be demonstrated with the Wisconsin Card Sort test, asimple sorting exercise in which cards are sorted according todesigns on the cards. Persons with schizophrenia have difficulty sorting the designs,even though they are told how to do it (by color or shape)immediately before they begin. The persist in responding in an inappropriate way, showing thatthey are unable to make use of information they have just beengiven. This kind of memory loss has not been previously noted as acharacteristic of schizophrenia, because it was masked by thedelusions and hallucinations that accompany the illness. Dr. Weinberger says a condition similar to schizophrenia can beinduced in laboratory rats by creating a lesion in the area justback of the pre-frontal cortex. The animals become highly activewhen placed in a novel environment, and they react to mildstresses as it if were life-threatening. The results of stress are long-lasting; even seven days later,the rats still have an excess of dopamine. Even though the lesionis present in the rat's brain from the first week of life, thisreaction does not occur until after puberty, just as withschizophrenia. An additional insight gained by this line of research is theconnection between brain age and the appearance of symptoms.Perhaps a brain must reach a certain state of development beforeschizophrenia can occur. At earlier ages, people may be protected from decisions by adultswho make decisions on their behalf. Maturity may bring both thenecessity of using information independently to guide behavior,and an increase in stress, precipitating the onset of psychoses. If abnormal cells in the brain's internal communication systemcan explain much of what characterizes schizophrenia, thentreatment can be directed at finding ways to prevent this injuryin early life, and to develop drugs that improve communication,rather than just the ones that affect neurotransmitters. Author's note: listening to Dr. Weinberger, and having lunch withhim after his University of Michigan presentation helps me to bemore understanding of my son when he seems unable to heed what wetell him. It brings home that we are getting closer to anexplanation (and better treatment) for this devastating disease. Excerpted from NAMI ADVOCATE, January-February, 1993 NEW DISCOVERY OF MOLECULE IN BRAIN [Return to Top] Studies by scientists at The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions suggest that the brain uses a common chemical to adjust the speed and intensity of the messages carried through its circuits. Researchers showed that adding a phosphate molecule to brain cells can make it easier for messages to go through. The demonstration provides important insight into the tools the brain uses to create learning and memory. The same tools may also play a role in brain damage from strokes and other disorders. Richard Huganir, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and an associate investigator at Howard Hughes Molecular Genetics Institute, studied phosphate molecules' effects on certain receptors, sites on nerve cells that open in response to chemical messengers from other nerve cells. While the receptors are open, calcium and sodium from around the nerve cell flow into it, triggering a series of electrical and chemical chain-reactions that transmit the message up the nerve cell. "A single receptor that we studied probably has 10 to 20 different sites where this phosphate molecule can be added, and each of these sites has different effects on the receptor," explains Huganir. " At one site, phosphorylation increases the amount of time the receptor is open," says Huganir. "Another affects the concentration of receptors, causing more to gather in a particular area." When a receptor is open longer or more receptors are gathered together, more of the calcium surrounding the cell flows into it, making the message come through more easily and more strongly. Huganir presented his findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in November in Miami Beach. NEW GENE LINKED TO BIPOLAR DISORDER [Return to Top] In the largest study to date using linkage analysis for bipolar, researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute, part of columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem have found evidence that a region on chromosome 21 contains a gene for the disorder. The study involved more than 900 people from 47 families in the U.S. and Israel with a high concentration of bipolar disorder. One U.S. family consisting of 67 individuals included 18 members who had diagnoses ranging from bipolar disorder to recurrent major depression to cyclothymia. The researchers found that DNA markers from region q22.3 of chromosome 21 gave evidence of linkage to the disorder in this family and, possibly, in other families as well. The study comes on the heels of other recent findings showing a possible site on chromosome 18, which may also be partly responsible for manic-depressive symptoms. Still earlier studies have shown a possible relation between chromosome 11 and bipolar illness. (Reprinted from the National DMDA Newsletter, vol. 7, no. 1) NEW STUDY ON BIPOLAR DISORDER [Return to Top] A new treatment-outcome and research network dedicated to the study of manic-depressive illness, the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network, includes national and international researchers and expert clinicians working in close association with NAMI and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association (NDMDA). These groups will work together to assess the efficacy of existing treatments for bipolar disorder and the development of new therapeutic agents. Participating research centers will recruit and treat patients with bipolar illness using standard protocols and assessments within randomized clinical trials. "The mission of the bipolar network is to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of bipolar illness, its cause or causes, and its treatments with the goals of establishing optimal treatment strategies," said Robert Post, M.D., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Branch of NIMH.

After his successes as a defensive end in two Super Bowls for Vince Lombardi's legendary Green Bay Packers, Mr. Aldridge suffered schizophrenia and was homeless for two-and-a-half years. Through sharing his personal experience, Mr. Aldridge inspired others to follow their dreams. His advice: "Don't let others determine who you are or who you can be." Close to two hundred individuals attended the Washington, D.C., Mental Health Consumer League's event, entitled "Yes We Can: Job Opportunities For Mental Health Consumers." "Having Lionel Aldridge speak at the job fair was the highlight of the participants' day. He is a role model who has experienced the same challenges that face persons with brain disorders," commented Regina Duvall, co-coordinator of the job fair and NAMI member.

The reality of schizophrenia in America in 1996 harkens back to Charles Dickens� famous opening to A Tale of Two Cities-�about it being the best of times and the worst of times. People with schizophrenia, as perhaps in no other time in history, confront an almost unbelievable sense of hope for effective treatment and high quality of life as well as fears of tragedy and suffering. Yes, in many ways, these are the best of times. Not so long ago, schizophrenia was considered an enigma, a hopeless illness, a dark family secret, a scourge, moral failing, certainly a desert and no-man's-land for scientists and doctors. The noted historian, Gerald Grob, has written that in the 1940s the �obstacles blocking fundamental biological research into mental illnesses were formidable�it would have been impossible to predict that�.scientists would develop substances that had the potential to modify the symptoms associated with...schizophrenia.� Yet there have been tremendous advances in schizophrenia science. In the last year alone, there were reports documenting developmental hazards-�such as Rh incompatibility between mother and fetus and extreme malnutrition during fetal development-�that double the risk of schizophrenia. Several studies pinpointed the regions of the brain that are structurally and functionally altered in schizophrenia. A major paper reported that a gene contributing to schizophrenia is likely to be located on chromosome 6. Reported data evidenced the effectiveness of a new schizophrenia drug�-olanzapine-�making it the third new drug for schizophrenia made available in a few short years, after literally decades of no medication advances. Another ten-year study presented this year showed that effective medical treatment coupled with intensive community supports and employment services led to a 50 percent employment rate for this population. These and other data represent stunning progress. To quote a prominent schizophrenia researcher-�Dr. Danny Weinberger-��20 years ago, the principal challenge for schizophrenia research was to gather objective scientific evidence that would implicate the brain. This challenge no longer exists...no longer can there be any doubt that there is an underlying brain pathology.� Schizophrenia is a brain disorder. It is not a problem of living. It is not a philosophical dilemma. It is not the result of your mother�s not breast-feeding you as a child. Schizophrenia is a brain disorder. Of course much more research needs to be done, but schizophrenia science is a mature, sophisticated science, with all of the tools of modern biomedicine, molecular biology, genetics, brain imaging, pharmacology, and services research. Most importantly, there is a growing arsenal of effective treatments and support services that reduce symptoms, decrease hospitalization, improve functioning and quality of life, and even employment outcomes. These are really the best of times. But, these are also the worst times imaginable. Approximately 1.7 million American adults have the brain disorder called schizophrenia. No more than 15 percent of them have a job. They make up more than half of the long-term residents of state and county mental hospitals. They, and others with severe mental illnesses, make-up at least one-third of our nation�s homeless population. Between 10 and 15 percent of individuals with schizophrenia commit suicide, usually before the age of 30. For 20 percent or more, schizophrenia is a chronically deteriorating illness; for most people with this brain disorder, it follows a long-term course, with relapses of frightening symptoms and prolonged disability. Approximately 8 percent of people in our jails have schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses�they are usually housed there for want of appropriate treatment and housing facilities. People with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses are disproportionately the victims of crime. So, despite tremendous progress in research, the reality of schizophrenia is in many ways a very grim one�for people with this illness, for their families, and for our nation. This grim reality certainly reflects the nature of this chronic brain disease�but it also reflects failed policies. To again quote the historian Grob: �Americans have yet to define a mental health policy that integrates decent and humane care with access to medical services for severely and chronically mentally ill persons.� What are the policy implications of our profound research success and the desperate plight of so many people who suffer the disease of schizophrenia? First, we must redouble our schizophrenia research efforts. Great discovery�indeed breakthrough is within our grasp. We have the research tools, we have some of the best brains in scientific research, and we have answerable scientific questions. The scientific opportunity is upon us. We must increase the amount of research on this disease. Congress and NIMH must make this a top research priority�and increase funding and focus on schizophrenia research. The research we rightly celebrate is but a seed for the research successes within our grasp, if only we would truly reach. This schizophrenia research is also the seed of informed and humane policy. Research data tell us to reject discrimination against schizophrenia, to make available the effective treatments, services, and supports that we now have to the people who need it. Only by enhancing research, ending insurance discrimination, and assuring access to effective treatment and services can we ensure that every person with schizophrenia will realize his or her best possible recovery. Let�s abide by and build on the successes of schizophrenia research�-and make these simply the best of times.

Imagine you've just stepped into an elevator and suddenly yourheart races, your chest aches, you break out in a cold sweat andfeel as if the elevator is about to crash to the ground. What'shappening? Imagine you are driving home from the grocery store and suddenlythings seem to be out of control, you feel hot flashes, thingsaround you blur, you can't tell where you are, and you feel as ifyou're dying. What's happening? What's happening is a panic attack, an uncontrollable panicresponse to ordinary, nonthreatening situations. Panic attacksare often an indication that a person has panic disorder. What is panic disorder? A person who experiences four or more panic attacks in a 4-weekperiod is said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder may also beindicated if a person experiences fewer than four panic episodesbut has recurrent or constant fears of having another panicattack. Doctors often try to rule out every other possible alter nativebefore diagnosing panic disorder. To be diagnosed as having panicdisorder, a person must experience at least four of the followingsymptoms during a panic attack: sweating; hot or cold flashes;choking or smothering sensations; racing heart; laboredbreathing; trembling; chest pains; faintness; disorientation; orfeelings of dying, losing control, or losing one's mind. Panic attacks can occur in anyone. Chemical or hormonalimbalances, drugs or alcohol, stress or other situational eventscan cause panic attacks, which are often mistaken for heartattacks, heart disease, or respiratory problems. What are phobias? Phobias are irrational, involuntary and inappropriate fears of(or responses to) ordinary situations or things. People who havephobias can experience panic attacks when confronted with thesituation or object about which they feel phobic. The American Psychiatric Association recognizes a category ofsymptoms called phobic disorders within the broader field ofanxiety disorders. Phobias are divided into three types: Single (simple) phobia: anunreasonable fear of specific circumstances or objects, such assnakes or traffic jams. Social phobia: extreme fear of making a spectacle of oneself inpublic, thus forcing one to avoid public occasions or areas. Agoraphobia: literally (in Greek) "In fear of the market place."An intense fear about feeling trapped in any situation,particularly in public places, combined with an overwhelming fearof having a panic attack in unfamiliar surroundings Phobias are usually chronic (long term) distressing andrestrictive disorders. They can lead to other serious problems,such as depression. In fact, at least half of those who suffer with phobias and panicdisorders experience depression. Alcoholism, loss ofproductivity, feelings of shame, secrecy, and low self-esteemalso occur. Some people develop a pathologic dependency and are unable to goanywhere or do anything without the assistance of others theytrust. What does it mean to "Fear the Fear"? Many people with phobias or panic disorder "fear the fear," orworry about when the next attack is coming Anticipatory anxiety,or the fear of more attacks, can be debilitating. People who are prone to panic attacks often begin to avoid thethings they think triggered the panic attack, thus limiting thethings they do or the places they go. Am I the only one? Two to five percent of Americans are thought to suffer panicdisorder, so you are not alone if you experience these symptoms.Most often, panic disorder first strikes people in their earlytwenties. A severe life stress, such as the death of a loved one,can precipitate panic attacks. A 1986 study by the National Institute of Mental Health showedthat 51 percent to 12.5 percent of people surveyed hadexperienced phobias in the past 6 months. The study estimatedthat 24 million Americans will experience some phobias in theirlifetimes. Phobias are the leading psychiatric disorders among women of allages. One survey showed that 4 9 percent of women and 18 percentof men have panic disorder, agoraphobia, or other phobias. What causes panic disorder? No one really knows what causes panic disorder, but severaltheories are being researched. Panic disorder seems to run infamilies, and this suggests the disorder has some geneticinheritability or predisposition. Some theories suggest that panic disorder is part of a moregeneralized anxiety in the people who experience panic attacks orthat severe separation anxiety can develop into panic disorder orphobias, most often agoraphobia. Cognitive theorists believe that one's "wrong thinking" maintainsan anxiety level that can trigger panic attacks. Biological theories point to possible physical defects in aperson's autonomic (or automatic) nervous system. Generalhypersensitivity in the nervous system, increased arousal, or asudden chemical imbalance can trigger panic attacks. Caffeine, alcohol, and several other agents can also triggerthese symptoms. Researchers have found that sodium lactate, when injected intothe blood stream of some people who are predisposed to panicattacks, will induce such attacks This suggests that people whoexperience panic attacks may have trouble metabolizing lactate, asubstance usually produced by muscles during exercise Is panic disorder treatable? Recovery from panic disorder appears to be most successful whena combination of treatments is used in fighting the disorder. Most often, medication is used to block panic attacks, and whenit is used in combination with cognitive or behavioral therapy,it allows people to overcome their fears and return to normal,functional living. Sadly, although treatments can be quite successful -- 75 percentto 90 percent of those treated show significant improvement onlyabout one quarter of those who suffer this disorder ever seekappropriate treatment. Cognitive therapy is used to help people think and behaveappropriately, thus making the feared object or situation lessthreatening through supported exposure and hierarchicaldesensitization (being exposed to, and slowly getting used to,the thing that is so frightening). Family members and friends play an important role in this processas they provide support, assistance, and encouragement. Medication is most effective when used as part of a morecomprehensive treatment plan that involves supportive therapy.Antidepressants, such as imipramine and phenelzine, andantianxiety agents, such as alprazolam, are most successful. Beta blockers, which limit neuron activity in the brain, arehelpful with social phobias. If you are seeking medicaltreatment, ask your doctor about these medications or others thatmay help you. Psychotherapy and healthy living habits are also believed to helppeople overcome the burdens placed on them by panic disorder.Exercise, a proper and balanced diet, moderate use of caffeine oralcohol, and reduced stress can help tremendously. Peer support is a vital part of overcoming panic disorder. Familyand friends can play a significant role in the treatment processand should be informed of the treatment plan and of the ways theycan be most helpful.

PREVENTING RECURRENT DEPRESSION [Return to Top] A study of treatments for recurrent depression revealed that a more aggressive medication strategy than typically prescribed for remitted patients was successful in keeping patients well for a longer period of time. The results indicated that the dosage used to get the patient better stood the best chance for keeping the patient better. Patients who did not remain on the high does of medication were up to 11 times more likely to suffer another episode of depression than were the patients who remained on full-dose medication during the three-year study. When these findings were published in 1990, Dr. Kupfer, Dr. Ellen Frank, and their collaborators at the NIMH Mental Health Clinical Research Center for the Study of Affective Disorders did not yet know what would happen to these patients beyond the three-year point. They then asked those individuals who remained well throughout the three-year trial period on active medication (with or without psychotherapy) to continue in a two-year additional randomized clinical trial of active medication versus placebo. The question was whether maintaining antidepressant medication at the dose used to treat the acute episode beyond the three years would continue to have a significant preventative effect compared to medication discontinuation after the three years of effective maintenance treatment. As with the three-year study, data analysis demonstrated a highly significant preventative effect for continued active medication maintained at the dosage level prescribed when the patient was acutely depressed. Based on the results of the five-year study, Dr. Kupfer and MHCRC colleagues expanded their original conclusion to view active medication as an effective means of preventing recurrence beyond three years. The results of these clinical trials conducted under the auspices of the MHCRC support the contention that patients with prior episodes of depression less than two and one-half years apart merit continued prophylaxis for at least five years. --reprinted from The Decade of the Brain (vol.4, no. 2) SCHIZOPHRENIA [Return to Top] Adam "was a wonderfully, sweet young man," his mother said. Hewas a high school athlete and captain of his team, active in hiscollege fraternity, a good student. He had graduated from college and started working while studyingfor a professional certification exam when something inside himchanged. . . Adam stopped being careful about his personalappearance. He told his parents he suspected them of communicating with eachother in secret ways, such as in sign language which he couldn'tunderstand. He began to hear his mother's voice in his head andhe asked her why she was sending him messages. . . he wasdiagnosed with schizophrenia. What is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia, a disease of the brain, is one of the mostdisabling and emotionally devastating illnesses known to man. But because it has been misunderstood for so long, it hasreceived relatively little attention and its victims have beenundeservingly stigmatized. Schizophrenia is not a split personality, a rare and verydifferent disorder. Like cancer and diabetes, schizophrenia has a biological basis;it is not caused by bad parenting or personal weakness. Nor areindividuals being treated for schizophrenia more prone toviolence than the general public, despite media focus onexceptions. Schizophrenia is, in fact, a relatively common disease, with anestimated one percent of the U.S. population being diagnosed withit over the course of their lives. While there is no known curefor schizophrenia, it is a very treatable disease. Most of those afflicted by schizophrenia respond to drug therapy,and many are able to lead productive and fulfilling lives. What are its symptoms? Schizophrenia is characterized by a constellation of distinctiveand predictable symptoms. The symptoms that are most commonlyassociated with the disease are called positive symptoms, thatdenote the presence of grossly abnormal behavior. These includethought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations. Thought disorder is the diminished ability to think clearly andlogically. Often it is manifested by disconnected and nonsensicallanguage that renders the person with schizophrenia incapable ofparticipating in conversation, contributing to his alienationfrom his family, friends, and society. Delusions are common among individuals with schizophrenia. Anaffected person may believe that he is being conspired against(called "paranoid delusion"). "Broadcasting" describes a type ofdelusion in which the individual with this illness believes thathis thoughts can be heard by others. Hallucinations can be heard, seen, or even felt; most often theytake the form of voices heard only by the afflicted person. Suchvoices may describe the person's actions, warn him of danger ortell him what to do. At times the individual may hear severalvoices carrying on a conversation. Less obvious than the "positive symptoms" but equally serious arethe deficit or negative symptoms that represent the absence ofnormal behavior. These include flat or blunted affect (i.e. lackof emotional expression), apathy, and social withdrawal). Who gets it? While schizophrenia can affect anyone at any point in life, it issomewhat more common in those persons who are geneticallypredisposed to the disease. The first psychotic episode generallyoccurs in late adolescence or early adulthood. Genetic Link -- The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of two parents, neither of whom has the disease, is 1 percent. -- The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of one parent with the disease is approximately 13 percent. -- The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of both parents with the disease is approximately 35 percent. Onset by Age -- Three-quarters of persons with schizophrenia develop the disease between 16 and 25 years of age. -- Onset is uncommon after age 30, and rare after age 40. Onset by Sex -- In the 16-25 year old age group, schizophrenia affects more men than women. -- In the 25-30 year old group, the incidence is higher in women than in men. What is the course of the disease? Studies have shown that some persons with schizophrenia recovercompletely, and many others improve to the point where they canlive independently, often with the maintenance of drug therapy.Fortunately, this accounts for the majority of cases. However, approximately 15 percent of people with schizophreniarespond only moderately to medication and require extensivesupport throughout their lives, while another 15 percent simplydo not respond to existing treatment. New therapies may offerhope for the treatment of these most seriously affectedsufferers. How is it treated? Hospitalization is often necessary in cases of acuteschizophrenia. This ensures the safety of the affected person,while allowing for observation by trained mental healthprofessionals to determine whether schizophrenia is theappropriate diagnosis. Hospitalization also allows for theinitiation of medication under close supervision. Antipsychotic drugs (also called neuroleptics), available sincethe 1950s, can dramatically improve the functioning of peoplewith schizophrenia. Once the most troubling symptoms are controlled by medication,the person often does not require hospitalization. Depending on the seriousness of the disease, the person mayutilize day programs, rehabilitation facilities, and be treatedin an outpatient setting. This allows the psychiatrist to adjustmedication dosages as necessary over the course of the disease. The person may also need assistance in readjusting to societyonce his or her symptoms are controlled. Supportive counseling or psychotherapy may be appropriate forthese individuals as a source of friendship, encouragement, andpractical advice during this process. Relatives and friends canalso assist in rebuilding the person's social skills. Suchsupport is very important. What can/should I do if a loved one is sick? Because an individual with schizophrenia may not be aware that heis ill, it is often necessary for a friend or relative to makecertain that proper treatment is sought. A good doctor is critical; it helps to find one through therecommendation of other families or healthcare professionals.Once the person is released from the hospital, families are oftenleft with the responsibility of ensuring that the person istaking medication and is continuing to receive whatever othertreatment is necessary. The best way to treat a friend or relative with schizophrenia iswith compassion, understanding, and support. The person shouldnot be made to feel as if the disease is his or anybody's fault. As Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has stated, "People do not causeschizophrenia; they merely blame each other for doing so." (Seefootnote.) Learning about the disease and its treatment will helpto avoid the temptation to blame. In addition to seeking help for the person afflicted with thedisease, loved ones often find mutual support to be invaluable. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is agrassroots, self-help organization of families and friends ofpeople with serious mental illnesses. Comprised of more than ninehundred local and state alliance groups all across the country,NAMI provides mutual support, education, and advocacy for thevictims of severe mental illness.

Bipolar disorder: a periodic, recurrent mood disorder withintervening periods of complete normalcy. Not to be confused withschizophrenia. Blunted affect: (see flat affect) Deficit symptoms: (see negative symptoms) Delusion: fixed, irrational ideas not shared by others and notresponding to reasoned argument. Flat affect: absence of or diminution in the amount of emotionaltone or outward emotional reaction typically shown under similarcircumstances. Grandiose delusion: a delusion in which subject believes himselfpossessed of great wealth, intellect, importance, power, etc. Hallucination: perceptions that occur without any externalstimulus. Inappropriate affect: emotional tone or outward reaction out ofharmony with the idea, object, or thought accompanying it. Manic depressive disorder: (same as bipolar disorder) Negative symptoms: behaviors which are absent among individualswith schizophrenia but present among normal individuals. Neuroleptic drugs: the standard drugs currently used to treat thesymptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms: behaviors which are absent among healthyindividuals but present among individuals with schizophrenia. Psychosis: a mental disorder causing gross distortion ordisorganization of a person's mental capacity, emotionalresponse, and capacity to recognize reality, communicate, andrelate to others to the degree of interfering with his or hercapacity to cope with the ordinary demands of everyday life. Schizophrenia: the most common type of psychosis characterized bya disorder in the thinking processes, such as delusions andhallucinations, an extensive withdrawal of the individuals'sinterest from other people in the outside world, and theinvestment of it in his own. Schizophrenia is now considered tobe a group of mental disorders rather than a single entity. Thought disorder: a symptom of schizophrenia. Clear,goal-directed thinking becomes increasingly difficult, as shownin a diffuseness or "woolliness" and circumstantiality of speech. Withdrawal: the process of retreating from society andrelationships with others. Usually indicated by aloofness, lackof interest in social activities, and difficulty in communicatingwith others.

The senators were forced to make these adjustments to secure agreement for passage. The final conditions and exceptions are discussed here with a firm belief that its passage will help families all over the U.S. It does require compliance by self-insured employers, historically exempt from state mandates because of ERISA. Now that it's enacted, it will need to be defended, monitored, and renewed. When is the law effective? It doesn't take effect until January 1, 1998, and it expires September 30, 2001. How does the law affect state parity laws and other mental health mandates? The state parity laws NAMI has worked to enact are not pre-empted by this federal law. The conference report statement on the final bill says: "It is the intent of the conferees that, consistent with section 704 (redesignated as section 731) of ERISA and Section 2723 of the Public Health Service Act, the application of the preemption provision should permit the operation of any State law or provision which requires more favorable treatment of mental health benefits under health insurance coverage than that required under this section." It remains important to enact state parity laws, both to give relief to consumers and families on those issues this law does not cover and to build momentum and pressure for its reauthorization and improvement. What about the small-business exemption? Because of the "50 or fewer employees" exemption, it has been estimated that 40 to 50 million Americans will go without the improved coverage the bill requires. What about the purchaser being allowed to drop coverage for mental illness? The first decision a plan purchaser has is whether to drop mental health coverage to get out of complying or to retain mental health coverage and comply. There is a question, with a special dynamic in union-contract situations, about whether many of the purchasers would comply anyway because of workforce loyalty/turnover considerations. (This situation could also apply to businesses in the exempt "50 employees or fewer" category.) If a purchaser/plan keeps mental illness coverage or starts it for the first time, this purchaser/plan is obligated to comply with the parity law for lifetime and annual limits. It can offset any additional expense by re-balancing its plan and its cost-sharing with group members in several ways. What about the plan/purchaser flexibility to alter services and co-insurance? The application of this flexibility could be a two-edged sword for NAMI consumers and families. Adjusting limits on mental illness in-patient days or out-patient visits, raising mental illness co-insurance and deductibles, and modifying the definition of medical necessity--or some combination of these--could keep the cost increase below one percent and thereby keep the company from becoming exempt. BUT if such changes raise cost barriers inordinately, they impede access. What about making businesses exempt if the premium rises one percent or more? The second step for a purchaser keeping mental illness coverage is to determine the cost of the addition of annual and lifetime dollar parity. If it reaches or exceeds one percent, the plan is again exempt. But, it is hard to see how it would exceed one percent if the plan makes a good-faith effort to use the many cost-limiting mechanisms available under the amendment. So what will be the net positive effect? At the end of the day, we expect purchasers whose plans cover larger numbers of lives (though we don't yet know how to define "larger") to continue the coverage they already have and to institute the equalization of lifetime dollar limits and eliminate annual dollar limits. (Because more than 95 percent of plans have no annual limits for other diagnoses, there's nothing to equalize, so equalization means elimination). In the end, plans will bear a greater share of catastrophic treatment costs and families and consumers will bear a lesser share. Nonetheless, there is still the possibility that the consumer and family share could be prohibitive because of all the mechanisms available to the plan purchaser to limit its costs. What does NAMI think about the one percent limit that can exempt businesses? The Congressional Budget Office estimate for the annual and lifetime caps amendment projects 0.4 percent as the increase in premium. Senator Domenici believes that persons with severe and persistent mental illness will be the principal beneficiaries of the provision because only they hit the $50,000 (average) lifetime limit in current health plans. NAMI agrees that only persons with severe illness will exceed the lifetime limits, and persons with severe illness are not a large percentage of the insured population. NAMI has consistently stood by the incidence and prevalence data on severe illness from the National Institute for Mental Health: 2.8 percent of adults, or five million persons; and three percent of children, or seven million persons. Many of these people are not covered by private-sector plans now. Disabled by the illnesses, they have fallen into the public sector. The persons with severe illness who are covered in the private sector will not all have severe episodes in the same plan year, but they are the ones who would reach a lifetime cap. They represent 0.2 percent or less of the cases in recent private-sector analyses of millions of covered lives over several years. They are both the ones who will raise the costs of premiums by very little and the ones who will benefit a lot. What about a concrete example? If a psychotic break in late adolescence were to incur a hospitalization expense of $30,000: under the current employment-related plan with a $350 family deductible with an 80/20 coinsurance and a $2,000 annual limit on mental health services, the family pays all costs over $2,000, or $28,000. under the new law (01/01/98) in the same circumstance, if the employer raised the deductible on mental illness services to $1,000 and lowered the co-insurance to 50/50, the plan would pay $14,000 and the family would pay $16,000 ($12,000 less than they pay in the first scenario).

The NIMH study and other research was reported in a special November 1993 issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders devoted to women and depression. "Research into the biological and psychological underpinnings of depression is beginning to yield findings that help to explain why women are twice as likely to develop depression," said former NIMH Director Frederick K. Goodwin, M.D. "As we learn more about gender-specific factors in the development of depression, we will be better able to design specialized and more effective treatments for both women and men with the disorder. Findings reported in this issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders are reported below. Dr. Myrna M. Weissman of Columbia University's New York State Psychiatric Institute and colleagues examined sex differences in the rates of depressive illnesses in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. Across the four countries, they found almost the same rates of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder in men and women, but higher rates of major depression and dysthymia in women. Major depression first strikes in the mid- to late-20s for both sexes, and while the rate of depression in the United States in men born since 1945 has been rising, it appears to have stabilized in women. In research on biological mechanisms underlying depression, Dr. Uriel Halbreich and Lucille A. Lumley, M.S., both of the State University of New York at Buffalo, compared neurochemical and neuroendocrine function in men and women. They found gender differences in several functions of the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, in activities of dopamine and acetylcholine, and in certain operations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression, as well as its actual expression, might be related to short- and long-term effects of gonadal hormones. These hormones probably play an important role in the multi-faceted and multi-dimensional mechanisms underlying mood and behavior. Dr. Diane N. Ruble of the New York University and colleagues, in a literature review of socialization processes in childhood, discussed various social factors that may lead to girls' greater vulnerability to depression. For example, girls are usually more closely watched and protected than boys, making them less likely to develop an independent sense of mastery. This low sense of self-efficacy, the researchers reported, may lead to feelings of little control, pessimism, and hopelessness. Theorists of learned helplessness believe all of these are related to the development of depression. This review also suggested that pre-pubertal girls sometimes have more depressive symptoms than boys. This finding supports the view that women's higher rates of depression cannot be solely explained by hormone-related changes associated with the onset of puberty. This is important because it suggests that prevention and intervention efforts should be directed at socialization processes during the early school years. Dr. Ronald Kessler of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and colleagues reported that there is no difference between the sexes in the overall course of depression once it occurs. Men and women who had a history of depression were equally likely to have been chronically depressed or to have experienced an acute recurrence of a depressive episode in the past year. This finding comes from the National Comorbidity Survey, which was conducted in the United States from 1990 to 1992 and involved nearly 8,100 respondents.

INADEQUATE DEPRESSION TREATMENT [Return to Top] A study of the recognition and treatment of depression has found that only 23 percent of depressed patients who could benefit from anti-depressants were receiving these medications and 39 percent of them were getting sub-therapeutic doses. Published in the May 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry, the study by Dr. Kenneth B. Wells of the RAND Corporation also found that patients of psychologists and allied mental health professionals were less likely to receive anti-depressants regardless of the severity of their illness. Additionally, depressed patients in HMOs were twice as likely to receive fewer visits and to be treated with anti-anxiety medications instead of anti-depressants. These results reinforce previous research showing that insufficient numbers of depressed patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that clinicians often fail to provide the kinds of treatment indicated by efficacy studies. JUST BETWEEN US [Return to Top] In this column, I'm going to tell you a story full of unnecessary suffering and grief. It's been a nightmare to remember and to write about. The problem is words. Incredible power is compressed into words. Too many words and notions applied to consumers are poisoned by prejudice. Stigma insinuates such subtly degrading lies and masquerades in such seductively simple half-truths. Wherever the truth about mental illness is more complex than the words regularly used to describe it, that's where consumers suffer helplessly and too often needlessly. The suffering is because no one sees accurately what's really happening to us or is willing to work with us to stop the tragedies before they happen. The heart of my story is a friend, a friend from the knob country of the rural South, quiet, honest, hard-working, and for parts of his life caught in the iron grip of unreasoning terror. He could be painfully shy, withdrawn. Even those who loved him aren't sure just when he slipped silently into paranoia. He never graduated from school. He was too ill. In the grip of driving terror he believed he'd be killed if he didn't defend himself. He lashed out in explosive violence and killed. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was remanded to a forensics facility where he was treated successfully and released. I met him on the bus. He was lost. It was a bitter winter and he was wearing a short-sleeved cotton shirt. Miraculously, he let me give him my sweatshirt and welcomed me as friend. We met more on the phone than in person. We saw each other regularly on the bus to the local mental health center. The second time I saw him he told me his story. He astounded me by his halting openness, his absolute honesty. Simply, with no evasions, no excuses, he told his tale. To share that took incredible courage. Over time it was clear: his meds just weren't working as well as they once had. He was slipping away. I asked if he'd told his therapist. He had. He did again. He hoped to see a psychiatrist about a meds change. The available appointment was just too far in the future. His life was getting scary. We urged him to visit emergency intake so he could perhaps access a psychiatrist without the endless wait. Or, we thought, he'd end up admitted to our local state hospital where he'd been before. The mental health center where he went for treatment relies more on counseling than on state-of-the-art meds work. Come the annual budget crunch, the director is famous among consumers for cutting psychiatry hours rather than talk therapy. Again my friend tried to schedule a meds visit, but all he could get was another therapy appointment in a few days. He was deteriorating, becoming volatile and agitated. A neighbor, concerned and frightened, took him the next morning to emergency intake. All he got was words. Later, a family down the street found him wandering, disoriented, and called the police. The police talked to the neighbor who'd taken him to the center that morning, then took him back to emergency intake. The person who saw him apparently didn't assess the acuity of the situation, even though my friend's complete records were at the center, and they included details of the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity verdict. Late that evening, after he left the center, the police arrested him for the death of his neighbor, the very person who had taken him to the center in the morning looking for help and care. Headlines shrieked, "Mentally Ill Killer Let Loose in Suburban Neighborhood," "Psychotic Killer Strikes Again." We saw him in jail awaiting trial. He wasn't on medication. He talked word salad. He was clearly psychotic. A mental health professional characterized my friend to the press as a treatment-resistant, uncooperative case. No one questioned that description or the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the treatment he actually received from that mental health center. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. He has yet to receive effective medication or appropriate treatment, and he is too ill to avoid the predators inside the bars. Our extremely conservative governor mentioned him as a killer who would be kept off our streets by the Republican initiative to build 27 new prisons. The governor wants to "privatize," or sell, our state mental hospitals to pay for the 27 new prisons. What has this to do with words? I'm desperate to know, Was all this suffering inevitable because my friend was treatment-resistant and uncooperative? Or did the treatment system catastrophically fail my friend, his neighbor, and our community? What about the right to timely, humane, effective care?

NAMI /About /Books /Conferences /Outlook /Medical /Updates Comment /Help /Index /Membership /Noframes /Search /Statistics Does Depot Medication Improve Compliance? "One cause of the gap between the theoretical and actual effectiveness of neuroleptic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia is the persistently high rate of patient noncompliance," wrote Peter Weiden when reporting on a compliance research study in Psychiatric Services (October 1995). "For example, our research group found that 74 percent of schizophrenic outpatients become noncompliant with their neuroleptic regiment within two years of discharge from the hospital." In a preliminary study of 93 neuroleptic-responsive inpatients to determine whether administering medication by the depot route rather than orally improves compliance with neuroleptic treatment after inpatients leave the hospital, Peter Weiden, M.D., et al found mixed results. Inpatients converted to depot medication had significantly better compliance at one month postdischarge; however, the initial positive effect on compliance waned. No significant differences in compliance were found between the oral and depot groups at six and 12 months postdischarge. Although Weiden and his colleagues concluded that "converting inpatients to depot therapy significantly improved short-term but not long-term medication compliance after discharge," they also concluded that depot treatment "can be used as a way to promote the transition to outpatient services."

Rappaport (703) 312-7886 February 7, 1997 Advocacy Group Calls for Dismantling of Federal-State Vocational Rehabilitation System, Funding to be Redirected Arlington, VA, February 3, 1997 --- The federal-state vocational rehabilitation system that supports the employment needs of people with severe mental illnesses is "an abject failure," according to a new report released today by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI). The report identifies pervasive problems in the tax-supported system from outmoded practices and questionable expenditures to deplorable outcomes and resistance to implementing changes. A Legacy of Failure: The Inability of the Federal-State Vocational Rehabilitation System to Serve People with Serious Mental Illnesses details the results of NAMI's assessment of the overall effectiveness of state programs that spend approximately $490 million annually, 79 percent of which comes from federal funds. "Our study results confirm what we have long suspected," said Laurie M. Flynn, NAMI's executive director. "This system is not only a waste of tax-payers' dollars, but it fails miserably at helping people with severe mental illnesses get back to work." Major report findings include: Administrative costs eat up nearly 50 percent of the system's funding, with the remaining funds supporting direct services. Further, vocational rehabilitation agencies are unable to estimate how many people will be served in a given year and at what cost. The system achieves dismal long-term outcomes for those with severe mental illnesses, who are earning less eight years after their cases are "successfully closed" by state agencies than before receiving employment assistance. Methods to support this population are grossly outmoded. Services are time limited so that once people obtain employment, the system provides no additional support. This approach is entirely contrary to the realities of severe mental illnesses, which are known to be brain disorders that are episodic in nature and fluctuate in severity and impact over time. Incentives reward employment counselors on the easiest placements. Despite successive federal and regulatory attempts to focus the system on people with the most severe disabilities, state vocational rehabilitation agencies have done little to establish incentives for serving individuals with more complicated long-term needs. More than 85 percent of individuals with serious brain disorders in this country are unemployed. NAMI's report lays out several alternative approaches for helping many of these people obtain and maintain employment. NAMI estimates that between 62,000 and 90,000 persons could be served if the $490 million combined federal and state funds for the vocational rehabilitation system were pulled and redirected into programs that have demonstrated the ability to produce results. "The current system blocks change and is beyond repair," Flynn said. "We're recommending a major overhaul, not a band-aid fix." The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is the nation's largest grassroots organization dedicated to improving the lives of persons with severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), major depression, and anxiety disorders. Based in Arlington, Virginia, NAMI's membership includes more than 140,000 people with brain disorders and their families, and 1,100 state and local affiliates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada. NAMI's efforts focus on support to persons with serious brain disorders and to their families, advocacy for nondiscriminatory and equitable federal and state policies, research into the causes, symptoms, and treatments for brain disorders, and education to eliminate the pervasive stigma toward severe mental illnesses.

Gordon, III, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine. Note: Tourette's disorder, or Tourette's syndrome (TS) as it is frequently called, is a neurologic syndrome. The essential feature of Tourette's is multiple tics that are sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic, stereotypical, purposeless movements, or vocalizations. What are the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome? Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics are present at some time during the illness, although not necessarily simultaneously. These symptoms occur many times a day nearly every day or intermittently throughout a span of more than one year. There is significant impairment or marked distress in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The onset occurs before the age of 18 Symptoms can disappear for weeks or months at a time, and the severity waxes and wanes. What are the first tics that may be characteristic of TS? Usually, the facial tic, such as rapid blinking of the eyes or twitches of the mouth, may be the first indication a parent has that their child may have TS. Involuntary sounds, such as throat clearing and sniffing or tics of the limbs may be an initial sign in other children. Are any other symptoms associated with Tourette's? Approximately 50 percent of patients meet criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and this may be the more impairing problem. Approximately one-third of patients meet criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or have other forms of anxiety. Learning disabilities are common as well as developmental stuttering. Social discomfort, self-consciousness, and depressed mood frequently occur, especially as children reach adolescence. What causes these symptoms? Although the cause has not been definitely established, there is considerable evidence that TS arises from abnormal metabolism of dopamine, a neurotransmitter. Other neurotransmitters may be involved. Can TS be inherited? Genetic studies indicate that TS is inherited as an dominant gene, but different family members may have dissimilar symptoms. A parent has a 50 percent chance of passing the gene to one of his or her children. The range of symptomatology varies from multiple, severe tics to very minor tics with varying degrees of attention deficit-disorder (ADD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Are boys or girls more likely to have TS? The sex of the child can influence the expression of the TS gene. Girls with the gene have a 70 percent chance of displaying symptoms, boys with the gene have a 99 percent chance of displaying symptoms. The ratio of boys and girls with TS is 3:1. How is Tourette's syndrome diagnosed? No blood analysis, x-ray, or other medical test exists to identify TS. Diagnosis is made by observing the signs or symptoms as described above. A doctor may wish to use a CAT scan, EEG, or other tests to rule out other disorders that could be confused with TS. Some medications cause tics, so it is important to inform the professional doing the assessment of any prescribed, over-the-counter, or street drugs to which the patient may have been exposed. What are the benefits of seeking early treatment of TS symptoms? When a child's behavior is viewed as disruptive, frightening, or bizarre by peers, family, teachers, or friends, it provokes ridicule and rejection. Teachers and other children can feel threatened and exclude the child from activities or interpersonal relationships. A child's socialization difficulties will increase as he reaches adolescence. Therefore, it is very important for the child's self-esteem and emotional well-being that treatment be sought as early as possible. What treatments are available for TS? Not everyone is disabled by his or her symptoms, so medication may not be necessary. When symptoms interfere with functioning, medication can effectively improve attention span, decrease impulsivity, hyperactivity, tics, and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Relaxation techniques and behavior therapy may also be useful for tics, ADD symptoms, and OCD symptoms. How does TS affect the education of a child or adolescent with TS? TS alone does not affect the IQ of a child. Many children who have TS, however, also have learning disabilities or attention deficits. Frequently, therefore, special education may be needed for a child with TS. Teachers should be given factual information about the disorder; and if learning difficulties appear, the child should be referred to the school system for assessment of other learning problems. What is the course of TS? Some people with TS show a marked improvement in their late teens or early twenties. However, tics as well as ADD and OCD behavior may wax and wane over the course of the life span. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition), or DSM-IV This is a change from the former edition, DSM-III-R, that set maximum age of onset at 21 years of age.

This clinical study was undertaken to evaluate the possibility that the higher ratio may be associated with more side effects. Thirty-four physically healthy patients (12 African-Americans, 22 Caucasians) who met the DSM-III R criteria for bipolar affective disorders were studied for RBC/plasma lithium ratio. At each evaluation, plasma lithium levels were similar in the two groups; however the RBC lithium concentration averaged 60 percent higher in the African-Americans. The African-Americans had significantly higher scores on the General Side Effects Scale, particularly in fatigue, dizziness, loss of initiative, and urinary frequency. To reduce the frequency of these side effects, the dosage and serum/plasma levels of lithium may need to be lower for African-American patients, however, more research should be done before making this assumption. --Strickland T., et al: Comparison of lithium ration between African American and Caucasian bipolar patients.

For the first time, scientists have a neurobiological explanation for the variation in severity of tics in Tourette's syndrome. Researchers at NIMH have traced such symptom differences to "supersensitivity" of certain neurotransmitter receptors in the brain structure responsible for carrying out automatic behaviors. They suggest that this dysfunction may underlie the compulsion to act out the sudden movements and vocalizations that characterize Tourette's syndrome, which affects about 100,000 Americans with its full-blown form and up to 0.5 percent of the population with milder symptoms. The researchers report their findings in the August 30th issue of Science.

Although we did not get passage of the Domenici-Wellstone amendment in the final version of the Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Care Reform Act, we did move the "needle" considerably in the minds of decision-makers. The issue became one of blatant discrimination. Policy makers can no longer continue to ignore us in the private healthcare system and treat us as second-class citizens in the public Medicaid system without risking being labeled discriminators. Make brain disorders as acceptable as heart disease, cancer, and epilepsy. In the year ahead, there is opportunity to move our agenda in both private and public health care. You MUST play a key role. NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination plan for year two will require major efforts in the grassroots. The opportunity to change the way brain disorders are discriminated against in both public and private health care will continue to be the major focus of the campaign. Many states will introduce state parity bills. We will all be paying close attention to the Medicaid changes during the November election. To end discrimination we must work together to create a groundswell of public support for our issues. We will not be truly successful until the public views severe brain disorders with the same compassion and knowledge as it views heart disease, cancer, epilepsy, and other physical disorders. The building of an army to end discrimination requires people. Every attempt must be made to enlist more supporters. The number of people we say we represent matters. Our current membership number is not yet large enough if we are to truly have an impact. Here are four things YOU can do now to increase our numbers: Sign up your entire family in NAMI and your state organization. Sign up your adult children, your brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. This is the easy part. Our issue is a family issue. Ending the stigma begins at home. Next, sign up your friends and neighbors. And ask your family members--the ones you just signed up--to do the same thing. None of these people must have a brain disorder in their family--or must want to attend a support group--to join us. All anyone has to do is be is a supporter of our mission. These people probably already know that you or someone you love has a brain disorder. By approaching them you are reinforcing your level of comfort with discussing brain disorders. You are teaching them to look beyond the stigma and to accept and support brain disorders in the same way they would support heart disease, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease. Many state organizations have dues for this type of membership. We recommend that $25 be sent to NAMI, then NAMI will return $7 and the new member's name to the state organization. Then turn to your doctor, dentist, lawyer, accountant, and associates at work. All of these people probably know that someone you love has a brain disorder. Sign them up as members of your state organization and NAMI. Reach out to the influential people in your community. There are individuals and organizations in every community that care about people. These are the community activists, religious-community members and organizations, and members of local civic groups. These people shape community opinions and attitudes--and too few understand brain disorders. Campaign brochures and materials are available to you through your state campaign coordinator. But "leafleting the world" at health fairs will have minimal impact on discrimination. On the other hand, distributing campaign materials and discussing brain disorders one-to-one with your community's opinion leaders will make a difference. Presenting the science message as a program at one of their meetings is a good way to engage these groups--but sign them up as members. Here are three things YOU can do now to educate your community's opinion leaders: Become part of the campaign in your state and community. All 50 states--and many communities--have appointed campaign coordinators. Call your state office to get in touch with your coordinator. Work with your campaign coordinators to reach influential opinion leaders in your community. Ask to speak at their meetings. Use the campaign materials to present the reasons our brain disorders should be covered the same way as other brain disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or epilepsy. A key message to deliver is that society pays and will continue to pay for these disorders one way or another, either by their taxes in Medicaid and Medicare payments or by giving us equal protection in private insurance. Take along an open letter to your U.S. senators and representatives, your state senator and representatives, your governor, and the president. Ask community leaders to sign them and include their affiliation. Ask them to join us in our efforts to end this unfair discrimination--and to join as an associate member of NAMI and your state organization. Signed letters with lots of signatures should then be copied and sent to all of the parties addressed and to NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination. Adopt a legislator. Target a key legislator for whom you voted and take on the ongoing job of making him or her a "friend and ally." Join NAMI for this legislator, as a gift for him or her. Send this "friend and ally" frequent notes and information. Identify business leaders in your community. Our loudest opponent in our efforts to end insurance discrimination for brain disorders has been the business community. Business interests widely criticized our attempts to end insurance discrimination as being a broad mandate that would lead to skyrocketing costs. The truth of the matter is that coverage of the severe brain disorders is not a broad mental health mandate and that numerous studies have shown that the cost of ending discrimination is minimal. By identifying local business leaders now, you will be prepared to effectively use campaign materials with business groups. These materials will be distributed to state campaign coordinators and state organizations in the coming months. Tell us what you've accomplished and receive a campaign lapel pin. When you've signed up your family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, senators, representatives, and business acquaintances, write to us at the campaign and tell us what you have done. When you have contacted your state and local campaign coordinator and worked to reach community opinion leaders, write to us. Again, tell us what you have done. We will send you a limited-edition campaign lapel pin. Most important, though, you will have joined the Campaign to End Discrimination as a participant.

NAMI neither agrees nor disagrees with the author's decisions. Ten months ago I gave birth to a healthy baby boy. I had been taking 200 milligrams of clozapine (Clozaril) daily for the previous six years. I was worried--and so were my doctors--about how the medication might affect my baby and how not taking the medicine might affect my functioning as a pregnant woman. There are so many factors and considerations to take into account when deciding whether or not to have a baby. Add to that having a condition that necessitates taking clozapine, and the decision becomes confusing and truly overwhelming. In the end the decision is completely personal, but in this article I will share with you the information that I have compiled over the course of several years concerning becoming pregnant on clozapine. One note, however: the information I share in this article is only about clozapine, which is an atypical drug in its class. It does not pertain to other anti-psychotic drugs. Before trying clozapine, I had struggled with depression for many years, and I finally entered a hospital. I spent two and one-half harrowing years there trying every drug for what by that time was diagnosed as a schizo-affective disorder. Nothing worked. With the help of my mother, I was able to be the first person to try clozapine at the New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center. Within about three months I was able to leave the hospital and function on my own. The next five years would be a difficult process of getting my life back together with day hospital, school, and finding a job. I met the man I would marry and--after a two-year engagement--we were married. I was thrilled to be able to continue my life in a normal, healthy way. Having a baby was always part of my dream, but I didn't know if it would be possible on clozapine. So, after nearly seven years of taking clozapine, I started researching and trying to decide. Because clozapine is a relatively new drug in the United States, there have been very few studies on pregnant women taking the drug. Advice from psychiatrists was almost uniformly the same: "Don't take clozapine while pregnant! Not enough is known about the effects of the drug on the fetus." One doctor advised cutting the dose of clozapine to a minimum during the first three months of pregnancy, which is the crucial time for fetal development. Although I did receive advice, I felt I was alone in the making of this decision. I was venturing into the unknown. In an article titled "Psychotropic Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation," authors Harold Goldberg, M.D., and Robyn Nissim, B.A., suggest that studies prove that the fetus is at greatest risk of negative effects from clozapine during the first three months of gestation, when organs are beginning to develop. Clozapine is a "category B" drug, which means that in animal studies there were no adverse effects on the fetus--but there are no extensive controlled studies in pregnant women. Clozapine, however, does cross the placenta to some extent, and the fetus absorbs more of the drug than the mother. For this reason, the mother may have to increase her dosage of the drug to maintain its effectiveness in controlling the symptoms for which it was prescribed. The fetus and the mother exist in equilibrium, and this can pose problems right before and during birth. According to Goldberg and Nissim, if clozapine is concentrated in the fetus right before birth, the baby will go through withdrawal after birth, and the effect could be toxic. One possible reaction could be a sedation effect known as "floppy baby syndrome," which disappears as the clozapine metabolizes or passes through the system. Some of the symptoms of this syndrome include hyperactivity, tremors, motor restlessness, and abnormal movements that could last for several months, but eventually subside. These symptoms seem to be due to the baby's immature metabolism. The authors state that there are two schools of thought about how to best protect a baby from the effects of withdrawal (even though their conclusions are inconclusive due to lack of studies). The authors recommend discontinuing clozapine five to ten days before delivery to avoid the symptoms; other doctors think it is safer to let the baby withdraw after birth. I did not reduce my dosage of clozapine during my pregnancy. I had experimented with stopping the medication and reducing the dose. I found that symptoms returned promptly and to such a degree of severity that reducing the dose while I was pregnant would have been unwise. However, I did reduce by half the clozapine the night before I was scheduled to go into the hospital. I started again the full dose the day after my son was born. He did have some breathing difficulty, but it corrected itself quickly. There was no evidence that this was a result of withdrawal. He also did not exhibit any of the possible side effects such as motor restlessness. The authors of the article mentioned above suggest that physicians (and patients) need to weigh controlling schizophrenia against the risk of the drug to the mother. I found several other studies done on women on clozapine who became pregnant. The first appeared in the American Journal of Psychiatry in June 1994. It reported on a woman with schizophrenia who had been in a five-year remission since taking clozapine. In preparation for her pregnancy she stopped taking the drug, but was forced to resume taking it when her symptoms returned. During the last nine weeks of her pregnancy, her medication was reduced. She delivered normally, and they baby showed no adverse effects and had no psychomotor abnormalities at six months. The conclusion was the recommendation to lower the dose of clozapine as much as possible a few days before birth to avoid "floppy baby syndrome." Also, the authors recommend that mothers should not breastfeed their babies because clozapine does pass through into the infant in breast milk. The other study, in the January 1993 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, reported that--as of December 1990--14 women were known to be exposed to clozapine during their pregnancies with no adverse effects on the fetuses. The Clozaril information packet distributed by Sandoz, the manufacturer of the drug, backs up these findings. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits given 2.5 to 7.0 times the human dose showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. Sandoz recommends that clozapine should not be administered to pregnant women unless clearly needed. Their reasons include: 1) adequate, well-controlled studies have not been performed; 2) animal studies are not always transferable to humans; and 3) it is advisable to minimize use of all drugs during pregnancy. Sandoz also agrees with the recommendation to avoid breastfeeding while on clozapine. The University of Connecticut Health Center Pregnancy Exposure Information Service also found that clozapine did not affect genetic material in bacterial or mammalian test systems. Again, they said that animal studies suggest that clozapine is not a cause of birth defects, but a small risk does exist--but a risk no greater that for the general population. Also mentioned is the possible agranulocytosis, which is a toxic effect on bone marrow. It can be fatal if not caught and reversed early enough. It is not clear if this problem could occur in the fetus or newborn. And there is a risk of seizures, but there is little data on whether the fetus or newborn might be affected, according to the December 1990 issue of the International Drug Therapy Newsletter. Some doctors warn that if you are on clozapine, you have a severe illness and, therefore, they don't recommend pregnancy. There is a potential risk of passing it on to your children. Also, doctors are concerned with the parenting skills--or lack of them--in people with serious brain disorders. In conclusion, this decision about pregnancy is completely personal. As scared as I was, I felt there was enough positive research and very little negative. I believed I could handle being a parent because, on the medication, I was well enough for long enough. I decided that life has risks at all times, and I really wanted to bring a baby into this world. I ventured into the unknown, but life itself is the great unknown. And I hope that, with what I have written, the unknown is a little more known.

The bill is poised to become law in the next two weeks. (We went to press the week of September 23.) The continuous and ardent advocacy of NAMI members made this historic achievement possible. "This has been a very long and difficult effort, but I'm pleased that we have finally succeeded," Senator Domenici (R-NM) said today. "I am proud of the fact that my mental health parity amendment was accepted. This represents a first step by the Congress to bring the nation to terms with caring for the millions of Americans who suffer from these diseases of the brain." Continued Domenici, "With this we begin remedying one of the most glaring and discriminatory discrepancies prevalent in America today." Co-sponsor of the bill, Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) said "This is a huge victory. It is a crucial and affordable step toward ending the stigma and the most egregious form of discrimination against Americans suffering from mental illness. Millions of American families will benefit from this very significant move toward parity treatment for people with mental illnesses." The bill, which is scheduled for approval by the House and Senate in the next few days (the last week in September) and then to be sent to the president, would outlaw discriminatory annual and lifetime limits on mental illness treatment in insurance plans offering mental health coverage. It extends to employers with more than 50 employees. Implementation is set for January 1998. The Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan is also covered under the bill. The provision "sunsets" in five years. The need for the amendment originated in the grassroots, and the people's voice--NAMI's voice--fueled the provision's momentum. On September 5, the Senate voted overwhelmingly 82 to 15 for the Domenici-Wellstone amendment. President Clinton expressed strong support for the amendment to House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a letter delivered the morning of September 11th. President Clinton wrote: "People with mental illness have faced discrimination in health insurance coverage for too long....It is time that we take steps to end this inequity." The House voted that same day 392 to 17 to instruct VA/HUD appropriations conferees to include the Domenici-Wellstone amendment as part of the proposed bill. On September 19th, the conferees did just that, voting to include this parity amendment. There can be no doubt that strong grassroots advocacy, week after week, registered with federal lawmakers. You, the members of NAMI, performed heroically and deserve immense gratitude and congratulations. But our fight has just begun. "This legislation is vital to stopping rampant discrimination against people with severe mental illness," said Laurie Flynn, executive director of NAMI. "This decision by the conferees is just the beginning of ending insurance discrimination. Congress has sent a strong message to employers and insurance companies that the days of second-class treatment of people with brain disorders are numbered." Annie Saylor, the President of NAMI, echoes this remark: "An important first step has been achieved toward ending discrimination against people with brain disorders called mental illnesses. We must not give up until ALL such discrimination has ended."

They stand as the most important federal programs that provide individuals with severely disabling illnesses with a modest income and that provide access to necessary treatment and services. The importance of these programs is underscored by statements of the NAMI membership and Board. NAMI policy says that reform should not result in less for beneficiaries than they have under current law. At the 1994 NAMI convention in San Antonio, membership brought forth a resolution demanding that staff make it a priority to advocate for increases in SSI (that were identified in the 20th anniversary review of SSI conducted under Social Security Administration Commissioner King). Specifically, members wanted the dollar-for-dollar grant offset that begins after the first $65 of earnings repealed. Precisely because of their vital importance, federal entitlements demand our continued examination. As currently constructed, these federal programs do not meet the needs of all individuals disabled by serious brain disorders-they provide strong disincentives to work, even during periods when work is possible and desirable by the consumer. Federal entitlements, for too many people, are a barrier to optimal recovery. Nor do the federal entitlement programs cover all necessary services. Some contain several discriminatory limits specifically on individuals with serious brain disorders. And the complexities of the entitlement programs, especially Medicaid, are such that any suggested changes for federal policy must be carefully considered. The complexities of the programs and their interaction are significant parts of the problem. NAMI, of course, can never tolerate discrimination against people with serious brain disorders and their families especially if written into federal law. NAMI cannot, however, afford to ignore the pressures on the federal entitlement programs. There will be continued clamor for federal legislators to control the growth in these entitlements or to cut them, due to their staggering outyear growth projections and the effect these have on the federal deficit and crowding out of discretionary programs. NAMI must advance the cause of people with serious brain disorders and their family members-hopefully in a constructive manner but in a strong defensive manner if necessary. Caution should be the byword for our examination. As noted, federal entitlement programs are a lifeline for many individuals with serious brain disorders. Federal entitlements that historically are of the greatest utility to persons with brain disorders are of two kinds: insured and means-tested. Within each type there is an income maintenance program and a health insurance program. The insured entitlements are Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare. The means-tested entitlements are Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. Insured Entitlements Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) guarantees a continuing income stream to a worker who becomes disabled after sufficient covered quarters (minimum six) of work to qualify under Title II of the Social Security Act. In certain circumstances a child of a disabled or deceased worker who becomes disabled before age 22 can receive SSDI on the parent's work record rather than on their own. The average monthly payment in 1993 was just under $650/month. In 1992 the federal government paid out $31.091 billion in SSDI benefits (up from $18.836 billion in 1985). While there is no means test going in (because disability supposes current inability to work full time), there is a limit on earnings (currently $500) through substantial gainful activity coming out. A person with large unearned income, and or substantial assets is still eligible for SSDI. But a person who works just over half-time under the minimum wage jeopardizes continuation of his/her SSDI monthly check. Medicare enrollment is automatically granted to a person under 65 years old whose disability and connection to covered work qualifies them for SSDI. But there is a two year waiting period. The underlying purpose is to observe whether the disability is permanent. Medicare Part A is the hospital insurance, and is non-contributory with respect to premium. Medicare Part B is Physician and other out-patient service insurance. It requires exercising an option to participate at all and payment of a monthly premium, currently $42.50. Medicare, while it does not cover prescription meds, does (Part B) cover physician visits at 80%, and covers partial hospitalization. Additionally, many disabled persons enrolled on Medicare are poor enough that they are also eligible for Medicaid. When Medicaid enrolled, their Part B premiums, and all deductibles and co-pays can be picked up by Medicaid (when no other third-party plan is obligated for first dollar coverage). This dual eligible status brings participants better health plan coverage than all but a few plans in the private sector. Medicare retains discriminatory limits on certain treatments for mental disorders. Hospital days are limited to 190 lifetime. This is not true for other diagnoses. Whereas outpatient co-insurance for all other services is 20% patient/80% plan, outpatient psychiatric services are @ 50% patient/50% plan. Ways & Means and Senate Labor made significant improvements in these discriminatory features of Medicare in the 103rd Congress, but the amendments never came to a floor vote in either chamber. Means-tested Entitlements Whereas the insured entitlements are linked to "premiums" paid into trust funds via employer and employee payroll taxes, the means-tested entitlements are public assistance programs available only to persons who meet the social characteristics for the programs -- and whose income, and assets -- each strictly defined in law and regulation -- are below the eligibility cut-off points. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a national income maintenance program for the poor elderly, blind, or disabled. No state may set an eligibility threshold lower than the national, unlike the former AFDC, now TANF program. It was assumed when the SSI program was enacted that the elderly poor would be the principal beneficiaries. But in 1993 83% of the total federal payments went to all persons with disabilities, not just those disabled by brain disorders. The amount paid to disabled recipients was $1.470 billion. The disability determination process in adults is virtually identical to that for SSDI. (The Social Security Administration is about to field test a "re-engineered" eligibility determination system.) A national income floor is established at about 68% of poverty. The current monthly grant is $470. When a person attempts to work full time, after the first $65 ($85 if they have no unearned income at all) of earnings their grant is offset one dollar for every two earned. They can control their hours or refuse raises to keep their earnings below the SSI vanishing point. They can thereby maintain a $1. grant, and thereby keep the categorical link to Medicaid eligibility. Section 1619 of SSI can also be utilized. This provision permits recipients in any state to maintain Medicaid eligibility to a higher income level when they no longer receive any SSI grant, even the dollar. It requires 1) that the disability eligibility condition for SSI is still current, though the income and assets conditions are no longer met because of higher earnings; and, 2) that Medicaid services are necessary on an on-going basis as a pre-condition of maintaining the person in a health condition that enables him/her to work. SSI for children is changed by the enactment of the Welfare Reform bill. "individual functional assessments" are no longer allowed as a tool for determining eligibility. Children must meet a listed disorder, and have a "marked and severe" functional impairment. The Administration reports that half of the children put off SSI, or not able to get on, will still qualify for Medicaid under another eligibility avenue (below the poverty level, for instance). Adults who qualified for SSI with a "material" contribution from an addictive disorder are put off the rolls January 1. The debt ceiling bill contained this provision. SSA estimates that 80% may re-qualify by a clearer restatement of their underlying brain disorder as sufficient in and of itself -- without any material contribution by addictive disorder -- to certify them as disabled under the SSA definitions and procedures. Persons functionally impaired with cognitive deficits will need advocates to manage and assist in their reapplication. SSI has a special relationship to housing for many adult recipients. Congregate housing -- group homes for the disabled, with or without support services, often take the person's whole (or nearly whole) monthly SSI check in payment for meals and shelter. Medicaid is automatically given to persons who are SSI enrolled in all but twelve states. These states were grandfathered at the time of enactment, and are permitted to use their own more stringent definitions for income and asset thresholds, and for disability. Although a separate determination process is required in these "209b" states, we are not aware of rejections of SSI enrolled persons to any extent. Medicaid pays for all diagnoses equally in the fee-for-service mode, so there is something akin to parity in the basic program. The community services that have been piloted in the public sector have more often than not involved Medicaid funding. Nearly forty states had included in their programs one or more of the optional services (services that do not have to be in a state's Medicaid plan for HCFA to certify its compliance) that help build a public sector community services network: the rehab option, the intense case management option, the clinic option, or the preferred provider option. Medicaid pays for prescription meds (which it still classifies as an optional service, but all 50 states and the District cover it), and in most states new generation drugs are covered by the formulary. Medicaid's shortcomings are the Institution for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion, and the inequality of access to the home-and-community-based waivers. IMDs are inpatient facilities in which more than 50% of the census has a primary diagnosis of mental disease, less patients over 65 with Alzheimer's or other dementia. Adults between the ages of 22 and 64 who are hospitalized in a facility characterized as an IMD cannot have their care paid for by Medicaid, even if they had Medicaid enrollment prior to admission. Psychiatric wings of larger hospitals have their in-patient census averaged in with the entire facility's, with the effect that Medicaid does reimburse care there. Scattered beds in acute, general care hospitals are also eligible for reimbursement. Up to age 22 and over age 65, there is no such exclusion. Repeal of the IMD exclusion might not be an unmixed blessing. When such language appeared in the first House version of Medicaid reform in 1994, the field feared that states would re-finance their old-line state mental hospitals with Medicaid if this went through. Persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities who were residing in state institutions were the primary beneficiaries of the home-and-community-based waivers created in OBRA 87 as sections 2175 and 2176 of that act. They required that an institutional bed be closed as a community slot was opened, or that without community services the person would absolutely require an institutional bed. Since deinstitutionalization for persons with brain disorders was mostly over by the time they were enacted, the slot tradeoff balance was not available. Parity for mental illnes was attached to S 1795, the last Medicaid attempt of the past Congress, in the Senate Finance Committee through the Conrad amendment. It covers amount, duration, and scope of services and co-pays. It is problematic to predict its effects, since it doesn't repeal the IMD rule, nor does it make the optional services that constitute the community services network mandatory. If it can pass the Senate Finance Committee again in the next Congress, there is still the question as to whether final enactment would follow. Characteristics of the Income Maintenance Programs Just over a quarter of all the enrolled persons in SSDI and SSI are disabled by a mental condition, not including retardation. 31.2% of SSI recipients (Dec, 1995) had a mental disorder as a primary disability diagnosis. This represented 852,600 persons between the ages of 18 and 64, plus 210,100 children. (A self-reported survey of a sample of the adults asserted that 43% lived below the poverty level.) The SSDI numbers for the same period are 1,069,000 persons, 25.9% of the total SSDI enrollment. The dilemma Consumers and families certainly desire that the federal entitlements worked in better harmony with the clinical course of the brain disorders and their unpredictable cycles. But too much success at independence causes loss of Medicaid and of the stability and quality of life Medicaid can enable. The same is roughly equivalent for Medicare. So the very support that enables one to work is threatened when one works. Private employer-sponsored health plans could fill the gap if they covered all needed services and supports. But SSDI beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients typically would have the kind of job that would not have such a health plan at the time they hit the ineligibility "notch". SSDI only has a nine-month trial work period (plus 36 months of continued eligibility without any Social Security check for the final 33 months), and has a very low permissible earnings (SGA) limit: $500/month. These features create very frightening disincentives for persons with severe brain disorders who are stabilized in the community and wish to work. Medicare can continue, but Social Security checks not stopped in timely fashion by self-reporting of earnings over the limit will have to be repaid. SSI has the equivalent of a very high marginal tax rate, 50% (for every dollar earned $0.50 is deducted from the SSI grant). SSI's section 1619 extenders of eligibility when earnings rise are very little understood and hard to access. These features create discouraging disincentives to persons with severe brain disorders who are stabilized in the community and wish to work. Loss of SSI threatens loss of Medicaid. Under these circumstances, for persons with severe brain disorders to reach for independence and self-fulfillment through greater earnings is like letting go of one swinging high trapeze bar to grab another -- without a net. Proposed solution The "open file" solution has been proposed. This mechanism would permit a disabled person in a period of stability to exceed the current fall-off thresholds. But if their disorder, acknowledged as clinically unpredictable yet chronic, flared up and rendered them unable to continue work -- their active enrollment status would be reactivated without the need to reapply from scratch, and the attendant lengthy waiting periods without supports. The former Ways & Means staffer who wrote section 1619 has been promoting versions of this solution for at least three congresses. There was no bill to this effect in the 104th. When the Social Security Administration's Associate Commissioner for Disability was asked if the SSA would support such a notion, the response was negative. Framework for legislative change Entitlement reform pressures that come from outyear cost growth forecasts are well known. Former Senators Rudman and Tsongas are leaders of the Concord Coalition, one prominent movement to rein in entitlement growth. Senators Nunn and Domenici did an across-the-aisle proposal in the just-ended Congress. Senator Robert Kerrey (Nebraska), with former Senator John Danforth headed another such group, at the request of the President. All of these bi-partisan efforts conclude that continuation of the status quo is under no circumstances a realistic option. While the largest entitlements, driven principally by the demographics of an aging society that is simultaneously adding significantly to lifespan, are Social Security and Medicare -- Medicaid is not far behind. The signing of the Welfare Reform bill and the number of votes it received from Democrats attest to the real political will to go beyond talk. The population whose disability arises from a severe brain disorder is not the target of these forces, but is caught up in them. The pre-conference House version of this bill contained a House provision creating a disability commission to look at all this. The House language did not survive the conference, and so is not in the law. But the House interest and intent remains. NAMI's position is clear: Consumers need life options that aren't severely curtailed by safety net eligibility rules. Consumers and families certainly believe that federal entitlements should work in better harmony with the clinical course of severe brain disorders. NAMI believes that these better life options include education, vocational and employment services, and employment -- and that participation in them for those who are able contributes to recovery and quality of life. Underlying the freedom to explore such options is the necessity for stable access to adequate and appropriate treatment and supports, living arrangements, and other basic life necessities. Once again, NAMI Board-passed public policy says that reform should not result in less for beneficiaries than they have under current law. (This is stated in the context of Health Care Reform, but is deeply and strongly enough held that it can legitimately be extended to other support areas in the public safety net.)

Glossary Antianxiety: Medication used to treat the symptoms of panic and other anxiety disorders. Antidepressant: Medication used to treat depression. Antimanic: Medication used to treat the manic episodes of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). Antipsychotic: Medication used to treat psychosis -- for example, in schizophrenia. Bipolar Disorder: A brain disorder characterized by manic and major depressive episodes, with periods of recovery generally separating the mood swings. Psychosis may be present during manic episodes. Bipolar disorder usually begins in the mid 20s and is chronic. Brain Disorder: A severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major depression. Cerebral Cortex: The portion of the brain that is critical in decisionmaking. Abnormalities in the cortex structure and functioning have been identified as likely causes of brain disorders. Dopamine: A chemical messenger in the brain. This neurotransmitter appears to play some role in brain disorders such as schizophrenia. Hippocampus: A nucleus in the brain crucial to learning and memory; part of the limbic system. Limbic System: A network of structures in the brain associated with control of emotion and behavior -- specifically, perception, motivation, gratification, memory, and thought. Locus Ceruleus: A nucleus in the brain that is involved in, among other things, the body’s response to stressful situations, such as the fight-or-flight response. Major Depression: A brain disorder characterized by profound depression -- that is, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, sadness, and feelings of helplessness. Other common symptoms include weight gain or loss, insomnia or excessive sleepiness, slowed or agitated movement, intense feeling of guilt or worthlessness, diminished ability to concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Bouts of depression commonly recur. Psychosis may also accompany major depression. The typical age of onset is the late 20s. Mania: A symptom of bipolar disorder characterized by irritability, expansiveness, elation, talkativeness, hyperactivity, and excitability. Monoamine: A group of neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) -- namely norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Monoamine-Oxidase Inhibitor (MAO): A class of antidepressants that acts by prolonging monoamine activity; generally used to treat persons who do not respond to tricyclic antidepressants. Norepinephrine: A chemical messenger in the brain. Alterations in the neurotransmitter have been implicated in several brain disorders. Neuron: Nerve cell; the basic functional unit of the nervous system that processes information in the brain. Neurotransmitter: A chemical messenger in the brain which can play a role in brain disorders. Neurological Disorder: Disorder pertaining to the nervous system, which is made up collectively of the brain, cranial nerves, spinal cord, spinal nerves, and other nerve cells and maintains the vital function of reception and response to stimuli. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): A brain disorder characterized by recurrent and persistent thoughts, images, or ideas perceived by the sufferer as intrusive and senseless (obsessions) and by stereotypic, repetitive, purposeful actions perceived as unnecessary (compulsions). The average age of onset is 20. OCD is generally chronic, with symptoms waxing and waning. The disorder frequently occurs with depression and Tourette’s syndrome, a neurological disorder. Panic Disorder: A brain disorder characterized by sudden, inexplicable bouts, or attacks, of intense fear and strong bodily symptoms -- namely, increased heart rate, profuse sweating, and difficulty in breathing. Panic attacks occur twice a week, on average. The disorder is usually chronic, with symptoms waxing and waning, and the average age of onset is 24. Antidepressants and antianxiety drugs, as well as psychotherapy, are often used to treat panic disorder. Parity: Equal health insurance coverage for brain and other physical disorders. Psychosis: A mental state characterized by severely impaired thinking and perceptions; a prominent symptom of schizophrenia. Psychotherapy: Often used in conjunction with medications to treat brain disorders, psychotherapy can include a range of therapies, including cognitive and behavioral. Reuptake: Removal of a neurotransmitter from the synapse by the neuron that released it. Schizophrenia: A brain disorder characterized by disturbance of cognition, hallucinations, and impaired emotional responsiveness. Schizophrenia usually begins in the late teen years or the early 20s. The disorder cannot now be cured or prevented, but its symptoms can be treated. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Medications which control the transmission of serotonin between brain cells and thus help treat the symptoms of such brain disorders as depression. Serotonin: A chemical messenger in the brain. This neurotransmitter has been implicated in several brain disorders, including major depression and bipolar disorder. Synapse: The site at which an impulse is transmitted from one nerve cell to the other, typically by a neurotransmitter. Tricyclic Antidepressants: Traditional medication for depression that acts by blocking reuptake of monoamines. Tourette’s Syndrome: A neurologic disease with symptoms including lack of muscle coordination, involuntary movements, tics, and incoherent verbal noises.

Third Edition by the World Preservation Society (Copies for 3.75 each may be obtained by calling 407-965-5996). ARCOZONE Contains herbs believed to provide essential minerals and nutrients to assist in maintaining nutritional balance and well being. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: una de gato, pau d arco. jatoba, suma, espinhiera santa, alfalfa, marapuama, catuaba. Arozon: enhances and stimulates the immune system, promotes toxin elimination, stimulates lymphatic drainage, improves circulation, tends to be anti-viral, anti-bacterial, helps the body to eliminate candida overgrowth. It can help build red blood cells and help people with anemia, diabetes and hypoglycemia. Other supporting aspects include nervous system calming, brain clearing and focasing, energizing, phlegm reduction, lung clearing, organic toxin removal, circulation promotion, acid neutralization, inflammation cooling. Because most chronic degenerative complaints, including low energy, arthtritis, asthman, chronic fatigue, gout, and numerous infections, each have to do with a compromised immune system, this herbal combination can have powerful and wide-reaching effects on a person's overall health. CALMAZON Assists the body's natural processes and supports its nutritional needs which may arise as a result of a stressful environment. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and thefollowing all natural Rainforest botanicals: passion flower, lemon balm, mulungu, espinhera santa, carqueja, marapuma, catuaba, chamomile. Calmazon: feeds the body to undo the effects of daily stress, promotes relaxation, and calming, improves circulation. Esineheira Santa strengthens the adrenal glands without stimulating the body. This formula has the effect of strengthening the body's stress reaction mechanism (CNS, endocrine system).This combination of herbs helps to promote mental clarity and emotional stability and keeps the body's system open and circulating even in the face of adversity. It releives headaches, nausea, hemorrhoids, supports the heart, and fortifies the blood. It has antidepressant properties and can be used for insomnia and to quiet hysteria. It is good for those who have stressful situations in their lives, including work, children and financial difficulties because it help the body to effectively clear the biochemical by-products of stress. DIGESTAZON Aides the body's natural process of digestion and nutrient absorption. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: bitterorange, boldo, carqueja, anisi, pepperment. Digestazon: promotes improved digestive functions, reduces the "bloated" feeling after eating, flushes liver/gall bladder, promotes intestinal function, normalizes ileocecal valve function. Often people are taking good nutients or supplements, but they are just not being absorbed, which often makes them feel hungry shortly after they have eaten. When people take Digestazon, the nutrients are more readily absorbed, and therefore people can eat less food and still feel satisfied, which is a key component in a weight-loss program. Also, people with allergies often have undigested protein and mucous build-up, both os which are dissolved when they take Digestazon. As well, it can clear parasites, balance ph, fortify the blood, and relieve gas, nausea, and insomnia. ENVIROZON Assists the body's natural ability to clease and restore balance after exposure to environmental impurities. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: jerubeba, boldo, artichoke, querbra pedra, una de gato, alfalfa. Environzon: cleanses and stimulates the liver/ gall bladder, promotes detoxification of the intestines, helps normalize ileocecal valve function, improves fat/sugar digestion, supports the spleen function, flushes and detoxifies the kidneys. This can positively affect cholesterol levels, fat, metabolism, blood sugar stabilization, enzyme and hormone production, energy levels, urinary tract infections, and recovery from alcoholic abuses. As well, it helps with gout, arthritis, asthma, herpes, constipation, hepatitis, chronic fatigue, and acne. Many inflammatory conditions (the "itis") are neutralized by this product (Recovazon also "soothes" the "itis" conditions). This combination of herbs aids the liver in its detoxification process after the ingesting of toxins from our sprayed food as well as our polluted air and water. ILLUMINATION This combination of the premier botanicals of the Rainforest into a single synergistic formula delivers a full complement of Amazonian treasures. Enjoy this awesome combination of Rainforest Bio-Energetic super food. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: una de gato, pau d arco, suma, tayuya, fucus, artichoke, boldo, star anise, bitter orange, pedra hume-caa, cajueja, quebra pedra, jerubeba, yerba mate, cornsilk, passion flower, lemon balm, mulungu, espinhiera santa, lemon grass, pepermint, pata de vaca, sarsaparilla, jatoba, chamomile, stevia, chuchuhuasi, sangre de drago. Illumination: a combination of 32 of the herbs used in the above formulas (except Warrior and Recovazon) constituting a complete body tonic. Containing a wide assortment of trace minerals derived from the herbs, which are grown in the rich soil of the Amazon rainforest, this combination acts as an excellent antioxidant complex and markedly improves immune function, supports hormonal systems, balances blood sugar levels, detoxifies blood, lymph, liver, gallbladder, helps calm anxiety, increases circulation, opens the systems of elomination, increases intestinal flora, and is a powerful nerve tonic. LUNAZON Assists the body's natural ability to restore harmony during cyclical imbalances.

This formuls helps with PMS systems such as mood swings, low energy, irritablility, cramps, bloating, and breast pain. Also it relieves menopausal systems such as hot flashes by balancing estrogen/progesterone imbalances. Lunazon is also high in iron, to help with associated anemia and may help women retain and replace calcium in the bones. METABAZON Assists the body's natural ability to maintain metabolic harmony, helping to meet special dietary needs that may arise from an imbalance in sugar energy. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: pedra hume caa, caehew plant, artichoke leaf, patadevaca, sarsaparilla stevia. Metabazon : supports the pancreas, helps to normalize the body's response to blood sugar fluctuations, as well as enzyme production (protease, lipase, amylase). This is very helpful with the "afternoon energy slump" many people experience and may help hypertension. It helps stimulate more complete carbohydrate digestion, which allows carbohydrates to break down into sugars; this maintains a long-term stable sugar supply, which combats hypoglycemia. Therefore, the herbal combination relieves the desire for sweet and thus helps with weight problems and candida. Those who eat food containing sugar, sucrose, fructose, corn syrup, dextrose, maltodextrin and rice syrup, often find these herbs of great benefit. RECOVAZON Assists the body's natural process in meeting special nutritional needs which may be present after athletic competition, physical activity, or from common muscle or joint discomfort.

This has an herbal anti-inflammatory and can be used for osteoarthritis, painful or swollen joints, cramps, and trauma. It balances the endocrine (glandular) system, calms the nerves after a stressful day, and is excellent for recovery from illness, injury, or surgery. These herbs support the liver, increase oxygenation, stimulate protein absorption, strengthen muscle tone, promote rejuvenation, and increase circulation. These herbs help in detoxifying, invigoration, balancing and emotionally uplifting. They can be used as an anti-inflammatory for both the soft tissues and joints. Recovazon and Calmazon are often used topically to soothe and heal injured areas of the body. SUMA Often refered to as "Brazilan Ginseng." Extensively used as a tonic and is reported to increase chi (energy flow in the body) promoting a sense of well being. Has a reputation as a cellular oxygenator assisting the body's ability to adjust to an ever changing environment. Suma, (available only in capsules but soon be also available in liquid form): is a South American version of ginseng. Suma has been used to help many chronic diseases including arthritis, asthma, high blood pressure, mononeucleosis, candida, hypoglycemia, Epstein Barr Sydrome, and high cholesteral. It seems to balance female hormones, is good for menopause, and is also used for impotency and frigidity. UNA DE GATO Deep in the Peruvian Amazon the bark of this vine has long been revered for it's powerful ability to assist the body's natural anti-oxidant responses. The Indigenous People of the Rainforest demonstrate a special reverence and respect for this extraordinary botanical. Una de Gato(available only in liquid or capsule form): is a favorite for stimulating the immune system. It is known as "the opener of the way" because of it's remarkable ability to cleanse the entire intestinal tract and therefore can be used for Crohn's Disease, hemorrhoids, parasites, leaky bowel syndrome, ulcers, gastritis, allergic disorders, and diverticulitis. It is a powerful anti-inflammatory which makes it very useful for arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. It also helps to increase T-lymphocyte and macrophage production, tonigy the blood, and can be also used as a broad spectrum infection fighter since it stops the expansion of virus-laden cells. WARRIOR An excellent multisport athletic supplement. Assist's the body's natural ability to enhance production, regulation and flow of essential energy while strengthening and tonifying overall system functions. Spagric extract made with distilled water, 20% ethanol and the following all natural Rainforest botanicals: marapiama, catuaba, sarsaparilla, dioscorease, astragalus, rehmanniae, atractylodes, tangerine peel, costus root, glycryrrhiza, snakegourd seed, dang gui, fennel, aquilaria. Warrior: is formulated to promote the unimeded flow of energy through the nervous system, and endurance, without a "racey" or "speedy" feeling. The basis of this formula comes from the Shao-Lin Monks of Tibet using Chinese herbs taken before Martial Arts exercise or battle to enhance maximum performance. Amazon herbs that have similar effects of energizing-strengthening, are combined with Chinese herbs. These herbs have natural plant sterois which promote muscle mass and tone. As well, they increase emotional stability, ease menopause symptoms, and increase libido.

Q. Why Rainforest herbs? Imagine a chunk of real estate the size of the United States and you get an idea of the immensity of the Amazonian Rainforest. Imagine a virgin tropical environment hundreds of miles from the nearest road or source of pollution. Think of the Rainforest soil, rich in minerals and trace elements as the forest continuously recycles in a virtually closed ecosystem. Imagine over 200,000 species of plants thriving in this tropical paradise. When you think of herbs, you've got to think of the Amazonian Rainforest as the mother of botanical resources. Many plant, though known and used for centuries in the Rainforest, are just beginning to get the attention they deserve as the world begins to focus on the treasures of Amazonia. Q. How did the actual formulas evolve? These formulas are based on traditional combinations that have been used by Indigenous Peoples for many years. Each individual herb has a long history and has been used thousands of times. For two years the Company worked exclusively with Health Care Practitioners, including medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncture physicians, nutritionists and athletic trainers. Through this experience and in cooperation with these professionals, we have refined and fine-tuned these formulas to address the nutritional needs facing the health conscious person living in today's modern environment. Q. How do I use the products? Rainforest Bio-Energetics are food products in the form of a concentrated herbal beverage. As an herbal drink, we suggest placing 10 to 30 drops into one ounce of pure water. As there are many body types, some will use less and some will use more. For children, elderly people, pregnant women or people who are dealing with serious health challenges, we suggest beginning with 3 to 5 drops. Although we prefer mixing the product in water, any liquid can be used such as your favorite juice, etc. To make an excellent hot tea, simply use hot water. By using Rainforest Bio-Energetics on a daily basis, you will find the way you most enjoy using the products. Q. How can I use the products together? All the formulas are natural food products and are synergistic in nature. We suggest that you use the products separately in the beginning so you may experience their nutritional benefits individually. As you gain experience with the formulas you will know when is the best time to use each formula and which combinations you like best. Q. Could I have a 'reaction' to the products? It is unlikely that anyone would experience a 'reaction'. However, as with any change in your diet that possibility exists. If you do experience a reaction, it will be temporary in nature and we suggest discontinuing the product for three days. Then resume, using one half as much. As your body acclimates, you may increase to the level that is best for you. Q. How is the product manufactured? Herbs used in the Company's Rainforest Bio-Energetics line are harvested in the sanctity of their natural environment. Whenever possible, our raw materials are acquired directly from the custodians of the Rainforest--its Ingenous Peoples. Phyto-sanitary certificates are secured to ensure the quality and purity of each plant. The botanicals are packed and shipped to the United States with all appropriate documentation. All shipments are cleared through U.S. Customs, Agriculture and FDA inspection. Note: All Rainforest Bio-Energetics herbs are imported, processed and sold as food and nutritional supplements. No drug claims are made. As such these products fall into the food (dietary supplement) category of the Food and Drug Administration regulations. All formulas are processed under exacting standards. After clearing the company's in house quality control checks, these materials are sent to a special FDA registered lab for further processing and bottling. This lab is experienced in processing according to the ancient spagyic principles. We consider this extraction method which emphasizes the 'whole' as simply the finest for preserving and potentizing the full natural energies of the botanicals. Great care is taken at every step from harvesting in the Rainforest through extraction and bottling to safeguard the quality and ensure the integrity of our products. A lot number and expiration date is printed on each label and batch samples are retained on deposit. When processing and bottling is complete, the finished product is returned to our marketing and distribution center in Jupiter, Florida. Q. What is the spagyric extraction process? The spagyric method of botanical preparation, sometimes referred to as "plant alchemy," is based on ancient bio-energetic principles. The details are proprietary information (trade secret)but the basic theory involves three important steps. First the raw material is run in a solution and separated into its three active components. The essential components are: an oil fraction, a clear volatile fraction and a mineral fraction. Next, there are special techniques used to purify each of these fractions which enhances the bio-availability of the water soluble, oil soluble and mineral essentials. The third step is recombining these three fractions into 'whole' again. Because of the intricacies of this process of this process and the celestial cycles we adhere to, it takes approximately three weeks to manufacture and bottle one batch of product. This process is an integral part of our objective to deliver to you the full and complete bio-energetic properties of the Rainforest. Q. Why are liquid supplements preferable to capsules? Unlike capsules, the liquid supplement is available for absorption into your system without having to be digested first. This bio-availability means that you receive the full strength benefit of all the herbal ingredients right away. Q. I see there is ethanol on the label. Why is the alcohol used? Ethanol is a natural alcohol distilled from grains. It is in Rainforest Bio-Energetics for several reasons. In our extraction process, it is the preferred solvent for breaking down the oil and tannin components of the botanicals. Secondly, alcohol acts as a stabilizer holding all the active essential components of the botanicals in solution for an indefinite period of time. Ethanol also serves as a carrier for the solution, further enhancing its bio-availability. For those who may be alcohol sensitive, we suggest enjoying your herbal beverage as a hot tea. Placing the drops into warm or hot water will evaporate the alcohol. Q. What is used to color and flavor the products? We do NOT add any colorings or flavorings to any of our products. The color and flavor of the product is simply the full synergistic compliment of all its natural ingredients. Q. What is the shelf life of the products? As the products are processed and labeled, the lot number and expiration date are printed on each label. Generally speaking, from the time of manufacture to the expiration date is four years. Q. What does Bio-Energetics mean? Bio-Energetics simply translated means life-energy. Our name, Rainforest Bio-Energitics exemplifies our commitment to bring you the finest botanical life-energy from the greatest concentrated source of life energy on Earth---the Amazonian Rainforest. The Rainforest people have a conscious awareness of the life-enegy of the plants living in their environment. Sometimes they sing to the plants to create a correct 'resonance' before harvesting. Q. What about product claims and the FDA? As liquid herbal food concentrates, our products come under the Food (dietary supplement) category of the Food and Drug Administration Regulations. The FDA monitors the import of our raw materials, inspects the manufacturing facility on a regular basis, and determines necessary labeling information. Since the products are foods and not drugs, it is prohibited to make any claims that the products will treat or cure any disease. We believe most everyone can benefit from proper nutrition and diets that include organic minerals and trace elements. We do not make therapeutic claims. We are confident that people will have a positive experience with our products and all of our products come with a guarantee of satisfaction. Q. How does using plants from the Rainforest help to preserve the Rainforest? We advocate the preservation of the Rainforest by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical resources. By creating an income stream for the herbs, we make the Rainforest more valuable alive than dead (clearcut). The Indigenous People have an intimate understanding of their ecosystems and have responded very favorably to our approach. This provides a morally and ecolologically balanced framework to support their need for currency and our need for the mineral rich botanicals of the Rainforest. We believe this type of exchange, born of correct intent, spawns a greater sharing and understanding between cultures. Building these channels of trust and mutual respect with a common goal of individual and planetary health is an ongoing endeavor and our corporate mission. In addition to the way we conduct our business securing our raw materials, we return 1% of all net sales to the Rainforests through our Rainforest Rescue Fund. Each distributor in the Rainforest Bio-Energetics network can feel satisfaction knowing that a part of each purchase goes to preserve our planet's natural resources. All of our literature and correspondence is printed on recycled paper. We use soy-based ink and encourage recycling all bottles and packaging material.

Certainly I had spent some time in Amazonia during my treasure seeking years and it had proven to be a formidable foe. Fueled by a dream to discover lost cities and armed so ineptly with a machete and some survival provisions, the jungle was heavy and overwhelming. Driven by the scent of treasure, I was constantly tortured by heat, humidity, biting insects and the threat of poisonous snakes. I knew that the cache was just over the next hill or across the river. My reward for this determination and persistent sweltering through the semi-permeable molasses of forest was bountiful, and expressed itself in several ways. There was of course the exhaustion, the fevers, the dysentery, the parasites and other similar benefits too unsavory to discuss, not the least of which was the wounded ego of a treasure hunter with an empty basket. After several such forays I surmised that the treaures of Amazonia were probably best left in the care of the Rainforest that so diligently guarded them. After all, by moderate standards, I was doing quite well with handicrafts from the Andes and gemstones from the mines in Brazil and Uraguay. Realistically, I could have left this remote chunk of real estate to God's birds and beasts and gone on about my business, but this fascination with the interior would not go away. I now understand Col. Fawcett's (Lost Trails, Lost Cities) preocupation with the mysterious seduction of the forest.        "The robust healty tribes do not live near the easily navigable rivers, but retire beyond the range of civilized man.... There, I believed,lay the greatest secrets of the past yet preserved in our world today. I had come to the turn of the road and for better or worse I chosethe forest path."                                                   -Col. P.H. Fawcett                                      Lost Trails, Lost Cities 1913 My own path continued to criss-cross the Andes, but would occasionally yield to the call of the Amazon. Invariably I would find myself upriver pursuing my natural trade, engaging in commerce with the indigenous Indians. Trading in natural artifacts, blow guns, monkey bones, ceramics and textiles was only marginally profitable, but afforded a convenient excuse to continue to journey into the Rainforest. It was on one of these trips that my life was essentially changed forever. (Now to regress for just a moment. My personal health history included a bout of hepatitis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever that culminated in a death experience in a hospital in North Carolina. Since that time, 10 years prior to this trip I have been continually challenged by a compromised liver. As anyone who has dealt with a liver problem knows, the liver serves a multitude of functions. Symptomatically poor liver function manifests itself as a feeling of low energy, fatigue, ungroundedness, unclear thought processes, and all in all operating at about 60% of my optimal efficiency. I had been plagued by all these symptoms up to the time of the journey.) I knew I wasn't in top condition when I wandered into Shipibo Vilage. I was sweating and chilling with a low-grade jungle fever, and I knew I looked shabby and travel- weary. It had been an exhausting day on the river, and with the searing afternoon heat I was feeling a bit sideways and stir-fried. Along with a suitable site to tie my hammock, I was offered some Una de Gato (Uncarla Tomentosa) and Chancca Piedra (Phyllantius Niruri) teas. I drank about a liter of this combination, and by morning the fever was broken and I was feeling better. After three days of resting and drinking these teas, my health improved significantly and I was ready to travel again. I took some of the Gato vine and Chanca Piedra shrub with me and continued to use these herbs daily. I continued to sense noticable improvements in my health. After about ten days of using these Rainforest herbs, I realized I was in better health than I had been in years. I had a strong sense of connectedness, clarity of thought, an energetic power and internal chi. I was breathing easier and my posture was more erect. In fact, I was in better health than I had ever been, even before hepatitis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever! Yet as dramatic as this rejuvenation was, it was only the beginning. Being now newly charged, I began to hear the call of those treasure sirens again. A couple of days further upriver, I stepped out of the dugout canoe into a double canopy forest and was immediately aware of something which I had never noticed before. I could sense a very powerful energy coming from the forest. I felt that magical moment of discovering a treasure that you are not looking for. There was a new awakening and a realization that I was standing in the highest concentration of life-energy on our planet. Incredible symbiotic relationships were all around me. Of an estimated 200,000 species of plants in this forest, only 2% have been thoroughly studied. New species of birds and frogs are identified each year, and new insects discovered every day. Clearly the Amazonian Rainforest is our planet's greatest natural treasure house. This was a new perception for me. It was as if I had passed through a filter- a screening process- and the blinders had been removed. The plants were radiating a clear life-energy. The Rainforest was no longer my foe. This is simply the most awe-inspiring living eco-system on the face of the earth . Everything is being recycled. An iguana could not die at my feet and he completely consumed in a matter of minutes- nothing left but clean bones. Life begetting life. A leaf would fall from the top canopy, drift down, hit the forest floor, decompose and another plant utilizing those nutrients would grow right back out. There is a variety of flying and crawling and biting insects; some of which choose to fly, to crawl on and bite me. Some even saw greater opportunities in burrowing into my skin, laying their eggs and raising families. I was just another host organism in this environment. I wasn't at the top of the food chain any longer either. The jagaur, cayman and snakes in this area could take me out for nutritional content. Nature's decision here is clear and absolute- there is no appeal process. It is a very humbling experience to recognize oneself as a minority species, as part of the living mosaic of the whole. The living forest maintains its ecological harmony. There are many members of our species who have a clear understanding of the energetics of this environment and its symbiotic balance. These are of course the Shipibo, Machegunga, Campa, Aguaruana and all other groups who call the forest home. These people had renewed my life with Una de Gato and Chanca Piedra, and from them I began to learn the true value of the Rainforest botanicals. Through our narrow model of scientific and clinical methodology, studies have shown the immune enhancing properties of Una de Gato and the liver rejuvenating characteristics of Chanc Piedra, but the true value of these Amazonian botanicals goes far beyond a "this for that" mentality. The plants from the Amazonian Rainforest serve as a store of nutrients, as well as trace elements and minerals from the rich soil of this environent. This is very important in that much of the food supply grown in this country is grown in soil that has been depleted of many of the essential trace elements and minerals. Yet these trace elements and minerals are the very building blocks of health. Without them, even vitamins can't do their job efficiently. When harvesting botanicals in the forest, often the indigenous people will sing to the plants to set up the correct resonance. These songs ask for the plant's permission and willingness to transfer its essential bio-energetic properties. But even more important is the idea of how this high concentration of life energy is stored and transferred. The botanicals of the Amazon serve as a conduit of information of our planet's greatest living treasure house of species and nutrients. In The Secret Life of Plants Peter Tompkins and Christopher Byrd demonstrate that plants interact with their environment. Plants growing to classical music grew better than plants exposed to heavy rock music. Even more profound were their experiments connecting plants to polygraph machines and measuring their response to a variety of environmental criteria including changes in behavior and the emotional state of the plant's owner. Their results seem to confirm some type of photosynthetic intelligence in living plants. Also worth considering is Carl Jung's theory of the "collective unconscious". Recent DNA research has demonstrated the possibility that the collective information of our ancestors is encoded in our genes. This suggests that when we recognize or learn something seemingly new, it is simply bringing the pre-known stored data into present awareness. Many of us have a sincere and genuine concern for the survival of the Rainforest. Unquestionably the ecologically-intact Amazonia is threatened. Perhaps some of us are just tapping into this "collective unconscious" as to the true value of the Rainforest. Perhaps the botanical intelligence from the Rainforest is playing a role in manifesting this awareness. The true value of the the Rainforest botanicals lies not only in their rich nutrient value, trace minerals and phtyo-pharamacological properties, but in the stored information of a thousand generations of ecological harmony. When we consider the environmental chaos that seems to be accelerating- as evidenced by dramatic changes in weather patterns and seismatic activity- perhaps the subtle energies of the Rainforest are what will nourish our awareness to value symbiotic balance at all levels of experience. The knowledge of our Creator's green temple is now being unveiled as the consciousness of natural healing comes of age.

If Amazonia were a country, it would be the ninth largest. One hectare (2.47 acres) may contain over 750 types of trees and 1500 species of Higher plants. The Amazon has over 1000 tributaries and is over three miles wide in some parts. One sixth of all the freshwater that flows on the earth moves through the Amazon drainage system, greater flow volume than the next eight largest rivers combined! An ocean-going vessel can cruise over 2300 miles up the mighty river, almost crossing the entire continent of South America. THE GOOD NEWS Our remarkable tropical Rainforests are beautiful, precious and teaming with life. Over half of the world's known plant and animal species call the Rainforest their home. With thousands of life-forms still being identified, you can imagine the vast potential this botanical treasure house offers in health and nutritional values. Is there a piece of the Rainforest near you? Consider this--fully 80% of the developed worlds's diet originated in the tropical Rainforest. We are surrounded by its bountiful gifts: Rice, corn, potatoes, sugarcane, bananas, oranges, coffee, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, chocolate, pineapples, avacados, vanilla, grapefruit and a variety of spices and teas all had their origins in the world's Rainforests. At least 3000 fruits may be available in the Rainforest: of these, only 200 are now in use. Some, like cherimoya, papaya and mango are only recently being enjoyed in the northern markets. The Rainforests also provide essential environmental services for all of us. Because the Amazon Rainforest is continuosly recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen, it has been described as the "Lungs of our Planet." THE BAD NEWS A large part of the world's greatest Rainforests are being leveled for farming, ranching and logging. It appears we are losing Earth's greatest biological treasures just as we are beginning to appreciate their true value. "The chainsaws and fires are doing their work in the world's tropical forests. An acre and a half of these forest are lost every second with tragic consequences for both developing and industrial countries." World Resources Institute. "Nearly half of the world's species of plants, animals and microorganisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century." Peter Raven, Our Diminishing Tropical Rainforests. "In the year 1979, 29,000 square miles of Rainforests were destroyed. In 1990, the rate accelerated to 55,000 square miles per year. That is an area larger than the state of Florida, lost each year." Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Of more than 265,000 known plant species, less than three percent have been tested for their medical applications, yet out of this tiny portion have come 25 percent of all medicines." Michael Blalick, Director, Institute of Economic Botany "Each time a medicine man dies, it is as if a library has burned down." Dr. Mark Plotkin, Ethnobotanist, Conservation International. There were an estimated ten million Indians living in the Amazonian Rainforest five centuries ago. Today, there are less than 200,000. THE GOOD NEWS When managed properly, the forest can provide for our needs on a perpetual basis. We believe that harvesting the Rainforest's life-giving resources on a sustainable basis will stop the destruction of these imperiled ecosystems. By purchasing renewable Rainforest products we help to protect the Rainforest and support the native people's economy. Sufficient demand for sustainable Rainforest products is necessary for preservation efforts to succeed. We can effect positive change. By sharing these ideas and Rainforest products with others we are promoting individual and planetary health. Use the products regularly, become familar with the Rainforest's nutritional benefits and help protect a world resource at risk.

Any Platinum Warrior who is fully blocked from any 1 leg of Infinity Bonus by downline, qualifies for this pool. This pool divided pro-rata by those who qualify. The first level in our program is the Wholesale Associate where you can retail product and sponsor a small network of distributor/ consumers. As a Wholesale Associate with $50 PV (personal volume), you may qualify to receive 10% of BV (bonus volume) on the purchases made by the people you directly sponsor into RBE. The next position is that of Ambassador where you begin building other leadership skills within your group by assisting your downline to build a second level of participants, and chart a course for their own success. With a $100 PV (personal volume), you may now qualify for the 3 Star Ambassador level of achievement by creating 3 active legs of Ambassadors and earn 10% BV on everyone through 3 levels. By adding one more active leg to your organization for a total of 4, you will become a 4 Star Ambassador and earn 10% through 4 levels of sponsorship. By adding a fifth active leg, you will be promoted to the position of 5 Star Ambassador and earn a 5th level of 10% BV. Once you have earned the position of 5 Star Ambassador, you now qualify for one of the most exciting and profitable compensation concepts offered in the Network Marketing industry. When you understand the profit potential at this level, you will want to obtain this position as quickly as is humanly possible. THE WARRIOR INFINITY BONUS The Warrior Infinity Bonus is designed to give extraordinary rewards to extraordinary leadership performance. This bonus gives 5 Star Ambassadors the potential of earning a percentage on their organization from the 6th level down, regardless of depth. The Infinity Bonus is paid in addition to the 5 level bonuses. This bonus is paid on all legs and interrupted only by other downline Ambassador qualified for the Warrior Infinity Bonus on a specific leg. When that happens, the higher degree Ambassador still receives the difference between their bonus percentage. Look at the profit plan diagram and you will see that you can qualify for an additional 1%, 3%, 5%, or up to 8% of BV on your organization from the 6th level down. That simply means you could earn up to as much as 10% on your first five levels and up to 8% on the 6th level down to infinity. WARRIOR BONUS POOL The Warrior Bonus Pool is 2% of the company's total monthly sales. Any month a qualified Platinum Warrior also has a qualified Platinum Warrior in his downline, he qualifies for this fund. The fund is divided Pro-rata.

Even though it reads like an Indian Jones action novel, it's actually a true story of "Amazon John" Easterling and Rainforest Bio-Energetics@.  It's a story of adventure and discovery complete with lost civilizations, sacred sites, pre-Columbian treasure, ancient curses, near death experiences, and life saving botanicals from the Rainforest.  "Amazon John" is a degreed environmentalist and a lifetime member of the South American Explorers Club with 20 years experience and over I 00 trips into the jungle's interior.  His is a saga that includes many chapters of incredible encounters and fantastic discovery while other events are almost too intense to discuss.  Indeed there are still places in the world where fact is more phenomenal than fiction.His life started off normally enough.  He was born to a typical American family, went to a typical American school and had a typical American boyhood, at least until the fateful day when "that" issue of The Weekly Reader arrived in his third grade classroom. Each week, the publication featured a story about a young child from some exotic part of the globe.  On this day, it was Raul and his llama, high in the snow capped Andes mountains, "living the adventure" every day.  It was a story that captured young John's imagination and set his heart to beating like the drum of discovery. As he learned of the Inca history, his mind raced with the possibilities - lost cities of untold wealth - advanced civilizations vanished off the face of the earth - scattered ruins deep in the jungle or hidden in the mountains, still living the "old ways".  He was awakened to a whole new world, and suddenly knew that this was to be his destiny.  He requested an immediate reassignment to Peru. After graduating from college, with a degree in Environmental Studies, John sold his car and bought a ticket to Ecuador to begin his search for lost treasure.  From there, he traveled by bus through Peru and began to experience a special bonding with the South American continent.  To him, it was a land brimming with mystery, intrigue and opportunity.  Some highland Indians introduced him to the alpaca.  This high altitude relative of the llama is the central focus of native Andean life.  It has the softest and most durable wool of any animal on the planet.  He returned home with a handful of traditional handicrafts, woven by natives from the wool of the alpaca, and discovered that others also recognized the quality and value they represented.  Thus began his first importing business. Over the next several years, John made many trips between North and South America.  He supported himself with his native handicrafts business, but was also able to spend months at a time exploring the ruins of Machu Picchu, Tiahuanaco, Tambo Machay, Paracas and Nazca.  He was finally living his dream, searching for lost treasure!  He learned a valuable secret--when you yield to the siren of adventure, your life takes on its true course and all the obstacles to your dreams are shattered. Eventually he got into some ancient sites and began an avocation in Pre-Columbian textiles, dealing with museums and collectors around the world.  The search for lost cities led over the Andes and into the Amazon.  Going upriver he developed a trade in Amazon basin tribal artifacts.  The more time he spent in the Rainforest, the more he came to appreciate the Indigenous People's knowledge and heritage of Amazonian botanicals. John's health had been compromised earlier in life with a serious bout of hepatitis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  In fact, he had a near death experience from that in a hospital in North Carolina.  As a result, he suffered from chronic and long lasting periods of fatigue and. low grade fevers and compromised liver function. Some Shipibo Indians on the headwaters of the Amazon shared some Ufia de Gato and Quebra Pedra teas with John.  After a few days of drinking this herbal combination, he felt an increased sense of balance and revitalization.  His energy returned.  His sense of groundedness, his mental acuity, everything improved not only to the point where he was before he was sick but to an even higher plateau of health where he had never been.  From that point on he maintained a personal stash of these herbs. He continued making trips "upriver" collecting blowguns, carved monkey bones and other artifacts, not fully realizing that he had been introduced to the real treasure of Amazonia-the life force of the Rainforest itself.After ten years and over 50 trips, he sold the business, Raiders of the Lost Art, with the intention of spending some time in Tibet.  He was planning one last trip through South America to stockpile his dwindling herb supply when, as the wheel of fortune spins, he reconnected with Nicole Maxwell. Nicole is the author of "Witchdoctor's Apprentice," first published in 1961, and a dear friend of his.  She spent 40 years of her life doing research and collecting botanicals in the Rainforest of Peru.  He always enjoyed her wit and wisdom.  When she expressed an interest in returning to Peru, his new path became clear.  His consciousness shifted and he began to fully realize that the dense tropical jungle that he had grudgingly macheted his way through searching for lost treasure, was, in fact, itself the real treasure.  There came a realization that he was standing in the highest concentration of life energy on the planet.  Nicole's uncompromising spirit for life made her a wonderful travel companion and an invaluable source of inspiration. Sharing the Adventure Health care professionals whom he had known encouraged further exploration of the potential for traditional nutritional formulas from the Rainforest.  The Rainforest BioEnergetics@ Company was formed and an exciting cooperative effort was born.  Using the same diligence with when he had previously pursued ancient artifacts, Easterling committed himself to the Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ mission. As products were shared and the benefits were experienced, more and more practitioners became involved in using Rainforest-Bio-Energetics@.  As the word spread from person to person, they began receiving calls from others requesting the products.  After researching modalities as to how best to expose these products to a larger audience, network marketing evolved as the natural choice, since this was in effect the way the information was being carried already. Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ is a six year old, multimillion dollar company that is just now entering its "Acceleration Phase." The Company's mission is to create a new vision of Rainforest consciousness, planetary health and economic destiny.  It was founded around three simple principles which form a circle-adventure, discovery and empowerment.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@  Associates are encouraged to embark on an adventure of exploration, finding new possibilities for their own health of the planet.  They will discover the magical healing power of the concentrated life energy of the Rainforest and they will be empowered to bring new meaning into their lives, not only profitting themselves, but empowering the Indigenous People of the Rainforest to make decisions about their future. The company's product formulas are based on traditional combinations that have been used by the Indigenous Peoples of Amazonia for may years.  Each individual herb has a long history of safe and successful use.  In addition, the Company has worked closely with hundreds of medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncturists, nutritionists and athletic trainers since its inception to obtain a better understanding through carefully controlled observation, of how these nutritional supplements benefit those who use them.  This information has been used to fine tune the formulas in order to address the nutritional needs facing all health conscious people in modern society-Amazon John even goes further in explaining why these formulas are so necessary today. The true value of the Rainforest botanicals lies not only in their rich nutrient value, trace minerals and phyto-pharmacological properties, but in the stored information of a thousand generations of ecological harmony.  When we consider the environmental chaos that seems to be accelerating-as evidenced by dramatic changes in weather patterns and seismic activity-perhaps the subtle energies of the Rainforest are what will nourish our awareness to the valued symbiotic balance at all levels of experience.  These Rainforest nutritional products are how being unveiled to a greater population as the consciousness for the real treasures of Amazonia comes of age. Preserving the Rainforest Herbs used in the Company's products are harvested with a respect for their natural environment.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ maintains a permanent company facility in the Amazon for collecting and grading raw material.  They work directly with the Indigenous People to ecologically harvest these herbal treasures.  When you are connected with Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ you know you are connected to the source. The Company advocates the preservation of the Rainforests by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical resources.  By creating an income stream for the herbs, we make the Rainforest more valuable alive than dead (clear cut). The Indigenous People have an ultimate understanding of their ecosystems and have responded very favorably to the Company's approach.  This provides a morally and ecologically balanced framework to support their need for currency and our need for the mineral rich botanicals of the Rainforest.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ believes this type of exchange born of correct intent spawns a greater sharing and understanding between cultures.  Building these channels of trust and mutual respect with a common goal of individual and planetary health is an ongoing endeavor and the corporate mission. In addition to the way the Company conducts their business securing raw materials, they return 1% of all net sales to the Rainforests through their Rainforest Rescue Fund.  Each Associate in the Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ network can feel satisfaction knowing that they are doing their part and that creating sufficient demand for Rainforest products is necessary for preservation efforts to succeed. All company literature and correspondence is printed on recycled paper.  They use soy-based ink and encourage recycling all bottles and packaging material. The formulas are processed under exacting standards.  The active herbal agents are concentrated using its proprietary process, which emphasizes the "whole" nutritional complement of the plant.  The method of botanical preparation sometimes referred to as "plant alchemy" is based on ancient bioenergetic principles.  To maximize bioavailability, most of the extracts are presented in liquid form.  This process is an integral part of the Company's objective to deliver the full and complete bioenergetic properties of the Rainforest.  When added to pure water, they create excellent teas. Una de Gato, or "Cat's Claw" serves as a base for many of the Company's products.  Una de Gato is referred to bymany as the most important botanical of our time.  Rainforest Bio-Enerc,etics@ first introduced this incredible herb to U.S. doctors in 1991, predicting it would become a legend.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ is the leading importer of Ufia de Gato and guarantees the highest quality.  There are other Rainforest herbs which are well known such as Pau d'Arco, Suma, and Stevia and many more destined for the spotlight such as Muira Puama and Chuchubusasi.  IlluminationTM, which is the flagship product, is a combination of the premier botanicals of the Rainforest into a single synergistic formula.  It contains Una de gato, pau d'arco, suma, tayuya and 29 other herbal components.  Other products are Arcozon Calmazon, Digestazon, Envirozon, Metabazon, Lunazon, Warrior, Recovazon, Suma, and Una de Gato.  For many of these products, the names are suggestive of their benefits.  Excellent Company literature provides ample additional information. The Amazon Warrior Profit Plan In today's competitive marketplace, every MLM company strives to achieve the pinnacle of success.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@, Inc. is no different.  But that's where the comparison ends.  No other company can claim such a unique and proven product line.

The company must also provide solid marketing concepts and a compensation plan which offers the serious minded distributor a significant financial opportunity.

This accounts for the sudden appearanceof selling in many such issues. People drag along for years witha stock and then find that they are carrying a hopeless investmentand sell it to get into some other issue which gives more promisefor the future. Rockefeller “Boys” Bearing the Market? That the Rockefeller “boys” - Percy and William G. -are factors in the stock market on an important scale is a storywhich has been going the rounds of Wall Street for the past weekor more. And their activity is believed to be on the bearside.In fact, to them and following is credited much of the weaknessin shares of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. The sons of William Rockefeller are not novices in stock speculation;nor are they always successful in their Wall Street ventures.But in recent turns their winnings are believed to have been fairlysubstantial. Back to the top of the page The History of Barron's, The Dow Jones Business and Financial Weekly BARRON'S magazine first appeared on the nation's newsstands May 9, 1921, at a seemingly unlikely time -- the depth of a post-World War I recession. But to Clarence W. Barron, the publication's founder and namesake, the time was right: "A fresh financial publication based on sound sources of information and policy should be a helpful factor in assuring return of confidence to the world of business," he wrote in that first issue. Mr. Barron, president and owner of Dow Jones & Company, served as editor of the magazine to which he applied the motto "the application of money to positive ends." Son-in-law Hugh Bancroft, who proposed the financial weekly -- with an eye toward making use of Wall Street Journal presses that were idle on Sundays -- was the magazine's publisher. Barron's initial cover price was 20 cents, and an annual subscription was $10. The introductory issue's cover story, "European Unsettlements -- The Distress of France," carried Mr. Barron's byline. When Barron's made its debut, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (then comprised of 20 stocks) was a lofty 79.48. The first issue was 16 pages and sold approximately 9,000 copies. Circulation in this 75th anniversary year is over 275,000. As circulation has grown, so has Barron's reputation for journalism that affects corporations and financial markets and that is consistently ahead of the curve. Some historical examples: Exposed financial discrepancies in the New Haven Railroad's 1955 annual report. The discrepancies, covering up financial woes, subsequently led the railroad to file for bankruptcy. Scored a 1970 coup on the imminent collapse of the Bernard Cornfield empire, Investors Overseas Services, LTD., which Barron's began to suspect from the strange action of I.O.S. stock on the London market. Correctly forecast the disaster that befell holders of $2.4 billion of Washington Power Supply System bonds; 1983. Months before the October 1987 market crash, headlined an article "Bears Take Over The World" and warned that the Federal Reserve would likely tighten credit. An August 1988 cover story, "The Coming Collapse in Home Prices," gave readers an early warning of the impending fall in residential real estate prices. Broke the story on the perils ahead for investment portfolios of life insurers; 1990. Warned of the pitfalls of exotic derivatives securities in 1993, well ahead of the derivatives trading woes that ultimately bankrupted California's Orange County. Barron's initial focus on stocks and bonds has broadened through the years, tracking reader interest in a widening array of investment vehicles. During the '70s, the business and financial weekly added columns on commodities, options, international stock exchanges and the domestic real estate market. The '80s brought such Barron's features as the Sotheby's Art Index and the weekly column Current Yield, an analysis of bond markets. The '90s, so far, have seen expanded mutual funds coverage, including the recent introduction of an annual assessment of mutual fund families; the launch of Barron's quarterly Big Money Poll, a survey of major institutional money managers' views on financial markets; and stepped-up coverage of the technology industry with the opening of a bureau in Palo Alto, Calif. Barron's 75th birthday is a milepost achieved by fewer than one in 150 magazines. With 75 years experience, Barron's remains forward-looking, and what it sees transcends the printed page: "Barron's will join the rush to the Internet, launching a Web-based weekly edition," Editor Edwin A. Finn Jr. said. "Readers of the on-line edition, for example, will be able to get historical financial data and stock market information about any company mentioned and do their own customized investment research using Barron's data." Barron's is also enhancing its international presence with the addition of correspondents in Tokyo and London. Its first international forum was held recently in Tokyo. Another is scheduled later this year. In the 75 years since Clarence Barron launched his weekly financial magazine, it has become more comprehensive, even global. What hasn't changed is the commitment to provide readers the best intelligence for making wise investment decisions. Back to the top of the page Who Was Clarence Walker Barron? CLARENCE W. BARRON (1855-1928), founder of Barron's magazine and generally considered the "father of financial journalism," was born July 2, 1855, in Boston, to Henry, a struggling merchant, and Elana Barron. Clarence Barron began his journalism career at the Boston Daily News, writing on business and economics before he was 20 years old. He moved to the Boston Transcript as a reporter in 1875 and, convincing his editors of the value of reporting the news affecting the market tables, created the newspaper's first financial section and served as its editor. In July 1887, when just 32 years old, Mr. Barron decided there was need of a service that would publish financial news during the day in bulletin form and established the Boston News Bureau, a newspaper regarded as the "Financial Bible of New England." Subsequently, he arranged for the Boston News Bureau to exchange news with Dow Jones & Company, which also published financial bulletins, and The Wall Street Journal in New York. In 1896 he founded the Philadelphia News Bureau. In 1902 Mr. Barron acquired Dow Jones from ailing founder Charles H. Dow and partner Charles Bergstresser. Co-founder Edward D. Jones had left the company three years earlier. Mr. Barron was initially a passive owner, preferring to spend time at his home and farm in Massachusetts. He met with the board of directors in 1902 and then not again for almost 10 years, infrequently visiting Dow Jones' offices. He was more actively involved with Doremus & Company, the financial advertising firm he established in 1904. His wife, Jessie, was his representative on the Dow Jones board, and she assumed an active role in the company. But it was almost inevitable that Mr. Barron, a colorful individual with influential friends and a seemingly endless amount of energy, would become more involved in running Dow Jones. The turning point occurred in 1912 when, suspecting the company faced a financial slump, he became president and assumed day-to-day control. In addition to his management function, he became editor of The Wall Street Journal and its lead reporter, often filing dispatches on finance and politics, many during his frequent trips to Europe. Under his tutelage, Journal writing and headlines became crisper and profiles of business people were added. It was Mr. Barron's reporting that exposed Charles Ponzi's investment scam in 1920. Mr. Ponzi, who Mr. Barron claimed was paying investors exorbitant yields in a pyramid scheme using money from subsequent investors, countered with a $5 million libel suit. The exposé ultimately led to Mr. Ponzi's conviction. The libel action against Mr. Barron was dismissed. Convinced of the need for a national, weekly financial magazine, Mr. Barron, then 66 years old, introduced Barron's on May 9, 1921. He wrote the lead story in the first issue, European Unsettlements -- The Distress of France, while in Paris. At its launch, Barron's, The National Financial Weekly, had a cover price of 20 cents and an annual subscription price of $10. Mr. Barron wrote several books, including "Twenty-eight Essays on The Federal Reserve Act," "The Audacious War," "The Mexican Problem" and "A World Remaking, or Peace Finance." His edited notes and writings, including records of conversations with the likes of Calvin Coolidge and Henry Ford, were published as "They Told Barron" and "More They Told Barron." Despite frequent health problems compounded by his immense girth (upwards of 330 pounds on a 5-foot-5-inch frame), Mr. Barron remained active as president of Dow Jones and editor and writer for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's until shortly before his death on Oct. 2, 1928, at age 73. He was predeceased by Jessie, a widow with two daughters when she married Clarence, and stepdaughter Martha. He was survived by stepdaughter Jane Bancroft and her husband, Hugh, who was the first publisher of Barron's and an officer of Dow Jones. Their descendents continue to have a controlling interest in Dow Jones, and three members of the Bancroft family are directors of the company.

They form strong views and never blindly follow the herd. They are all disciplined planners and hard workers. They don't get emotionally attached to companies or investment ideas. When it's time to act, they act decisively. They neither shun nor embrace risk but spend a lot of time understanding and managing it. In other words, they are voracious and creative users of information. They are in the business of turning information into insight, and investing money in those insights. At Barron's, we too are in the investment information/insight business. Each week, we look back over the last week and forward to the weeks ahead, always trying to cut through the fog and the fads and place events in a perspective that will be useful to our readers. Our aim is to be the most important tool in your wealth-building toolbox. © 1996, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

What's more, Barron's explores what well may happen in the markets next, thereby arming investors for the shocks and turmoil of market battles to come and allowing them to survive -- indeed, to thrive -- as a result. Financial survival and success being as highly esteemed as they are, Barron's is read intensely, cover-to-cover, week-after-week, by some of the most powerful (read "rich and influential") people in the world. Different parts of the publication contain different information (data, insights and ideas), expressed in different ways (feature articles, columns, Q&As, charts and tables, financial statistics etc.) on different markets, the economy, sectors and companies. Thus, how each person reads Barron's varies with each person's needs. But there's one constant among all these readers: It is the remarkable utility of Barron's that they value most -- the fact that Barron's gives them immediately useful information that they can (almost literally) take to the bank. Parts of the Whole Barron's is made up of two distinct parts -- a center pullout section called "Market Week," and the pages that wrap around this center section and that we call (quite naturally enough) "The Wrap." The Wrap contains the cover story, feature stories, the weekly Q&A, some regular columns, the departments and the editorial material. Market Week covers the previous week's market activities in detail with columns that focus on specific markets, the comprehensive statistics in the financial pages, and the final eight pages of market data and macroeconomic data known as the "Market Lab." Barron's editorial perspective is to look back at what happened in the markets, and then to project forward to what may happen next. So the physical makeup of the publication mirrors our editorial focus: an inner pullout that chronicles the markets' activities for the previous week and an outer wrap whose articles, columns and departments explore the possibilities (good, bad and indifferent) for the economy, sectors, companies and investment categories. I. The Wrap contains, on any given week, the following material in this usual order of appearance through the publication: Up & Down Wall Street, by Alan Abelson. This legendary Wall Street wise man offers his witty and often controversial opinions on business, financial, economic and political news and events and analyzes moves in specific stocks. Table of Contents. A listing with descriptions of that issue's stories, columns and departments. Index to Companies. An alphabetical listing of companies mentioned in that week's issue. Review & Preview, edited by Andy Zipser. This regular feature provides a quick look at the week that was and fills in the investing datebook with next week's critical events. Review & Preview Follow-Up, written by staffers who wrote the original stories. Provides the opportunity to look back on previous Barron's stories and "find out how we did" -- were reporters on the money or off the track? Feature Articles (including Sizing Up Small Caps, by Rhonda Brammer). The ever-changing weekly array of key stories in an issue. Q&A. Every week, we interview security analysts and money managers who discuss particular industry sectors and pass along their investing ideas and themes. Cover Story. Appears in the Wrap as the first right-hand page after the centerfold. That week's most topical, most important story. Offerings in the Offing. A brief look at upcoming stock issues, mainly initial public offerings (IPOs). The column provides important investment data as well as "Worth Noting" -- cautious comments that balance the underwriter's enthusiastic look at the stock. 13D Filings. 13Ds are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within 10 days of a company's or an individual's attaining a 5% or greater position in any class of a company's securities. This information can indicate what insiders and other major shareholders are doing. This often provides insights into their view of the company's prospects. Research Reports. Before an investment firm recommends a stock for purchase, they'll research the company to determine whether or not it's a good investment. This column provides a sampling of research report information from various investment firms and analysts. Insider Transactions. An insider is any officer, director or owner of 10% or more of a class of a company's securities. An insider must report to the SEC, by the 10th of the month following a trade, any transaction that he or she has engaged in. The Insider Transactions table shows the largest dollar value transactions reported to the SEC for a specified period. Heavy sales might indicate that the insiders are pessimistic about the company's prospects; heavy purchases might indicate an optimistic outlook. Market Watch. Excerpts from various investment newsletters, bulletins, and research reports. The column focuses on what the advisors of these publications see as the markets' direction rather than on their opinion of individual stocks. Speaking of Dividends, by Shirley A. Lazo. A column that analyzes dividends -- what companies are paying them, what companies aren't, increases, decreases and what might be ahead. Mutual Funds, edited by Leslie P. Norton. The part of the magazine that covers mutual funds. Includes Fund of Information, Mutual Choice, Scoreboard, Cash Track and Fund Scope. Fund of Information. A column reporting on trends and events affecting mutual funds, fund managers' strategies and performance, and other news that could have an impact on investors. Mutual Choice. A column that looks at the holdings, strategies and performance of one stock fund. Scoreboard. A brief column that provides an at-a-glance look and commentary on U.S. stock and bond funds.

In fact, most "green"products and services designed and promoted primarily for their environmentalbenefits have failed. The reason for their failure is embarrassingly simple:they did not first satisfy the basic style, performance and/or price requirementsor expectations of the mass market. Coddington Environmental helps businesses appropriately position product,service and technology "design-for-the-environment" initiatives.After all, the greenest products and technologies won't benefit the environmentif they don't see the light of day.

Green processes and products are based (and often priced)on environmental ethics and principles (such as eco-justice, zero wasteand sustainable development) that few end-users fully understand or empathizewith. Market environmental education, however, can be too time-consuming and costlya process for one company to bear alone. Coddington Environmental, therefore,links marketers up with programs or partners that have similar educationalgoals and similar target audiences.

To operate efficiently, an internalcombustion engine must breathe efficiently. The more air received by eachengine cylinder during the combustion process, the more completely the fuelwill be burned, thereby reducing the cost of fuel and reducing the amountof toxic emissions. The purpose of the ACE Array Poppet Valve System is to improve the performanceof the inlet valves that allow air to enter into the engine cylinders duringthe combustion process. In particular, the ACE Valve System greatly improvesthe efficiency of a standard internal combustion engine by increasing thevolume of air entering an engine cylinder. It does so by enlarging the amountof inlet opening area available when air is transferred into the cylinder. The increase in engine operational efficiency results in better gas mileage,lower operating cost and a much cleaner burning engine, thereby, reducingair pollution. Most car engines have one inlet valve per cylinder to allow air entry intothe engine. Some higher performance cars and race cars have as many as twoinlet valves for air entry into the engine. The ACE Array Poppet Valve Systemuses three to four valves (as a clustered group) designed to allow moreair into the cylinder. This results in what is called an increase in volumetricefficiency, which merely means that there is more air available inside anygiven cylinder during engine operation. The ACE Array Poppet Valve System The innovative ACE Array Poppet Valve System narrows the extended intakeevent while simultaneously increasing the amount of air and fuel withinan engine's cylinder head having the same limitation of 45% valve diameterto bore diameter. This has been accomplished through miniaturization andmultiplication of valves. ACE has developed four miniature valves about the axis of the port's entryinto the combustion chamber. These valves are sized to one-half the diameterof the standard single valve they replace. The Array Poppet Valve Systemis seated with four one-half size valves, each having one-quarter the areaas the standard valve they replaced. The value of the Array Poppet ValveSystem is that the combined circumferences of the four mini valves equateto twice the circumference of the standard valve they replace. As a result,only one-half the previously required valve lift distance is now required. Utilization of the ACE Array Poppet Valve System to ImproveEngine Efficiency When the piston reaches top dead center (TDC) the Array Valve windowwill be the same size as the standard valve would have been, except thevalve has been lifted off its valve seat 4.5 degrees later. The result isless contamination of exhaust and intake gases during the valve overlapperiod and improved emissions due to decrease in the valve overlap period.A second point of improvement is the fully open window of environment (maximumvalve lift ) occurs earlier during the intake valve event to complimentthe maximum piston velocity period, resulting in improved filling of thecylinder. Single Cylinder Engines There are many inherent differences between single cylinder engines andmultiple cylinder engines. Single cylinder engines are designed as highoutput engines in order to have positive horsepower to size ratios. Onedifference is that the inlet valve opens 30 degrees before TDC, not 9 degrees,and stays open 70 degrees after BDC (actually a portion of the compressionstroke) in order to have a very effective intake event (approximately 40percent of the complete engine cycle). Incoming air and fuel is contaminatedby and mixed with the exhaust gases exiting due to the extended exhaustand intake valve overlap at TDC. Fuel and air contained within the cylinderafter BDC expel due to the piston actually being in an effective velocityduring the early portion of the compression stroke, creating back pressurein the direction of the carburetor while the intake valve is still open.Consequently, single cylinder, high output engines create unacceptable emissionsand fuel consumption. The ACE Array Poppet Valve System can greatly improve the performance ofsingle cylinder engines by reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency.The ACE System also allows the engine to run more smoothly, thereby reducingthe wear and fatigue brought about by excessive single cylinder engine operatingvibration. The ACE Array Poppet Valve System technology can be readily adapted to conventionalinternal combustion engines without major changes in engine design. The multiple valve technology described herein is covered by U.S. and foreignpatents.

Burning oil, coal or urban waste causes unacceptableemissions and restrictions are increasing all over the world. The most commonway of solving the problem is to add cleaning processes for specified, singlepollutants, but these systems are expensive and far from 100% effective.Another way is to use clean fuels, but this is also very expensive. The BAL System Invented in Sweden, the BAL hazardous waste disposal system is the mosteffective and economical alternative to reducing exhaust gas emissions.It virtually eliminates air pollution associated with combustion resultingin the cleanest exhaust gas possible, almost regardless of what is beingburned. The BAL system is based upon a very simple principle: Any gas will condenseif the temperature is reduced to a low enough level. The BAL system reducesthe temperature of exhaust gases down to -50°C to -75°C (-65°Fto -110°F). At this very low temperature, most of the gaseous pollutantscondense together with residual water, which forms a sort of "dirtysnow." The patented BAL system cools the gas by expanding it througha reverse screw-compressor, thus eliminating the icing problems and highcosts associated with traditional cooling equipment. The residual snow isthen collected and formed into a solid waste that can be dumped withoutenvironmental risks. The BAL method is essentially a four-step process: 1) pressurizing the gas/air; 2) cooling the gas; 3) expanding the gas; and 4) separating the snow. BAL plants have been in operation since 1985. Tests with exhaust gases fromcombustion of urban waste have shown results far below any country's limitations. Today, BAL offers a plant for combustion of fluid fuels at a size of 5 MW.This plant is especially well suited for fluid hazardous waste, such asoil industry waste, PCB-containing oils, ClHC, waste from agricultural chemicals,plastics, etc. The BAL process is covered by worldwide patents.

The presence of organic matter, after all, is what distinguishes soil fromdesert and enables the soil to sustain crop growth. Long-term sole use ofchemical fertilizers strips the soil of this necessary organic matter resultingin a decrease in crop production and a host of other unexpected negativeenvironmental consequences. We are moving toward a situation where at least 30 percent of the totalfertilizer used will be of organic origin. And this is why organic fertilizersmust be developed to levels appropriate for modern handling and distributiontechniques. Enter VNP: Organic Fertilizer Pelletization VNP is produced from a composted and hygienized mixture of organic waste(e.g., sewage sludge, animal manure), a carbon source (e.g., municipal waste,vegetable waste, barch, peat), and additional nutrients and trace elements.The mixture is then compressed into high-density pellets (5-10 mm in diameterand 10-15 mm in length) with dry substance of 85 to 90 percent. The pelletssupplied to the soil have the following important characteristics: · high bacteriological activity · high water retention · plant nutrients in a form available to the roots of the plant · long-term nutrient effect. VNP can be produced from any organic waste and carbon source yielding theappropriate composition of the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphor, and potassiumand micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, copper, zinc, manganese,iron, and boron. The VNP concept was developed in cooperation with the Swedish AgriculturalUniversity and has been extensively tested and proven in laboratory andopen field conditions.

The developed countries such as USA and Germany have been using Geo graphic Information Systems(GIS) which can manipulate data collection, update, analysis , display and data management in terrain analysis. Our military forces, having relatively less computing power, need to develop their own tactical terrain analysis system. The objective of this study is to develop a scientific tactical terrain analysis system which can combine GIS, image processing and graphics technology to support field commanders who have to set up strategic tactics in battlefield operations. This terrain analysis system will reduce uncertainty in troop manenvering, fire planning, and communications. The accurate information produced by the terrain analysis system will be able to enhance the combat capability of a military unit and efficiency of weapon systems and also support military officers to make a prompt decision and operation plan. Therefore, it is necessary to build our own terrain analysis system that suits to our circumstances. Especially, it is important to build Korean menu driven system that can be easily utilized by military officers in operational mode.

However, due to the high-cost of the system, un-user-friendliness, and slow turn-around it was not widely accepted by resource managers. Thanks to the recent technology development in the field of IBM PC or compatibles, costs of microcomputer system and image processing peripherals were substantially reduced while performance and capacity have been dramatical ly improved. As a result many low-cost system were developed and commercially available for the on-site experts in national land development, resource exploration, environmental conservation, marine and oceanic research, weather forecasting, etc. Recently interest in utilizing remote sensing technology has been increased in some govemment offices, national institutes, and universities. Some of them already installed an image processing system at their site. Thease system usually have been introduced into Korea in turn-key base. With turn-key based system, the local maintenance of the hardware and software is very difficult even though not impossible. Thus it is very important to develop a low-cost, easy-to-use microcomputer image processing system and distribute to the local remote sensing specialists and resource menagers.

Since the meteorological satellite receiving system has been operated at the Korea Meteorological Service in July, 1989, it provides valuable information for meteorological analysis and forecasts around the Korean peninsula. However, the system was developed entirely by foreign knowledge, it is difficult to integrate our own knowledge by the system. Moreover, it is expecting that the maintenance, update, and operation should heavily rely on the foreign supports in the future. Therefore, the integration of knowledge on utilizing meteorological satellite data is urgently required. Scope Develop a radiative tansfer model that simulates the NOAA/AVHRR and GMS/ VISSR infrared channel to investigate the radiative characteristics of the channe ls. Also develop algorithms to retrieve sea surface temperatures and atmospheric precipitable water amounts from the channel characteristics. Test some algorithms to analyze cloud amounts, cloud heights, and cloud type classification. Test the algorithms to estimate the vegetation index. Investigate the feasibilty on the application of satellite imagery for pred icting atmospheric lightning. Investigate the data structure and application of the Space Environment Monitor. Develop a W/S for satellite image processing and application S/W for m eteorological parameter retrievals. Conclusions and Recommendations It is suggested that the radiative transfer model developed properly simulates the NOAA/AVHRR and GMS/VISSR infrared channels. The characteristics of the channe ls are mostly depend on the amount of atmospheric water vapor and the water vapor amo unts, the precipitable water and sea surface temperature algorithms were proposed. The cloud analyses techniques for cloud amounts, cloud heights, and cloud classification from satellite images, and the algorithm for vegetation index has been studi ed and tested. The relationships among ground measurements of lightning, GMS cloud top temperat ures, and application of SEM data have been explored. Meteorolgical satellite image processing W/S is developing in three parts, preprocessing S/W, image processing S/W, and analyses S/W for meteorlogical parameters. A me thod for geometric correction of satellite images has been developed as a part of prepr ocessing S/W. Image processing S/W is developing by modifying the KMIPS (KIST Microcomputer Image Processing System). The S/W for estimating cloud amounts, cloud heights, veget ation index, and sea surface temperature have been prepared as the S/W for methorological pa rameters in accord with the algorithms developed in this study or reported in the literature. Verifications for some conclusions are required, and communications among th e projects in this program are necessary to prepare the analysis S/W for meteorological parame ters. Go Back One Step!

In this context, U.S.A and Japan started developing image processing software from early 1960 and there are a large number of image processing packages being utilized in operational mode. In Korea, research to develop an image processing software has been performed sporadically, however no significant results were made due to the lack of fund and man power. Korea is a small country with a large number of population and the use of satellite imagery for the efficient national land utilization, resource development, and maximizing crop produetion capability is indispensible. For this purpose, a powerful image processing software for the analysis of the remotely sensed data needs to be developed. Contents and Scope of the Study This year is the second year of the proposed three year study. The countent of the study can be divided into three major sections. The first is the developing the enhancement software in spatial domain while the second section deals with the transformation algorithms in frequency domain. These softwares were designed to analyze the satellite imagery such as Landsat and STOP. The third section deals with color balancing for generating hard copy of satellite imagery. It covers transformation between RGB vs HIS. The existing popular image processing software packages were surveyed and analyzed also. Conclusions 1. Analysis of six (6) existing popular image processing software packages. 2.

Since the mid 1970s, specialized computer systems have been developed to process georeferenced information in various ways. The collective name for such systems is Geographic Information Systems, abbreviated GIS. Traditionally, geographic data is presented on maps using symbols, lines and colours. Most maps have a legend in which these geometric elements are listed and explained. Compared to maps, GIS has the inherent advantage that data storage and data presentation are separate. As a result, data may be presented and viewed in various ways. So, the goal of the research is to develop the intelligent vector process system software for various GIS entertainment. That will be used foreign as well as domestic. Contents and Scope of the Study We performed the 1'st period research out of three perieds which is the basic design for user interface, editor(I), DB management(I), and realized the specific fuction which is included in the basic design.

Navigation Information System(NIS) for vehicles is the system which drivers can see the optimal driving path from the current location to the destination by displaying map and road information through the LCD display. These NIS for vehicles provides the drivers more comfortable driving environment with the connection of the most advanced eletro nics and car engineering. NIS for vehicles is a noticeable and a high valued industry which con sists of the Geographic Information System(GIS) technology (which is being developed very fa st today to solve the faced social problems such as a local unbalanced increasemant of urba n population, traffic jam, etc.), Satellite Communication, Microprocessor Production, etc. and thus collectiong the technologies about these fields are required and spreading effects to other related fields are also expected. Today, the increment of cars and bad road condition produces social problems like economical loss and environmental polution by bearing severe traffic jam. NIS for vehicles atively deals with these kind of problems and increase the efficiency of road use, and some developed countries have already made an investment related to this as as infra-structure. NIS for vehicles provides beginners of first trip drivers an optimal driving path and comfortable driving environment so that they can drive safely, reduce the cost , and prevent the accident before it happens. Car industry tends to be a high ranked industy with adding some kinds of eletronic devices and these NIS for vehicles is essential for the next car industry. So the development of this system provides not only the increment of a foreign competition but also the protection of a domestic market. Japan will be expected that in 1995, there will be a market with 200 billion yen, and in Korea there will be also a big market as soon as it is widely used. Contents and Scope of the Study We performed the l'st period research out of three periods which is the basic design of driving path guiding system, and realized the specific function which is included in the basic design. We developed the program of deciding the present location and finding the optimal driving path as the basic part of the driving path guiding system. And we finished standardized sampled area map data input. The contents and the scope of the lst period study are as follows. The investigation about present NIS technique. Basic design of a driving path guide system. The Study of the standardization about map data Present location decision by GPS Development of an algorithm for the standard map image data and road data display. Study of an algorithm about extracting the optimal driving path Standard map image data and road data input and building a D/B of a sampl ed data Development of an intelligent sensing and control system for a safe drive . Map data itself can't be used as a path extracting information and additional driving information about their driving environment. Road data requires constant exertions for both exrtacting the optimal driving path and guiding the present location about drivers. Map data and road data require constant exertions and time for inserting and making data, and they affect the structure of the optimal driving path guiding system. So in order to join and simplify the system design, map standardizartion and road standardization are highly required. Present location decision is the key element of the automatic drive guiding system and thus we measured the present car location by GPS sattelites. To do this, GPS sattelite receiving system is required and communication between this receiving system and microprocessor is required. We examined the basic process for extracting the optimal driving path and we choosed the appropriate searching method suitable for the road condition. It is required that how well we can model the appropriate searching method according to the complicated practical road condition, and we will deal with this kind of research in 2'nd period of the research and in 1'st period, we extracted the optimal driving path with considering road distance, number of lane, and the coefficient of utilization. We developed an algorythm which provides drivers data with excellent visual efficieny and it is easy to use and reduce the responsibility of the microprocessor. Now we developed interface emphasised display module with the use of MS-WINDOWS which is used as GUI(Graphical User Interface) environment in personal computer. We made that a car is always located in center of the monitor by organizing the map as four pieced images so that it can be possible to display a real time display which doesn't disturb the drivers' eye We added a process of driving locus trace and inserted the important location information in Daejeon area in addition. The results of the Study We developed the techniques of basic elements about the data standardization with the decision of present locaion,data display and the optimal driving path extraction.

Parts of developing an intelligent sensing and control system for a safe drive. 9. The others o tracing the navigation locus and display o data input about the important facilities and D/B construction We performed the basic system design which includes the key functions needed as car driving guide system, and realized the main functions. We expect that with the result of this research, it can be commercialized whithin 2'nd or 3'rd period the research. But in order to manimize the efficiency of the result of this study, government leading teamwork and investment should be considered for D/B construction of the whole country using large scale map, operating a traffic information broadcasting for collecting real time road information, and etc. Go Back One Step!

Economic modeling and engineering are the foundation of the Center's work. The Center plays a prominent role in the national laboratories' technical support for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. Other current projects include the following: Testing the feasibility of alternative-fueled vehicles (ethanol, methanol, and natural gas), Investigating the potential for oxygen enrichment for both diesel and spark-ignition engines, Conducting experiments on novel methods for controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx), Developing engineering research competitions for university students to build hybrid-electric vehicles, Conducting assessments of lightweight materials in automobiles, and Evaluating the energy and environmental implications of a renewable oxygenate standard for reformulated gasoline. The Center is organized into three sections: Technology Engineering Environmental and Economic Assessments Advanced Systems. The Socio-Economic Research Program is also featured in this summary. BACKGROUND AND MISSION The transportation research program operates with a well-defined mission: to provide the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and others with an independent evaluation of the impacts of technological change in the transportation sector and, where appropriate, provide research and development to overcome technical obstacles. The transportation research staff conducts fuels and engine research; economic and environmental assessments, for instance, of lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium, and composites; and analyses and experimental research on advanced transportation concepts (such as magnetic levitation). The Center for Transportation Research has extensive experience in analyzing both passenger and freight transportation systems and the impacts of new technologies and changes in government policies. To aid in this analysis, Center staff have developed computer models, with extensive peer review, to project transportation energy use and pollutant emissions for all transport modes. Transportation energy use is particularly important for the following reasons: Transportation is almost entirely dependent on oil, Almost two-thirds of all oil is used for transportation, and Petroleum use in the transportation sector alone now exceeds domestic oil production. Exploring new ways to improve transportation energy efficiency is not only beneficial because of the dwindling supply of U.S. oil resources and the balance-of-payments effects of imported oil, but is always critical when world oil supplies are unexpectedly interrupted. The staff consists of researchers in such fields as mechanical and chemical engineering, physics, environmental sciences, geography, and economics. Augmenting the regular staff are special term appointees (from universities and the private sector) who work on an as-needed basis, as well as staff from other sections/teams in the Energy Systems Division and other divisions at Argonne. In addition, when the research project's objective is to ensure technology development capability within industry, the Center will contract a substantial portion of the research to the private sector. 100796 WT02-B26-182IA005-000053-B022-202http://camelot.es.anl.gov:80/htmls/division.html 146.139.76.150 19970221172313 text/html 6223HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Friday, 21-Feb-97 17:23:33 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tuesday, 08-Oct-96 21:42:25 GMTContent-length: 6042  Division Page INTRODUCTION It's a fact. As private R&D funding decreases, more and more U.S. companies are leveraging their research dollars by working with the nation's network of federally funded laboratories. Forget what you've heard in the past about working with government agencies. As the nation's priorities have switched from developing weapons systems to ensuring economic security, technology transfer has become a top priority for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its laboratories and facilities. Increased U.S. technological competitiveness is the destination. Effective working partnerships between industry and government are paving the way. At DOE's Argonne National Laboratory, the Energy Systems (ES) Division is strongly committed to a revitalized national economic competitiveness. The Division's long history of industrial partnerships provides a strong customer-focus for its research. Cost-effective, practical solutions are developed to solve real problems and meet real needs. Economic and market evaluations are key considerations, not afterthoughts. Timeliness and responsiveness are the Division's operating characteristics. ES scientists and engineers are experienced in tailoring research programs for a broad base of industries, including the oil, natural gas, railroad, automotive, textile, electric utility, primary and secondary metals, chemical, and pulp and paper industries. Additionally, ES routinely "teams" with professional staff from other Argonne divisions or other national labs and universities when additional capabilities or expertise are needed to solve an industry problem. The Division's unique technical resources, expertise, and facilities are focused on: Developing tomorrow's manufacturing processes Controlling environmental impacts of industrial energy use Recovering valuable products from industrial waste Developing new feedstocks and products Reclaiming natural resources and restoring environmental quality Designing 21st century transportation This website provides a brief overview of the Energy Systems Division's research and development efforts and capabilities. The Division is committed to partnering with companies of all sizes in transferring its ideas, concepts, designs, expertise, technologies and research results. ES ORGANIZATION The Energy Systems Division is organized into three Centers. The Center for Industrial Technology Systems is strongly committed to developing and transferring clean, efficient energy and industry-related environmental technologies into the marketplace to benefit U.S. companies, the federal government, customers, and the general public. The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems develops and performs research, development, and demonstration programs to support the complete environmental restoration process, from start to finish, addressing each of the three stages of the process, and to transfer the knowledge and technologies obtained to sponsors and other potential users of that information. The Center for Transportation Research conducts research to evaluate and develop transportation technology, with emphasis on reducing petroleum-fuel requirements, costs, and environmental consequences of transportation systems. A number of specialized sections/teams make up each center (see Organization Chart). Each has developed a particular core of expertise that enables it to perform state-of-the-art research and development in a given area. The sections/teams work together on specific projects, enabling the Division to conduct a broad range of energy and environmental research programs. Additionally, ES routinely teams with professional staff from other Argonne divisions or other national laboratories and universities when additional capabilities or expertise are needed to solve research problems.

The microsensor relies on an innovative combination of cermet materials, cyclic voltammetry, and neural network signal processing. Work is under way to train the sensor to differentiate gases in mixtures and to evaluate its performance. Natural Systems ModelingThe Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS) is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques, and a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing and field inventory data. Based on Department of Defense (DoD) user requirements, the project objective is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support system that will link the site military mission with the planning needs for biological conservation and resource management on DoD installations. Plastics RecoveryThrough collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations. Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials, cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics is being developed. Treating Agent-Contaminated SoilsSoils contaminated by chemical warfare agents pose a unique remediation problem for military installations. Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem of agent-contaminated soils, is evaluating different treatment technologies for treating such soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal. The chemical warfare agents most likely to be encountered at the Arsenal are the blister agents, mustard and lewisite, and the nerve agents, GB and VX. Success in identifying effective remediation technologies will pave the way for full-scale treatment of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated soil and may also have applicability to other kinds of contamination problems. Reduced NOx EmissionsArgonne National Laboratory has developed a new method for after-treatment of NOx in the exhaust whereby monatomic nitrogen plasma is used. The new method should make oxygen enrichment applicable during the entire driving cycle. Monatomic nitrogen, however, is unstable and cannot be stored. As part of its work on applying oxygen-enriched air to internal combustion engines, Argonne investigated the use of membrane separation. Research results suggest that the membrane "waste stream," which contains nitrogen-enriched air, could be used as feedstock for producing monatomic nitrogen. 100796 WT02-B26-187IA005-000053-B022-196http://camelot.es.anl.gov:80/htmls/projects.html 146.139.76.150 19970221172305 text/html 6039HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Friday, 21-Feb-97 17:23:26 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Friday, 14-Feb-97 21:20:55 GMTContent-length: 5859  ESD Projects Page Click on a topic to jump there in this list...

The Center is strongly committed to DOE's Office of Industrial Technology (OIT) in transferring clean, efficient energy technologies into the marketplace to benefit U.S. companies, federal government customers, and the general public. To leverage its resources, the Center partners with various Argonne divisions, other national laboratories, industry, universities, not-for-profit organizations, and others. For efficient and effective operation, the Center is divided into three sections: INDUSTRIAL AND UTILITY TECHNOLOGY The Industrial and Utility Technology section focuses on the development and application of cost-effective process, environmental, and power generation technologies for the industrial process and utility industries. In addition, this section is providing planning support for two DOE "Vision of the Future" programs: Refinery of the Future and Forest Products Industry of the Future. The section's core activities center around process industry technology; pollution prevention and control; utility technologies and systems; and analysis, simulation, and modeling. Effort has been organized in this manner to respond to DOE's and other sponsoring agencies' desire to work more closely with U.S. industry in the development and commercialization of technologies and to take optimal advantage of the technical expertise of the section's staff. This expertise is concentrated in chemical and mechanical engineering, with a strong emphasis on chemical processes, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, thermodynamic processes, and combustion and emissions measurements and control. Key projects include the Refinery of the Future advanced environmental control technology, carbon disulfide removal from viscose plant emissions, CO2 capture/utilization/disposal, and industrial cogeneration. PROCESS EVALUATION The Process Evaluation section conducts applied research and technical and economic analysis of innovative technologies for industrial applications. It develops cost-effective technologies for waste minimization/utilization applications, with an emphasis on materials recycling. Technical, economic, and market analyses of advanced energy and environmental technologies help determine technology R&D requirements and commercialization potential. The section works closely with large-scale industries and industry-supported associations. Core activities include development of physical/chemical separation processes and metallurgical processes, process simulation and cost analysis, and process control and sensor development. Representative projects include electrochemical dezincing of galvanized ferrous scrap, selective removal of antimony from aluminum scrap, recovery of materials from auto shredder residue and aluminum salt cakes, evaluation of the process for recovery/recycling of rocket motor chemicals, and development of electrocatalytic gas microsensor technology. WASTE MANAGEMENT AND BIOENGINEERING The Waste Management and Bioengineering section applies physical, chemical, and biological processes to solve real-world problems for industry and government in a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner. This section has aggressively pursued individual-company industrial collaborators for all projects. Major environmental issues being addressed include development of "green" chemicals from biobased materials and development of remediation technology. Core activities include membrane separations, remediation, environmental biotechnologies, and gas and oil industry technologies. Key projects include implementing an alternative feedstocks program, bioconverting high-starch food wastes into high-value products, minimizing use of chemicals in gas/oil operations, removing salts from produced waters, undertaking a landfill gas program, cleaning textile parts with sonication, removing salts from reactive dye solutions, and designing and using foams to remediate non-aqueous-phase liquids. 1000796 WT02-B26-190IA005-000053-B023-227http://camelot.es.anl.gov:80/htmls/CERS.html 146.139.76.150 19970221173044 text/html 11334HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Friday, 21-Feb-97 17:31:03 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tuesday, 08-Oct-96 21:42:21 GMTContent-length: 11152  CERS HOME PAGE    Welcome to the Center for Environmental Restoration Systems BACKGROUND Over the past 20 years, Argonne National Laboratory has demonstrated a successful track record in completing large and complex programs to solve difficult environmental issues over a wide range of circumstances. The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems (CERS), operating within Argonne's Energy Systems Division, performs research, development, and demonstration programs to attain all aspects of environmental restoration from start to finish, including site characterization, selection and implementation of remediation technologies for site cleanup, and final restoration of a site to usefulness. The ultimate goal of the Center is to put the research results into practice. Sponsors and industry users who have already benefitted from the Center's knowledge and technologies include the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), Gas Research Institute (GRI), and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). For instance, Center staff tackled research problems associated with the coal mining industry, funded by the DOE in the 1970s; pipeline right-of-way research, sponsored by GRI from 1982 to present; and rehabilitation of training areas and hazardous waste sites for the U.S. Army from 1983 to today. MISSION AND GOALS The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems' mission is to develop and perform research, development, and demonstration programs to support the complete environmental restoration process, from start to finish, addressing each of the three stages of the process, and to transfer the knowledge and technologies obtained to sponsors and other potential users of that information. The following five goals constitute the Center's mission: Research, develop, evaluate, and demonstrate innovative and improved methods, techniques, and technologies to characterize all aspects of highly disturbed and/or contaminated facilities, sites, ecosystems, and landscapes. Design and implement laboratory and field research programs to develop, evaluate, and/or demonstrate improved and more effective or efficient methods, systems, or technologies to clean up or remediate hazardous and/or toxic materials within the environment. Research, develop, demonstrate, and implement improved and effective methods and technologies to reclaim, remediate, or restore to a sustainable and intended end use disturbed sites resulting from site remediation activities, production and transportation of energy and/or energy and mineral resources, military activities, or other causes. Determine, evaluate, or predict the environmental effects and/or consequences of past, ongoing, or planned military activities; energy production, development, or transportation projects; or other similar or related actions; and identify, develop, test, and/or demonstrate under laboratory and field conditions promising techniques or technologies with which to mitigate consequent, deleterious environmental impacts. Develop, demonstrate, implement, and maintain state-of-the-art scientific, engineering, and technical knowledge, skills, tools, capabilities, and resources necessary to perform or to support all research, development, and demonstration activities supporting the Center's mission and goals. AVAILABLE RESOURCES The Center's mission is accomplished by using the diverse staff resources available within the Center, in collaboration with other individuals, programs, and organizations within Argonne's Energy Systems Division, the Laboratory, other R&D organizations, academia, or the private sector. Approximately 100 skilled scientists and engineers staff the Center. To further leverage its resources, the staff partners with more than 400 other technical experts active in the environmental arena throughout the Laboratory. The CERS staff encompasses a wide range of expertise and disciplines, including engineering; hydrology; geology, geophysics, and geochemistry; soil science and agronomy; aquatic and terrestrial ecology; organic, inorganic, and analytical chemistry; and social sciences, policy, and legal experts. When addressing an environmental challenge, the Center's staff takes a multidisciplinary team approach, tailored specifically to the needs of the problem. The teams focus on arriving at practical, cost-effective engineering, scientific, and technical solutions to resolve environmental issues in a timely manner. TEAMWORK Five teams operate within the Center: Environmental Chemistry, Ecology and Natural Resources, Geosciences, Engineering and Technology Evaluation, and Land Reclamation. Fundamental team objectives include collaboration and mutual support of existing projects and in developing new programs. Considerable cooperation and interchange between teams occurs to meet individual project, program, and Center research and development goals, objectives, and needs. The Environmental Chemistry Team studies the fate of chemical pollutants in the environment. To do this, several different chemistry disciplines are involved, including analytical, physical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, as well as biochemistry. The Ecology and Natural Resources Team evaluates the impact of human activities on natural biological systems. Team members have been involved in research projects located throughout North America and in some foreign countries. The Geosciences Team supports shallow subsurface studies at federal, state, and private facilities in the United States and overseas. Studies are undertaken to define the geological framework, hydrostratigraphy, and extent of contamination in both terrestrial and near-shore environments. The Engineering and Technology Evaluation Team evaluates treatment technologies under both laboratory and field scales and conditions. Team members have performed projects at major military facilities contaminated with a range of toxic and hazardous materials. This team is developing strong expertise in the safe and effective decontamination and demolition of engineered structures and facilities that are suspected of being contaminated. Finally, the Land Reclamation Team develops innovative techniques and approaches to restore highly disturbed sites and landscapes to productive use. Members of this team have successfully restored large ares severely degraded by such activities as surface mining, large-scale construction operations, and major military maneuvers and training exercises. LABORATORIES / EQUIPMENT Specialized field equipment includes a soil exploration drilling rig, a complete array of geophysical equipment, a mobile laboratory with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, and three 4WD field vehicles. The Center houses several specialized laboratories: Environmental Analysis/Laboratory, Chemical Research and Technology Evaluation Laboratories, Land Resources Analysis Laboratory, and Field Analytical Laboratory. The Environmental Analysis/Laboratory has served the analytical needs of ES Division research since 1985 by providing physical and chemical analysis of soil, water, and plant material. All sample preparations necessary before analysis are performed in the lab before any analytical work is initiated. The Center possesses two chemistry laboratories: the Technology Evaluation Laboratory and the Environmental Research Laboratory. The Technology Evaluation Laboratory is set up for bench-scale studies (such as solvent washing and thermal desorption). The Environmental Research Laboratory contains a gas chromatograph and a liquid chromatograph. Two field-ready instruments are also available: a gas chromatograph can be set up in a mobile laboratory for the remote sampling of sites, and a spectrophotometer is also available for screening purposes. The Land Resources Analysis Laboratory staff uses a multidisciplinary approach to solve complex environmental and natural resources problems. Using state-of-the-art geographic information systems, remote sensing, visual simulation, data visualization techniques, global positioning systems, and environmental modeling, the staff conducts applied research on a wide range of physical, biological, and natural resource issues. These issues include such topics as land reclamation; natural resources and ecosystem management; site characterization; and long-term environmental management, monitoring, and mitigation strategies. Greenhouse and plant growth facilities are particularly well suited for a variety of plant research studies. Two recently renovated greenhouses, totaling 1,200 square feet under glass, have an attached headhouse and laboratory. Environmental conditions in each greenhouse can be independently controlled and monitored via a central computerized control system. Other plant research facilities include state-of-the-art hydroponic and aeroponic plant growth systems, controlled environment plant growth chambers, and space for field plots or outdoor growth facilities adjacent to the greenhouse complex. KEY CENTER RESEARCH The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems addresses diverse - and often complex - environmental problems. Key projects are organized into five areas: Site Restoration, Technology Evaluations, Treatability Testing, and Demonstrations, Site Characterization, Information Systems, and Process and Method Development. 100796 WT02-B26-191IA005-000053-B023-250http://camelot.es.anl.gov:80/htmls/org.html 146.139.76.150 19970221173059 text/html 1561HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Friday, 21-Feb-97 17:31:22 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tuesday, 08-Oct-96 21:42:33 GMTContent-length: 1380  ESD Organization Page 100896 WT02-B26-192IA005-000053-B023-263http://camelot.es.anl.gov:80/htmls/pubslist.html 146.139.76.150 19970221173108 text/html 22902HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Friday, 21-Feb-97 17:31:28 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tuesday, 08-Oct-96 21:42:36 GMTContent-length: 22720  Recent ESD Publications Page RECENT PUBLICATIONS Publications by ES Division Staff, January 1994 - March 1995 ENERGY-EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY Energy Recovery from Municipal Waste Chang, S.L., M.

The challenge of identifying, tackling, and overcoming transportation-related problems -- including those of pollution, energy efficiency, and dwindling natural resources -- requires foresight and creativity. Today, working with several industrial partners, Argonne National Laboratory researchers are exploring many innovative advanced engine concepts that will improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions and yet maintain the expected level of performance for automotive engines. Engine Research Facilities and Capabilities Argonne's extensive engine research facilities and associated modeling expertise enable a wide range of engine experiments. Argonne also employs the nearby facilities at AutoResearch Laboratories to cost-effectively perform other tests as needed. In  addition to its on site facilities, as well as its close proximity to several major vehicle and engine manufacturers, Argonne's Center for Transportation Research has an engineering staff with extensive experience in commercial engine development.  At AutoResearch Laboratories: Automated engine durability test cells Chassis-dynamometer setup for Federal Test Procedure and off-cycle emissions analysis Exhaust gas measurements, including gas chromatography for hydrocarbon speciation At Argonne: Engine-dynamometer test setups to handle 10 to 200 hp engines Engine data acquisition system (DSP-Technology's RedLine ADAPT-integrated, real-time control systems for dyno control, data acquisition and combustion analysis) In-cylinder piston temperature measurement using microwave and pyrometry techniques Nitrogen oxides (NOx) control lab with monatomic nitrogen arc pulser and emissions species analyzers Testing and analysis of engine parts with ceramic coatings and advanced lubricants Fuel spray (aerosol) systems laboratory with laser diagnostics instruments Engine performance mapping and analysis Performance codes for diesel and spark-ignition engines ANSYS and KIVA codes for analyzing thermal and mechanical loading Conventional- and hybrid-vehicle performance and fuel efficiency PC models Improvements in Engine Combustion Argonne has been working with Compact Membrane Systems to develop a low-cost, permeable membrane that would separate ambient air into oxygen-rich and nitrogen-rich streams for use in engines. The membrane (about the size of an air filter) would provide an oxygen stream for the engine to improve combustion, while thenitrogen stream would be fed  into the exhaust as a plasma to reduce NOX emissions. For Diesel Engines: Problem : Need to meet particulate and smoke emissions standards Solution : Increasing the in-cylinder concentration of oxygen from the ambient 21% to 25% results in a reduction of almost 60% in particulate emissions at rated load conditions, while engine power output is increased by 50% with only a nominal (15%) increase in peak cylinder pressure. For Alternative Fuels: Problem : Air toxic emissions for alcohol fuels and low power density for natural gas engines Solution : With 25% oxygen concentration in the cold phase, experiments show that M85 vehicles can meet CO, NMOG, NOX, and formaldehyde emission standards for TLEV and Tier II. Research also indicates that oxygen enrichment will increase the power density of vehicles powered by natural gas. For Gasoline Engines: Problem : High hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions during engine cold-start Solution : Tests show that the proposed California TLEV and Tier II emission standards can be met by using 25% oxygen during the cold phase of the Federal Test Procedure. Advanced Sensors for Combustion Control Argonne has developed an innovative electrocatalytic gas microsensor that is sturdy and inexpensive, operates at several hundred degrees Celsius, and identifies a wide variety of gases and vapors at concentrations approaching 1 ppm. The microsensor's versatility comes from an innovative use of cyclic voltammetry, neural-network signal processing, and ceramic-metallic, or cermet, materials. In principle, the microsensor can measure the concentration of any gas species that reacts with oxygen in its sensing element. The sensor system could provide real-time emission sensing and feedback for advanced combustion control. Control of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Using Catalysts to Control Nitrogen Oxide Emissions from Lean-Burn Engines In the presence of the excess oxygen found in the exhaust gas from lean-burn engines, the current generation of catalysts is unable to control NOX emissions. In partnership with the Low Emissions Partnership of the United States Council on Automotive Research, a consortium of the three major automobile manufacturers, Argonne is one of five national laboratories conducting cooperative research on catalysts for NOX control in the exhaust gas from lean-burn gasoline engines. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOX to nitrogen, in the presence of excess oxygen, by unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas appears to be an ideal emission control scheme. The ZSM-5 zeolite charged with copper ions accomplishes this conversion with good efficiency, but it is very susceptible to long-term deactivation under engine exhaust conditions. Argonne is working to understand the factors that promote the effectiveness of this catalyst and to ascertain how they might be replicated in a more durable catalyst material. Using Monatomic Nitrogen to Reduce Nitrogen Oxide in Engine Exhaust Historically, engine designers have had to live with the trade-offs between control of particulates and NOX in diesel engines and between NOX and fuel economy in all engines. This situation is becoming more difficult as the NOX emissions standard becomes even more stringent. Argonne�s success in using monatomic nitrogen plasma to reduce NOX emissions from gasoline-fueled automotive engines (50-90% reductions of NOX have been achieved) led Caterpillar, Inc., to fund an evaluation of the concept for heavy-duty diesel engines. It is expected that data from the laboratory evaluation will guide Caterpillar�s decision to move this technology to the commercialization phase. A one-of-a-kind facility, the monatomic-nitrogen-generating test bench, is being used in the evaluation.  Automotive Two-Stroke Engines Argonne is pursuing advanced engine concepts research with Mercury Marine Division of Brunswick  Corporation (Fond du Lac, Wisconsin), a major manufacturer of two-stroke engines. The current CRADA with Mercury Marine is to conduct applied research in materials for automotive two-stroke engines. The components that have been shown to have problems in automotive applications are pistons, rings, bearings, and exhaust ports. The main engine-component stress comes from thermal loads caused by high temperatures encountered in the two-stroke combustion cycle. The ceramic materials development program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has identified a few advanced low-wear, heat-resistant materials that could be used in the form of coatings, composites, or monolithic components to handle high thermal stress.  Advanced Materials and Lubricants Advanced engines, such as gas turbines and those fueled by diesel, will operate at elevated temperatures and pressures. These harsh conditions require improved lubricants and coatings for engine durability and reliability. Problem : Wear and corrosion of fuel injectors using alternative fuels, or injectors under high pressure Solution : Argonne is working with diesel engines and gas turbines to develop processes for depositing diamond-like coatings on metallic and ceramic components. Problem : Wear in gears, bearings, drives, and other automotive parts Solution : A self-replenishing lubricant, boric acid, reduces friction and wear and is environmentally safe. "Clean Diesel" Bus Technologies The use of alternative fuels in city buses could help transit operators meet mandated air quality regulations. However, a largecapital investment would be needed to convert the fueling infrastructure and buses. If oxygen-enrichment technology could be applied to meet air quality standards, or if a diesel-electric hybrid system were implemented, the use of these "clean diesel" buses could delay that investment for many years. The Regional Transit Authority in northern Illinois initiated a project with Argonne to evaluate the possibility of applying these technologies to Chicago Transit Authority buses. Following a limited number of engine tests and computer analyses, Argonne concluded that both concepts are practical and could result in a "clean diesel" bus that meets the mandated limits of the Clean Air Act Amendments. Argonne staff used dedicated models to analyze the performance and emissions of a typical urban bus powered by conventional diesel fuel and an optimized diesel-electric hybrid system. The results compared favorably with published bus data.

Many available sensors for measuring gaseous emissions are too delicate to withstand the hostile, high-temperature,  environments found in industrial stacks, or they are not portable and involve sample collection and transportation.  These sensors can also be expensive, and their versatility and sensitivity are limited.  Approach Argonne National Laboratory has developed a small electrocatalytic microsensor made of ceramic-metallic (cermet) materials that identifies many different gases by their electrical signatures.  The microsensor relies on an innovative combination of cermet materials, cyclic voltammetry, and neural network signal processing.  Work is under way to train the sensor to differentiate gases in mixtures and to evaluate it performance.  The microsensor, produced by using thick-film screening methods, is constructed of four overlapping thick films with an incorporated thick-film heating element on the back.  As a cyclic voltage is ramped through the upper and lower electrodes, gases adsorbed on the surface react catalytically, changing the concentration of ions at the three-phase boundary between the gas, electrode, and solid electrolyte. This, in turn, changes the ionic current flow measured through the microsensor.  The applied voltage and measured current produce a voltage/current signature that is unique for each individual gase and mixture.  The microsensor's intelligent signal processing uses neural networks to recognize the gas signature patterns and quantify the gases by their shape changes.  (top to bottom, left to right) EC Microsensor, Miniature Support Electronics, Benchtop Demonstration System, and Typical Voltammogram Response Researchers are evaluating applications for the microsensor, including monitoring stacks and flues for gaseous emissions of regulatory concern, characterizing environmental contaminants in the field, providing early fire warning, monitoring fugitive emissions from machinery, detecting CO2 and O2 for underwater breathing apparatus, detecting CO for indoor air quality, and providing input information to process control systems. Results The microsensor's intelligent pattern recognition system can be trained to recognize a wide variety of gases and gas mixtures. The microsensor is inexpensive to produce ( < 25� per microsensor ), yet it may prove rugged enough to survive in hostile, high-temperature environments, if necessary. The microsensor can be remotely cleaned and does not require electrolyte replenishment or replacement. Compared with conventional sensors, power requirements are low (milliwatts). The neural network processing will soon fit onto a microcontroller chip, which will minimize support electronics and transfer the burden of signal generation from the microsensor itself to the support electronics. Future Plans The cermet sensor research team is also developing other microsensors.  Researchers are working to apply new measurement techniques to tin oxide sensors and thin-film/thick-film hybrids, using advanced materials.  The team is also rebuilding the microsensors to exploit a new thin-film process called "metal organic chemical vapor deposition", which could reduce the microsensor's size and improve its sensitivity.

On-site and off-site environmental impacts, wildlife conservation issues, cultural resources concerns, and the need for training realism all dictate that natural resources be maintained and enhanced on these installations.  The tasks of balancing multiple military and nonmilitary land uses, complying with resource regulations, and assessing the impacts on the sustainability of both the resource base and the military mission are complex and challenging.  Management actions to alleviate one resource problem can often exacerbate others.  In order to make the most efficient use of available resources, it is necessary to make trade-offs so that the most valuable and effective efforts are funded first, and less valuable efforts are only pursued if funds are available.  At a time when conservation funding is growing increasingly scarce and the demands for adequate justification of decision making are growing stronger, a new dynamic approach is needed to help resource managers in their decision-making. Approach 	To fulfill this need a new approach is underway with funding from the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and work conducted by the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the U.S. Army's Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL).  Called the Integrated Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Modeling System (IDLAMS), it is an integration of ecological models, decision support techniques, and a geographic information system (GIS) that incorporates remote sensing and field inventory data.  Based on DoD user requirements, the project objective is to create a methodology and develop a decision-support system that will link the site military mission with the planning needs for biological conservation and resource management on DoD installations. 	The development of IDLAMS will assist the decision-makers in identifying and resolving land-use issues and help determine cost-effective solutions to long-term land stewardship problems.  The approach offers a computer technology that enables resource managers to integrate their planning process by identifying multiple land use objectives and incorporating trade-off analysis, determining the cost and economics of viable land management alternatives, and incorporating "what if" scenarios into their decision-making.  The user-friendly interface allows the resource manager to operate this predictive, decision-making and planning tool without the need for substantial GIS training or extensive environmental modeling expertise. The central component of IDLAMS is a vegetation (land cover) change model, which incorporates naturally occurring changes, changes due to training use, and those resulting from resource management activities.  Other management concerns such as soil erosion, water quality, wildlife, and cultural resources can also be modeled and linked to the vegetation dynamics submodel.  Also, SERDP has funded other research efforts that can provide additional submodels to the IDLAMS framework and has facilitated the coordination among complimentary projects.  For example, the system currently being tested at Fort Riley, Kansas, can model and predict changes in vegetation type that might result from fire, forest/shrub expansion, or secondary succession of grassland following training activity disturbances.  It also has submodels for soil erosion prediction and wildlife habitat suitability analyses.  In addition to the GIS spatial analysis component, ANL is investigating the use of advanced, remote-sensing technologies to provide large-scale, high-resolution images for use in the overall dynamic landscape model. 	Although principally an ecological modeling environment, IDLAMS also uses a value-based decision-analysis process to link the ecological models with the management needs and user requirements of the resource manager.  To help accomplish this task, ANL held a two-day workshop bringing together land managers from several representative installations (Fort Riley, Kansas and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin) and natural resource experts from ANL and USACERL.  The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Ralph Keeney, an internationally-known expert in the field of decision-analysis.  Participants met to develop operational definitions for land management objectives, determine and prioritize a list of relevant objectives to be used, and define measures to estimate the extent to which those objectives are reached and can be incorporated into a decision-support system.  The information gathered at this initial workshop, and through a follow-up workshop, is currently being quantified and will be used to develop and test the decision-support system.  This system will result in a more systematic evaluation of resource management actions undertaken at military installations.  This approach will be further enhanced to incorporate the cost and economics of viable land management alternatives. Results 	The initial Dynamic Landscape Modeling System (DLMS) developed for Fort Riley, Kansas is currently being field tested at the installation.  The expanded, more robust modeling/GIS approach (IDLAMS) is now under development at an additional DoD site (Fort McCoy, Wisconsin).  This will involve the development of an oak savanna vegetation dynamics submodel (which will include a fire modeling component), as well as continued development and refinement of submodels which may include erosion/water quality, wildlife, cultural resources, and past land uses.  The choice of submodels will be evaluated and determined through coordination with the Fort McCoy natural and cultural resource staff as well as other installation personnel.  The development of new submodels for IDLAMS will be complimentary to various ongoing DoD efforts. 	The project's scientific approach and the resulting IDLAMS system will enable resource managers to quantify the effects of land management actions, both spatially and over time.  The project offers a planning framework and a technology that will be transferred to installation site managers by providing pertinent resource information and a set of computer tools linked to their existing geographic information system (GIS). Future Plans Although the initial emphasis of the project has focused on military installations, the technology currently under development can also be used at DOE sites.  Future enhancements of this dual-use technology could have widespread application to help other federal and state agency resource managers and planners meet the challenges of fulfilling land stewardship requirements, balancing multiple management objectives, and supporting their primary mission with increasingly limited conservation funding.

In the last 15 years, however, the use of plastics in appliance manufacturing has increased substantially, at the expense of metals.  To increase the recycling of obsolete appliances in the future, cost-effective and environmentally acceptable technologies need to be developed to recover, upgrade, and reuse plastics from discarded appliances.  It is estimated that more than 300 million pounds of high-value plastics could be recovered and reused, resulting in a reduction of up to 90% in appliance-related solid waste that would otherwise end up in landfills. Approach Through collaborative research with industry, Argonne National Laboratory is developing a process for recovering valuable individual plastics from the non-metallic fractions generated by appliance shredding operations.  Further, to enhance the market penetration of recycled plastic materials, cost-effective methods for improving the performance of the recovered plastics will be developed. An estimated 300 million pounds of plastics from obsolete appliances could be recovered and reused. The recovery process consists of granulating the non-metallic material, which is generated by appliance shredding and disassembly operations, to 1/4-inch size.  The granulated material is then processed via mechanical/physical separation methods into several fractions:  polyurethane foam and other light materials; thermoplastics, which include high-density polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS); and a small fraction consisting of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nylon and some metals.  The thermoplastics fraction is further separated via acid/solvent-assisted methods into two high-value plastics:  ABS and HIPS.  The ABS materials recovered from appliances could have a market value in the range of 40-70�/lb. Results A laboratory-scale process for recovering ABS and HIPS plastics has been demonstrated, and more than 100 pounds of high-purity ABS has been produced and analyzed to determine its properties and upgrading needs.  Tests conducted on the properties of the recovered ABS indicate that this material has good performance characteristics and could be recycled to high-value applications. Future Plans A demonstration plant is scheduled to be built in 1996 to evaluate the overall economic and technical performance of this process.  A major appliance recycler has tentatively agreed to use one of its facilities for the demonstration of this process.  With industry collaboration, the market value of the recovered plastics will be optimized by researching cost-effective strategies for upgrading the properties of the materials.

At Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver, chemical and incendiary munitions have been produced and dismantled since the 1940s.  The chemical warfare agents most likely to be encountered at the Arsenal are the blister agents, mustard and lewisite, and the nerve agents, GB and VX.  Success in identifying effective remediation technologies will pave the way for full-scale treatment of the Arsenal's agent-contaminated soil.  Technologies that Argonne National Laboratory identifies as promising may also have applicability to other kinds of contamination problems.  Approach Argonne, a pioneer in studying the problem of agent-contaminated soils, is evaluating different treatment technologies for treating such soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  Argonne is helping Rocky Mountain Arsenal choose the most appropiate remediation path for treating soils contaminated by chemical warfare agents. The laboratory work, which will be performed on simulants to the agent, has two phases.  The first is a small-scale screening of the technologies, using small samples (1 to 20 grams).  Experiments are conducted over a wide range of values to establish operational parameters.  Findings will help identify a narrower set of values to be tested during the second phase.  The second phase features bench-scale feasibility tests using larger (1-kilogram) soil samples, which will provide better insight into the mechanisms of handling large soil volumes. Argonne is pursuing two cleanup technologies: thermal desorption and solvent washing.  Thermal desorption involves the removal of contaminants that have adhered to the soil matrix (adsorption) or are held in voids between particles (absorption).  Solvent washing extracts compounds by dissolving them in a fluid.  Because the agents in question are highly toxic, more benign compounds with similar chemical properties are used to "spike" test soils in the laboratory. In thermal desorption, treated soil and off-gases will be analyzed for the simulated agent and expected degradation products.  Later, in Phase Two, 1-kilogram soil samples will be treated in an indirectly heated, batch, rotary-kiln desorption unit. Triethylamine is currently being studied for solvent washing.  Laboratory screening will test for triethylamine's solubility with target compounds, maximum extractability, and removal efficiency. Results Preliminary to laboratory experiments, Argonne conducted an extensive literature review on agent chemistry, toxicology, decontamination, potential treatment technologies, and applicable laws and regulations.  A database of 300 entries was compiled.  Using the findings from the literature search, Argonne conducted an evaluation of 26 in-situ and ex-situ technologies.  Each technology was screened for cost-effectiveness, implementation potential, and decontamination effectiveness.  From these paper studies, Argonne then chose its two candidate technologies to test for feasibility at the laboratory scale:  thermal desorption and solvent washing. Soil spiking, analytical development, and preliminary screening are progressing.  There are no data to report as yet. Future Plans Both solvent washing and thermal desorption have been tested on pesticide-contaminated soils at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  One of the goals is to use either process to treat pesticide- and agent-contaminated soil simultaneously. If the experimental program has positive results, commercial vendors will be screened by Argonne and invited to demonstrate their processes with full-scale prototypes.  A final evaluation will be prepared for each vendor process, including projected costs.  Argonne expects to continue as an unbiased, expert consultant that can screen potential treatments for specific contaminated sites and assist in the testing, evaluation, and selection of appropriate vendors to provide full-scale remediation.

Beginning in 1998, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 mandate that light- and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel engines must meet new emissions standards.  Researchers have known for nearly two decades that oxygen-enriched combustion air enhances engine performance and reduces exhaust emissions.  Oxygen enrichment improves combustion by increasing the ratio of oxidant to fuel in the cylinders of engines.  This results in a faster burn rate and higher flame temperatures and reduces the products of incomplete combustion (HC and CO).  Using oxygen enrichment reduces HC and CO in both gasoline- and diesel-engine exhaust, but NOx emissions are increased.  As a result, oxygen enrichment is currently appropriate only during the cold-start phase of vehicle operation, when NOx emissions are relatively low and not affected by oxygen enrichment. After-treatment of NOx in the exhaust with a monatomic nitrogen plasma. Approach Argonne National Laboratory has developed a new method for after-treatment of NOx in the exhaust whereby monatomic nitrogen plasma is used.  The new method should make oxygen enrichment applicable during the entire driving cycle.  Monatomic nitrogen, however, is unstable and cannot be stored.  As part of its work on applying oxygen-enriched air to internal combustion engines, Argonne investigated the use of membrane separation.  Research results suggest that the membrane "waste stream," which contains nitrogen-enriched air, could be used as feedstock for producing monatomic nitrogen. Pulsed-spark and steady-spark methods of electrically activating the nitrogen are being investigated.  The goal is to develop a cost-effective electrical activation device for engine and vehicle applications. Results By using Argonne's NOx after-treatment technology, 50-90% reductions of NOx, even in the presence of oxygen, have been demonstrated.  These results indicate that this technique could be used to control NOx in gasoline engines.   Future Plans Tests with nitrogen dioxide and oxygen mixtures, as well as with synthetic gasoline-engine exhaust, will be conducted. Actual engine testing will follow.

Other potential commercial feedstocks include resources from renewable and agricultural processes.  However, these resources are not widely used because of the lack of cost-effective technologies for manufacturing high-volume chemical building blocks from these materials.  America's agricultural industry could be revitalized by expanding market demand for farm and forestry products, while the chemical industry would benefit from less costly feedstocks. Approach Argonne National Laboratory is participating in a consortium of five national laboratories.  The goal is to use resources from renewable and agricultural processes as feedstocks to demonstrate new pathways to production of chemicals (such as succinic acid, the first target of Argonne's program).  Argonne is applying metabolic engineering to develop superior organisms that improve product yield, productivity, and tolerance.  Electrodialysis techniques are being applied to product recovery, and a novel process is being developed to produce low-cost, high-purity intermediates suitable for further conversion.  Argonne is also developing new, degradable polyester derivatives, which could increase the succinic acid market significantly. Currently, succinic acid is produced by using a hydrocarbon-based process that oxidizes n-butane to maleic anhydride.  The maleic anhydride is then hydrated to the acid form and hydrogenated to yield succinic acid.  A fermentation process using glucose derived from corn syrup can also produce succinic acid, but it is not economically competitive.  Argonne is improving fermentation efficiency by using conventional and genetic techniques to develop superior succinic-acid-producing organisms. Conventional technology for primary purification involves addition of sulfuric acid to the fermentation broth, which contains calcium succinate.  This step generates large volumes of calcium sulfate salt waste, which poses a serious waste management problem for industrial-scale processes.  Other, newer technologies also generate different kinds of waste salts.  In contrast, Argonne's primary purification process uses advanced desalting and water-splitting electrodialysis technologies.  These technologies purify the succinic acid efficiently and economically without generating the large volumes of salt waste streams. Results The feasibility of electrodialysis for primary purification of succinic acid has been demonstrated by using fermentation broths.  Economic analysis shows that this process should reduce the overall succinic-acid production cost by about 6�/lb, compared with conventional methods.  The feasibility of a novel secondary purification process is being studied.  Genetic analysis of the succinic-acid pathways has generated metabolic engineering approaches for biocatalyst development. Future Plans For succinic acid production, Argonne will continue development efforts and participate in a demonstration of an integrated process for converting carbohydrates to succinic acid to 1,4-butanediol.  The demonstration is planned to start in late 1995, and the integrated process will be operated continuously for a period long enough to test critical parameters in the fermentation, recovery, and catalytic conversion processes.  Additional products (such as butanol) will be studied during 1995.  Argonne will contribute its technical expertise in biocatalyst development and product recovery.

However, lactic acid production generates large volumes of salt wastes, which pose a serious disposal and management problem for industrial-scale processes. Opportunities exist to develop more efficient, environmentally sound technologies for large-scale production of lactic acid and to develop novel applications for lactic acid derivatives.  If lactic acid could be produced from carbohydrates at lower costs and in larger quantities, the potential market for the acid and its derivatives could reach about $3.2-$4.4 billion/yr. Approach Argonne National Laboratory has conducted comprehensive market and economic analyses of lactic acid and its derivatives and the technologies for their production.  On the basis of these analyses, Argonne's strategy is to develop (1) processes for the conversion of carbohydrate wastes into lactic acid esters and their derivatives and (2) novel product applications to expand the lactic acid market. Argonne's process and product development strategy for lactic acid and its derivatives. The key technologies being developed by Argonne for lactic acid production are fermentation, primary purification, secondary purification, and the various polymerization or chemical conversion technologies for making lactic acid derivatives.  Traditionally, lactic acid is purified by adding sulfuric acid to the fermentation broth, which contains calcium lactate.  This step generates a large volume of calcium sulfate salt waste.  Other, new technologies also generate different kinds of waste salts.  In contrast, Argonne's primary purification process uses advanced desalting and water-splitting electrodialysis technologies.  These technologies purify the lactic acid efficiently and economically without generating a salt waste stream. To produce lactic acid derivatives, Argonne uses a different lactate intermediate (lactate ester instead of lactic acid), which facilitates high-volume manufacture of several different chemicals.  Argonne's process for making high-molecular-weight polylactic acid uses a chemical pathway that differs from the commonly used lactide route.  This results in greater versatility, allowing synthesis of polymers with tailored properties. Previous research has resulted in an efficient fermentation process, an electrodialysis-based primary purification that eliminates salt waste and novel products of lactic acid oligomers and polymers.  Current efforts are focused on the development of a novel secondary purification process, the development of lactate-derived products that can significantly expand the lactic acid market, and technology transfer activities to commercialize the processes and products. Results Argonne is working with a major agriprocessor to commercialize the lactic acid production technology. Argonne's polylactic acid technology has been licensed by an Illinois-based start-up company that is commercializing the technology for specific applications. Argonne is testing new applications for various lactic acid derivatives. Future Plans Argonne will continue efforts in process and product development for lactic acid and its derivatives, including the following: Technical support to a major industrial company for piloting and commercializing lactic acid production technologies, Further development of a novel esterification process for the secondary purification of lactic acid, and Continued development and testing of lactate-derived products with industrial collaborators. In addition, a cooperative R&D agreement (a funds-in CRADA) with a technology company is expected to be established in 1995 to develop and commercialize applications of advanced electrodialysis-separation technologies, which prevent pollution by recycling waste salts into their corresponding acids and bases.

This creates more than 6 million tons of hydrogen sulfide, a waste that must be treated to meet environmental regulations.  Although current waste-treatment technology recovers nearly all of the sulfur (99.0-99.5%), the remaining amount is emitted to the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide.  Moreover, the valuable hydrogen is burned to water, making it unavailable for further use.  This loss has a direct impact on bottom-line production costs for the refinery. Approach Argonne National Laboratory-based researchers are developing a new process, called MISHA, that uses microwave plasma chemistry to split hydrogen sulfide.  This patented process recovers hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide and recycles the hydrogen to the refinery.  MISHA (Microwave-Induced Sulfur and Hydrogen Autolysis) is an excellent fit for refineries because it would replace both the operating old Claus and tail-gas clean-up units while decreasing costly on-site hydrogen production.  In some refinery situations, MISHA can also replace the amine purification unit, thereby achieving even greater refinery savings. MISHA recovers and recycles hydrogen. Two reactor conditions must be satisfied to explain the observed hydrogen sulfide conversions and the low energy consumption: The microwave energy must be efficiently transferred to the plasma to create a high-temperature zone (thousands of degrees). The fluid dynamics within the plasma-chemical reactor must isolate and stabilize the plasma and, simultaneously, rapidly separate and cool the products. This freezes the products at a composition which is characterized by the plasma temperature rather than the bulk-gas temperature. To satisfy these reactor conditions, the feed is injected tangentially into the reactor, above the central plasma zone.  This creates a turbulent cyclonic flow that prevents the plasma from contacting the reactor wall and minimizes energy losses.  It also creates a thin, turbulent, high-temperature layer on the surface of the plasma, where hydrogen sulfide rapidly dissociates.  The turbulence of this boundary layer ensures that the dissociation products are quenched as they remix with the bulk gas flowing around the plasma.  Furthermore, the sulfur reacts with itself to form high-molecular-weight clusters that are driven to the wall of the reactor by the centrifugal forces generated by the cyclonic flow.  This prevents sulfur from re-entering the turbulent boundary layer and back-reacting. Results Argonne's experiments have confirmed the critical contribution of the cyclonic flow to increasing the hydrogen sulfide conversion and lowering its energy of dissociation.  However, the experiments challenge two of the predictions derived from a theoretical plasma-chemical model:  (1) Argonne obtained a plasma at atmospheric pressure with less than 1 kW of power, whereas the model predicted that 30�kW or more was required; and (2) the Argonne experiments do not show the predicted sharp rise in dissociation energies at pressures greater than 0.65 atm.  Furthermore, Argonne's analysis of the gas dynamics in the plasma-chemical reactor indicates that additional improvements in hydrogen sulfide conversion and process efficiency are possible. Argonne's experiments have shown that: MISHA recovers both the hydrogen and the sulfur at lower costs while saving energy and oil, MISHA's hydrogen sulfide emissions would be minuscule, less than 10 tons/yr, for a facility recovering 158 long tons/day of sulfur and 3.9 million scf/day of hydrogen, and In some locations, MISHA could easily be used to recover marketable hydrogen from natural gas production operations. Future Plans Argonne is searching for an industrial partner to scale up the laboratory plasma-chemical reactor to an industrial-scale prototype reactor operating with 10-20 kW of microwave power.  This plasma reactor would provide the necessary engineering data to design a commercial process for treating hydrogen sulfide and the economic data needed to determine the commercial potential of the process.

The recycling of automotive plastics, which constitute about 20-30% of ASR by weight, is not currently practiced on a commercial basis.  The components are not recycled for several reasons, including a lack of a cost-effective technology for recovering plastics, potential contamination of the plastics with other materials from the ASR stream, and the absence of a strong market. Approach Argonne National Laboratory is testing a technically promising, potentially economical process to recycle polymers and other constituents from ASR.  The value of the recovered plastics could be very competitive in a variety of applications; one of the first might be polyurethane foam for carpet padding. Argonne is testing a potentially economical process to recycle polymers and other constitutents from automotive shredder residue. The Argonne technique for recycling ASR begins with mechanical/physical separation of the ASR into several fractions: polyurethane foam, which is separated and cleaned; iron-oxide-rich "fines," which may be used by the cement industry as a source of iron oxide; and a plastics-rich stream, from which Argonne dissolves and recovers heat-formed plastics (thermoplastics).  The solvent used in the process is regenerated and continuously recycled.  If fines, foam, and plastics are recycled, as much as 75% of landfill waste could be eliminated. Results A demonstration plant at a shredder site is now processing polyurethane foam.  At the same time, four different plastics are being recovered in a batch-process unit, in quantities of 1 to 5 pounds each.  The plastics being recovered for evaluation are acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene.  Plans are also under way to run a large-scale test using fines in cement. Future Plans Some 20,000 pounds of polyurethane foam are being accumulated for an Argonne techno-economic evaluation in early 1995.  Argonne engineers are designing a continuous-process demonstration plant that could produce 3,000 tons of foam per year.  Commercialization of the polyurethane foam process could come as early as the beginning of 1996.

Today, the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) has a requirement to develop safe and economic technologies to demilitarize and to dispose of large rocket motors loaded with either of two propellants (Type 1.1 or Type 1.3).  This requirement has occurred as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START I and II) and normal obsolescence, as well as increasingly stringent environmental regulations that have made the open burning of propellant unacceptable.  Such unconfined burning of these energetic materials typically releases large clouds of smoke and toxic gases, including hydrochloric acid.  The volume to be disposed of may be over 30 million pounds per year. Approach In a joint program between Argonne National Laboratory and the U.S. Army Defense Ammunition Center and School (USADACS), a systems analysis is being conducted on six different propellant removal technologies, as well as two different technologies for the treatment of effluent waste streams.  Two versatile computerized products are being used to simulate the operation of these propellant removal systems:  Aspen PlusR and the Environmental Simulation Program (ESP), both of which generate material and energy balances.  Aspen Plus is also being used to identify the most promising integrated systems by estimating capital and operating costs. Technique for recovering solid propellant from a rocket motor casting. By using the most sophisticated, versatile computer software for process simulation, Argonne's approach provides an independent, unified, consistent perspective for the analysis.  Implementation of the analysis will result in safe, environmentally sound operating practices. The separate steps are being assembled into a viable, complete, and integrated system that incorporates opportunities for recovery and reuse of valuable propellant components.  The technique for recovering solid propellant from a rocket motor casing (see figure) begins with the application of work on the propellant, either with mechanical cutting or with hydraulic cutting via a very high-pressure jet of working fluid.  Propellant particles are separated for further treatment and recovery, while any accompanying dust and/or liquid wastes are sent to treatment facilities.  Where possible, working fluid is recovered and recycled.  After drying, if necessary, the propellant may be used in applications less demanding than rocket motors.  For example, recovered propellant has successfully been used as a component of explosives for mining and quarrying.  This particular reuse application appears to have very promising economic advantages for an integrated system. Results USADACS contractors have begun to operate pilot-scale facilities and to supply operating data and conditions to Argonne for use in computer process simulations, including process flow diagrams.  The systems analysis and integration using the Argonne computer have been completed (except for economics) for all of the processes under consideration.  The converged material and energy balances have been computed and used to generate a tabulation of all of the process stream flows, including waste effluents from those processes that have waste streams.  Some technologies have little or no waste effluent to treat. Future Plans Argonne's joint work with USADACS will include the use of Aspen Plus to estimate the capital required to construct a selected full-scale recovery technology and to estimate the cost per pound to operate such a facility.  The goal is to do this for both propellant types (1.1 and 1.3).  Such a comprehensive computerized description of a given technology is expected to be a valuable, user-friendly tool for thorough study of the process parameters that could lead to an optimum design.

With zinc-coated prompt scrap increasing fivefold since 1980, steelmakers are feeling the effect of increased contaminant loads on their operations.  The greatest concerns are the cost of treatment before disposal of waste dusts and the water associated with remelting zinc-coated scrap.  An economical process is needed to strip and recover the zinc from scrap to prepare it for steelmaking. The operating-cost benefits to the steelmaking industry from such a process are estimated to be $140 million per year (compared with using non-scrap sources of iron).  Environmental compliance costs would be mitigated by about $150 million per year.  Foreign exchange could also benefit by some $130 million per year, through reductions in zinc imports. Approach Through a cost-sharing program with Metal Recovery Industries U.S., Inc., Argonne National Laboratory is developing a new technology for converting galvanized steel scrap from stamping plant wastes into clean scrap for steelmaking.  With further development, the technology could also process galvanized steel scrap from obsolete automobiles. The degalvanizing process will be tested on shredded auto scrap. This is the largest source of ferrous scrap. The process consists of dissolving the zinc coating from scrap in a hot, caustic solution and recovering the zinc from the solution electrolytically.  The zinc-bearing scrap is charged in an electrolytic cell containing a 70�90 degrees C sodium hydroxide solution.  Applying an electric potential dissolves the zinc into the hot caustic.  Clean scrap is removed, rinsed, and recycled.  The electrolyte is then pumped into a second cell, where the zinc is electrolytically removed from the solution.  The zinc can be sold to refiners for purification and resale. Results Metal Recovery Industries U.S., Inc., has installed a 50,000-ton/year pilot plant in East Chicago, Indiana.  This plant has dezinced over 1,000 tons of automotive stamping waste, and tests have demonstrated that the process can remove not only zinc, but also many plastic coatings.  Tests continue to evaluate process economics and operation. Future Plans Plans are to provide 1,500 tons of dezinced scrap for a melt test to determine the environmental impact of dezinced scrap on furnace operations.  If testing is successful, detailed engineering will begin on a 200,000-ton/year dezincing demonstration plant for late 1996.  Plants like this one could be used for future commercial operations.

Systems that integrate coal gasification with combined-cycle power generation, combined with CO2-capture technologies, are an important option for future coal-based electricity supplies.  Integrated gasification/combined cycle (IGCC) systems feature high energy conversion efficiency.  Also, as shown by field studies, IGCC systems produce very low levels of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, which cause acid rain and other pollution problems. Approach Argonne National Laboratory's work emphasizes IGCC systems combined with CO2-capture technologies.  The entire fuel-cycle was considered, from mining the coal through CO2 pipeline transport and sequestering.  Commercial CO2-capture technology provided performance and economic baselines for comparing innovative technologies. Energy system components for CO2 recovery. By taking an overview of the fuel cycle, it was possible to compare the overall impact of each stage of the cycle and assess its relative importance.  Process evaluation included contact with commercial vendors to refine the engineering assessments for available technologies.  These assessments identified potential problem areas and development needs, evaluated key process tradeoffs, and estimated costs for the technologies. Commercial processes based on CO2 solubility in amines, glycol, and methanol were studied, as well as facilitated transport membranes (a still non-commercial technology).  Also considered were high-temperature technologies (for example, calcium- or magnesium-based sorbents and molten carbonate membranes).  CO2 recovery was set at 90%, and the combustion turbine was fed a high hydrogen-content fuel.  From the IGCC plant, a 500-km pipeline took the CO2 to geological sequestering. Results Results showed that the base IGCC plant was cheaper and more efficient than conventional pulverized coal-fired boilers.  However, Argonne found significant reductions in the IGCC plant's net electric power production.  For a 458-MW base case, these reductions ranged from 73.6 MW to 185.1 MW with a 0.29-0.53 kg/kWhe CO2 release rate (after considering makeup power).  Life-cycle CO2 sequestering costs were $113-201/ton of CO2, resulting in electricity costs that are 74-113% higher than the base case. Future Plans Argonne will continue actively monitoring development of U.S. environmental policy related to greenhouse gases.

With tougher competition, the heat rate of the power plant becomes a more important issue.  One long-established method to reduce the heat rate is to lower the back-pressure of the surface condenser.  This is accomplished by retubing existing units with commercially available enhanced tubes.  While this practice has been successfully used by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the past 15 years, Argonne National Laboratory is now working with TVA and other utilities to (1) determine the potential heat-rate reductions that are possible by retubing with enhanced tubes; (2) make utilities aware of these benefits; and (3) eliminate such technical concerns as tube-side fouling, tube vibrations, and eddy currents. Approach To determine the heat-rate reduction, Argonne has written a computer program that performs the lengthy thermal calculations on the basis of information supplied by the utility.  Publications in journals and presentations at conferences and meetings are being used by Argonne to acquaint utilities with the experience obtained with enhanced tubes and to address the most common concerns. The spirally indented enhanced tube is the type most commonly used for power-plant condenser retubings. The quantity of heat rejected by the tubes in surface condensers is a function of the surface area and the surface profile of the tubes.  Enhanced tubes improve the thermal performance inside the tube because they (1) increase the surface area per foot of tubing and (2) modify the flow field by increasing turbulence levels and decreasing the boundary-layer thickness.  Performance improvements outside the tube depend on the particular type of enhancement - that is, the disruption or roughness shapes and manufacturing process used.  These improvements are offset somewhat by an increase in tube-side pressure drop and higher fouling rates for some cooling-water types. A computer program was developed to calculate the heat-rate reduction that can be obtained by retubing with Korodense LPD, a commercially available tube made by Wolverine Tube, Inc.  The program incorporates the thermal performance characteristics obtained by monitoring 14 operating TVA condensers that were retubed with Korodense LPD. Results Argonne has conducted research to identify enhanced tubes that are superior in performance to Korodense LPD.  The research yielded two important findings:  (1) more outside enhancement is needed through the use of low-fins and (2) the internal disruption shapes should be more contoured.  Enhanced condenser tubes of the low-fin type are now being used successfully in Japan, but not in the United States.  The profile modifications of the spirally indented enhanced tubes can be made with a larger diameter indenting tool and are being considered as a possible option by Wolverine Tube. The following major barriers to the use of enhanced condenser tubes have been eliminated: Uncertainty of performance, Concern of excessive fouling, Lack of long-term successful demonstrations, and Low cost-effectiveness. Results of investigations to date indicate that increases of 30-40% in the overall heat-transfer coefficient (with a cleanliness factor equal to 1.3 to 1.4) are obtained in the clean condition with Korodense LPD.  Argonne is continuing to monitor the performance of these units and that of others to update these characteristics.  For most river waters, the superior performance is maintained for a year or more.  The new clean condition can be obtained by mechanical or chemical cleaning during shutdown or by on-line ball cleaning.  Intermittent chlorination also effectively controls biofouling.  The 14 retubed TVA condensers are operating successfully, one of them for 15 years.  Recent studies with Argonne's computer program indicate that payback times of 1 to 3 years are possible for many utility condensers when retubing is necessary. Future Plans Progress is being made to identify superior tube configurations for power-plant condensers.  Several have been identified, and approximate prediction methods were developed.  If funding is obtained, the next step will be to demonstrate these performance improvements by conducting experiments in the condenser of a host utility. Principal Investigators: C.B.

Metal loss is plaguing the effective operation of these units by causing shutdowns for unscheduled maintenance/refurbishing, which cost millions of dollars in lost revenues each year.  Erosion rates of 3 mm/1000 hours for reactor walls are not uncommon in conventional fluidized-bed boilers.  Similar rates have also been reported in petroleum fluid cracking units and silicone product reactors.  New software can be used to mitigate metal erosion in fluidized-bed reactors, which reduces costs and improves reactor design and operation. Approach Argonne National Laboratory participated in a cost-sharing consortium with fluidized-bed boiler manufacturers and with governmental/private research agencies such as the DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Predicted erosion rates vs. the fluidizing velocity for several Geldart's class B particle sizes. Using its advanced computational fluid dynamic capabilities, Argonne provided a mechanical understanding of metal erosion in fluidized-bed systems by computing solids motion and assessing its impact on erosion of reactor vessels and internals.  From these virtual reactor simulations, new effective sets of design guidelines were formulated to help industry mitigate and, in some instances, eliminate solids particle erosion in fluidized-bed systems.  The erosion mitigation software is based on fluid-solids hydrodynamic models which can predict, for a given reactor, three-dimensional distributions of solids loading, gas and solids velocities, pressures, and temperatures.  These programs are based on the solution of Navier-Stokes multiphase equations using the IMF (implicit multi-field) numerical technique.  The computer program can simulate dense ebulliated reactors as well as very dilute, short-contact-time reactors such as those used in the petroleum cracking industry. Results The erosion-reduction methodology developed at Argonne has been validated with proprietary data from a large-scale plant, which makes this methodology unique, proven, and directly usable by industry.  Through these solutions, companies can now save up to $2 million/yr on a large production-scale fluidized-bed process, by either refurbishing, modifying, and improving present processes and/or mitigating erosion problems.  With Argonne's advanced methodology, companies can also do a better job of designing and operating new fluidized-bed units with reduced erosion. Foreign customers from emerging economies are seeking new reactor designs, and technology transfer plans are being formulated with private sector software companies. Future Plans A world leader in silicone manufacturing is considering developing Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software capabilities for fluidized-bed systems which are directly tailored to its needs.

Attention was focused on the abatement of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate-matter emissions.  Subsequent concerns over the possible effects of acid rain served to strengthen that focus.  In 1990, Amendments to the Act addressed acid rain controls and reinforced restrictions on other air pollutants, such as ozone, which is influenced by NOx emissions.  An additional concern now receiving greater attention is the safe and economical disposal of large volumes of solid wastes from air-pollution control systems.  As new issues arise and emissions limits are gradually reduced, there are continuing needs for engineering improvements and research into new concepts that could lead to improved processes.  New or improved technologies for controlling emissions of NOx and SOx will enable U.S. industry to continue to compete in a cost-effective, environmentally sound manner. Laboratory spray-dryer facility. Approach In response to the directives of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, Argonne National Laboratory is developing new or improved pollution-control technologies for industries that burn fossil fuels.  This research continues Argonne's traditional support for the DOE's Flue Gas Cleanup Program.  Argonne's pollutant emissions research has ranged from experiments in the basic chemistry of pollution-control systems, through laboratory-scale process development and testing, to pilot-scale field tests of several technologies.  Whenever appropriate, the work has emphasized integrated or combined control systems as the best approach to technologies that would offer low cost and good operating characteristics. Laboratory facilities are available to address a variety of flue-gas cleanup problems by using realistic flue-gas compositions, on-line multicomponent gas analysis, and computerized data logging.  Current experimental systems include a complete wet scrubber, a unique spray-dryer/fabric-filter combination, and a fixed-bed reactor designed for investigation of dry sorbents.  Additional laboratory facilities are available for supporting bench-scale research and waste characterization studies. Results Development and patenting of a NOx/SO2 process concept based on the use of ferrous ethylenediaminetetra acetate [Fe(II)�EDTA] in a wet flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) system. This concept was later tested at pilot-plant scale. Recent work has identified electrochemical techniques that can extend the useful life of the Fe(II)�EDTA additive. Performance characterization of the first commercial-scale spray-dryer FGD system operating on high-sulfur coal. This work, done on-site at Argonne, was documented in a design and operation handbook. Identification of chemical additives and process conditions that promote NOx capture in spray-dryer/fabric-filter FGD systems. The techniques were successfully tested in two sets of field tests by using Argonne's 20-MW spray-dryer system. Future Plans Efforts continue to emphasize combined NOx/SO2 control.  Preventing or reversing the oxidation of ferrous ions in Fe(II)�EDTA is the primary focus of the wet scrubbing research. Work on the chemical kinetics of the process will continue to improve understanding of the underlying phenomena and to guide process development.  Tests of flue-gas cleanup wastes and waste-processing techniques will continue in parallel with the process development activities. Principal Investigator: C.

In 1986, activities were terminated, and by 1993 all furnishings and process equipment were removed.  Previous proposals for decommissioning the pilot plant were based on the plant's past association with agent materials.  Past recommendations called for enclosing the structures in tents and for removing the buildings in the most conservative way possible.  The Argonne National Laboratory team realized that the Army's own regulations, literally interpreted, would be the greatest constraint on the flexibility of decommissioning activities. Argonne's approach was to quantify the condition of the facility, as well as to explore an alternative way to deal with the legal requirements.  The rules encompassed both federal and state solid and hazardous waste regulations and DoD requirements regarding the treatment of any materials associated with chemical weapons. Chief among the federal laws were the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1986 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980. The Argonne decommissioning plan developed for the Aberdeen Proving Ground pilot plant complex could save the Department of Defense tens of millions of dollars. If the Argonne decommissioning plan is accepted, DoD could save tens of millions of dollars, based on the estimates of previous plans.  Because other Army agent-related facilities will ultimately require similar action, the Argonne approach could result in savings 100 times the amount spent on the pilot-plant study. Approach Army regulations suggest that all items coming in contact with chemical warfare agents must be heated to 1,000 degrees F for 15 minutes before they are released from DoD control.  Since chemical warfare agents are destroyed at this temperature, this approach ensures that all pilot-plant debris would be nonhazardous.  Other treatments, including chemical baths and washdown treatments, will also destroy agents.  But, historically, the Army has requested that materials be treated with nothing else but heat. On the state and federal levels, it is unclear which regulations are applicable.  Under different interpretations, the pilot plant could fall under either RCRA or CERCLA regulations.  Under the debris rule of RCRA, structures are classified as buildings until they are demolished.  Therefore, activities that might change the characteristics of potential contaminants in the structures can be performed under RCRA and not be considered as waste treatment. All parties involved want to minimize the amount of testing needed prior to razing since the rubble would have to be tested for both toxic and hazardous materials, as well as for chemical agents.  To determine the presence of chemical agents, vapors have been screened to less than one part per trillion for volatile agents.  Dust on the surface and in the pores of building surfaces will be collected for screening.  Heavy metals will be tested on wall surfaces and on structural steel. Under the Argonne recommendations, the structures will be treated first, then crushed under controlled conditions. Representative solid samples will be collected, as well as vapor samples from storage boxes.  From tests on these samples, individual units of crushed debris will be evaluated to determine the success of the system. Results Argonne's testing program, as well as new interpretations of Army, state, and federal regulations and proposed changes in the regulations themselves, points toward new, less costly demolition procedures.  Much of the material removed from the pilot plant may be recyclable as building materials or scrap metal after limited chemical treatment without heat treatment. Future Plans If the buildings are demolished and recycled according to Argonne recommendations, the Army can use this methodology for other facilities that need similar treatment.

Currently, soil samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory for heavy metals by atomic absorption spectroscopy and/or inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy.  This requires sizable expenditures of time and funds.  Hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrum analyzers have been developed for detecting lead and other heavy metals in paint.  Further development of these units offers a potentially fast and inexpensive method of determining levels of lead and other heavy-metal contamination in soils. Being able to take a hundred readings a day and having the data available immediately are the major benefits of portable XRF units.  Ordinarily, one would have to wait weeks for a laboratory to report analytical results.  With a small portable unit, a researcher can quickly determine the scope of lead contamination and then use laboratory results to verify field measurements. Argonne scientists are evaluating a hand-held X-ray fluorescence spectrum analyzer as a quick, convient, and inexpensive way of measuring concentrations of lead and other heavy metals in soils. XRF units also reduce costs.  A laboratory analysis for lead and other heavy metals may cost $200-300 for each soil sample.  With portable XRF units, a large number of readings can be made at greatly reduced cost. Approach At Grafenw�hr Training Area, a U.S. Army installation in southern Germany, Argonne National Laboratory researchers investigated small arms firing ranges for lead contamination in soils.  A hand-held XRF unit was used to measure lead concentrations in soils in potentially contaminated areas.  Ranges devoted to rifle, pistol, and hand grenade practice were included in the study.  Readings taken on the rifle range indicated the highest level of lead in the surface soil.  At only a few centimeters beneath the surface, however, lead could no longer be detected.  At the pistol range, readings showed lower concentrations of lead than at the rifle range.  This is consistent with the fact that rifle slugs disintegrate on impact into small particles that are more easily incorporated into the soil.  Pistol slugs, on the other hand, remain intact on impact. Results XRF field readings of lead contamination were confirmed by laboratory analysis.  With few exceptions, relative standard deviation was in the 8-10% range, which is very acceptable precision for a field-screening method.  The exceptions may reflect the heterogeneity of fine lead particles in soils and the fact that XRF has a bias toward low values for soils with high lead concentrations. Future Plans This technology has advanced to the point where it can be used for other heavy metals besides lead.  Argonne researchers are looking for opportunities to expand their investigations to other heavy metals and to determine the influence of soil texture and moisture conditions on this field-screening method.

In pipeline systems where water collects, bacterial colonies can form deposits on metal surfaces and produce organic acids that accelerate corrosion and cause localized pitting.  The bacteria act as environmental "catalysts," creating corrosion under conditions that cannot be reproduced in the laboratory.  Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) in the natural gas industry has been estimated to cause 15-30% of corrosion-related pipeline failures.  Improved MIC detection systems would provide early warning of pipeline failures and help avert worker injuries.  In the United States, industries spend $1.2 billion annually on biocidal chemicals to fight MIC.  These treatments are not only costly, but they can also have a harmful environmental effect.  As regulatory scrutiny of biocides intensifies, these chemicals represent potential environmental liabilities to industry.  Approach Argonne National Laboratory is developing the next generation of mitigation approaches, which are intended to reduce dependence on toxic chemical treatment.  To field test candidate technologies, Argonne established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas).  The next generation of approaches being developed and tested includes inexpensive carbon steels that resist MIC, "alternative" biocides that are less toxic than those now in use, and improved on-line MIC detection methods.  Argonne is developing methods for reducing pipeline corrosion that lessen dependence on toxic chemical treatment. Argonne and SoCal Gas have both set up experimental test loop systems to study the prevention and monitoring of MIC.  Both systems use produced water from natural gas storage or production fields.  The test loop systems are being used for: Screening and development of inexpensive MIC-resistant carbon steels, Development of less toxic chemical treatments, and Calibration and testing of on-line MIC detection methods and proprietary treatment approaches. SoCal Gas tests promising candidate metallurgies, treatments, and detection methods in the test loop system at its Montebello (California) natural gas storage field.  In addition to providing technical support for these field tests, Argonne uses its own laboratory test loop system to develop the information needed to improve the application or design of these technologies. Results Argonne and SoCal Gas are currently field testing alternative chemical treatments in gas storage and recovery wells, which traditionally have been most susceptible to MIC.  At SoCal Gas's Montebello storage field, these treatment efforts are saving an estimated $1 million/year.  In addition, two on-line devices have been selected as candidates for MIC-specific monitoring. Future Plans Further reduction in chemical usage will require an even better understanding of corrosion mechanisms.  In its laboratory test loop, Argonne will correlate localized corrosion with a specific electrochemical signal. In addition, chemical companies and a steel tubing manufacturer are joining the CRADA to examine methods of using less toxic chemicals to prevent MIC and to examine the effects of metallurgy on susceptibility to MIC.

Trees were cut down, stumps grubbed, and gullies filled, destroying existing plant cover.  This resulted in a barren, infertile landscape that became severely eroded.  Sediment was carried into adjacent forest, and the accumulation of sediment damaged and killed some of the den trees of the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species that requires living trees for nesting.  On the basis of Argonne's recommendations, modified agriculturial techniques were used to control erosion and revegetate a severely eroded area at Fort Benning, Georgia. Approach Argonne's CERS was asked to develop an erosion control and revegetation plan for stabilizing the drop-zone.  CERS staff conducted site surveys to collect data on the amount and types of existing plant cover and the type and degree of soil erosion.  Soils samples were collected and analyzed to determine soil characteristics.   A global positioning system was used to map the locations of roads, existing dam checks, and other physical features.  This information was combined with topographic and other data, using a geographical information system, to provide detailed site maps.  Information was gathered on local climatic conditions, candidate revegetation species, and designs for erosion control structures. Test plots were established to evaluate potential revegetation species and determine plant response to soil amendments.  These data were then used to develop detailed erosion control and revegetation plans and specifications. Detailed cost data on materials, labor, and equipment used were collected during each rehabilitation operation.  Following revegetation efforts, changes in vegetation cover were monitored.  Field observations were made to determine the effectiveness of erosion control structures.  Cost information was combined with monitoring data and field observations to determine the cost-effectiveness of each rehabilitation operation. Results Four erosion control and rehabilitation contracts have been implemented by local contractors at the drop-zone.  Revegetation efforts involved liming, fertilizing, and seeding with mixtures of adapted grasses and legumes to increase vegetative cover and reduce runoff rates.  Of the 680 acres in the drop-zone, approximately 365 have been limed, fertilized, and seeded; another 62 acres have been fertilized to increase vegetative cover and reduce soil erosion rates.  Over 1,000 feet of silt fence was constructed to curtail sediment deposition in adjacent forest areas.  The 1,400 feet of terrace and the 325 feet of riprap-lined waterway have helped to control erosion of the steep slope next to the airstrip.  Six porous check dams were constructed in gullies to limit gully erosion, and outlets on six existing check dams have been modified to reduce runoff velocity and trap sediment. Future Plans Cost, effectiveness, and site condition data will be used to refine future erosion control and revegetation plans for other disturbed sites with similar conditions.

Toxic wastes located in pits, trenches, and other disposal sites at Aberdeen are suspected sources of aquifer contamination beneath the facility.  However, because of local discontinuities in silt and clay deposition during the late Pleistocene and Holocene periods, the hydrogeologic framework cannot be imaged with confidence by using a single geophysical technique to define pathways of this contamination.  Multiple technologies are required to guide sampling and remediation programs.  Approach With support from the environmental program at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Argonne National Laboratory staff are using non-intrusive geophysical techniques to define aquifers and to guide drilling and sampling.  A pilot study was conducted in the southern Bush River Peninsula and adjacent waters to "see through" the Holocene-deposited silts and clays that effectively mask the underlying aquifers.   With the multiple technologies used by Argonne, identification of sediment type is possible at much lower costs than drilling.  Furthermore, data are acquired in a continuous profiling mode instead of discretely at specific testing stations.  Offshore and onshore data are well integrated.  Aquifers beneath the Chesapeake estuary system are located in Cretaceous-age sediments of the Atlantic coastal plain and in paleochannels of Pleistocene age that were cut below sea level during low stands of the Pleistocene.  Subsequent rises in sea level during late Pleistocene and Holocene periods resulted in deposition of organic silts and clays that now blanket coastal plain sediments and effectively mask the underlying aquifers. The Argonne approach to determining the hydrogeologic framework of these terranes was to use multiple geophysical data sets gathered both onshore and offshore.  From these data were inferred the geologic structure, distribution of silts and clays, existence of manmade artifacts, and porewater chemistry. 	Argonne utilized a variety of techniques to acquire the necessary data.  Side-scan sonar was used to image the details of water-bottom relief.  In shallow, high wave-energy areas near the shoreline, single-channel marine seismics provided high-resolution imaging.  Magnetometer profiling delineated the distribution of ferrous iron debris, as well as subtle trends in the magnetic properties of the bottom sediment.  Electrical conductivity mapping showed brackish water intrusion into shallow aquifers and differentiated coarse-grained materials associated with fluvial deposits from finer-grained silts and clays more commonly associated with quiet-water estuary environments.  Ground-penetrating radar imaging established the fine detail of water-bottom depths and the geologic framework to depths of 40 feet or more. Results A combination of techniques has been used successfully by Argonne staff in the Edgewood section of the Aberdeen Proving Ground to provide an excellent understanding of the underlying geologic framework.  Data acquisition was completed during the summer of 1994.  Data processing and interpretation were finalized during the spring of 1995.  Three reports are about to be published. Future Plans Technologies and procedures developed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground are constantly changing as they are modified and improved to explore the hydrogeologic framework at contaminated sites throughout the United States.

Cleanup via in-situ bioremediation can take up to 100 years at sites where contaminants must be desorbed via diffusion.  Many "pump-and-treat" processes are thought to fail partly because desorption releases the contaminants very slowly.  Another cause of slow release could be the limited mobility of non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs), which become pooled or trapped within soil matrices.  For these sites, innovative technologies are needed to achieve rapid, efficient cleanup at competitive costs. Foam remediation technologies have the potential to increase the applicability of in-situ bioremediation.  Unlike other approaches, foams can be designed to remove pollutants and enhance bioremediation simultaneously.  Although foams have been applied successfully underground for enhanced oil recovery, they have not yet been systematically applied to environmental remediation problems closer to the surface.  Argonne National Laboratory is exploring the opportunity to adapt and mature this existing technology for environmental remediation purposes, such as for the cleanup of hazardous waste at federal facilities. Foam delivery concept Approach Argonne is using foams to release and mobilize NAPL contaminants in the subsurface and is coupling this technology with bioremediation (either in-situ or ex-situ).  Unlike surfactants, foams remove contaminants by physical scouring, in addition to surface tension reduction and solubilization.  The physical scouring mechanism is particularly well suited for extraction of residual trapped NAPLs from soil matrices.  This characteristic, combined with the effective areal sweep or "plug-flow" movement of foams, minimizes the channeling tendencies common to other remediation technologies. The foam can be either produced in-situ or injected into the contaminated zone.  Injection/production wells (vertical or horizontal) can be used to assist in delivering, transporting, and monitoring the foams through the subsurface.  The proper selection of foaming agents can aid the delivery of the foam, its sweep front, the foam stability, its efficacy to release NAPLs in the subsurface, and the resultant biodegradability of the foam/NAPL mixture. Either aerobic or anaerobic environments can be established in the subsurface, depending on the selection of the carrier gas used to generate the foams.  This enables the foam-pollutant system to be biodegraded adequately for the particular contaminant of concern.  For example, trichloroethylene can be degraded aerobically, while tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride at the same site must be biodegraded anaerobically. It is anticipated that this technology can be applied to both the saturated and vadose zones for remediation of soils contaminated with either chlorinated organics, such as trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as chrysene, benz(a)anthracene, anthracene, fluoranthene, or phenanthrene. Results Argonne's research has elucidated some of the properties for foam flow in unconsolidated porous media at shallow depths.  This information has been integrated into a generic foam-flow model that can be used to design field processes.  Research with test soils has shown that foams remove NAPL-like contaminants 10 times more effectively than do surfactant flushing solutions.  Other aspects of foam-assisted remediation, such as enhanced bacterial transport in porous media, are also being investigated with industrial participants. Argonne researchers have found that: Foam-assisted remediation increases the bioavailability of trapped NAPL contaminants, allowing in-situ bioremediation to proceed further than it normally would; Aerobic or anaerobic environments can be established in the subsurface (depending on the selection of the carrier gas used to generate the foams), enabling the foam-pollutant system to be biodegraded adequately for the particular contaminant of concern; Foam technology could be applicable to remediation of soils contaminated with either chlorinated organics or polyaromatic hydrocarbons; and The technology can treat soils having either scattered contaminants or pools of NAPL contaminants in the subsurface. Future Plans A field demonstration of this technology is planned to begin in fiscal year 1996, given successful research on technical design criteria. Argonne researchers have begun applying magnetic resonance imaging to examine pollutant/soil interactions and three-dimensional modeling to predict foam behavior and porous media as an aid to foam control and design.

About 24 buildings in the Edgewood area of Aberdeen - a Superfund site - may soon be scheduled for decommissioning and demolition.  These structures must be characterized, both for chemical warfare agents and for common industrial contaminants.  The extent ination is not known.  The best methods of demolition and disposal must be determined. Special expertise is required because of the unique nature of the site's potential contaminants and the lack of established procedures for demolishing contaminated buildings.  Argonne National Laboratory's approach focuses on using portable field instruments and mobile laboratory facilities to provide high-quality data efficiently and cost effectively.  The detailed building inspection methodology developed by Argonne is yielding comprehensive, defensible documentation in an area for which no adequate description previously existed. Argonne is determining the best methods for demolition and disposal of buildings of the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground. Approach Argonne has begun work to define the scope of the contamination problem, identify specific contaminants, develop appropriate and efficient methods for screening structures for certain substances, execute field measurement programs to determine the true nature of the problem, and develop suitable approaches for decontamination and decommissioning. For each contaminated structure, Argonne researchers search historical records, inspect the building in detail, perform a comprehensive site survey, and develop a preliminary risk assessment for demolition.  They are developing a list of key potential contaminants most likely to present environmental and human health problems, as well as methods for screening for these substances.  The researchers have also designed field sampling and measurement programs to determine the true extent of contamination problems.  Finally, they are developing suitable approaches for the decontamination and decommissioning of each structure. Results All buildings of concern at Aberdeen have been inspected.  Two detailed inspection reports have been published and others are in preparation.  Reports are available on the findings of the geophysical surveys taken for the area.  A preliminary risk assessment has been completed for one building that serves as a prototype for others.  Initial sampling has been conducted for nine relatively simple buildings.  Preliminary results show that two of the nine are free from significant contamination; data for the remainder are being analyzed. Future Plans Field measurement and sampling will be conducted on the remaining, more complex buildings.  Results will be incorporated into risk assessments and used to develop recommendations for decontamination and decommissioning options.  Eventually, a contractor will apply Argonne's data and evaluation to perform the actual demolition.

Hurricanes, rising sea levels, and the dredging of deepwater canals have been seen as the lateral transport mechanisms of getting salt water into the interior of these wetlands.  However, a vertical transport mechanism has been identified � upward, periodic release of saline fluids from deep aquifers to shallow aquifers along regional growth faults.  This vertical transport mechanism has important ramifications to the petroleum, gas, transportation, and other sectors that have an investment in infrastructure that could suffer from increased subsidence accompanying these faults. Areas where salt water has been detected beyond the Baton Rouge fault. A more exact knowledge of active subsidence areas, which are not apparent from the marsh surface, would benefit all interested parties in the region.  Pipelines, bridges, and roads could be located in more stable areas.  An oil production company might be able to demonstrate, during litigation, that natural processes caused local subsidence, not its drilling activity.  And petroleum geologists might better understand the role of faulting in the migration of hydrocarbons beneath these and similar delta terranes. Approach Differences in chloride concentrations have been determined in aquifers straddling a known fault zone (the Baton Rouge Fault).  These findings support the theory that saline waters are fed into fresh marsh terranes from deep, geopressured zones and that these terranes and associated waters are compartmentalized into blocks.  Additional support for fault compartmentalization came from deep research boreholes, surface vegetation mapping, satellite imagery, and other sources.  Argonne research staff utilized an extensive database of existing seismic records to map the location where faults intersect with the surface.  The team proceeded under the assumption that these faults and fault-bound compartments were hydrologically distinct and could be mapped with non-invasive electromagnetic technology. In November 1994, Argonne research staff made a reconnaissance trip to southern Louisiana to determine if an electromagnetic sounding technique could map salinity regimes compartmentalized by faults.  Results indicated that the hydrology of these wetlands is much more complicated than the simple diffusion model endorsed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Electromagnetics is a non-invasive, inexpensive method for gathering framework data in these wetlands.  Bulk conductivity represents a cumulative electromagnetic response from the surface to the effective depth of the tool.  In this case, the effective depths of response were 15, 30, and 60 meters.  The study indicated that the deep 60-meter values best defined the aquifers on each side of the fault.  Investigations up to 600 meters in depth are possible with time domain electromagnetics (TDEM). Results A Ph.D. dissertation and several publications by an Argonne staff member have focused on the relationship of seismically mapped faults to subsidence phenomena in southern Louisiana.  The followup investigation demonstrated the ability of electromagnetics techniques to map these same faults. The electromagnetic technique used by Argonne is simple to apply.  A preliminary hydrogeologic investigation across two parishes was accomplished in a week. Future Plans A work proposal is being prepared to continue these investigations down to 600 meters by using TDEM.  Several strategically placed deep borings will be used to field calibrate the TDEM data set.

The activities of the DOE alone could generate more than 200,000 m3 of aqueous mixed waste, contaminated with both toxic organics and metals, that would require treatment over the next 20 years. Many researchers have undertaken extensive studies of photocatalytic techniques assisted by titanium dioxide (TiO2) for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from aqueous waste streams.  These techniques have been proven effective for oxidative destruction of the most resistant organic compounds and for reduction of several heavy metals.  However, reduction of toxic heavy metal ions, such as lead (Pb2+), had not been reported. Argonne's technology holds promise for remediating groundwater contaminated with long-lived radioactive materials. Successful application of the technology would enable removal, detoxification, and recovery of heavy metals, along with the destruction of organics in combined waste streams.  This would represent a significant breakthrough for the treatment of heavy-metal-contaminated waters at DOE and industrial sites.  By recovering the metals in metallic form, heavy-metal toxicity is minimized, and the number of steps required for recovery is reduced. Approach Basic research on surface modification of colloidal TiO2, which was conducted by Argonne National Laboratory's Chemistry Division, is being applied by Argonne's Energy Systems Division to develop materials that effectively remove lead and mercury ions from aqueous solutions.  The goal is to develop an industrial process for selective heavy-metal recovery and simultaneous removal of organic and metal contaminants from aqueous waste streams. Argonne chemists are using metal-binding peptides and related mercapto-reagents to modify the particle surface of TiO2 colloids.  Surface modification enhances the reduction properties of conduction band electrons, yielding materials that are selectively optimized for photochemical reactivity towards toxic metal ions.  In parallel research, Energy Systems engineers and scientists are conducting batch, bench-scale experiments on aqueous solutions containing various metal and organic contaminants to determine process kinetics and optimal treatment conditions. Results Preliminary results indicate that in solutions containing lead only, the surface-modified catalyst reduces lead ions effectively.  In lead-phenol and lead-naphthalene solutions, the presence of lead has little effect on phenol or naphthalene degradation.  Phenol does not appear to affect removal of lead ions significantly.  Naphthalene, however, by absorbing ultraviolet light, interferes with the illumination of colloid particles and deters the photocatalytic process.  Reduction in lead concentration is delayed until a significant portion of naphthalene is degraded. Future Plans Argonne researchers will design methods for metal and catalyst recovery and will test other compounds for surface modification of TiO2 colloid particles.  Systems and economic analyses will be performed, and a continuous flow treatment process will be designed and tested. Principal Investigator: Natalia K.

Argonne National Laboratory scientists, working with the Gas Research Institute, are using advanced computer technology to reduce the time and effort required for gathering and assessing the data needed to site and obtain permits for gas pipeline rights-of way (ROWs).  Approach Computerized geographic information systems (GISs) combine a wide variety of spatial data for the area of interest -- population centers, land cover, endangered species habitats, wetlands, hydrography, soils, and transportation routes -- that provide information associated with siting, permitting, construction, maintenance, and monitoring of pipeline ROWs.  Using this information, weighted map layers are created and used as input into a GIS least-cost analysis.  Weights are assigned to geographic areas  on the basis of environmental and engineering characteristics.  Least-cost analyses are then performed to produce a route for the ROW, or even several alternative routes, that avoid environmentally sensitive areas or areas with severe engineering constraints.  Alternative routes can be created quickly and easily by varying the weights assigned to the input layers, either by including or excluding specific categories or by changing the actual weights assigned to each category.  Results By using this approach, unavoidable impacts on preferred routes  can be identified and quantified early in the route selection process.  This allows for the design of mitigation measures and their presentation to regulators early in the permitting process.  This approach to planning pipeline routes will save the industry both time and money.  The GIS modeling results are typically obtained in less than a year, and it is expected that this period will be shortened further as digital data become more available. Future Plans Further research may be needed to determine the model's sensitivity to various input categories and their assigned costs.  In addition, decision support analysis tools would greatly  improve the process of assigning weights.  Coupling of GIS with other methods, including statistical and physical analyses, also needs to be investigated.  GIS may be coupled to physical models in the areas of hydrology, geology, transportation, storage, and production.  Available models need to be investigated for their compatibility with GIS and with the interfaces defined and established in this study.

Although the wastewater's constituents occur naturally, they are considered contaminants and must be treated.  Varying widely in concentration, these constituents include salt, organic compounds, and, in some cases, heavy metals and trace elements.  A common disposal method is deep well injection; its cost depends on the volume of wastewater injected.  What is needed is a simple treatment technique that reduces wastewater volume and removes contaminants. Argonne scientists are investigating several plant-based approaches for treating the salty wastewater that is brought to that surface along with natural gas from gas wells. Approach Argonne has developed a low-cost, low-tech method for cleaning up wastewater and reducing the volume of produced water.  Based on phytoremediation, the method uses green plants in an engineered plant ecosystem modeled on natural wetland ecosystems.  The "ideal" phytoremediation plant would be a large, vigorous, salt-tolerant grass or grasslike species having a large area of aboveground leaves and stems and a dense, fibrous root system to act as a biological filter. Large, green plants can move copious amounts of water through their roots and into the plant body.  This water is evaporated from the leaves as pure water vapor - a process called transpiration.  When selected, adapted plants are grown in contaminated wastewater by hydroponic techniques, and the root system functions as a biological filter. Contaminants taken up along with the water are degraded, metabolized, and/or stored in the plant body.  Transpiration is enhanced by maximizing the leaf/stem area of the plant.  Contaminant concentrations in plants can become thousands of times higher than those in the wastewater.  The contaminated plant biomass can be digested or burned to reduce its volume.  The residue can be processed to recover the contaminant, if valuable, or disposed of in environmentally appropriate ways. Phytoremediation offers several major advantages over competing physico-chemical technologies (e.g., ion exchange).  One advantage is the ability of selected plant species to adsorb contaminant ions from an extremely broad range of concentrations.  Another advantage is selectivity. Selected plants have the ability to adsorb the target contaminant while ignoring other ions in solution.  Other important advantages of phytoremediation:  It is low-cost and low-tech. Status Promising processes and plant species that were identified during the literature review and database development phases have been evaluated in greenhouse experiments.  Over 80 species have been screened for salt tolerance and high evapotranspiration rates.   For six species, detailed experimental data have been generated on transpiration rates, salt tolerance, nutrient requirements, and maximum salt concentration at which effective transpiration occurs.  Transpiration rates are consistently above open-water evaporation rates at a saline concentration of at least 2% salt in the nutrient solution.  For several species, these high evapotranspiration rates have been maintained up to 6% salinity. Future Plans An experimental batch-processing bioreactor with two compartments will be assembled in 1995 to simulate planned pilot and field installations.  Each downstream compartment will process wastewater of increasing salinity with different plant species.  The goal is to reduce the volume of saline production wastewater by 75% in less than eight days. Principal Investigators: Ray R.

Until now, there have been few quantitative data to guide the regulatory community and the natural gas industry in restoring pipeline corridors to their original condition.  The recent emphasis on "no net loss" of wetlands, with resulting wetland banking strategies, has imposed both financial burdens and uncertainty on pipeline companies in planning the future development of pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs).  Documented studies are needed to define the type, significance, and duration of environmental consequences associated with past pipeline practices. Approach Argonne National Laboratory's field team of botanists, ecologists, engineers, and soil scientists conducted one-time surveys of 13 wetland crossings and two surveys each on two wetland crossings for eight different pipelines throughout the eastern, midwestern, and southern United States between 1990 and 1992.  The communities chosen represented a diversity of wetland types, installation techniques, and maintenance practices.   A taxonomist, specializing in local flora, joined the team at each site.   At the time of the surveys, the wetland crossings ranged in age from 1 to 31 years.  Data were collected on the vegetation that became established on the ROWs and in adjacent, undisturbed wetlands.  The percent of area coverage collected for each species on the ROW and on adjacent wetlands was used to evaluate similarities and differences between plant communities.  Changes to topography, soils, and hydrology attributable to ROW construction were documented, along with impacts on rare, threatened, endangered, or sensitive species.  The study verified that current environmental regulations and pipeline technology are effective in limiting undesirable impacts to wetlands.  The current recommendation to seed wetland ROWs annually with ryegrass is not necessary and may only serve to delay establishment of native vegetation. Argonne's study of wetland areas shows little evidence of environmental degradation by pipelines. Results The results indicated that ROWs installed under recent wetland regulations normally are revegetated within a few years after site closure with dense, diverse plant life similar to that in adjacent natural areas.  These plant communities have propagated from naturally available species without special soil treatment or artificial seeding.  Traditional maintenance by periodic mowing has been successful in allowing an herb stratum to develop. While ROWs encourage plant and habitat diversity for wetlands, there is no evidence that they degrade wetlands by encouraging the growth or spread of invasive, non-native plant species.  Most negative impacts are short-term, diminishing with time.  Older ROWs, developed before current regulations went into effect, had fewer positive results than those developed within the last several years. Natural gas pipeline companies recognize the Wetland Corridors Program as a unique data bank on wetland recovery.  Future Plans One pipeline company has approached Argonne to survey some of its wetland crossings in similar fashion and compare the findings with the previously established data bank.  Continuous studies are needed to document more precisely the duration of observed effects, the impacts of recent regulations limiting maintenance to only the central portion of ROWs, and further comparisons of directional drilling and open trenching.  Studies are also needed to document potential fragmentation of various habitats and identify techniques to avoid this condition.

Federal law requires that alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) be included in government automobile fleets beginning in 1993, in state and fuel provider fleets in 1996, and potentially in municipal and private fleets beginning in 1999.  There are numerous types of AFVs from which fleet owners may choose.  The difficulty lies in knowing which will best meet the owner's needs. Approach To help fleet owners decide which vehicles to buy, Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are building a database of information on AFVs.  The information in the database is collected in moving laboratories - the test vehicles Argonne employees drive at the laboratory's Illinois site.  With 60 vehicles, Argonne's Center for Transportation Research (CTR) is the nation's largest alternative-fuel fleet demonstration center and the only one with all models of OEM-produced vehicles.  Argonne employees use the AFVs in their daily work, which is as varied as hauling equipment and driving to meetings.  Thus, the information is collected under real-life operating conditions.  The information gathered about the daily performance of these vehicles aids not only federal agencies that will purchase these types of vehicles,  but car makers and others as well. Argonne natural gas vehicle Argonne's fleet includes vehicles powered by methanol (alcohol derived from natural gas or biomass), ethanol (alcohol made from grain or biomass), and natural gas.  The alcohol-fuel vehicles are flexible-fuel vehicles that can use any mix of gasoline and alcohol without modifications.  Because the alternative fuels are available on site, the vehicles primarily use alternative fuels. Argonne's alternative-fuels fleet includes mid- and full-sized sedans, burning either ethanol or methanol, and vans using natural gas.  Gasoline-powered vehicles of the same type are used to gather comparison data.  Argonne's approach is unique in that the data are collected on a trip-by-trip basis, so that performance over the entire driving cycle can be examined. Thus, researchers can capture the differences between performance on 10 short trips as opposed to one longer one with the same total mileage. Data collection focuses on the vehicles' driveability, reliability, and fuel efficiency, but other operational characteristics peculiar to AFVs are also being observed and documented.  Argonne is analyzing additional information on performance, driveability, and emissions for a more precise evaluation of how various vehicles and types of fuels perform in different kinds of weather.   Results Since the experiment began in August 1992, over 280,000 miles have been accumulated.  In an earlier study begun in 1986 and concluded in 1991, Argonne drivers logged more than 1 million miles in dedicated methanol-fueled vehicles. Information from the experiment is available to researchers on the Alternative Fuels Center database. Future Plans Additional alternative-fuel vehicles will be added as they come into the federal fleet.  Three methanol-calibrated, flexible-fuel Dodge Intrepids were added in spring 1995, including one designated to use E85 (85% ethanol and 15% hydrocarbons), an Argonne exclusive.  In a research partnership based on the CTR's acknowledged leadership in AFV testing, Chrysler engineers are allowing a special field test of some Intrepids using E85.

Decreased petroleum consumption, in turn, will improve the nation's balance of trade, increase jobs and gross domestic product, and reduce the environmental impact of fuel combustion and production.  The use of lightweight materials allows automakers to decrease the weight of an automobile without decreasing its size.  Advances in lightweight materials, coupled with design improvements and improved joining technology, will help assure that crashworthiness and handling characteristics in lighter cars are the same as in heavier automobiles.  The part of the automobile with the greatest opportunity for weight reduction is the body itself.  The competition among materials developers - primarily makers of steel, aluminum, and polymer matrix composites (PMC) - is fierce.  Therefore, a program to evaluate lightweight materials that is based on independent analysis and has clear program objectives and a well-thought-out implementation plan is critical to ensure that R&D dollars are used effectively. Approach Argonne's Center for Transportation Research is helping the DOE determine the potential benefits of a lightweight materials program.  By using a macroeconomic model developed by Argonne researchers, impacts of lightweight vehicle production on Gross Domestic Product, jobs, and balance of trade are estimated. Aluminum and other lightweight materials have a significant role to play in improving the performance and fuel economy of passenger cars and trucks. Argonne is evaluating an all-aluminum car body for Ford Motor Co. Argonne's approach is to estimate the vehicle life-cycle and determine the vehicle's energy, environmental, and economic impacts, assuming that aluminum and PMC materials are used extensively in the body.  First, the weight, materials composition, and fuel economy of a baseline steel vehicle are delineated.  Next, from an extensive literature search and interviews, aluminum-intensive and PMC-intensive vehicles are characterized.  The costs of the lightweight vehicles are assumed to differ from those of the baseline steel vehicle because of the additional cost of the materials themselves.  Next, a vehicle-choice model is used to simulate the competition between lightweight and conventional vehicles and to determine the vehicle mix.  From total vehicle sales projections and vehicle fuel economy estimates, total fuel consumption is estimated. Embodied energy in the materials is estimated from an extensive Argonne database of materials production and recycling energy consumption.  Estimated changes in total energy use are plotted over time.  From fuel consumption data, changes in greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants are also plotted. Results Preliminary results indicate that lightweight materials (such as aluminum and high-performance PMCs) have the potential to boost the fuel economy of vehicles, making it feasible for manufacturers to increase their corporate average fuel economy, even when larger vehicles are in demand.  By using aluminum, significant life-cycle energy savings are projected in the 2010-2030 period, assuming an incremental cost of no more than about $800 to $1,200 per vehicle, but realizing these savings will require improvements in forming, joining, and recycling technologies.  Very high cost is an impediment to the market penetration of high-performance PMC-intensive vehicles.  A breakthrough in manufacturing processes and low-cost polymer synthesis is required.  The product mix and pricing strategies are important.  For example, the replacement of conventional-material automobiles with more expensive lightweight versions, prompting buyers to shift to light trucks and vans, would hurt overall fleet fuel economy. Future Plans Argonne researchers are completing the analysis, and results will be available in mid-summer 1995.  Plans call for the analysis to be expanded to include other lightweight materials and engines.

The transportation sector currently accounts for approximately two-thirds of all U.S. petroleum use and roughly one-fourth of total U.S. energy consumption.  A virtual one-to-one relationship exists between additional gasoline consumption and America's increased use of imported oil.  Clearly, any effort to decrease the use of oil hinges on reducing its use in transportation.  By displacing imported oil with domestically produced alternative fuels, Americans could help to reduce the trade deficit, create jobs, and promote economic activity. On the environmental front, many Americans living in metropolitan areas around the country face possible chronic damage to their health from long-term exposure to air pollutants.  Emissions from the 190 million cars and trucks in this country account for about half of all air pollution and more than 80% of all urban air pollution.  New domestic sources of power for vehicles and new vehicle technologies could reduce emissions and provide cleaner air to breathe.   AfterShock, an award-winning HEV built by students at University of California, Davis, set a mileage record in October 1994, driving 440 miles from Los Angeles to Sacramento using only a single battery charge and 5.7 gallons of gasoline, while averaging 77 mpg. Federal legislation (the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Energy Policy Act of 1992) is encouraging the use of alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel fuels.  Both auto manufacturers and the oil industry will be affected. Approach Since 1987, the DOE has sponsored 28 different college and high school engineering competitions through Argonne National Laboratory.  These competitions help to accelerate the domestic development of alternative-fuel-vehicle technology.  Federal funding for the competitions is heavily leveraged by industry contributions, reflecting the high value industry places on the competitions.  These competitions emphasize current or future vehicle technology;  students work with production vehicles (donated by domestic vehicle manufacturers) to meet emissions standards, while maintaining high performance and fuel economy.  Auto industry experts judge events, interact with students, and compare technologies.  The competitions program represents a unique international coalition of government and industry aimed at eliminating technical and institutional barriers to acceptance of alternative fuels.  Program Objectives Advance the state of the art in fuel systems and power trains and document student designs and vehicle accomplishments. Inform and educate the public about alternative-fuel technologies. Obtain industry participation to improve the relationship between DOE and industry, other government agencies, and academia. Support innovations and ongoing research resulting from involvement in these competitions (see "Results"). Increase students' engineering knowledge through work on "real world" problems outside of the classroom. Provide students with hands-on experience, which often results in opportunities for automotive industry employment. Excite students about careers in science. The high school events have interested many students in science careers. Results Competition vehicles have exceeded the toughest foreseeable emission standards while improving fuel economy, performance, and driveability.  Several innovations and ongoing research projects have resulted from thecompetitions.  Examples include: Northwestern University developed a gas quality sensor, Old Dominion University developed a gaseous fuel injector, and other teams developed several complex emission-control systems. Four universities were awarded $1.1 million in research grants on the basis of their competition experience. Three university hybrid-electric vehicles were used to help validate the draft Society of Automotive Engineers Hybrid-Electric Vehicle Emissions Procedures. More than 120 student papers and over 10 Argonne technical papers have been published. Future Plans In 1995, 10 DOE-sponsored competitions will take place, involving electric, hybrid-electric, solar, and alternative-fuel vehicles.  A new competition, FutureCar Challenge, sponsored in conjunction with USCAR, comprised of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors, is now being planned for 1996.

But, EVs are only one of several technologies that do so.  Total energy cycle analyses can be used to compare, from a complete system perspective, the environmental emissions, residuals, and total energy use of competing methods of providing energy services for similar end uses.  Such a comparison will make it possible to select the best means of reducing U.S. oil imports, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution without causing unintended impacts on the environment.  Approach The DOE is sponsoring several total energy cycle assessments (TECAs), including one for electric vehicles, the EVTECA. Argonne National Laboratory, through its Center for Transportation Research, is one of three national laboratories participating in the EVTECA.  TECAs examine the environmental effects of energy systems. They consider all energy-cycle stages, including raw material extraction, material transportation, conversion to an energy form (e.g., electricity), transportation of the energy form, and end use. The entire life cycle of each stage is included: construction and/or manufacturing, operation, and post-operation (e.g., disposal). EVTECAs consider all energy-cycle stages. In the EVTECA, an emissions and residuals inventory of electric vehicles is being developed, as well as an inventory for comparable conventional vehicles fueled by reformulated gasoline (RFG). The emissions and residuals associated with vehicle and battery manufacturing, battery recycling and disposal, vehicle operation, electricity generation, production of RFG, and extraction and transport of feedstock for electricity and RFG will be included. Several scenarios of EV market penetration for the years 2000 and 2010 have been developed. EV use is being evaluated in four metropolitan areas with different utility fuel mixes, climate, transportation patterns, and environmental regulations. The regions selected for analysis are Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Washington, D.C. The scenarios also vary in terms of battery types, vehicle types, vehicle use patterns, and EV charging schedules. The results of the scenario analysis are being incorporated into a total energy cycle analysis model, TEMIS (Total Emissions Model of Integrated Systems). The model will be used to estimate the emissions and residuals associated with electric and conventional vehicle use on a per vehicle mile of travel (VMT) basis. Both the scenario results and the per-VMT results will be presented in the final technical report of the project. Results The project is well under way. Much of the battery, vehicle, and RFG characterization has been completed and submitted for external peer review. Argonne has prepared draft papers on the following topics: the selection of battery and electric vehicle types for inclusion in the assessment; EV performance characteristics, EV battery recharging patterns, energy use and emissions associated with producing and recycling EV batteries, vehicle travel patterns in the four study areas and selection of driving cycles for simulation of electric and conventional vehicle performance, estimates of energy consumption of electric and conventional vehicles, conventional-vehicle operating emissions, emissions associated with production of RFG, and projections of annual EV sales and stock. Base-case utility dispatch for the four regions has been simulated, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has completed an analysis of EV impacts assuming unconstrained charging and peak-shift charging in selected seasons, but the analysis is not yet available for review. Future Plans The final products of this study will include a technical report documenting the estimates of the emissions and residuals of the total energy cycle of EVs and comparable conventional vehicles. The TEMIS output will be made available in a spreadsheet format. A policy-oriented report will be developed outlining the policy and R&D implications of the EVTECA.

With an office-wide Strategic Program Planning initiative already in progress, the challenge was to integrate efforts to respond to this congressional requirement. Approach The staff of Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Transportation Research developed a research plan and assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers to provide quick-response technical, engineering, and economic analysis services. The effort was planned as an inter-laboratory activity, including the participation of personnel at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Tennessee. A key element of the research approach involved the use of comprehensive computer analysis techniques that provided definitive projections of energy savings and environmental and economic benefits of the advanced transportation technologies. Market-penetration estimates from the Alternative Vehicle Sales (AVS) model developed by DOE provided inputs to Argonne's Integrated Market Penetration and Anticipated Cost of Transportation Technologies (IMPACTT) and Argonne Multisector Industry Growth Assessment (AMIGA) models. The models were used to generate estimates of the reductions in petroleum use and criteria air pollutants, as well as increases in the Gross Domestic Product and employment benefits. An iterative approach was used to develop the research plan, with frequent submissions and close coordination with the sponsor. Results A comprehensive draft of the plan was developed and submitted for review and comment within six weeks of the start of work. Subsequent submittals were provided after comments were received from Office of Transportation Technologies staff, industry peers, senior DOE management and general counsel, the Office of Management and Budget, and other federal agencies.  The plan was transmitted to Congress in August 1994. The methodology and results were also used by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for several ongoing technology assessment and program evaluation efforts, as well as for other submissions required by the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Projections show that OTT's programs could boost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $583 billion by 2020.  As indicated in the accompanying table, the benefits will accrue from growth in the GDP resulting from reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and oil use and a projected decrease in the world price of oil due to the use of advances in transportation technology.  Future Plans The planning methodology has been updated and is currently being applied to office program assessment and development efforts.

(In fact, the first U.S. patent for a maglev system suitable for transportation applications was granted earlier, in 1968.)  However, while the Germans and Japanese continued vigorous R&D on this technology, U.S. funding was discontinued after 1975.  By 1989-90, both Germany and Japan had achieved advanced stages in their maglev development programs, and both had prototype test vehicles running on test guideways.  But since no commercial maglev system was as yet deployed, there remained an opportunity for the United States to re-emerge as an international competitor. Approach Following publication of landmark maglev studies performed by U.S. Senator Moynihan's Technology Advisory Committee and Argonne National Laboratory in 1989, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and DOE, together with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, jointly formed the National Maglev Initiative (NMI) in FY 1990.  The program was initiated in part due to the growing concern that the demand for fast, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation was rapidly outpacing the existing system's capacity. Maglev technology addresses the need for fast, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly mass transportation in the United States. This federally funded project investigated the state of the art in maglev system design, developed U.S. maglev system design concepts, evaluated them relative to existing transportation systems, determined the economic feasibility of developing and implementing such systems in the United States, and examined what role the federal government should play in their development and implementation. By the time the NMI was started in FY 1990, formation of a strong maglev technical team was already well under way at Argonne.  The team consisted of transportation experts, physicists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, one of whom had served as a project leader for the first federally funded maglev program in the early 1970s.  Funding from the Laboratory, the state of Illinois, and the DOE helped to build that team and its level of expertise in maglev technology. Results During subsequent years, Argonne made many contributions to the NMI program.  Argonne's maglev team produced more than 70 reports and papers and a number of invention disclosures from 1988-95. Five patents have been awarded, and a sixth application was recently submitted. The Laboratory participated in various program planning, management, and coordinating committees and helped government agencies evaluate contractor proposals and monitor technical progress on awarded contracts.  In addition, through government-sponsored in-house R&D, the Argonne team, building on the earlier maglev work done in the United States and abroad, developed laboratory experimental techniques and used them to help develop new computer codes and validate both old and new codes.  Argonne's acquired expertise and analytical tools were then applied to verifying and evaluating contractors' results. Future Plans Federal support for the NMI was drastically reduced in FY 1994 and virtually eliminated in FY 1995.  Despite these actions, Argonne staff continue to work in the maglev field, although at a reduced level.  During FY 1994, both the Army Corps of Engineers and the FRA provided support to Argonne to continue in-house R&D and offer technical support where needed.  In FY 1995, the FRA provided funds to Argonne to help conduct its congressionally mandated Commercial Feasibility Study (CFS), expected to be submitted to Congress this summer.

To reduce America's reliance on imported petroleum, the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992  requires that alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) be included in government automobile fleets beginning in 1993, in state and fuel provider fleets in 1996, and potentially in municipal and private fleets beginning in 1999.  To promote the use of vehicles that run on nonpetroleum fuels, Section 405 of EPACT requires that the DOE, in conjunction with appropriate federal agencies and other individuals and organizations, establish "...a public information program on the benefits and costs of the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles."  Furthermore, DOE is required  "...to produce and make available an (annually updated) information package for consumers to assist them in choosing among alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles."  Approach Argonne National Laboratory was asked to develop a public information program on alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles.  Target audiences and outreach strategies were consistent with, but differ somewhat from, those which have evolved under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, specifically the Clean Fuels Program.  As a key element in Argonne's approach to this task, Argonne and DOE gained early and ongoing participation of stakeholders (those with a vested interest in the fuels and vehicles market)  and technical oversight panels during the development of promotion and outreach materials.  In all materials, alternative fuel and AFV characteristics are to be compared to those associated with gasoline and evaluated on a life-cycle basis.  The materials are designed to provide relevant and objective information on a variety of alternative fuel and AFV characteristics, including: Environmental performance Energy efficiency Domestic content Cost Maintenance requirements Reliability Safety. The Section 405 program is using three broad approaches in support of petroleum displacement goals.  First, the program provides information that will make it easier for affected fleets to comply with AFV mandates.  Second, whereas it is generally recognized that even the fullest application of fleet AFV mandates will be insufficient to achieve all petroleum displacement goals, the program can provide information that encourages voluntary commitments to purchase AFVs, supplementing the mandates.  Third, program efforts to measure effectiveness provide feedback that can be used to adjust not only Section 405 program plans, but related programs as well.  Results Early in the program, it became apparent that no single group interested in promoting increased alternative fuels or AFV sales is likely to be taken seriously without consistent and unambiguous support of its specific message by other influential agents, and that a key aspect of any outreach program should be constant monitoring and promotion of fleet-owned AFVs as they reach the end of their commercial service cycle. Because fleets are the first audience segment to face requirements for alternative fuels and AFVs acquisition, a 32-page document targeted at this segment was published in June 1994.  The brochure has been very well received by its targeted audience.  To date, about 45,000 copies have been distributed. Information on alternative fuels and AFVs was distributed through DOE's Public Information Exhibit at the 1995 New York Auto Show and the 1995 National Association of Fleet Administrators Fleet Institute Exposition.  The exhibit also participated in the Air & Waste Management Association's 88th Annual Meeting & Exhibition in June 1995.  Future Plans The scope and quantity of outreach materials and efforts is expected to expand over the next several years. Principal Investigator: Christopher L.

Modern society promotes theideal of the rugged individual. For men you have the Clint Eastwoodpersona--the Marlborough Man. For women you have single moms raisingtheir kids alone. The ideal Western male rides into town, fights thebad guys, falls in love, and then heads off into the sunset. He isstrong and solitary just like an orangutan but he represents anevolutionary dead-end. Many of today's problems are a result ofabandoning our human biological roots. We must look to ourdistinctive gregarious human heritage; living and working in familygroups and communities if we want to be successful. Otherwise we arejust stressed out 'orangutans' in an urban setting." The Person Birthdate May 10, 1946 Birthplace Galdikas was born in Germany while her parentswere enroute from Lithuania to Canada. She grew up in Toronto. Residence Coquitlam, BC (Spends half the year in Borneo) Office Simon Fraser University Family Members Father: Antanas Galdikas (retired contractor) Mother: Filomena Galdikas (retired nurse) Spouse: Pak Bohap, Dayak rice farmer in Borneo, tribal President andco-director of the Orangutan Program there. Birute Galdikas has two younger brothers and a sister, as well as three children.

She feels thirsty, not so much hungry.Swatting at mosquitoes, Dr. Birute Galdikas balances on a slipperylog--"The logs are always slippery. I don't know why, but they alwaysare"--trying to avoid the thorn vines and toxic bark in the dark dankrainforest. She stands waist-deep in tea-coloured swamp water, herjoggers and jeans soaking wet. Two pairs of socks, one tucked underand one over the jeans keep out leeches and other unspeakable menacesof the bog. She's wearing a khaki long sleeved shirt with lots ofpockets and a cotton jungle hat she bought at an army surplus store. Catching her breath, she spots two magnificent humongous maleorangutans standing face to face, glaring at each other's massivecheek pads. They are ready to fight for the chance to mate with thefemale that Galdikas has been tracking for days. Actually, she canonly glimpse their shifting shadowy forms in the dense foliage. Thesounds are horrific: snarling, grunting, loud and frightening. Theywrestle and tumble, smashing through the brush, trying to bite eachother on the head and shoulders until one flees into the bush. Movingforward to see, Galdikas snaps a twig distracting the other one.Suddenly, he grabs two thick vines, swings down until he hangs only ametre above her head and stares into her eyes, so close that hernostrils tingle from the stale odour of orangutan sweat. In 22 years of jungle observations, she's had only a handful of suchclose encounters, so rare are orangutan's meetings with humans or eventheir fellow apes. But this fellow's message was clear: "Leave mealone." Galdikas has learned more than any other human being about what itmeans to be an orangutan, and the cardinal fact is that they like tobe left alone. An adult male's range is at least 40 square kilometresand he can spend weeks loping slowly from tree to tree eating fruits,nuts, insects, leaves and bark without ever meeting any of his kin. "I've always wanted to study the one primate who never left the Gardenof Eden," says Galdikas. "I want to know what we left behind." Her conclusion: our biologically recent developments of complextool-making, language, and social institutions have removed us fromthe slow paced, isolated but extremely stable lifestyle of ourprehistoric ancestors in the 'garden'. And we must not forsake theseevolutionary roots, for it is only our distinctly human social tiesthat can keep our natural animal greed in check, preserve ourenvironment and maintain our mental well being. History When Birute was 12 years old she loved to go into the wilder sectionsof High Park in Toronto and pretend she was a Huron or Iroquois nativeslipping through the woods, at one with nature. She would spend hourslike this, quietly and secretly observing the wild animals in thepark. Ever since she was 5, Birute wondered where human beings camefrom. She knew they evolved from a common ancestor of monkeys andapes but she wanted to know more. She Got university degrees in psychology and anthropology. Went to meet Louis Leakey and got his support to set up an orangutanresearch station in Borneo. Lived in the jungle observing orangutans for 23 years. Founded orangutan support groups all over the world. Became a professor at Simon Fraser University. Wrote articles for National Geographic, Science and other journalsand has just finished a book. The Science Birute Galdikas is the world's leading expert on orangutans, the greatapes that live in the rain-forests of Borneo. She is anAnthropologist. Anthropology is the study of human beings, butGaldikas is looking to the great apes who decended from a commonancestor to help understand the mysteries of human nature. When she was 22, Galdikas met Dr. Louis Leakey who is famous fordiscovering fossils of early humans in Africa. Leakey and the NationalGeographic Society helped Galdikas set up a research camp in Borneo tostudy orangutans. Although she grew up in Toronto and spends severalmonths a year teaching in Vancouver at SFU, Galdikas has been livingin the rainforest among the orangutans for the last 23 years. 1. The Rainforest The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable ecosystems on theplanet. A huge variety of plants and animals thrive there, and nothinghas changed for millions of years. This is why the common ancestor forall apes including humans may have been somewhat like an orangutan.Orangutans have no serious predators except humans. Their dietaryknowledge of the irregular fruiting patterns of tropical plantshighlights their intelligence. It also explains their solitarylifestyle and the eight-year interval between births. A big animalneeds a lot of foraging territory without too many others around. 2. Structural Brachiators Orangutans are structural brachiators which means they are built toswing from branches with their upper limbs, but they have become tooheavy to move quickly like this. Adult orangutans are the largesttree-dwelling animals on earth, averaging about 100 kilograms formales. 3. Food Collecting The mother is collecting sweet habu-habu bark for her baby, one of over400 types of food orangutans enjoy in the rainforest. Galdikas hastried many herself. One way she has learned to spot orangutans in thedense foliage is by the sound of dropping fruit peels and pits. 4. The baby is reaching for the food. Through the repeated transfer of food between mother and baby, youngorangutans learn to process food. They watch and imitate. They learnby trial and error. 5. Babies Baby orangutans cling to their mother's fur until they are 4 years old.They are very dependent and remain with the mother for nine years.Females have perhaps 4 offspring in a lifetime. Orangutan males livesolitary lives, appearing briefly to mate. The orangutan's naturallife-span is unknown, but in zoos they have lived for up to 60 years. Activity Try being a physical anthropologist and make an activity budget for ananimal you can observe. You'll Need: A focal animal. It could be a pet, a human being or a squirrel in the park. A notebook, a pencil and a watch. What to do: Observe your focal animal for at least one hour noting the time andduration of every activity. Note what he/she does, how he/she holdsthings, posture, utterances, everything. Make two columns: one for theexact time and one for the activity. For instance 11:02 Left hand picks up cup 11:02:05 Sips about 5 millilitres Afterwards, break down the activities into categories like Eating,Moving, or Resting, and add up how much time the subject spent oneach. Categories can be divided further. For eating, show time spenton each type of food. Finally draw a graph.

Other Interests: Founding president of a society for themaintenance of academic freedom. "I'm concerned about newrules in the university research environment. For instance,for politically correct reasons, certain research is nowfrowned upon as it might offend certain groups (like fatpeople or women). Also I do not like the emphasis oncollaborative research. Both these trends kill the creativefreedom of the individual. You just have to go ahead andfind things out for yourself. This is the mark of a goodscientist." The Story The room is dimly lit, quiet and small. It's in the bigmodern psychology building at the University of WesternOntario. A young university student sits at a table readyfor the test. There are no windows. The ventilation systemis the only sound. A slightly older graduate studentadministers the test from the other side of the table. She places asheet of paper with rows and rows of little pictures infront of the subject and starts a stopwatch. The fellowtaking the test is getting $10 dollars to sit for a halfhour checking off pictures that match. As soon as hefinishes one page, she puts another one in front of himuntil two minutes are up. It's kind of fun at first but itgets a little bit boring after a while; especially for theolder student who has given this test almost a hundred timesalready. The stopwatch sets the pace of the action in twominute intervals as different subjects come into the room todo the test. Later, the graduate student tabulates theresults to see how many rows of pictures men matchedcorrectly compared to how many rows the women got right.Doreen Kimura comes in and takes a look at the raw data.Right away she can see they are onto something and a subtlesmile crosses her face. History: Kimura grew up and went to school in a small town inSaskatchewan (Neudorf, near Yorkton), where facilities to doscience were almost non-existent; so her interests were inwriting, languages, and algebra. Before finishing HighSchool, at the age of 17 Kimura dropped out to teach in one-roomed rural schoolhouses in Saskatchewan and NorthernManitoba. While in Manitoba she saw an ad in a teacher'smagazine for an admission scholarship to McGill, applied forthe fun of it, and got it! At McGill she became interested in Psychology as a result ofhearing Donald O. Hebblecture in the introductory course. She got a BA, MA and PhDat McGill, the latter in Psycho-biology, and then spent twoyears as a post-doctoral Fellow at the Montreal NeurologicalInstitute, before sojourns at UCLA Medical Center and theZurich Kantonsspital in Switzerland. She became a professorin Psychology at UWO in 1967. She also has a smallconsulting business which sells neuropsychological teststhat she developed. The Science Behavioural psychologists study how brains work tounderstand how people differ from each other. They do thisby giving people psychological tests. For instance you mightbe shown a series of pictures where you have to match theones that are the same. The test is timed and the faster youdo it the higher your score. 1. Mental Rotation Test: On average, men can pick outmatching rotated objects faster than women. Women are betterat matching objects based on their surroundings. 2. Aphasias: Aphasias, or speech disorders, occur most oftenin women when they have brain damage in the front of thebrain. In men, these disorders occur when the damage is inthe back of the brain. 3. Finger Ridge Counts: Kimura counts the number of fingerridges between two specific points on a person's fingerprint. Peoplewith high ridge counts on the left hand are better at"feminine" tasks. On average any sample group of people will havemore ridges on their right hands. But Kimura has found thaton average, sample groups of women and groups of homosexual men havea higher incidence of individuals with more ridges ontheir left hands. Activity: Find someone you can watch for five minutes while they aretalking. They don't need to be talking to you. They could bein a restaurant or a bus or they could be talking to someoneelse with you. They should have nothing in their hands. Theidea is to record their hand movements while they talk forfive minutes. Make a table to record your data. The tablehas three columns: one for right and one for left hands, andone for both hands. It also has two rows so you can recordself-touching movements as well as free movements. After doing several different people, count up the totals of handmovements for each individual. Did you record more right hand movementsor left hand movements? While people are talking they use speech centreson the left side of the brain. Which side of the brain controls the movementsof the right hand? Your experiment might help answer this question. If youpool your observations with dozens of others at your school you may have enough datato calculate a left and right hand movement average for men and anaverage for women. Which sex uses their right hand the most while they aretalking? Mystery: Kimura offered no mystery for future generations to solve,saying that it's the unpredictability of science that makesit interesting.

The Story The aroma of antiseptic and crisp sheets mingles with the sooty smell of a small coal-burning fireplace at the end of the infirmary room."Coxeter, how do you imagine time-travel would work?" says John Petrie. "You mean as in H.G. Wells?" says Coxeter. The two 14-year-old boys are inside-by-side beds recovering from the flu in their private school's sick-room.H.G. Wells's classic science fiction storyThe Time Machine is a popular topic of conversation. Both boys are very bright andbelieve time travel will eventually be possible. "I suppose one might findit necessary to pass into the fourth dimension," says Coxeter.  That is the moment when Coxeter began forming ideas of hyperdimensionalgeometries. The boys had some books and games by their beds. They startedplaying around with ideas of higher dimensional space. Eventually theseearly musings lead Coxeter to his discoveries and books about regularpolytopes--geometric shapes that extend into the fourth dimension andbeyond. History:  Discovered new regular polyhedron having six hexagonal facesat each vertex, 1926; enumerated the n-dimensional kaleidoscopes, 1933; Coxetergroups; inversive distance between two disjoint circles (or spheres).Author of 6 books on geometry including "Introduction to Geometry" (1961),"Projective Geometry" (1964), "Twelve Geometric Essays" (1968), "RegularComplex Polytopes" 1974. Co-author and editor of numerous other booksincluding "M.C. Escher: Art and Science" (1986). "Kaleidoscopes" (1995) isa collection of 26 of his papers on polytopes, etc. The Young Scientist:  Because of a school essay Coxeter wrote at the age of about 14 on the idea of projecting geometric shapes into higher dimensions, Coxeter'sfather, who was a pacifist and friend of Bertrand Russell, took him to seethe brilliant philosopher. Russell helped the Coxeters find an excellent math tutor and Coxeter was formallytrained and fast-tracked for Cambridge University. The Science Coxeter's major contribution was in the area of Dimensional Analogy. Regular Polytope: Coxeter is famous for his work on Regular Polytopes. The process of stretching geometrical shapes into higher dimensions is called "Dimensional Analogy". These shapes are called "Polytopes". When they involve coordinates made of complex numbers they are called "Complex Polytopes". Hypercube: If you pull a cube into the fourth dimension you get ahypercube. Eight cubes make a hypercube. Cube: A square is flat. If you pull it up into the thirddimension you have a cube. Six squares make a cube. Line: A line is a one dimensional shape. If you pull it in thesecond dimension you have a square. Four lines make asquare.  Experiment:  Try making some rhombus tiles. A rhombus is a squashed square. Maketwo diamond shaped rhombuses, each having four equal sides. One rhombus hastwo angles of 36 degrees and two of 144 degrees. The other one has twoangles of 72 degrees and two angles of 108 degrees.  Measure, draw and cut several dozen of these out of heavy card stock andmove them around on a table to make patterns and shapes. Roger Penrose has shown that these shapes can be used to make an aperiodic tiling of the plane. Try it. Try to make 3d shapes from these 2d rhomboids. How many can you make? Consider 36 x 2 = 72. 36 x 3 = 108. 36 x 4 = 144. 1, 2, 3, and 4 multiplesof the same angle make up all the angles in the two shapes! If you love this and it gets you thinking and dreaming, you may have afuture in geometry. Mystery For FutureGeneration: 4-colour map problem. Although a controversial computer proof hasrecently been shown, Coxeter believes that a more elegant proof may stillbe possible.

The Story Standing on a thin ledge of rock, just below Hell's Gate falls on theFraser River, William Ricker dips his net into the eddy at his feet.He brings up a six pound sockeye salmon for tagging. This one is freshand strong, not like the tired ones who are having trouble with therapids. Again and again the weak ones find their way into his net.From a pocket, Ricker pulls out two little red and white metal disksand a 5 cm pin. He wipes his brow and waves to his partner who isalso tagging fish a few meters away. The sun is hot. A steady hot windblows up the narrow canyon. "Of course there was no road down to 'The Gate' in those days," saysRicker. "Only a steep trail actually, but nothing youcouldn't handle if you were young and skookum." Ricker was 30. It was the summer of 1938, the first time he had workedon the big river and he was enjoying himself. It was also the first year of the Canadian Salmon Commission's studyof Fraser sockeye. While his partner held a fish down, Ricker used a pair of pliers to attach the bright tag through the fish'sbody just below the dorsal fin. Then he threw the wild sockeyeback into the water to fight its way upriver. Theroar of the rapids, the cool water swirling around his feetand the hot wind made a perfect combination for Ricker. The team of four men managed to catch and tag up to20 fish per hour, several thousand in all. Enough toaccomplish the goals of the study: "We wanted to find whatfraction of the fish went to each of a dozen or so spawning regionsto mate and lay eggs at different seasons. Observers in those regions were on the lookout for the salmon and were making estimates of the numbers on each spawning ground," says Ricker. Knowing the number of spawners is crucial if you want topredict how many fish will be available for future harvest. Ricker knows salmon runs like some people know World Series baseball statistics. He has kept track of the Commission's estimates of the FraserRiver sockeye ever since that day in 1938. Each year different numbers of salmon return to spawn depending on thespecies. Also, they go through cycles. For example, the big salmon run of 1993 is the same "line" or "cycle" as the record run of 1913 which was around 100 million fish. Forsockeye, such huge numbers occur only every 4 years. So thenext big run should be 1997. Off years are one tenth asnumerous or less. Ricker was the first to suggest several possible reasonsfor the cyclic variation in returning salmon stocks. Biologistsare still collecting evidence to determine the correctexplanation. The Fraser sockeye are on a 4-year cyclepossibly because most of the fish mature at 4 years of age.Farther north age 5 is also common. Pink salmon have a 2-yearlife cycle. For cohos it's usually 3 years, while chinook or"spring" salmon return at any age from 2 to 7 years. The mostpowerful and largest of all salmon, a chinook holds the worldrecord, weighing in at over 57kg. History: When he was eleven years old William Ricker began studying his dad'sstar charts. Eventually he could name all the constellations and thebrightest stars.  All through high school Springtime found Ricker upmost mornings at 5:00 am. For three hours before breakfast he wouldride his bike into the woods or along the shoreline near North Bay,Ontario looking for birds. Then he...  Got a BA & PhD in Biology.  Had summer jobs working for the Ontario Fisheries Research Laboratoy mainly on trout.  Studied salmon life history and enhancement at Cultus Lake, BC.  Became a professor of Zoology at Indiana State University.  Became Editor of Publications for the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, andthen Chief Scientist.  Wrote the "Green Book" on the computation of fish population statistics.  Identified 90 new species of stoneflies.  Wrote a Russian/English dictionary of fisheries terms.  Kept fit with hiking, and played violin and bass viol. The Science 1. The Ricker Curve, developed in the 50s, is still used all over the worldto determine average maximum catches for regional fisheries. Each coloured curverepresents a different type of fish population. 2. Line of natural replacement. Along this line, spawners are replaced by anequal number of adult progeny 3. Salmon are interesting because their Ricker curve looks more like this.At this point you have reduced the population to 40%, but some fish,like salmon, produce many more mature progeny when spawning grounds areless crowded. 4. Natural Equilibrium. At this point, spawners equal progeny. You can'tcatch any fish, if you want to maintain the population at this level.Fish don't naturally go much beyond this level because they get too crowded.Spawning beds get messed up and many eggs die. 5. When you catch fish, say 20%, you move back here on the green Rickercurve. You have less progeny, but enough to sustain a catch of20%--a surplus. 6. The  point of maximum sustainable catch isactually a bit to the left of the maximum point on the curve. This isbecause the distance between the curve and the replacementline is the greatest at this point. Anywhere to the left of thisline you are overfishing and will reduce the next generation's harvest. Activity  Sockeye Salmon                    Pink Salmon Biologists must be able to tell the difference between many differentspecies. You can try it too: You'll Need: A library book with good pictures and descriptions of fish local to your area.Try cod or salmon. A trip to a big fish market or your favourite fishing spot. What to do: At the market: Take your book to the fish market and try to find the distinguishing featureof each type of salmon, or cod that is available. Write down their proper Latin names See if you can find any fish that are mislabeled in the market.If you go fishing: Try to identify everything you catch. Note the depth, water temperature andtime of day. Keeping records like this is not only scientific, it will help you catch morefish!

The People Funding sources Great Canadian Scientists Backgrounder Introduction The Great Canadian Scientists project was started toincrease Canadian's awareness of the great scientists that our countryproduces. Over the last five years with the help of several grants the projecthas developed a website, book and CD-ROM to meet this goal. The idea Barry Shell is a science writer at SFU responsible for publishinga newsletter that profiles the work of SFU scientists. One day in the hallwayan Engineering professor named Jamal Deen suggested that Shell might apply thesame techniques he was using in the newsletter to a book on the greatestCanadian scientists. Figuring therealready must be many books like this, Shellwent to the public library expecting to bring home an armload. Imagine hissurprise when the science librarian at the main branch of the Vancouver publiclibrary told him that no such book existed. The librarian said there was astrong need for such a book, especially for school-aged kids who wereconstantly coming into the library with assignments to write about Canadianscientists. Thus the project began. Three Definitions Everyone asks, "What do you mean by Great? How do you defineCanadian? And what about the word Scientist?" It's difficult to compare the sumof great people's lives. Any listing like the one in the GCS project is boundto generate debate. When Isaac Asimov wrote his Biographical Encyclopedia ofScience and Technology in the 60s he did not even let an assistant type it. Inthis way he felt the responsibility for the scientists chosen for thatcompendium rested with him alone. In a similar way, Shell takes fullresponsibility for the choices in the list of scientists for the GCS project.There is no committee, just him. How can you define greatness? Shell starts with Nobel laureates, but also looksfor Canadian winners of the King Faisal prize, the Albert Einstein Award of theWorld Cultural Council, the Wolfe prize from Israel, the Welch foundation inTexas and of course Canada's own Killam, Gairdner, Manning, Herzberg andSteacie prize winners. As much as possible, he tries to check with peers as towhether a particular scientist's work was considered to be the best in theirfield. He also attempts to select scientists from all parts of Canada, and awide variety of disciplines. There have been many inconsistencies and Shell welcomes ideas for improving theproject. From time to time he receives mail from people who suggest, forexample, that Roberta Bondar (first Canadian woman in space) or David Suzuki(popular environmentalist) should not really be included. Shell's response:"Maybe so if you just look at their scientific achievements, but I figure ifyou can make it into orbit, or get your science messages on national TV everyweek, that's definitely great." He defines Canadian scientists as researchers who held Canadian citizenshipwhen they made their most outstanding scientific discoveries. That's it. Thatmeans many of the people in the project were not born in Canada, and some wereborn here but do not live in Canada any more. Scientist is hard to define. At first the project began with researchers inPhysics, Chemistry and Biology and most of the people in the project do work inthese three core disciplines. But the boundaries have blurred a bit and a fewdoctors, engineers, computer scientists, and psychologists have joined thelist. There is no good reason for this. It just seems like a good idea and itmakes the project more interesting. Women Scientists No product evolves in isolation. A purely "objective" commitmentto scientific achievement ignores other equally important factors that gobeyond science and that indirectly affect the process of science and who doesthat science. Historically and currently, women face barriers to entering ascientific career. It became a project goal to encourage girls and young womento enter science by including many women scientists whose achievements areworthy of acknowledgement and can serve as inspiration to women interested inbecoming scientists. Hence the percentage of women in the project is about 20%while in reality the percentage of practicing woman scientists in Canada issomewhere around 5%. Born, Bred, Matured and First Published on theInternet The content of Great Canadian Scientists began in June 1991 witha posting in several Internet discussion groups (Usenet) that called fornominations. A list of about 70 scientists was quickly generated. As the monthsand years went by, the list was refined and rebroadcast to the newsgroups andmore nominations were solicited. Several responders helped verify somenominees' citizenship or career achievements. Email was used to contact manyscientists, too. Once, upon receiving an email query from me about a nomineeand colleague, a researcher at AT&T Bell labs simply walked down the hallto ask Brian Kernighan (one of the creators of the C programming language) ifhe was a Canadian citizen. The answer came back in just a few minutes. He is. With poor prospects for conventional book publication, early drafts of theinformation were first published on the World Wide Web beginning in May 1995.Many thousands of "visitors" later that original manuscript has been muchimproved and the book, a website and a CD-ROM are the results. Publication of three formats Great Canadian Scientists is the first product available toCanadians that integrates and utilizes new and traditional media for learningabout Canadian men and women of science. The product synergistically combinesthe book with a website and a companion CD-ROM. Each medium delivers thematerial in a different way and each has strengths that the others do not. Theywork together, not against each other. With the CD-ROM students can hear andsee the scientists talk about themselves and their work in their own words.Scientific principles can be hammered home through fun-to-play interactivecomputer games. With the website, they can send email directly to livingscientists and ask questions. They can play the quiz and try to beat other kidsall across the country (and the rest of the world) playing at the same time.The book lets them go home and read more about the scientists on the livingroom couch or do activities at the kitchen table. 100% Canadian Focus and Content! GCS has a pure and single-minded Canadian slant. Other availableproducts, though perhaps made in Canada, often try to target the more lucrativeAmerican market so they must be watered down or altered to fit American schoolcurricula. Great Canadian Scientists fits the mandate of the Information Highway Advisorycouncil to protect Canadians from the potential for a loss of Canadian identitydue to the American slant of the Internet. It also fits with a new Pan-CanadianInstructional Resource Profile that emphasizes curriculum content about theprocess of science. Canadians need to tell the world that we are particularlygreat at science. Canada has a great reputation in the world of science. GreatCanadian Scientists shows you why.

Charles Krebs is an expert on: 1. Why bears hibernate,2. Why male penguins hatch the egg, 3. Why lemmings commit masssuicide or 4. Why birds migrate to the Arctic?* On October 18, to start off Canada's National Science and Technology Week,hundreds of people puzzled over such questions. About 40 registered totrack their scores on the quiz at the Great Canadian Scientists website(www.science.ca). The six top scorers got Great Canadian Scientistst-shirts and CD-ROMs. The winners were: 1. Ashleigh Cheung (13, Vancouver, BC), 2. Scott MacIntyre (39, Dartmouth,Nova Scotia), 3. Roger Leeman (~25, Zurich, Switzerland), 4. NancyBroughton (~25, Chicago, Illinois), 5. Micheline Villeneuve (~30, Orleans,Ontario), and 6. Louis Moreau (27, Quebec, Quebec) Barry Shell, the project's creator says, "I think it's great that people inSwitzerland and Chicago could play alongside Canadians at home." The GCSQuiz and website show that the Internet is a very effective medium for thepromotion of Canadian excellence abroad. Several things about the winners are of interest. They are from sea toshining sea; Nova Scotia to BC. There was an even 50/50 split of male andfemale winners. A Chinese Canadian was the top scorer. Two French Canadiansare in the winners list. Of the two outside Canada, one is a Canadian PhDstudent studying in Chicago. The other is a Swiss fellow who just likesCanada. Interestingly, the age range of the winners shows that the site ismainly being used by adults; often to assist children with learning, butusually for their own interest. The results are particularly striking because they show that theInternet is becoming more open and accessible. No longer is it solelythe domain of male nerds and hackers. Instead a cross section ofCanadians was represented in the winners circle. They *are* allcertainly predisposed to science and technology, however, with ascience wiz kid in Vancouver, a professional engineer in Nova Scotia,a Chemistry PhD student in Chicago, and an Industry Canada employee inOttawa. The quiz was programmed by Gordon Ross, a 4th year Communication student atSimon Fraser University where the Great Canadian Scientists website makesits home. By the way, anyone in the world can play the quiz at anytime by goingto www.science.ca. Find out onceand for all if lemmings really do throw themselves off cliffs. *ANSWER: Charles Krebs is one of the world's leading Ecologists. He wrote the most widely used textbook, "Ecology", and he is an expert on why lemmings commit mass suicide.

March 18th, 1869, St. Andrew's East, Quebec d. September 2nd,1940 Pathologist Maude Abbott won a scholarship to McGill University, Montreal,in her senior year of high school. She earned her BA and thendecided to study medicine. McGill at that time did not allow womento enter its medical program, so Maude attended Bishop's Collegeand became a doctor in 1894. In 1897, she wrote a successful paperon heart murmurs, but a male friend had to present it for hersince women were not admitted to the Montreal medical societywhere she was to read her paper. In 1898 Maude was appointed curatorof McGill's Medical Museum. Here she began cataloguing specimensand became interested in pathology, the study of disease. Shefocused her studies on heart disease and began work on her book,The Atlas of Congenital Cardiac Disease, in which she describedher new classification system. In 1923 she became Chief of Pathologyat a woman's medical college in Pennsylvania. In 1926 Maude returnedto McGill in Canada, where she pioneered the use of museum exhibitsas teaching aids. She also wrote a history of nursing which waslater used in nursing schools across the country. In 1936 heratlas was published and was praised as an important addition tomedical knowledge. She was also made an honorary member of theall-male Osler Society, named after Sir William Osler,a famous pathologist who had encouraged Maude in her studies.On September 2nd, 1940, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage anddied shortly after, at the age of 71.

Nerve cells do not die immediately when damagedbut may survive even for months. This survival provides opportunityfor healing, under the right conditions, such as the envelopingpresence of Schwann cells (support cells that provide structureand insulation). Although actual cures of serious injuries havenot yet been achieved, more recent research with the optic nervesindicates some recovery of function.

May 8, 1939-Montreal, Quebec Sterling Professor of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut Sid Altman grew up in Montreal but through a twist of fate attended MIT where hereceived a B.Sc. in Physics. He then studied molecular biology under Lerman at theUniversity of Colorado Medical School. Lerman helped arrange for Altman to go toEngland to work in the laboratory of S. Brenner and F. Crick. While there, in 1970,Altman discovered an unusual enzyme involved in the transcription of DNA intoprotein. He then moved to Yale University where his continued research showed thatthe active part of the enzyme consisted of RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). This wassignificant because RNA molecules are much more primitive than protein molecules.Besides offering a possible explanation for how life might have begun billions ofyears before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesomeprimitive life form: the virus for the common cold which is based on RNA. It may bepossible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold viruses by chopping upthe RNA on which they are based.

He became a doctorand studied diabetes, a fatal disease. He and his colleague CharlesBestdiscovered a hormone, called insulin, that helped people sufferingfrom diabetes live a normal life. Banting studied medicine atthe University of Toronto. He obtained his medical degree in 1916 andserved for the remainder of WW I as a medical officer overseas.He was awarded the Military Cross for heroism under fire. Bantinglater became interested in diabetes mellitus, a disease whichat that time meant a slow but certain death. Its chief biochemicalsymptom is the presence of abnormally high glucose levels in theblood, and the appearance of glucose in the urine. It had alreadybeen proposed that a hormone produced by small patches of cellscalled the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas gland might preventdiabetes. The research of Banting and his colleague Best resultedin a way to isolate the hormone, called insulin, and extract itfor the use of those suffering from diabetes. The experimentswere completed in 1922, and in 1923 Banting was awarded the NobelPrize. Outraged that his co-worker had not also been awarded theprize, he gave half his share to Best. The Banting Research Foundationwas established by Canadian Parliament that same year. With thecoming of WW II, Banting was again involved with medical war workand died in a plane crash over Newfoundland.

For a scientist to qualify asCanadian, the simple rule is: they must have held Canadian citizenshipwhen they did their most distinguished work. We include him here because many people consider him Canadian. Throughout his life Bellwas interested in the education of deaf people. Among his mostfamous students was Helen Keller. His work with hearing and speechled to his most famous invention, the telephone, in 1876. Althoughthe first phone conversation took place in the US, Bell said hedeveloped the idea in 1875 in Brantford, Ontario. It is certainthat many of his early experiments were conducted there, includingthe first long distance telephone call, between Brantford andParis, Ontario. He also invented the microphone. The Bell TelephoneCompany and other related businesses made Bell a wealthy man,and he was able to pursue a wide range of scientific interests.He spent his winters in the US on business, and summers in CapeBreton Island, Nova Scotia, on scientific research, which rangedfrom the genetics of sheep breeding to aviation. His Silver Dartaircraft was the first to fly in Canada, in 1909, and his hydrofoilspeed boats held the world record for more than 10 years. Belldied of diabetes in 1922, ironically the same year that Bantingdiscoveredinsulin. It is doubtful that he ever became a Canadian citizen.

March 13, 1934, Tokyo Professor and cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Montreal GeneralHospital Research Institute Dr. Ray Chiu was born in Tokyo. He received his MD from NationalTaiwan University, and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1970, in ExperimentalSurgery. He pioneered a new type of experimental surgery thatremoves some of a heart patient's back muscle, attaches it tothe ribs, and wraps it around the heart. A specially designed pacemaker contractsthe back muscle in time with the heart's own contractions, thushelping a weak heart to function. Chiu was the first to overcome the physiological obstacles tousing other types of muscles to assist the heart's function. Heartmuscle is the only kind that can contract regularly without tiring;other muscles require periods of rest. Thus the physiologicaland chemical factors of the back muscle have to be modified tobecome more like the heart. Collaborating with David Inuzzo, abiochemist of York University, Chiu subjected the latissimus dorsimuscle with four to six weeks of constant low frequency electricalstimulation, after which it came to resemble the heart muscle.The stimulation alters the expression of certain genes in themuscle cells. The process was actually discovered by biochemistsin the late 60s, but was not applied to heart surgery until theresearch came to the attention of cardiac surgeons in the lastdecade.

Costerton was a Universityof Calgary postdoctoral student in 1978 when he shook up the establishedscience of microbiology with a new view of bacterial life. He and his team workedouta way to see the structure of the slimy substance that seemedto anchor bacteria to surfaces in cattle stomachs. When they tookthe bacteria into the lab and "purified" them, they became justlike ordinary bacteria. It became obvious that test-tube bacteriaare not the same as in life. Natural bacterial colonies were creatingtheir own microhabitat, adhering to surfaces and covering themselveswith a slimy protective layer of molecules Costerton dubbed "matrix-enclosedbiofilms." The researchers also found that biofilm bacteriawere often team players, different species working in physiologicalco-operation. Biofilms also survive under conditionsthat floaters (individual bacteria released as scoutsfrom the biofilms themselves) can't; it takes up to 50 times the bactericide tokill an attached slime population as it does to kill floaters.Costerton and his team have applied their knowledge to developingnew technologies in areas ranging from oil production to bacteria-resistantmedical devices.

He also investigatedthe cell biology of the pancreatic beta cells and cells of thepars intermedia of the pituitary gland. His researches on theheart led him to the 1980 discovery of Atrial Natriuretic Factor(ANF): a polypeptide hormone produced by the cardiac muscle cellof the heart atrium. He thus demonstrated that the heart has anendocrine function and opened a field of research that has ledto many new insights in biology. Recognition of his work on ANF is shown by hisnumerous distinctionsand awards, including the Gairdner Foundation International Award,The Ernest C. Manning Principal Award, and the CIBA Award in Hypertension Research.He is a Nobel Prize nominee.

Shereceived her BA from McGill University in 1890, earning the highestmarks and winning several prizes. The following year, Carrie becamethe first female instructor at McGill. In 1896, she earned herMA and, after a long struggle, was made a lecturer. Five yearslater, she was appointed acting chairperson of the botany department,a position she held for nearly three years. But when the universityfinally filled the position permanently, it passed over Carrie,and hired a man. Carrie eventually became the first woman everappointed to a full professorship at a Canadian university. Herresearch on heredity was read by scientists around the world andpaved the way for the future study of genetics. She was one ofthe few women listed in American Men of Science (1910). McGillawarded her the honorary title of 'Professor Emerita'. She diedin 1941.

Fyfe is Canada's foremost earth scientist, widely consideredthe world's most eminent geochemist. He grew up as the youngestof three brothers on a farm in South Island, New Zealand, andwas the first student from his one-room school to attend university (B.Sc., OtagoUniversity, New Zealand, 1948; M.Sc. 1949; Ph.D. 1952).Early in his career, Fyfe's application of chemistry to geologicalresearch earned him a reputation as the "Father of ModernGeochemistry". He made important contributions to the knowledgeof isomorphism, studying the behaviour of rock forming mineralsunder high temperature and stress. His investigation of metamorphism- the chemical and physical transformation of rocks under pressureand stress at the base of mountain systems - revolutionized thefield of Metamorphic Petrology. While Dean of Science at University of WesternOntario (1986-90), he established the Interface Science ResearchCentre. Fyfe's Canadian research effort focused on the role offluids and tectonics in creating deposits of precious metals,particularly gold. He did research on a range of biosphere-geosphereinteractions, including the role of micro-organisms in concentratingmetals and the role of geothermal systems in creating ocean nutrients.Concerned with the environmentalimplications of human energy consumption, Fyfe conducted researchinto problems associated with the industrial exploitation of ligniticcoals. His knowledge of the geology of ancient rocks and the movementof fluids in the Earth's crust were key to research into the possibilityof safe geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes. As well,he devoted attention to the genesis and conservation of Earth'svulnerable fertile soils and the alarming current rate of soilerosion. He led the establishment of the Global Change program,a comprehensive international investigation of Earth's life-supportsystems.

This antigen is produced in tumors and fetal and embryonicgut, pancreas and liver cells, but not by normal adult cells.CEA enters the blood and thus a blood test or radioimmunoassaywas developed that can indicate the presence, spread or reoccurenceof cancer. The CEA assay has proved most useful in assessing theextent of a cancer, its growth rate and response to treatment,but not reliable in testing for the presence of tumors, sinceearly tumors do not produce enough CEA to be detected. The discoveryof CEA opened the new field of onco-fetal antigens. Recipient1982 Manning Principal Award, and Gairdner Award in 1978. Officerof the Order of Canada, 1978.

The University of Alberta chemistry professor is a leader in thedevelopment of miniature analytical systems. Micromachining techniquesare used to fabricate tiny three-dimensional structures that cancarry out chemical analyses on a piece of silicon a couple ofcentimetres square. The result is a "lab-on-a-chip."And the applications are diverse. They include immunological testsfor hormones and drugs of abuse, DNA diagnostics, tests for soiland water contamination, and detection of biological warfare agentson the battlefield. The small size of the devices would make testkits easily portable, a key advantage for military and environmentalapplications. As well, chemical analyses can be completed in seconds,virtually eliminating any anxious waiting for test results. Alab-on-a-chip also requires only a minute volume of test material-- about one billionth of a millilitre, a "speck" tonon-scientists. Perhaps most amazing are the detection limitsof these devices. They are capable of detecting picomolar concentrations-- that's like one Tylenol tablet dissolved in 12 Olympic-sizedswimming pools. "This is the sort of thing people react toby saying 'wow.'

His father was achemist. He majored in physics at McGill University, and then became interested inthe medical world. So he enrolled in McGill's medical school, without ever havingtaken a biology course. Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins in 1958, and teamed up withTorsten Wiesel from Sweden. The pair began to make key discoveries about the visualcortex almost immediately. A year later they moved to Harvard Medical School,continuing their experiments. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Hubel and Wieselco-authored a series of ground-breaking papers on the visual cortex. They usedmicroelectrodes and modern electronics to detect the activity of individual neurons,using cats as their subjects. (The cats were not harmed by these experiments; indeed,their purring created vibration problems.) They found that stimulation of cells onthe retina by light causes activity in particular cells in the striate cortex, wherecells are arranged in columns and layers. This cell activation is surprisinglyspecific: some cells respond to spots of light, others to lines whose tilt iscritical. Still others respond only to specific movements or to specific colours.Thanks to the work of Hubel and Wiesel, the visual cortex has become the best knownpart of the brain.

He tackled difficult mathematics since he wanted to know how anyonecould make assertions about the core temperatures of the sun. He entered theUniversity of Cape Town in 1949 and took courses in physics and mathematics, sincenone were offered in astronomy. Despite family difficulties, Israel completed hisM.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in one year. Israel went to Dublin and joined the DublinInstitute for Advanced Studies for two years. Then he moved to Edmonton, Alberta, in1958, since Max Wyman, a famous physicist, was there. Israel was the first to guess,and to make contributions toward proving, that Roy Kerr's new solution of Einstein'sfield equations were crucial to what became known as a black hole. Israel alsocontributed seminal papers on the thermofield dynamics of black holes and on thinshells of matter. His paper on filamentary structures anticipated cosmic stringtheory. He received the Izaak Walton Killam Prize in 1984.

"Our traditional understanding of superconductors,which were discovered in 1911, strongly suggests that superconductivityshouldn't exist above 30 degrees Absolute (-243 degrees Celsius),"explains Dr. Kallin. But "high-temperature" superconductivity(above 30 degrees Absolute) was discovered in 1986, and in subsequentyears the temperature escalated to the present record of 160 degreesAbsolute (-113 degrees Celsius).

After getting hisbachelors degree from the University of Minnesota (1957), Krebs came to Vancouver,BC, to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the world expert on lemmings.Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a Ph.D. (62) in Zoology from the University of BritishColumbia. Then, after a two-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home to teachZoology at Indiana University. But in 1970 Krebs returned toVancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC. Krebs hasspent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of lemmings and other smallNorthern mammals whose populations crash regularly every four to ten years. The KrebsEffect, also known as the Fence Effect, is named after Krebs. He simply fenced in anarea of grassland the size of a soccer field to see what would happen to thepopulation of voles living inside the fence. (The fence extends down into the soilseveral inches to stop tunneling.) Within a year, he found the population of volesincreased about 5 times. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated possiblereasons for the Fence Effect. Krebs now believes that the effect is due to socialbehaviour among the voles. This includes the natural genetic selection for moreaggressive individuals over time as living conditions become more crowded. The finalcrash seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babiesin neighbouring nests.

His book (co-authored with Paul Vitányi), AnIntroduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications,was the first comprehensive book in this field. It is used toteach graduate seminar courses all over the world.The power of Kolmogorov complexity is that itallows scientists to quantify the randomness of individual objectsin an objective and absolute manner. This is impossible usingclassical probability theory. For example, in computer scienceit is often necessary to determine how fast a certain programruns. Using conventional methods, this is very difficult becausethe program must be run with a large number of inputs, each resultanalyzed, and an average time arrived at. Using Kolmogorov complexity,only one input is needed to complete the analysis. In one areaof his current research (which also includes machine learningand computational biology), Dr. Li is extending the use of Kolmogorovcomplexity in the analysis of computer programs, DNA sequenceanalysis, physics and computation.

O. Hebbat McGill University, Melzack began to work with patients whosuffered from "phantom limb" pain, i.e. people who feelpain in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that painoften has little survival value, and some pains are entirely outof proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuinglong after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoralstudent, Melzack began collecting "pain words" and puttingthem into classes that belonged together, like "hot,""burning," "scalding," and "searing."In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the McGill PainQuestionnaire, now used in pain clinics and cancer hospices aroundthe world. Eventually Melzack with his colleague Patrick Walldeveloped the gate-control theory of pain at MIT in 1965, whichstates that pain is `gated' or modulated by past experience, i.e.perceiving a specific stimulus as pain is a decision of the nervoussystem. Gate-control theory led to the valuable discovery of endorphinsand enkephalins, the body's "natural opiates." Melzack'srecent research at McGill indicates that there are two types ofpain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathwaysin the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such asthe pain of cutting a finger, is transmittedby a group of pathways that Melzack calls the "lateral"system, because they pass through the brain stem on one side ofits central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic backpain, is transmitted by the "medial" system, whose neuronspass through the central core of the brain stem. Melzack is the author of TheChallengeof Pain (with Patrick Wall) 1982, 2nd ed. 1988, and Textbook of Pain(ed. with Wall) 1984, 2nd ed. 1989 and is co-editor of Handbook of PainAssessment, 1992.

Born in 1879, she grew up in Harrison Hot Springs, BC. She received herBA in 1904 and her MD in 1911 from the University of Toronto. She was ademonstrator of physiology in MacCallum's laboratory at the University ofToronto, but she had to leave Canada to pursue a career as a research scientist. In those days women were not allowed to do research in Canadianuniversities. She became a research fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, and aresearch fellow at Western Reserve University. Then she went tostudy in Berlin with LeonorMichaelis, and the Michaelis-Mentenequation was developed.This equation gives an expression for the rate of an enzyme reactionand became fundamental to the interpretation of how an enzyme reactson its substrate. Ultimately, Menten earned a Ph.D. in biochemistryat the University of Chicago. She later became a professor on thefaculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Inhistochemistry, her publication in 1944 of a new technique for thedemonstration of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase ushered in the newazo-dye method.

She earned money to attend university by teaching and enteredMacDonald College, McGill's agricultural school. She earned topmarks and won the Governor General's medal. Margaret decided tomajor in plant pathology (the study of plant diseases). She graduatedwith her BA in 1918, followed by her MA the next year. None ofthese achievements were easy; she had to fight for the same accessto the labs which male students had. Margaret's graduate workwas done in Minnesota and Saskatchewan with two wheat rust experts,Dr. E.C. Stakeman and Dr. W.P. Thompson. She received her Ph.D.in 1922, the first Canadian woman to receive a doctorate in agriculturalscience, and taught at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1925,Dr. Newton was appointed head of the new Dominion Rust ResearchLaboratory at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Newton became thebest-known Canadian expert in stem rust, a fungus which destroyswheat, and her work helped find ways to fight the disease. Croplosses, which had once been at least 30 million bushels, fellto almost nothing. She was the first graduate from an agriculturalcollege to be awarded the prestigious Flavelle Medal from theRoyal Society of Canada. She was also given the Outstanding AchievementAward from the University of Minnesota in 1956. In 1969, the Universityof Saskatchewan made her an honorary Doctor of Laws. She was forcedto retire in 1945 due to poor health. Dr. Newton died in Victoria,BC in 1971.

He got his B.Sc. at AcadiaUniversity, 1963 and B.Sc. (Honours), 1964, then his Ph.D. at NorthwesternUniversity,1968. He is currentlya professor of chemistry at Acadia University and is famous forsynthesizing RNA, important to many areas of medical research.He worked for 20 years before he achieved this goal at McGillUniversity in 1987. Synthesizing RNA could lead to breakthroughsin diseases caused by viruses. In medical research, the availabilityof synthetic RNA is making possible the development of new drugsthat were previously beyond the reach of science. These drugswill consist of RNA sequences tailor-made to attach to certaintypes of viruses and interfere with their ability to replicatethemselves. In 1980, he also invented the automated gene synthesizer,or "gene machine," which made it possible to build DNAsequences in a matter of hours rather than months, and which heused in the synthesis of RNA. The gene machine was manufacturedby Bio Logicals, Canada's first publicly traded biotechnologycompany, for which Ogilvie was a scientific consultant. He isthe author of 12 patents and a drug called Glanciclovir, whichfights the cytomegalovirus or CMV. He won the Buck-Whitney Medal in 1983, and theManning Principal award in 1991.

His chief accomplishments were thedevelopment and implementation of efficient numerical techniquesto solve the interacting time-dependent partial differential equationsthat govern the evolution of the atmosphere. Robert was the onlyscientist in the world between 1963 and 1970 to attempt to producemeteorological forecasts with a spectral model--and the semi-Lagrangianscheme, where he combined existing Lagrangian methods with hissemi-implicit scheme.In contrast to many scientists in this field who aim primarilyat improving accuracy, he always professed to devise efficientnumerical methods, that is to say, to attain a given degree ofprecision with the least amount of computation. The methods thathe developed are now used in models of the world's largest weatherprediction and climate research centres.

Smithwas offered a scholarship to a local private school called Arnold School. Eventuallyhe entered the honours chemistry program at Manchester University and got a statescholarship and completed a Ph.D. In 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver,Canada, Gobind Khorana, who had a position available to work on biologicallyimportant molecules with phosphates. Going to Vancouver turned out to be a very gooddecision, because in Khorana's lab Smith began learning the chemistry that would leadto the Nobel Prize in 1993. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slipa synthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into some DNA on oneside. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standard chemicals forbreaking and reforming DNA chains, but putting an Adenine molecule where there shouldbe a Guanine to create a mutation. It took Smith and his team many years of work toactually do it. In the process they had to learn new techniques, design new chemicalsand develop new chemical processes. One of the chemical methods developed by Smith isnow used in every modern automated gene synthesizer machine. Sources: personal interview Steacie, E.W.R. Pioneer researcher in chemical reactions; b.

She observedthat the medium the cells were in was hyaluronic acid, a substancethat tells cells when to move and when to stop. Her insight wasto relate this observation to the connection between RAS (a genethat can mutate into cancer) and RHAMM (the receptor that tellsthe mutant to grow), something most other biologists thought unlikely.She proved in 1995 that hyaluronic acid indeed affects the RHAMMreceptor site, and thus must play a key role in cancer cells.In a laboratory experiment with mice, Turley succeeded in gettingcancer cells to revert to normal.

Over five years she developeda new class of chemicals which absorb waste heat from industrialprocesses, and which can also be used to insulate homes. Duringthis time, Dr. White received funding from federal governmentagencies, such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering ResearchCouncil. Dr. White says her father, "a frustrated inventor",subtly encouraged her to pursue a career in science; her two olderbrothers also have science-related professions.

Assoc. Professor, Physics Dept., University of British Columbia, Vancouver,BC Dr. Whitehead began working on the light pipe after making a keydiscovery in 1978 while he was a University of British Columbia physics student(B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D., UBC (77,79,89)). He showedtheoretically that the `total internal reflection' effect usedin optical fibres could be harnessed in large hollow pipes, ifthey could be coated with precision, gem-like prisms. His researchon structured surface physics -- the study of interfaces containingprecision structures on a scale of 0.1 to 100 micrometers -- ledto the prism light guide. His system can make use either of sunlightor electric light as a source. He occupies UBC's new Chair inStructured Surface Physics, which was established by the NaturalSciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)and 3M Canada Inc. There, he and his colleagues in both the universityand BC industry continue physics research generating innovationsin lighting, image display technology, optics, electromagneticfilters and thin flexible sound sources. Recipient of 1984 ManningPrincipal Award and 1995 winner of the BC Science and EngineeringGold Medal in Industrial Innovation. He was CEO of TIR Systems Ltd. 1983-93.

March 18th, 1869, St. Andrew's East, Quebec d. September 2nd,1940 Pathologist Maude Abbott won a scholarship to McGill University, Montreal,in her senior year of high school. She earned her BA and thendecided to study medicine. McGill at that time did not allow womento enter its medical program, so Maude attended Bishop's Collegeand became a doctor in 1894. In 1897, she wrote a successful paperon heart murmurs, but a male friend had to present it for hersince women were not admitted to the Montreal medical societywhere she was to read her paper. In 1898 Maude was appointed curatorof McGill's Medical Museum. Here she began cataloguing specimensand became interested in pathology, the study of disease. Shefocused her studies on heart disease and began work on her book,The Atlas of Congenital Cardiac Disease, in which she describedher new classification system. In 1923 she became Chief of Pathologyat a woman's medical college in Pennsylvania. In 1926 Maude returnedto McGill in Canada, where she pioneered the use of museum exhibitsas teaching aids. She also wrote a history of nursing which waslater used in nursing schools across the country. In 1936 heratlas was published and was praised as an important addition tomedical knowledge. She was also made an honorary member of theall-male Osler Society, named after Sir William Osler,a famous pathologist who had encouraged Maude in her studies.On September 2nd, 1940, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage anddied shortly after, at the age of 71.

Nerve cells do not die immediately when damagedbut may survive even for months. This survival provides opportunityfor healing, under the right conditions, such as the envelopingpresence of Schwann cells (support cells that provide structureand insulation). Although actual cures of serious injuries havenot yet been achieved, more recent research with the optic nervesindicates some recovery of function. He has been president ofthe Society for Neuroscience, and is head of neurology and neuroscienceat Montreal General Hospital as well as head of a major centerof excellence known for studies of regeneration by neurons inthe brain.

Sources: Canadian Who's Who, 1993 Altman, Sidney Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989 for discovery of catalytic RNA b. May 8, 1939-Montreal, Quebec Sterling Professor of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut Sid Altman grew up in Montreal but through a twist of fate attended MIT where hereceived a B.Sc. in Physics. He then studied molecular biology under Lerman at theUniversity of Colorado Medical School. Lerman helped arrange for Altman to go toEngland to work in the laboratory of S. Brenner and F. Crick. While there, in 1970,Altman discovered an unusual enzyme involved in the transcription of DNA intoprotein. He then moved to Yale University where his continued research showed thatthe active part of the enzyme consisted of RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). This wassignificant because RNA molecules are much more primitive than protein molecules.Besides offering a possible explanation for how life might have begun billions ofyears before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesomeprimitive life form: the virus for the common cold which is based on RNA. It may bepossible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold viruses by chopping upthe RNA on which they are based. Altman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry,1989; Rosenstiel Award for Basic Biomedical Research, 1989; National Institutes ofHealth Merit Award, 1989; and Yale Science and Engineering Assn.

Sources: Who's Who in America, 1994 Banting, Sir Frederick Grant Successfully isolated insulin and received the Nobel Prize 14 Nov 1891, Alliston, Ontario-d. 21 Feb 1941 Medical doctor University of Toronto Frederick Banting was born the son of a farmer. He became a doctorand studied diabetes, a fatal disease. He and his colleague CharlesBestdiscovered a hormone, called insulin, that helped people sufferingfrom diabetes live a normal life. Banting studied medicine atthe University of Toronto. He obtained his medical degree in 1916 andserved for the remainder of WW I as a medical officer overseas.He was awarded the Military Cross for heroism under fire. Bantinglater became interested in diabetes mellitus, a disease whichat that time meant a slow but certain death. Its chief biochemicalsymptom is the presence of abnormally high glucose levels in theblood, and the appearance of glucose in the urine. It had alreadybeen proposed that a hormone produced by small patches of cellscalled the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas gland might preventdiabetes. The research of Banting and his colleague Best resultedin a way to isolate the hormone, called insulin, and extract itfor the use of those suffering from diabetes. The experimentswere completed in 1922, and in 1923 Banting was awarded the NobelPrize. Outraged that his co-worker had not also been awarded theprize, he gave half his share to Best. The Banting Research Foundationwas established by Canadian Parliament that same year. With thecoming of WW II, Banting was again involved with medical war workand died in a plane crash over Newfoundland.

He had a Summer home in NovaScotia but was never a Canadian. For a scientist to qualify asCanadian, the simple rule is: they must have held Canadian citizenshipwhen they did their most distinguished work. We include him here because many people consider him Canadian. Throughout his life Bellwas interested in the education of deaf people. Among his mostfamous students was Helen Keller. His work with hearing and speechled to his most famous invention, the telephone, in 1876. Althoughthe first phone conversation took place in the US, Bell said hedeveloped the idea in 1875 in Brantford, Ontario. It is certainthat many of his early experiments were conducted there, includingthe first long distance telephone call, between Brantford andParis, Ontario. He also invented the microphone. The Bell TelephoneCompany and other related businesses made Bell a wealthy man,and he was able to pursue a wide range of scientific interests.He spent his winters in the US on business, and summers in CapeBreton Island, Nova Scotia, on scientific research, which rangedfrom the genetics of sheep breeding to aviation. His Silver Dartaircraft was the first to fly in Canada, in 1909, and his hydrofoilspeed boats held the world record for more than 10 years. Belldied of diabetes in 1922, ironically the same year that Bantingdiscoveredinsulin. It is doubtful that he ever became a Canadian citizen.

Boyle's majorcontributions include the first continuously operating ruby laser, which he inventedwith Don Nelson in 1962, and the first patent (with David Thomas) proposing asemiconductor injection laser. Also in 1962 he became director of Space Science andExploratory Studies at Bellcomm, a Bell subsidiary providing technological supportfor the Apollo space program. In 1964 he returned to Bell Labs, switching fromresearch to the development of electronic devices, particularly integrated circuits,which are now essential building blocks in telecommunications and electronics ingeneral. In 1969, Boyle and George Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD).CCDs can be used as imaging devices, memories, filters and signal processors. Theyhave revolutionized astronomy (the Hubble Space Telescope uses CCDs at its primefocus) and created entirely new industries (e.g., filmless video cameras). For thisinvention, Boyle and Smith were joint recipients of the Franklin Institute's StuartBallantine Medal in 1973, and of IEEE's 1974 Morris Liebmann Award.

Years later, Chang,while still an undergraduate at McGill, invented the world's firstartificial cell in 1957. His idea was to make tiny, ultrathinplastic microcapsules that could hold biological agents (suchas enzymes). If he could control the permeability of the plasticmembrane, he could control what passed through the wall of hisartificial cell, and thus mimic many of the functions of realcells.

March 13, 1934, Tokyo Professor and cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Montreal GeneralHospital Research Institute Dr. Ray Chiu was born in Tokyo. He received his MD from NationalTaiwan University, and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1970, in ExperimentalSurgery. He pioneered a new type of experimental surgery thatremoves some of a heart patient's back muscle, attaches it tothe ribs, and wraps it around the heart. A specially designed pacemaker contractsthe back muscle in time with the heart's own contractions, thushelping a weak heart to function. Chiu was the first to overcome the physiological obstacles tousing other types of muscles to assist the heart's function. Heartmuscle is the only kind that can contract regularly without tiring;other muscles require periods of rest. Thus the physiologicaland chemical factors of the back muscle have to be modified tobecome more like the heart. Collaborating with David Inuzzo, abiochemist of York University, Chiu subjected the latissimus dorsimuscle with four to six weeks of constant low frequency electricalstimulation, after which it came to resemble the heart muscle.The stimulation alters the expression of certain genes in themuscle cells. The process was actually discovered by biochemistsin the late 60s, but was not applied to heart surgery until theresearch came to the attention of cardiac surgeons in the lastdecade.

Costerton was a Universityof Calgary postdoctoral student in 1978 when he shook up the establishedscience of microbiology with a new view of bacterial life. He and his team workedouta way to see the structure of the slimy substance that seemedto anchor bacteria to surfaces in cattle stomachs. When they tookthe bacteria into the lab and "purified" them, they became justlike ordinary bacteria. It became obvious that test-tube bacteriaare not the same as in life. Natural bacterial colonies were creatingtheir own microhabitat, adhering to surfaces and covering themselveswith a slimy protective layer of molecules Costerton dubbed "matrix-enclosedbiofilms." The researchers also found that biofilm bacteriawere often team players, different species working in physiologicalco-operation. Biofilms also survive under conditionsthat floaters (individual bacteria released as scoutsfrom the biofilms themselves) can't; it takes up to 50 times the bactericide tokill an attached slime population as it does to kill floaters.Costerton and his team have applied their knowledge to developingnew technologies in areas ranging from oil production to bacteria-resistantmedical devices.

Geochemistry and global change 4 June 1927-Ashburn, New Zealand Geochemist; professor emeritus, retired Department of Geology, University of Western Ontario William S. Fyfe is Canada's foremost earth scientist, widely consideredthe world's most eminent geochemist. He grew up as the youngestof three brothers on a farm in South Island, New Zealand, andwas the first student from his one-room school to attend university (B.Sc., OtagoUniversity, New Zealand, 1948; M.Sc. 1949; Ph.D. 1952).Early in his career, Fyfe's application of chemistry to geologicalresearch earned him a reputation as the "Father of ModernGeochemistry". He made important contributions to the knowledgeof isomorphism, studying the behaviour of rock forming mineralsunder high temperature and stress. His investigation of metamorphism- the chemical and physical transformation of rocks under pressureand stress at the base of mountain systems - revolutionized thefield of Metamorphic Petrology. While Dean of Science at University of WesternOntario (1986-90), he established the Interface Science ResearchCentre. Fyfe's Canadian research effort focused on the role offluids and tectonics in creating deposits of precious metals,particularly gold. He did research on a range of biosphere-geosphereinteractions, including the role of micro-organisms in concentratingmetals and the role of geothermal systems in creating ocean nutrients.Concerned with the environmentalimplications of human energy consumption, Fyfe conducted researchinto problems associated with the industrial exploitation of ligniticcoals. His knowledge of the geology of ancient rocks and the movementof fluids in the Earth's crust were key to research into the possibilityof safe geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes. As well,he devoted attention to the genesis and conservation of Earth'svulnerable fertile soils and the alarming current rate of soilerosion. He led the establishment of the Global Change program,a comprehensive international investigation of Earth's life-supportsystems. He was awarded the Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, NSERC, in1991.

Director, McGill's Cancer Centre, Montreal, Quebec. Phil Gold and Samuel Freedman discovered in 1965 a carcinoembryonicantigen (CEA), produced during growth of cancer cells of the digestivesystem. This antigen is produced in tumors and fetal and embryonicgut, pancreas and liver cells, but not by normal adult cells.CEA enters the blood and thus a blood test or radioimmunoassaywas developed that can indicate the presence, spread or reoccurenceof cancer. The CEA assay has proved most useful in assessing theextent of a cancer, its growth rate and response to treatment,but not reliable in testing for the presence of tumors, sinceearly tumors do not produce enough CEA to be detected. The discoveryof CEA opened the new field of onco-fetal antigens. Recipient1982 Manning Principal Award, and Gairdner Award in 1978. Officerof the Order of Canada, 1978.

The University of Alberta chemistry professor is a leader in thedevelopment of miniature analytical systems. Micromachining techniquesare used to fabricate tiny three-dimensional structures that cancarry out chemical analyses on a piece of silicon a couple ofcentimetres square. The result is a "lab-on-a-chip."And the applications are diverse. They include immunological testsfor hormones and drugs of abuse, DNA diagnostics, tests for soiland water contamination, and detection of biological warfare agentson the battlefield. The small size of the devices would make testkits easily portable, a key advantage for military and environmentalapplications. As well, chemical analyses can be completed in seconds,virtually eliminating any anxious waiting for test results. Alab-on-a-chip also requires only a minute volume of test material-- about one billionth of a millilitre, a "speck" tonon-scientists. Perhaps most amazing are the detection limitsof these devices. They are capable of detecting picomolar concentrations-- that's like one Tylenol tablet dissolved in 12 Olympic-sizedswimming pools. "This is the sort of thing people react toby saying 'wow.' Well, I feel that way too," says Dr. Harrison."This field is opening up in front of our eyes. It is veryexciting to push the limits in miniaturization, speed and detection.I love it."

His father was achemist. He majored in physics at McGill University, and then became interested inthe medical world. So he enrolled in McGill's medical school, without ever havingtaken a biology course. Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins in 1958, and teamed up withTorsten Wiesel from Sweden. The pair began to make key discoveries about the visualcortex almost immediately. A year later they moved to Harvard Medical School,continuing their experiments. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Hubel and Wieselco-authored a series of ground-breaking papers on the visual cortex. They usedmicroelectrodes and modern electronics to detect the activity of individual neurons,using cats as their subjects. (The cats were not harmed by these experiments; indeed,their purring created vibration problems.) They found that stimulation of cells onthe retina by light causes activity in particular cells in the striate cortex, wherecells are arranged in columns and layers. This cell activation is surprisinglyspecific: some cells respond to spots of light, others to lines whose tilt iscritical. Still others respond only to specific movements or to specific colours.Thanks to the work of Hubel and Wiesel, the visual cortex has become the best knownpart of the brain.

Despite family difficulties, Israel completed hisM.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in one year. Israel went to Dublin and joined the DublinInstitute for Advanced Studies for two years. Then he moved to Edmonton, Alberta, in1958, since Max Wyman, a famous physicist, was there. Israel was the first to guess,and to make contributions toward proving, that Roy Kerr's new solution of Einstein'sfield equations were crucial to what became known as a black hole. Israel alsocontributed seminal papers on the thermofield dynamics of black holes and on thinshells of matter. His paper on filamentary structures anticipated cosmic stringtheory.

But "high-temperature" superconductivity(above 30 degrees Absolute) was discovered in 1986, and in subsequentyears the temperature escalated to the present record of 160 degreesAbsolute (-113 degrees Celsius).

After getting hisbachelors degree from the University of Minnesota (1957), Krebs came to Vancouver,BC, to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the world expert on lemmings.Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a Ph.D. (62) in Zoology from the University of BritishColumbia. Then, after a two-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home to teachZoology at Indiana University. But in 1970 Krebs returned toVancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC. Krebs hasspent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of lemmings and other smallNorthern mammals whose populations crash regularly every four to ten years. The KrebsEffect, also known as the Fence Effect, is named after Krebs. He simply fenced in anarea of grassland the size of a soccer field to see what would happen to thepopulation of voles living inside the fence. (The fence extends down into the soilseveral inches to stop tunneling.) Within a year, he found the population of volesincreased about 5 times. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated possiblereasons for the Fence Effect. Krebs now believes that the effect is due to socialbehaviour among the voles. This includes the natural genetic selection for moreaggressive individuals over time as living conditions become more crowded. The finalcrash seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babiesin neighbouring nests.

Heearned his Ph.D. at McGill University, Canada, in 1942. In 1946, Leblondwith L. F. Bélanger improved the resolution of radioautography.Photographic emulsion was melted and poured on the tissue sectionso as to make a thin coat that hardened as it cooled and actedas a photographic plate to the radioactive parts of the tissuesection. The method became widely utilized as a tool in cell studyand is now used in the electron microscope. The method can tracethe activity of substances in the body. Leblond's own experimentschallenged much of established cell theory at that time. For example,he demonstrated that cells are continuously active, and do notalternate between repose and activity, as was thought.

He went to the University of Alberta, andgot his B.Sc. in Honours Chemistry. His teacher of Organic Chemistry was ReubenSandin, who inspired Lemieux to pursue this subject. Later he got his Ph.D. fromMcGill University in Organic Chemistry. He took his postdoctoral studies with M. L.Wolfrom at Ohio State University, studying the degradation of streptomycin. Lemieuxfirst achieved fame for the synthesis of sucrose. His second major contribution waspioneering work on configurational determination by NMR spectroscopy. He invented theolefin cleaving reagent with von Rudloff in 1955, as well as many other reagents inhis career. He has also done important work with antibiotics, and started a couple ofresearch companies, including Chembiomed Ltd. with the University of Alberta. In1973, he began his famous work on the synthesis of human blood group determinants,and in 1975 published the first synthesis of the B human system trisaccharide. Helater synthesized the carbohydrate sequences for six different blood groupdeterminants. These achievements are important to the chemistry of immunology.Lemieux's current work deals with molecular recognition in biological processes. Hehas received numerous awards, including the Albert Einstein World Award in Science in1992 and the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1985.

His book (co-authored with Paul Vitányi), AnIntroduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications,was the first comprehensive book in this field. It is used toteach graduate seminar courses all over the world.The power of Kolmogorov complexity is that itallows scientists to quantify the randomness of individual objectsin an objective and absolute manner. This is impossible usingclassical probability theory. For example, in computer scienceit is often necessary to determine how fast a certain programruns. Using conventional methods, this is very difficult becausethe program must be run with a large number of inputs, each resultanalyzed, and an average time arrived at. Using Kolmogorov complexity,only one input is needed to complete the analysis. In one areaof his current research (which also includes machine learningand computational biology), Dr. Li is extending the use of Kolmogorovcomplexity in the analysis of computer programs, DNA sequenceanalysis, physics and computation. Others are following his lead.Recipientof 1996 Steacie Memorial Fellowship Sources: NSERC Ling, Victor Medical Biophysicist--discovered membrane transport protein P-glycoprotein. Vice President of British Columbia Cancer Research Center, and Assistant Dean of theFaculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia. Dr Ling's 1974 discovery of P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrugresistant gene (MDR) made him world famous. It is now known that P-glycoprotein isnot onlyimportant clinically, as it confers multidrug resistance in many cancers, it is alsovery important in basic research, as it has been found to protect the brain fromcytotoxic substances. P-Glycoprotein is the first protein discovered in humans thatbelongs to a group of membrane transport proteins called the ATP Binding Cassette(ABC). ABC is very important in maintaining normal cell functions. Mutations in thisgroup of proteins causes many well known diseases. One example is the cystic fibrosistransmembrane regulator (CFTR), which is responsible for cystic fibrosis. Dr Ling has won many international awards including the 1990 Gairder award, the 1991General Motors Cancer Research Foundation award, the Kettering Prize, the 1991 Joseph Steiner Cancer Research award, and the 1993 AmericanAssociation of Cancer Research(AACR scientific award.

O. Hebbat McGill University, Melzack began to work with patients whosuffered from "phantom limb" pain, i.e. people who feelpain in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that painoften has little survival value, and some pains are entirely outof proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuinglong after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoralstudent, Melzack began collecting "pain words" and puttingthem into classes that belonged together, like "hot,""burning," "scalding," and "searing."In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the McGill PainQuestionnaire, now used in pain clinics and cancer hospices aroundthe world. Eventually Melzack with his colleague Patrick Walldeveloped the gate-control theory of pain at MIT in 1965, whichstates that pain is `gated' or modulated by past experience, i.e.perceiving a specific stimulus as pain is a decision of the nervoussystem. Gate-control theory led to the valuable discovery of endorphinsand enkephalins, the body's "natural opiates." Melzack'srecent research at McGill indicates that there are two types ofpain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathwaysin the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such asthe pain of cutting a finger, is transmittedby a group of pathways that Melzack calls the "lateral"system, because they pass through the brain stem on one side ofits central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic backpain, is transmitted by the "medial" system, whose neuronspass through the central core of the brain stem. Melzack is the author of TheChallengeof Pain (with Patrick Wall) 1982, 2nd ed. 1988, and Textbook of Pain(ed. with Wall) 1984, 2nd ed. 1989 and is co-editor of Handbook of PainAssessment, 1992.

Born in 1879, she grew up in Harrison Hot Springs, BC. She received herBA in 1904 and her MD in 1911 from the University of Toronto. She was ademonstrator of physiology in MacCallum's laboratory at the University ofToronto, but she had to leave Canada to pursue a career as a research scientist. In those days women were not allowed to do research in Canadianuniversities. She became a research fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, and aresearch fellow at Western Reserve University. Then she went tostudy in Berlin with LeonorMichaelis, and the Michaelis-Mentenequation was developed.This equation gives an expression for the rate of an enzyme reactionand became fundamental to the interpretation of how an enzyme reactson its substrate. Ultimately, Menten earned a Ph.D. in biochemistryat the University of Chicago. She later became a professor on thefaculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Inhistochemistry, her publication in 1944 of a new technique for thedemonstration of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase ushered in the newazo-dye method.

She earned money to attend university by teaching and enteredMacDonald College, McGill's agricultural school. She earned topmarks and won the Governor General's medal. Margaret decided tomajor in plant pathology (the study of plant diseases). She graduatedwith her BA in 1918, followed by her MA the next year. None ofthese achievements were easy; she had to fight for the same accessto the labs which male students had. Margaret's graduate workwas done in Minnesota and Saskatchewan with two wheat rust experts,Dr. E.C. Stakeman and Dr. W.P. Thompson. She received her Ph.D.in 1922, the first Canadian woman to receive a doctorate in agriculturalscience, and taught at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1925,Dr. Newton was appointed head of the new Dominion Rust ResearchLaboratory at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Newton became thebest-known Canadian expert in stem rust, a fungus which destroyswheat, and her work helped find ways to fight the disease. Croplosses, which had once been at least 30 million bushels, fellto almost nothing. She was the first graduate from an agriculturalcollege to be awarded the prestigious Flavelle Medal from theRoyal Society of Canada. She was also given the Outstanding AchievementAward from the University of Minnesota in 1956. In 1969, the Universityof Saskatchewan made her an honorary Doctor of Laws.

He is currentlya professor of chemistry at Acadia University and is famous forsynthesizing RNA, important to many areas of medical research.He worked for 20 years before he achieved this goal at McGillUniversity in 1987. Synthesizing RNA could lead to breakthroughsin diseases caused by viruses. In medical research, the availabilityof synthetic RNA is making possible the development of new drugsthat were previously beyond the reach of science. These drugswill consist of RNA sequences tailor-made to attach to certaintypes of viruses and interfere with their ability to replicatethemselves. In 1980, he also invented the automated gene synthesizer,or "gene machine," which made it possible to build DNAsequences in a matter of hours rather than months, and which heused in the synthesis of RNA. The gene machine was manufacturedby Bio Logicals, Canada's first publicly traded biotechnologycompany, for which Ogilvie was a scientific consultant.

His university educationwas at Laval University (B.Sc., 1952), the University of Toronto(M.Sc., 1953) and McGill University (Ph.D., 1965).He started his career as a weather forecaster with the MeteorologicalService of Canada, but in 1959 transferred to research where hewas engaged in the development of atmospheric models for shortand medium-range forecasts. His chief accomplishments were thedevelopment and implementation of efficient numerical techniquesto solve the interacting time-dependent partial differential equationsthat govern the evolution of the atmosphere. Robert was the onlyscientist in the world between 1963 and 1970 to attempt to producemeteorological forecasts with a spectral model--and the semi-Lagrangianscheme, where he combined existing Lagrangian methods with hissemi-implicit scheme.In contrast to many scientists in this field who aim primarilyat improving accuracy, he always professed to devise efficientnumerical methods, that is to say, to attain a given degree ofprecision with the least amount of computation. The methods thathe developed are now used in models of the world's largest weatherprediction and climate research centres.

He became a philosopherof science (BA, University of Bristol, 1962; MA, McMaster University, 1964; Ph.D.,University of Bristol,1970), and is known for his numerous books on the philosophyof biology, particularly Darwin's theory of evolution, including "Molecules toMen" 1990; "The Darwinian Paradigm" 1989; "Taking Darwin Seriously"1986 (also issued in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish); and "Is Science Sexist?"1981. He hastried to define what constitutes the difference between scienceand pseudo-science, and was called to testify as an expert witnesson that topic in the celebrated "creationism trial"in Arkansas in the 1980s. His testimony was probably an importantfactor in the judge's decision on a definition of science. Sources: Canadian Who's Who, 1993; Timothy J.

Briefly a professor of chemistry,he studied music and teaching of voice for nine years until hisfather, William Saunders, appointed him to the Experimental FarmsService as experimentalist (1903-22 ). There he developed Marquis, the strainthat made Canada famous for its hard red spring wheat, which maturesearly, produces high volume, and is excellent for bread. Saunders also applied hissingle-line methods tobarley, oats, peas, beans and flax and introduced several newexcellent varieties of each kind of crop. In 1922,Saunders' health broke down and he moved to Paris where he studiedFrench literature for 3 years. He was knighted in 1934.

His controversial theory, General AdaptationSyndrome, was based on much experimentation with rats. He said"stress plays some role in the development of every disease."Failure to cope with "stressors" (any stimuli) can resultin "diseases of adaptation" (ulcers, high blood pressure,etc.).

April 26, 1932, Blackpool, England University Killam Professor, Peter Wall Distinguished Professor of Biotechnology Biotechnology Laboratory, University of BC, Vancouver, BC Michael Smith was born into a working-class family in Blackpool, England. Smithwas offered a scholarship to a local private school called Arnold School. Eventuallyhe entered the honours chemistry program at Manchester University and got a statescholarship and completed a Ph.D. In 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver,Canada, Gobind Khorana, who had a position available to work on biologicallyimportant molecules with phosphates. Going to Vancouver turned out to be a very gooddecision, because in Khorana's lab Smith began learning the chemistry that would leadto the Nobel Prize in 1993. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slipa synthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into some DNA on oneside. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standard chemicals forbreaking and reforming DNA chains, but putting an Adenine molecule where there shouldbe a Guanine to create a mutation. It took Smith and his team many years of work toactually do it. In the process they had to learn new techniques, design new chemicalsand develop new chemical processes. One of the chemical methods developed by Smith isnow used in every modern automated gene synthesizer machine. Sources: personal interview Steacie, E.W.R. Pioneer researcher in chemical reactions; b.

He extended his research into photochemistry and chemicalkinetics after joining the NRC as Director of the Division ofChemistry in 1939. He played a leading role in British-Canadiancollaboration in atomic energy, which led to the constructionof the Chalk River reactor, the first to be built outside theUS. Later Steacie became Vice-President of NRC in 1950, thenpresident two years later. He is perhaps best known as an administratorand statesman of science for Canada, since he was very instrumentalin building up university research in Canada and was the architectof enduring programs to support industrial innovation.

He has no job prospects and he has little to show for a year of work in Francis Crick's laboratoryin Cambridge, England. Crick was the co-discoverer of DNA, themolecule that encodes the genetic information that tellscells how to function and grow. It's an incredible honour forAltman to be invited to this famous laboratory. The year is 1970, an unusually warm June day. At the moment, this laboratoryis probably the best place in the world for geneticresearch, but Altman has only two weeks left before he mustleave. And he has no idea where he will go or what he will do next. Altman is working on mutant cellswith malfunctioning t-RNA (transfer Ribonucleic Acid)--asubstance that is part of the machinery in a cell that decodesinstructions in DNA. For about the thousandth time, Altmanpicks up a thin layer of gel on a glass plate. But this one is special. Altman was trying a new experiment, something no one hadever tried before. If he could just isolate a special type of RNAcalled precursor-RNA it would explain everything else. After putting a few drops of material prepared fromthe mutant cells onto the gel, Altman places the plate intoa strong electric field--a standard technique for separatingchemical compounds called electrophoresis. Different compoundsmove across the gel at different speeds because of the electricfield. Altman waits several hours, and then lays photographicfilm on top of the gel. Tiny amounts of radioactive tracer atomsin the RNA emit X-rays that will leave characteristic bands on thefilm. With a friend, Altman takes this latest piece of film into thedarkroom to develop it. Within minutes the two young scientistsboth see it. It's just a white splotch on the negativebut it gives Altman one overwhelming thought, "Now I know I canultimately get a job." He had taken the first step in a long series of experiments that would ultimately lead to thediscovery of catalytic RNA. Altman was hired for one more year in Crick's lab, then became abiology professor at Yale University in USA. His discoveries over the next two decades have resulted in a Nobel prizeand could possibly even lead to a cure for the common cold. He is still working on aspects of the same molecular biologysystem today. HistorySidney Altman grew up in the NDG suburb of Montreal.As a boy he loved books. He liked sports and writing, too, butthe library was one of hisfavourite places. He read everything: novels, sports books, andscience. His parents could always find the money if he wantedto buy books. "I read everything I could get my hands on," says Altman. He spent a lot of time alone in his room reading. When he was 12 years old someone gave him a book called "ExplainingThe Atom" by Selig Hecht. The book showed Altman thepower of science to predict things. From then on he was a confirmed scientist. "I wasn't interested in Biology at the time. I liked nuclear physics,"says Altman. One saturday afternoon while Altman was still in high-school afriend of his said, "Why don't you come with me to McGill. I'mgoing to take the American SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests)." These tests are a required part of any application to an Americanuniversity. Altman always thought he would go to McGill forUniversity, but on a whim he wrote the SAT tests that afternoonwith his friend. They both applied to MIT (Massachusetts Instituteof Technology) and as it turned out, Altman got in but his frienddid not. Altman's family had to scramble to get the money together to send him to this great American school, and he wasn't even surehe wanted to go. There was a big debate in the Altman household. But Altman says, "Within three weeks at MIT I knewI wanted to stay." He was impressed by the high caliber of theother students and he really enjoyed living away from home.At MIT he received a BSc. Then he: Went to the University of Colorado medical school where he gota PhD in Molecular Biology and met Leonard Lerman. Lerman introduced Altman to Francis Crick & S. Brenner in England. Altman won a fellowship to work in Crick & Brenner's lab. There, he made early discoveries that lead to the principle of Catalytic RNA. Came back to USA and became a professor at Yale University. The Science Molecular biologists study the thousands of chemical reactionsthat go on inside cells to create and sustain life. Altman specializes in thechemical processes involved in copying information from DNA andusing it to make proteins, the building blocks of cells. Information is copied from DNA (Deoxy-riboNucleic Acid) by a molecule called RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). DNA and RNA are long twisty chain-like molecules. Actually, there are about six different types of RNAinvolved in the transcription process. In Crick's lab, around 1970, Altman was investigating part of this complex process. He discovered an enzyme called "RNase P"that chops a little "tail" off the end of an intermediate molecule of RNA called "precursor-tRNA". Enzymes are special protein moleculesthat make chemical reactions go faster--a process called "catalysis".They usually do this by holding orbending a target molecule in a certain way so that one of itschemical bonds breaks more easily. It took about a decade, butAltman eventually discovered that the enzyme he was after was not youraverage enzyme. Instead of being a protein likeall other enzymes, it was made of two parts--one strand of RNA and one protein. Furthermore it was the RNA portion that provided the catalysis. This was a significant discovery because RNA molecules are muchmore primitive than protein molecules. Besides offering an explanation for how life might have begun billions of years agobefore proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesomeprimitive life form: the virus for the common cold. It may bepossible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill coldviruses by chopping up the RNA on which they are based. A 3D model of M1 RNA, the catalytic RNA molecule that Altman discovered. 1. The t-RNA precursor molecule whose "tail" is chopped off by the catalytic RNA. 2. The arrow points to the site of cleavage where the t-RNA moleculeis severed. (Model produced with DRAWNA software by Eric Westhof, Institut de BiologieMol�culaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Strasbourg, France.) Mystery Altman feels that perhaps the biggest mystery to be solved by the nextgeneration will be the understanding of the human brain.

The Story On an ordinary Wednesday morning in October 1994 Bert Brockhousegets out of bed at his usual time--about 6:45. He stretches a bitto loosen the overnight aches of his 76-year-old body when he seesthe little red light blinking on the answering machine on the FAX line. Who could have called in the middle of the night, he thinks, as hegoes over to press the play button. He listens to a voice announcingitself from Stockholm saying, "B. N. Brockhouse and C. G. Shull havebeen selected as recipients of the 1994 Nobel prize for physics."Brockhouse is stunned. For a moment he thinks, "Oh that's interesting,"but then he realizes, "I AM B. N. Brockhouse," and he calls his wifeDorrie, to listen the tape again with him. The rest of the day is filled with phone calls, telegrams and interviews.The next year, one of travel, awards, banquets, and lectures. In short Brockhouse had come out of retirement. In his annual Christmas letter to friends that year, after describing all thefestivities in Stockholm, Brockhouse says, "If anyone cares,we got a new car in the Summer, a Chrysler Neon." Brockhouse's Nobel prize can be traced back to 1951. Fresh out ofthe University of Toronto with a PhD in Physics, Brockhouse satat his desk in a faded blue-shingled wartimehut at Chalk River, Ontario, home of Canada's Atomic EnergyProject for the National Research Council. He gazed out the window at the snow. It was Winter, but hefelt warm inside the hut. He just sat there thinking, mullingthings over in his mind. The other night he had been athis boss's house, Donald Hurst, head of the Neutron Spectrometersection. They had been reading a 1944 paper about neutrons--subatomic particles with no electric charge that, together withprotons made up the nucleus of an atom. The existence of neutronshad only been verified about 20 years before. Not much wasknown about them. Brockhouse didn't quite understand the theoriesin the paper, but he felt it had a lot of interesting ideas.He was supposed to be working on something else, but couldn't stop thinking about the concepts in the paper and how hecould do experiments at Chalk River to try out some of the newtheories in the laboratory. He fiddled with some math on his notepad for a while and thenwent to the coffee room. As he passed the lab that housedthe radioactive nuclear pile, one of the most powerful sourcesof neutrons in the world at the time, he wondered how hecould use the tools at hand, or if he'd have to make new tools.In the coffee room he met Hurst. Brockhouse went up to the blackboard and said, "Don there's something I'd like to showyou." He sketched out some equations on the blackboard.The math described a device they couldbuild that would use a neutron beam as a kind of flashlightthat could look into the mysteries of crystalline structuresand other solids. Metals, minerals, gems, and rocks. Brockhouse went on to solve problems of controlling the sourceof the neutron beam; limiting it to neutrons of only one energy;eliminating background radiation from other experiments in thelab; and problems with the sensitivity of the detectors.The resulting Triple-Axis Neutron Spectrometer is now used worldwide to investigate crystal structures. History Bert Brockhouse was born in Lethbridge, Alberta in 1918, but in the 1920sthe family moved to Vancouver. They operated a rooming housein Vancouver's West End. Bert had a paper route to help supplementthe family income. He liked fishing and went withhis buddies to catch cod and salmon off the pier at English Bay. Hefooled around with radios a lot, hanging out at radio repair shops andmaking home-made radios from designs in popular electronicsmagazines. After high-school, instead of going to University,Brockhouse worked as a radio repair man. Then World War II came alongand his radio skills came in handy as an electronics technician inthe Canadian Naval Reserve. Brockhouse went to the University of BritishColumbia after the war, majored in Math and Physics, gettinga BSc with honours (1947). He then did his PhD at the Universityof Toronto (1950), moving to Chalk River shortly afterwards.Brockhouse spent his working life as a researcher at Chalk Riverperfecting neutron spectroscopes and their applications. Regarding his current work, he speaks cryptically of "The Grand Atlas", a sort of rulebookfor nature incorporating theories both physical and metaphysical. The Science Brockhouse is an experimentalist in the Physics of Solids like metalsand crystals. It's called Solid State Physics. As his tool he uses aNeutron Spectrometer that he developed at Chalk River. According to Brockhouse, the virtue of neutrons is you can say a greatdeal about a material by using a neutron beam. Imagine shining the beamof a flashlight on an object. Your concept of that object is based onthe light reflected from it. But when the object gets down to theatomic level, the light from the flashlight's beam is "too big". Thewavelength (or energy) of ordinary light is about 7000 Angstroms (oneAngstrom is the width of a hydrogen nucleus), while the wavelength of aneutron beam is around 1 - 4 Angstroms. In other words, your beam ofneutron "light" can penetrate to see details thousands of timesfiner. 1. The original triple axis spectrometer (1959). The bank of 52 rotaryswitches in the upper centre of the picture could be preset to gothrough an energy scan of up to 26 points. A feature of Brockhouse'sspectrometer was the way you could vary three angles: the direction ofthe neutron beam, the position of the specimen, and the angle of thedetector. Add to this the ability to vary the energy of the incomingneutrons and the sensitivity of the detector and you have a Nobel prizewinning creation. (Photo, courtesy of AECL) 2. Monochromating Crystal. A special crystal of salt (NaCl) was used toseparate out neutrons of a particular energy. The beam was then aimedand collimated (straightened out) before being sent on to the target. 3. Specimen. The position of the target metal or crystal can be variedon two axes. The beam of neutrons bounces off the target in different directions that can tell us something about the atomic structure of thematerial if we can detect them. 4. Detector. Another crystal, similar to the monochromating crystal,can be tuned to pick up particular energies which are then passed onto the detector which counts incoming neutrons. Activity Objective: To set up a crude spectrometer You'll Need: A laser light source (preferred), or flashlight/penlight. A crystal like quartz or amethyst A dark box Optional frequency detector to measure shift in light frequency. What to do: Inside the box, set up the laser light source and the target crystal. By rotating the crystal and measuring the anglesof refraction of the light beam, you can infer things aboutthe internal crystalline structure of the material. If you have a frequency detector, you can measure shifts inlight frequency before and after passing through the target.Theoretically this represents a change in the energy of the light which can tell you other things about the material. Mystery Like many physicists, Bert Brockhouse likes to explore metaphysicalideas as well--the spirit world. He is a religious man. His belief in physics theory coexists with his belief in religion. "Scienceis an act of faith," he says. Without faith, how can understandingthe existence of a neutron help with the larger moral issues in life? Brockhouse's example of a moral problem is "Kantian Doom" -- the idea that we are doomed because even though weknow that something is bad for us, we do it anyway becauseeveryone else is doing it. Examples might be driving cars, using computers, or watching television. Brockhouse would like to seea solution to this social problem.

The Story Roger Daley received a bachelors degree in physics, but decided tobecome a weatherman. "I wanted to do something practical with myeducation, something that would help people in ordinary life," saysDaley. The physics of weather seemed more practical to him thannuclear physics, for instance. Canada educates weathermen for free, butafterwards you "pay it back" by going where ever they send you. Rogerwas posted to the remote Goose Bay weather station in Labrador(actually a U.S. airforce base at the time). This was part of hisapprenticeship in the Canadian Weather Service. Goose Bay, Labrador 1996.Daley is lonely, spending a lot of time alone in his humble room in thearmy barracks. It's cold and there's not much to do. The smell of jetfuel is all pervasive and the Delta Dagger Interceptors and KC 135tankers roar overhead at all hours of day and night. Theysupport and refuel B52 bombers in flight. Daley decides to try an experiment. Working alone in his room at night,he makes up little blue cards for all the American airmen to fill outwhile flying missions in the area. From these cards Daley works out alocal theory for the behaviour of atmospheric turbulence in the area.He spends a lot of time pouring over maps spread out on his bed lateat night, entering the data from the cards onto the maps. The pilotsare very interested and cooperative because ultimately knowing thepatterns of upper level turbulence along the Labrador coast will helpthem fly better. They start hanging around his room and talking aboutthe air in which they fly. Daley realizes he loves this research anddecides to go back to university to get a degree in meteorology. History: 1966-67 served as weather forecaster at Goose Bay Air Base (USAF), in Goose Bay, Labrador. 1971-1992 Amanuensis, Copenhagen U., Denmark 1972-78 Canadian Meterological Centre, Montreal, developing forecast models 1978-85 National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, CO as senior scientist 1985-present: Canadian Climate Centre, Downsview, ON Chief Scientist Wrote the book on atmospheric data analysis (1991) The Young Scientist:Daley grew up in West Vancouver and the North shore mountains were hisbackyard. He climbed, skied and boated a lot. His best subject inhigh-school was history but he was always good in math. He saw math asa doorway to science, but he never wanted to be a research scientist.He always wanted to do something that related to "normal" life. Ingrade 12 he had no intention of studying science. The Science Meteorology is the study of the earth's atmosphere and weather. 1. Real Earth The Earth's weather is a very complex system affected byocean currents, temperature, pressure, wind, and manyother things. 2. Weather Satellite Several Canadian weather satellites detect many of thefactors that create weather. They send this informationback to Earth. 3. Super computer A supercomputer in Montreal (Programmed in part by RogerDaley) records and interprets information fromthe satellite and other sources. 4. Model Earth The weather computer constructs a model of the earthbased on very complicated mathematical formulas. This model can be usedto help predict the weather. Activity:You need: a cup of black coffee a little bit of milk or cream a ruler a watch or stopwatch. Imagine that the whirling coffee represents the motion of air in theatmosphere. The whitish milk represents a trace gas. By following themotion of the milk, knowing the size of the cup and using a stopwatchto measure the passage of time, you can determine the velocity of themoving coffee. How good are your velocity measurements when the milkand coffee become well mixed? The idea is to stir the coffee very very slowly, then drop milk in slowly.Note how the milk mixes and measure the speed of its rotation. Dothis by using the radius (r) (measure the distance from the center towhere the drop fell) and formula 2*pi*r to get the distance the milktravels in one rotation. Use the watch to time how long one rotationtakes. The speed of the whirling mixture is the distance/time. This ishow meteorologists work out speed of moving clouds and storms in theupper atmosphere. They have satellites that can "see" certainnaturally occurring gasses in the atmosphere, like methane from bogs.They "track" this methane as it moves about in the atmosphere, justlike the milk in the coffee cup and figure out wind speeds in theexactly the same way you did in the experiment. Mystery:Daley hopes future generations will help develop a hugecomputer system that will be able to model all the geophysical systemsin the world. Among other things, such a system would allow us toaccurately predict the formation of ozone holes and trends in globalwarming.

The Story Gerhard Herzberg was feeling a bit overwhelmed bent over the piles ofpaper on his big desk. As Director of pure physics at Canada'sNational Research Council, he was very busy in the Fall of 1959. JackShoesmith his research technician had come into the sun filled office. Hewalked up to the tall windows overlooking the Ottawa River and said,"I have an interesting spectrum to show you." Herzberg thought of all the meetings and conferences he had to organize, the paper he was writing, presentations he was preparing and thebook he was trying to finish (the third volume of his series"Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure"). He didn't have timefor this. "It's good," said Jack. Reluctantly, Herzberg got up from his chair and followed the youngtechnician down a flight of stairs to the lab below. It was a largehigh dimly lit room smelling of ammonia, ozone and hot electricwiring. They walked past the special spectrograph that Shoesmith hadbuilt--a long steel tube about 50cm high and 3m long. Vacuum tubes andwires snaked around the base of the aparatus, but the pumps andelectricity were turned off. The big room was quiet except for amurmuring crowd that had gathered in the corner. Herzberg hurried over to see what they were looking at. A long thinstrip of glass lay on a viewing screen with a seemingly random patternof vertical lines blackening its surface--a spectrogram. Recognizingit at once, Herzberg picked it up for a closer look. Instantly heshouted, "That's it!" and broke out laughing. "Eighteen years," hethought. "I've been looking for you for eighteen years." What Herzberg held that day was the first spectrogram of a simplechemical called methylene--a molecule having a carbon with a hydrogenon either side, written CH2. What was special about this? CH2 is avery unstable compound, a "free radical", very reactive; a fleetingtransition species in many chemical reactions. But its spectrum wasthe key to proving many theories of chemical structure. In addition,by training their spectrographs on the stars scientists could use thenew spectrum to identify CH2 in nebulae and other interstellarobjects. That particular spectrum Herzberg was looking at in theFall of 1959 eventually resulted in a Nobel prize in 1972. History: As a twelve year old in Hamburg, Herzberg and a friend named Alfredschulz made a home-made telescope. They patiently ground the lenses,and set them in hand-made mounts in a metal tube. On clear nights theyused to take the streetcar to the city park and set it up to look atthe moon and planets. Herzberg's mother was a vegetarian, and Herzberg has always been one himself. The Science 1. A spectrogram is created with a machine called a spectrograph. It worksby focusing a beam of light with a lens, then passing it through a prismto break it into its component parts. The light source is created by burningor photolysing a compound that you wish to investigate. 2. A spectrogram is a plate made of glass coated with photographicchemicals. When they are developed the plates have dark vertical lines.By measuring the spacing and thickness of the lines and groups of linesyou can apply mathematical formulas and determine some of the energystates of the molecules in the light source. 3. The distance between the larger lines in the spectrum is proportionalto the molecule's "vibrational" energy. The small groups clustered aroundthe major lines represent the "rotational" energy of the molecule. Theselines and their mathematical relationships are called "Balmer" lines after the Swiss high-school teacher who figured them out in 1885. 4. The molecule CH2 or Methylene. Methylene is a "free radical" whichmeans it has an extra pair of electrons that it tries to share withanother molecule. Activity: You need: a revolving chair or stool Sit in the revolving chair or stool. Now, holding your arms stretchedout at your sides, spin yourself around, or have someone else spinyou. As you spin, quickly bring your arms in. You should notice achange in your rate of rotation. Is it faster or slower? This changeyou feel is caused by the conservation of angular momentum,a principle of physics that affects the rotational energy in amolecule when electrons fall from higher orbital levels to lower ones.

The Story Story about going to get his hair cut and describing cosmologyto the hairdresser. Hairdresser calls it "cosmosis". The Young Scientist Remembers the encylopedia his dad gave him. memories of sitting on the beach in Cape Town reading "Calculus Made Easy". "What one fool can do, another can." The Science Cosmology is the study of stars and other heavenly bodies. How was the universe created, and when will it end? What happens to things that fallinto black holes? What are black holes? Israel's recent theoretical discoveries about the interior of black holes. Left:- Ground Based Composite Visual/Radio View: The giant ellipticalgalaxy NGC 4261 is one of the twelve brightest galaxies in the Virgocluster, located 45 million light-years away. Photographed in visiblelight (white) the galaxy appears as a fuzzy disk of hundreds ofbillions of stars. A radio image (orange) shows a pair of opposed jetsemanating from the nucleus and spanning a distance of 88,000light-years. Right:- Hubble Space Telescope Image of NGC 4261: A giant disk of cold gas and dustfuels a possible black hole at the core of the galaxy. Estimated to be 300light-years across, the disk provides astronomers with a clear view of thebright hub, whichpresumably harbors the black hole. The dark, dusty ring of the hub is acold outer region which extends inwards to an ultra-hot areaa few hundred million miles from the suspected black hole. Thisarea of dense stars feeds matter into the black hole, where gravity compresses andheats the material. Hot gas rushes from the vicinity of the blackhole creating the radio jets. The jets are aligned perpendicular tothe disk, like an axel through a wheel. This provides strongcircumstantial evidence for the existence of a black hole "centralengine" in NGC 4261. 1. The Hubble space telescope has now provided fairly convincingevidence (like the image above) for black holes at the centre of every galaxy. 2. As an astronaut falls into a black hole he first passes the "Event Horizon".At this point he can no longer send signals back out of the black hole. However,he can still receive messages from outside. 3. The Inner Horizon. 4. Nobody knows what happens in the inner regions of a black hole. Ultimately, theblack hole becomes a "singularity"--an infinitely massive point in space Activity Objective: To calculate the mass of a typical black hole. You'll Need: A calculator The following information. If gas and stars can be observed orbiting ablack hole at a velocity of v kilometers per second and if the orbiting objectsare at a distance of r light years from the black hole, then the mass of theblack hole in units of solar masses (m) can be calculated with the formula: What to do: In a nearby active spiral galaxy (NGC 4258), 21 million light yearsaway from Earth, there is an object called a "maser" made partly ofwater molecules that can be observed orbiting something at the centreof the galaxy that is probably a black hole. The maser is 0.3 lightyears from the black hole (r) and is orbiting it at a speed of 900Km/sec (v). Calculate the size (i.e.: mass) of the black hole at the centre of thisgalaxy. (NOTE: you can look up more about this system in Nature #373,p. 103, 12 Jan 1996) In the giant galaxy M87 in the centre of the Virgo cluster65 million light years from Earth, similar observations and calculationsshow a black hole at the centre of M87 with a mass oftwo billion suns!! Mystery Nobody knows what happens inside a black hole or where things go when theyfall into one. Einstein's theory of relativity explains most things inthe universe, until you get inside a black hole. Israel feels that a quantumtheory of gravity will need to be developed to explain what happens insidea black hole. Though people have been working towards this goal since Einstein'stime, the quantum theory of gravity has remained elusive.

Favorite music Beethoven 6th symphony (2nd movement) Other interests Photography, classical music, skiing, hiking. The Story Krebs sits at the back of the sled, tired and happy to be pulledalong by the noisy snowmobile. Its high-pitched whine breaks the serenity of the frozen lake in Canada's North. But Krebs loves it,the crisp quiet cold, the wide open whiteness. Wind and snow sprayhis face as they plow through a snow drift. For Krebs it's a childhood dream come true. As a kid in Illinois, he read every book in the library about exploring the North Pole. He was fascinatedby the mysteries of the North. Did lemmings really commit masssuicide jumping off cliffs? Now here he was, findingout for himself. Krebs thinks about the morning as the sled swooshes alongover bumps and cracks in the ice. With him are four ecology studentsfrom UBC, two riding in front of him on the sled loadedwith research equipment, and two up front on the snowmobile.They are returning from a 6 hour session tagging snowshoe hareson a remote island in Kluane Lake in South West Yukon Territory.It's early May, 1980. Working in teams, they had just finished checking traps on a grid covering the island. These traps don'thurt the rabbits. Every rabbit was weighed, sexed, andif they didn't already have one, they got an ID tag in their ears.The researchers kept meticulous notes on clipboards. Krebs is satisfied. He's thinking about how this new data fits into apaper he's working on when suddenly the student driving the snowmobileyells, "Hold on guys," and revs the engine to jump across a crackin the ice. The lake is starting to break up with the Spring thawand they have crossed a few of these cracks already. The snowmobilemakes it across, but it opens the crack too much. Beforehe knows it, Krebs, the sled, and the two other students are sinkingfast in icy water. It doesn't help that they're all wearing winterparkas and heavy snow boots, either. Krebs treads water with one handand holds the data notebooks up with the other yelling, "Save thedata! Save the data!!" They did save the data, and themselves, fortunately, but his studentsnever let Krebs forget that day.Data's hard to come by when you are a wildlife biologist like Krebs. You don�t do much work in a comfortable laboratory. Your lab is thegreat outdoors and since animal life cycles take years, you needdecades of observations and data collection to understand a particularanimal. Even after about 50 years of research, we still don't know exactly why populations of lemmings in the North seem to disappear about everyfour years. But one thing for sure, we know they do not jump off cliffs. History Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis,Missouri. As a kid he remembers fishing for catfish in local rivers withhis grandfather. Charley admired his grandfather and his tales of naturaladventures and wildlife. In particular Krebs was drawn to the Canadian Arctic.At 8 years old he wanted to be a forest ranger. Even then, he was readingbooks about basic ecology and the science of wild animals. All throughhis high school years, Krebs had the most amazing summer job. He workedfor a St. Louis fur trading company harvesting seals in the Berring Sea.Each Summer he went by train 3 days to Seattle, then by boat 7 days upthe coast to these uninhabited Northern islands. Krebs loved it, and hewas curious about all the wildlife on the islands. It's probably becauseof these teenage trips that he has become one of the world experts onNorthern animals like lemmings and snowshoe hares. After getting his bachelors degree from the U. of Minnesota (1957), Krebscame to Vancouver, BC to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) theworld expert on lemmings. Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a PhD (62) in Zoologyfrom UBC. Then, after a 2-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back hometo teach Zoology at the of Indiana University. But in 1970 Krebs returned to Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC. Krebs' textbook called "Ecology" published by Harper-Collins andnow in its fourth edition is used worldwide as the standard teachingtext for ecology courses. The Science Zoology is the study of animals. Krebs is an animal ecologist. Ecology is a combination of physiology--the study of the internalworkings of an animal's body--genetics, evolution, and behaviour.Krebs has spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery oflemmings and other small Northern mammals whose populations crashregularly every four to ten years. Hudson's Bay fur trading recordsshow these fluctuations stretching back for hundreds of years. In 1965 Krebs tried a simple experiment in an Indiana pasture. He simply fenced in an area of grassland the size of a soccer field to seewhat would happen to the population of voles living inside the fence.(The fence extends down into the soil several inches to stop tunneling.)Amazingly, within a year, he found the populationof voles increased about 5 times. Krebs has spent his working lifetrying to explain the "Krebs effect". He says, "You just put a fence up.You don't do anything to the animals. So what is the fence doing?" 1. Lemmings are small rodents that look like guinea pigs. They livethroughout the world in Northern latitudes. Every 4 years theirpopulation increases up to 500 times and then crashes to almost nothing. 2. The "Fence Effect" also known as the "Krebs Effect" demonstratedhere on Westham Island, BC. A population explosion on the left sidefenced in area has occurred and the voles have eaten everything exceptthe thistles. 3. Graph showing the population explosion and crash caused by the fence.The gray line is for voles in a similar unfenced area. The black lineshows the number of voles over time in the fenced area. 4. Aggression in voles. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminatedpossible reasons for the Fence Effect. Food is not a factor. You can supplythe fenced in area with unlimited food, and the effect is still observed.Predators are not the answer. You can make the fence low enough to keep thevoles in but let predators like foxes in. The fence is never a deterrentfor birds of prey like hawks, yet you still see the Fence Effect. Krebs nowbelieves that the effect is due to social behaviour among the voles. Thisincludes the natural genetic selection for more aggressive individuals overthe time as living conditions become more crowded. The final crashseems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babiesin neighbouring nests. Activity Objective: To learn about animals by following their tracks You'll Need: A trip to the countryside A notebook What to do: Summer: Go to any large grassy field such as those outside most airports,and literally put your nose to the ground. Part the grass and inchalong parting it in a straight line for at least 10 meters or untilyou find a vole runway. It will be an unmistakable runway about2 or 3 cm wide like the inside of a toilet paper roll. They are likecurving tubes at the bottoms of the grass stems right near where thestems join the roots. If you don't find one on the first try, try again, maybe in a different field.The runways curve and branch in all directions. Try to draw a mapof the vole runs in a small area of the field. Winter: If you are in Canada, you probably live somewhere near a spruce forest.Go cross country skiing or hiking in the forest looking for snowshoehare tracks. They look like this:Once you learn to spot the tracks, follow a set and try to determinewhat the hare is eating. You can examine their droppings or lookfor bits of food the hare dropped while eating. Is there lots of food?Where is it located? Where do snowshoe hares like to hang out? Howdo they avoid predators like lynx and other wildcats? If you want to get a feeling for what Charles Krebs does, try to count the number of hare tracks that cross your path in a set distance, say about 100 meters. Write this in your notebook andreturn to the exact same 100 meter stretch next year to count thenumber of tracks that cross the path. Repeat this for at least 10years. Can you see a cycle begin to emerge? Mystery Krebs has still not figured out the mystery of the fence effect entirely, butone thing he would like to know is: how big does a fenced in area have to beuntil the Fence Effect dissappears?

The Story It was 1986 and Julia Levy was giving a talk in Waterloo, Ontario. Shemet the people who were doing photodynamic therapy. "For the firsttime, I became aware that we were talking about real patients beingtreated for real cancer, says Levy. The doctors were very upset withJohnson & Johnson for closing down their Photofrin research program.So many people were being helped by this technology but soon theywould not be able to get the drug. " That was a very upsettingexperience for me," says Levy. But it was also very exciting. That night on the plane flying back to Vancouver she began thinking,"We're in the business of photodynamic therapy. We should get intothis at the first level and we should maybe start making Photofrin atleast for the Canadian investigators." She sat pondering this thewhole way home and became very excited. She got off the plane inVancouver and called her business partner, Jim Miller and said "We'vegot to do something." Levy wasn't thinking about big financial take-overs. She just wanted to help those cancer sufferers. "Let's make theproduct. We know how to make it," she said. But Miller replied, "We'lltake over the company." They partnered with the pharmaceutical giant,American Cyanamid, raised $15 million and did it. That was a majorturning point for Quadra Logic. "Being in business--in commercial science--focuses your science," saysLevy. "The big difference between University and commercial science,is not the quality of the research. It's your awareness that as youmove a drug forward towards getting it into a patient, towards gettinga treatment perfected, every step costs about 10 times as much, andtherefore you cannot afford to make mistakes. Maybe that's why itsuits my personality because I don't like retracing my steps anyway. Ilike to do it right the first time. You can't afford too many goofswhen a single experiment costs $50,000." In April of 1993 the Canadian government approved photofrin for thetreatment of bladder cancer. Other cancers of the skin, lung, stomachand cervix are also treatable. Levy is now starting a fantastic new program to treat auto-immunediseases such as arthritis, psoriasis (a skin disease), and multiplesclerosis with a second generation photodynamic drug called BPD. "It'sway beyond cancer," says Levy. She and her team are curing arthriticmice by injecting them with BPD and placing them in a red-light box afew hours later to activate the drug. "We're the only people in theworld doing this," says Levy. "The exciting thing is that everythingwe've touched our hands to has turned out positively." The Young Scientist: Levy grew up in Vancouver. Even as a little girl, she was interested inbiology. On weekends she would come home from Queen's Hall boardingschool in Vancouver and go for walks with her mother in the woodsbelow 41st avenue. Their dog would romp along collecting stray dogswho would stay at their house for up to several days. Sometimes Juliawould take a sieve and a jar to bring back frog's eggs so that she andher sister could grow tadpoles in the basement wash basins. Later: She enjoyed mathematics in high school, and had a particularlyinspiring woman biology teacher in grade 11. She got a degree in microbiology from UBC. She got a PhD at University College in London, Eng. Became a professor of microbiology at UBC. Founded her own drug company, Quadra Logic Technologies Inc., withseveral other university professors. The Science 1. Photodynamic drug injected into the blood stream. 2. Lipoproteins in blood carry the drug to all parts of the body. 3. BPD (BenzoPorphyrin Derivative) drug developed by Levy and company is transported in the blood inside lipoprotein, a complex protein that carries fatty material. 4. BPD brought inside cancer cell by lipoprotein. 5. Cancer Cell. Several hours after the injection, cancer cells, which grow faster than normal cells accumulate ten times more BPD than normal cells in the body. 6. Fibre-optic Laser Into Lung. Using a fibre optic scope, doctors can enter the lung and find the cancer tissue. Then red laser light with the wavelength of 690nm is sent down the fibre optic probe. The light activates the BPD molecules creating free oxygen molecules which react with the cancer cell and effectively "burn" it up. 7. Cancer tumour in lung being destroyed by photodynamic therapy. Activity:To understand why Levy and her team use red laser light toactivate their photodynamic drugs, try this experiment. You'll Need: A good flashlight. What to do: Turn on the flashlight and put your hand over it, or putyour mouth around the bright end. What colour is the light that you see through your hand orcheeks? Why it works:Our bodies are mostly transparent to red light. The red laser light at690 nanometer wavelength that Levy uses to activate photodynamic drugspasses right through skin and flesh. Even hemoglobin, the protein thatmakes blood red, does not absorb red light at that wavelength. Why do you think red light passes through our bodies?

The Story Holding his half full gourd of "chicha", Walter Lewis smiles, wishinghedidn't have to drink another drop. It tastes so sour, like acombinationof yoghurt, warm beer and mashed potatoes. But the headman--theapu of the AchuarJivura village in the Amazonian jungle--is looking him right inthe eye. To refuse this friendship ceremony drink would be an insultto his hosts. Lewis takes another look at the yellowish liquid in his gourd. Heknows that Achuar women make chicha by chewing a kind of tapiocaroot andspitting it into a huge bowl to ferment in their own saliva. The airin the open hut is wet and hot. Lewis feels his shirt stick to thesweat on his back as he turns to see his wife sitting among the womenjustoutside the men's circle. A smoldering cooking fire gives everythingthesmell of smoked fish. The forest outside is alive with shriekingjungle birds while pet parrots, monkeys and dogs squawk and bark,leaping among the crowd of gawking naked children surrounding Lewisand his wife Memory Elvin-Lewis. "We are the zoo," thinks Lewis as hetakes a final sip of the sour tasting brew like a good ethnobotanist. Mariano the headman is telling Lewis about the healing powers of acertain plant whose roots are used to help women through the finalstages of childbirth. The Lewis's have travelled to the Peruvianjungle in search of new plants that might yield new drugs. They areethnobotanists and they specialize in communicating with nativepeoples around the world to learn of previously undocumentedtraditional medicines. While Walter is talking to the headman, Memory notices a big grin onthe face of an old woman in the back row. (In Achuar culture women donot sit with the men, but have their own special area within thehut.) Memory quietly goes to talk to the old woman who turns out tobe Mariano's aunty. She takes memory outside to show her the plantMariano is talking about, all the while telling her how men don'tknow much about this medicine, since it's strictly used by women.When Memory sees the plant she realizes immediately that it's notthe root the Achuar use, but rather the leaf. On closer inspectionlater, Walter discovers that it's not the leaf that has the medicinalquality, but a fungus which grows on the topmost leaves of the plant. The Lewis's credit many of their discoveries to the way they work asateam. If Walter had been in the jungle on his own perhaps he neverwould have discovered this medicine, since as a man, he wouldprobablynot talk to the women of the tribe, and he would have embarked on afutile search looking for the active ingredient in the roots of theplant. The Lewis's have collected thousands of plants and found dozens oftraditional medicines which require authentication by modern biomedicaland chemical analytical techniques. These include a wound healing sap that makes cuts and scrapes heal30% faster, various antimalarial plants, anti-arthritis plants, andmore. Three quarters of all drugs come directly or indirectly from plants used infolk medicine and the Lewis's are trying deperately to catalog thethousands of plants used by tropical rain-forest culturesbefore the forests are chopped down. History Walter Lewis When Walter was 12 his dad asked him what he wanted for his birthday.The Lewis family lived in Victoria, BC and Walter was fascinated byanuncle who had a nursery where he grew plants in the countryside.Walter told his dad he'd like a greenhouse for his birthday and hisfather gave him one. It was made of wood and glass and was about 3mlong and 2m wide with planting benches on each long wall. Walter'suncletaught him how to grow roses from cuttings. The next summer Walterbegan selling his roses in Victoria. His mom and dad wanted him to become a dentist. Walter went toVictoria College (which later became the University of Victoria) tostudy towards dentistry, but he took extra botany courses on the sideto satisfy his curiousity about plants. After second year universityhe announced to his parents that he would become a botanist, not adentist. Memory Elvin-Lewis When Memory was a girl her father, who was a physician, took her withhim on his house calls and as a teenager she helped in his office. She was fascinatedby all things scientific and her father encouraged her by helpingher understand what he did.She was not like other girls at Queens Hall school for girls and wanted to goto public school (Prince of Wales) where she believed she would get a better education. In high-school she always topped the class in science. As a teenager she volunteeredin the St. John Ambulance Brigade and became a sargent. At the University of British Columbia when she took her firstmicrobiology course she remembers thinking, "This is it!" In the mid-60s Memory and her co-workers recorded a case of ayoung boy dying of strange natural causes. Nobody could understandthe boy's case history or understand why he died, so blood specimens were put away and frozen. Twentyyears later when the disease of AIDS was characterized, Memory recognizedthe symptoms and had the boy's frozen blood analysed. The case is nowrecognized as the first recorded case of AIDS in America. The Science Ethnobotany is the study of plants by obtaining information frompeople around the world. The Lewis's specialize in discovering newdrugs from plants used in folk medicine by native tribes in SouthAmerica and other tropical parts of the world. The tropical jungles which make up the primary source for such plantsare disappearing. At the same time the people who know how to usethese plants are becoming "acculturated", that is they are becomingmore Westernized and they are losing their traditional culture andknowledge of the forest.The Lewis's and people like them are tryingdesperately to catalogue as many medicinal plants as they can beforeit is too late. 1. The Hut The Achuar hut sits in a clearing in the forest. Inside severalfamilies live together. Unmarried and widowed women live at one end. Meetings are held at the otheraround a Snake Stool where the headman or apu sits. Open firesburn on the floor and the smoke goes out a hole in the roof. 2. A Achuar Elder Now dead, this wise elder taught the Lewis's much about the medicinalplants of the Achuar. 3. Gourd with Holly leaves Each morning before dawn the Achuar men drink guayus, a very strongcaffeine containing drink made from these leaves. Each man usuallydrinks about a litre (4 cups). Within 45 minutes they vomit about half of it backup. The vomiting is not caused by the guayus but is a custom of thetribe. When boys reach maturity they join the men in the morningritual of drinking and regurgitating guayus. 4. Methylergonovine A chemical structure similar to the active ingredient in the ergotfungus the Lewis's found growing on a plant used byAchuar women to aid in childbirth. Activity To get a feeling for what it's like to be an ethnobotanist lookaroundyour house for six different things made out of wood. Try to identifywhat type of wood was used, where the wood came from and how it wasmade into the final product. Can you ask your "tribal elders" (yourparents or teachers) if they know where the wood came from? What doesthe origin of the wood tell you about you and your family? Another place to be like an ethnobotanist is the grocery store.Try to find out where certain produce comes from. Ethnic grocerystores like Chinese, East Indian, or West Indian stores are good places to look. Seeif you can find an unfamiliar fruit or vegetable and get somebody in the store to explain how to prepare it. Remember to watch for non-verbal clues and tricks of language. Where does the vegetable grow? How is itused? We depend on people from other cultures around the world becausethe knowledge they have about preparingfoods and medicines enriches our lives every day. Mystery In the Peruvian jungle the Achuar have shown the Lewis's aplant that they use to treat "the frightened people". TheLewis's do not know what the Achuar people mean by this, but theyfeel if this mystery could be solved then a new drug foranxiety or mental illness might be discovered.
