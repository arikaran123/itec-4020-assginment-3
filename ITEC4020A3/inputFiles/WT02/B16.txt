Why Should We Care About Sustainable Energy? Environment Problem Today, the production and use of energy causes more environmental damage than any other human activity. If current trends continue, it will get worse. U.S. energy consumption is projected to rise 20 percent between 1995 and 2015. World energy consumption is expected to rise 50 percent in the next 20 years. Opportunity Energy efficiency allows economic growth to continue with lower rates of growth in energy consumption. Renewable resources provide clean alternatives to traditional fuels. Public Health Problem Energy use is a public health issue, even in developed nations like the United States. Some 54 million Americans live in counties that regularly violate air quality standards. Opportunity Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are proven ways to prevent pollution by businesses, industries and cars. Economy Problem Wasted energy is wasted money for U.S. businesses, taxpayers, and families. Enormous amounts of capital are wasted today in the form of unnecessary energy expenses. Opportunity Less energy waste would free money for new investments in business plant and equipment, higher profits for stockholders, reduced consumer prices, better wages and training for workers, more disposable income for homeowners types of spending that research shows produce more jobs than building new power plants. Oil Imports Problem America's high reliance on imported petroleum makes the economy vulnerable to supply disruptions and price shocks. Oil prices are projected to increase with higher consumption caused by economic development programs worldwide. Opportunity Energy efficiency and renewable, domestic energy resources reduce our dependence on imported oil and insulate the economy from price shocks. Trade Deficit Problem The U.S. imports more oil today than at any other time in its history. In 1993, oil imports contributed $51 billion to the nation's trade deficit. Imports are projected to rise to 62 percent of U.S. consumption in the next 20 years. Oil prices also are projected to rise over the next 20 years by approximately 50 percent. Both trends will cause more upward pressure on the trade deficit. Opportunity Energy efficiency and domestic, renewable energy resources slow the growth of oil imports. That's not all. With the world market for environmental technologies expected to grow to $425 billion annually by 1997, U.S. energy efficiency and renewable energy Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy Benefits Programs Targeted for Urban Centers and Municipalities Why Industrial Energy Use Matters Why Utility Energy Use Matters Why Building Efficiency Matters Why Transportation Energy Matters Partnering With States Test Your Energy IQ Energy Tip of the Day [Home][EREN][DOE] Return to EREN Home Page WT02-B16-45IA059-000321-B004-79http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/greenpower/ 205.168.79.27 19970114195227 text/html 4919HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 19:52:31 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wed, 16 Oct 1996 15:55:34 GMTContent-length: 4745 The Green Power Network U.S. Department of Energy Welcome to the Green Power Network - a clearinghouse of information on electric power industry green marketing efforts.

They are dramatically different from one another. One path was mapped out last year by the U.S. House of Representatives in the Omnibus Science Authorization Act of 1995 (HR 2405). The Act set authorized funding levels for the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs for 1997. If Congress follows this path, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs will be cut by 50% from the President's FY 1997 budget request and 53% from FY 1995 appropriations. The other path has been mapped by the American public and the Clinton Administration. It calls for a strong, responsible Federal role in helping develop the clean, efficient and renewable energy technologies the nation will need in the years ahead. The public clearly favors the second path. In a national poll conducted in December 1995 among a bipartisan group of 1,000 voters, a majority said they consider energy efficiency and renewable energy the highest-priority research programs at DOE. More than 90% said they support the development of renewable energy alternatives to oil. The second path has been carefully charted in a series of Administration initiatives: the Climate Change Action Plan; the National Sustainable Energy Strategy; the "Bridge to a Sustainable Future" report developed by the National Science and Technology Council; and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. The Administration has backed up these initiatives with annual proposals to fund a lean but active Federal program to research, develop and commercialize sustainable energy technologies. In 1996, however, Congress cut DOE's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by a devastating 27%. As you'll see in the following pages, the President's 1997 budget calls upon Congress to restore these funds. The proposed 1997 budget for energy efficiency and renewable energy is $1.13 billion, about equal to 1995 levels. We at the Department of Energy and responsible leaders of both political parties share many goals. We want a vibrant economy, with ample numbers of quality jobs. We want to achieve that growth without sacrificing public health, or the quality of our air, water and land. We want to increase the income of and minimize the tax burden on every American family. We want to build a future in which our children have ample resources and prosperity in the fullest sense, economically and environmentally. All of these benefits can accrue from sustainable energy programs described in this booklet. Taking the second path means a strong Federal commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy. We look forward to Congressional support for the important programs contained in the 1997 budget. Christine A. Ervin Assistant Secretary Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy U.S. Department of Energy Return to EREN Home Page Please send comments to: webmaster.eren@nrel.gov WT02-B16-47IA059-000321-B004-174http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/overview/budget/budget3.html 205.168.79.27 19970114195344 text/html 11269HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 19:53:50 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 21:46:06 GMTContent-length: 11094 DOE EREN - Introduction Introduction New Realities, New Energy The Department of Energy's Fiscal Year 1997 budget proposes that the average American invest $4.12 in the research, development and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. What will be the return on your investment? Your $4.12 will improve the quality of the environment both here in the U.S. and worldwide as American companies export new clean-energy technologies to other nations; Your $4.12 will enhance America's world leadership in science and technology; Your $4.12 will lower the U.S. trade deficit and insulate the economy from oil shocks by reducing our reliance on imported oil. It will lower the chances that your children or grandchildren will have to fight an oil war; Your $4.12 will help create a dynamic set of new U.S. industries and high-quality jobs for you and your children. The bottom line is simple: The Department of Energy's sustainable energy programs are a common-sense investment offering one of the highest paybacks anywhere. They enhance our ability to respond to several new realities. Reality No. 1: Energy has a profound but hidden influence on the nation's economic health. The typical American family can significantly improve its disposable income by making more efficient use of energy. The typical business can increase its profits and improve its productivity with energy efficiency technologies. In the typical American community, 70 to 80 cents of every energy dollar immediately leave the local economy. Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can plug that leak, keeping money at home to create more jobs. In the nation as a whole, our oil imports have reached record levels -- 50% and climbing--increasing our foreign trade deficit and our vulnerability to supply disruptions. After the energy crises of the 1970s, all sectors of the U.S. economy embraced energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency became one of America's great technology success stories, saving the economy about $225 billion annually. Now, 20 years later, brand new potential is waiting to be captured. Recent advances in energy efficiency technologies have created tremendous opportunities for more savings. Developing and adopting sustainable energy technologies promises greater economic health at every level of our economy. Reality No 2: Energy is directly linked to the quality of the environment. The production and use of energy cause more environmental damage than any other economic activity in the world today. The problem is rapidly growing worse. The world's most populated nations, including China and India, have launched aggressive economic development campaigns. Where they get the energy to fuel that growth will affect the world environment for many years to come. Clean energy technologies must be available to help these emerging economies leapfrog over the environmental problems that were byproducts of industrialization in the West. Worldwide economic development is creating a huge market for clean energy. With aggressive action to develop and export sustainable energy technologies, the U.S. can capture that market and create new industries and jobs at home. Reality No. 3: A Federal role is vital to developing sustainable energy technologies and to helping them enter the marketplace. Some national policy makers still argue that the Federal government should not be involved in the energy marketplace. If the marketplace functioned perfectly, Federal initiatives might not be needed to help the private sector research and develop promising new energy technologies. But changes in the marketplace, in companies and in the nature of technology development, all have discouraged private investments in R&D. These changes include: Downsizing in many companies, including cuts in high-risk, long-term research and development; Skyrocketing costs for increasingly specialized research that most individual companies are unable to bear; The complex nature of much modern R&D, which cuts across companies and traditional disciplines; and The lack of alignment between the near-term priorities of individual companies and the long-term strategic interests of the nation. These changes suggest that the Federal government has a role in technology R&D that meets certain criteria: there is a high social rate of return; it fulfills a strategic national need; and the private sector cannot develop it alone. Federal energy efficiency and renewable energy programs meet these requirements. Reality No. 4: We must do more with less. The Department of Energy is working hard to reduce the budget deficit and to meet Secretary Hazel O'Leary's pledge to reduce DOE spending by billions of dollars. In Fiscal Year 1996, after an exhaustive evaluation of our programs, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy eliminated those where a Federal role is no longer needed. We closed four regional offices, with corresponding cuts in personnel. We reformed energy grant programs to give states more flexibility in how the funds are spent. We reorganized to reduce unneeded layers of management, making our programs more efficient, more responsive and more cost-effective. At the same time, we have worked to maintain the critical core of Federal energy efficiency and renewable energy investments that fulfill the Federal government's legitimate and vital role in building national security, economic security and environmental security. * * * * * * The reality is that energy is one of America's most underrated environmental, economic, jobs and public health issues. The Fiscal Year 1997 sustainable energy investments described in this booklet are keys to a better future. Each year, R&D Magazine recognizes 100 of the world's most technologically significant new products. The magazine's R&D 100 award is internationally renowned. The Chicago Tribune calls it the "Oscar of Inventions". Since 1963, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has won a remarkable 386 awards, more than the number received by all other agencies of the U.S. Government combined. The awards underscore that DOE is one of the world's most accomplished research institutions. In the past five years, projects supported by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy have won 31 of these awards representing more than 6% of the total number given during that time. This record is especially remarkable considering that the Office's R&D budget represents under one half of one percent of the nation's total R&D funding. The Office has been honored for a diverse array of clean energy technologies, ranging from genetically engineered bacterium for converting biological material to ethanol fuel; to improved photovoltaic cells; to a superefficient lightbulb. These awards demonstrate the power of partnerships between the Federal government and private industry. Since 1980, 20 of the Office's awards have recognized joint achievements with private companies, universities and other government agencies. The R&D 100 awards are independent confirmation that DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is a prolific and critical producer of the clean, world-class energy technologies the United States needs to produce a healthy economy and healthy environment.

A pre-electric life is difficult for most Americans to imagine, but it is realityfor more than 2 billion people in the world today. During the next decade, developing nationsare expected to invest a trillion dollars in electrical generation capacity to raisethe living standards of their people. A critical question arises: How will thedeveloping world provide this energy without dramatically increasing global emissions of carbondioxide and other greenhouse gases? U.S. renewable energy technologies are alarge part of the answer. The Department of Energy is working with Americancompanies to develop, produce and export solar, geothermal, wind, biomass andother renewable power technologies that produce clean energy. The potentialbenefits are high: better environmental quality worldwide, new jobs for Americanworkers, and overseas sales that lead to mass production of renewable energy systems,making them a less expensive alternative for clean power here in the UnitedStates. The Office of Utility Technologies leads the Federalgovernment's effort to help America's electric power producers develop clean, renewableand more economical forms of energy. The Office has two principal missions: To develop new technologies to produce electricpower from renewable resources, including solar, wind, geothermal and biomassenergy. To work with the power industry to develop advancedtechnologies needed to integrate renewable technologies into the utility grid andto demonstrate and market renewable electric power generators to the domesticand international markets. Fiscal Year 1997 Highlights Energy for Today and Tomorrow The Photovoltaic Energy Technology Program works inpartnership with U.S. industry to foster major advances in photovoltaic (PV)technology and economically competitive use by utilities, with a goal of500 megawatts installed worldwide by the year 2000. Increased funding in Fiscal Year 1997 will restore DOE'ssupport for core research and for key development efforts such as PVMat andPV-COMPACT -- heavily cost-shared collaborations with industry to improvetechnology for manufacturing PV cells and to pave the way for greatercommercial use of PV. Fiscal Year 1997 activities will produce world records in cell andmodule performance, and encourage more than 15 megawatts in new power supplyinstallations. The Biomass Power Program is partnering with U.S.industry and agricultural interests to demonstrate and deploy integratedpower systems that are economically competitive and environmentally sustainable. The program has three primary focus areas: a core research and developmentprogram; biomass gasification demonstration projects that will validate high-efficiencyU.S. biomass technologies; and the Biomass Power for Rural Developmentinitiative, a collaborative effort with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) todemonstrate the feasibility of integrated feedstock production and advanced powerconversion systems. In Fiscal Year 1997, this program will initiate at least two moreintegrated rural biomass power projects with USDA and will continue existing projects.These projects will firmly establish the technology viability of a broad base of U.S.developed systems and provide substantial benefits to rural America. The Geothermal Electric Power Program has set a costtarget of 3 cents per kilowatt hour for geothermal electricity by 2005. The program is working toward an international market share for the U.S. geothermal powerindustry of over $10 billion. These goals are pursued by R&D projects and partnershipsaimed at improving technologies used to locate, map and drill geothermalreservoirs and at improving the efficiency of geothermal electric power plants. Fiscal Year1997 activities will increase U.S. geothermal generating capacity by about 30 megawatts,improve U.S. process efficiencies by 5-30% at existing plants, and restore atleast 50 megawatts of productive steam capacity at The Geysers in northernCalifornia. The Geothermal Program is also a key sponsor of the Geothermal HeatPump Consortium, an industry-led group that seeks to increase market sharefor these devices to 12% of the U.S. space conditioning market by the year 2000. The Wind Energy Program is built on four keyactivities: applied research aimed at addressing fundamental wind energy engineering andtechnology issues; turbine research, a coordinated effort with industry andutilities to help develop the next generation of wind turbines; cooperative research andtesting involving partnerships with industry and the National Wind Technology Center; andtechnology deployment to help introduce the utility sector to advanced windtechnologies. These research and development activities will enable wind technology toprovide electricity for 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour in 15 mph winds by the year 2000.Increased funding in Fiscal Year 1997 will support research critical to making the nextgeneration turbines a cost-competitive reality, provide technology assistance to U.S.companies competing for global markets, and restore the successful, highly leveragedTurbine Verification Project. The Climate Challenge Program demonstrates analternative to government regulation by using voluntary agreements with individualelectric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By February 29, 1996, utilityparticipation represented over 60% of the industry in terms of total utilitygeneration. In addition to a significant pledge of over 43 million metric tons of carbon equivalentemissions reductions by the year 2000, Climate Challenge has prompted hundreds ofmillions of dollars in utility industry investments, including two new energy venturecapital funds now at $52 million. The Solar Thermal Electric R&D Program works withmanufacturers, developers, and users of solar thermal electric technologyto develop reliable and efficient power tower, dish/engine, and parabolic troughsystems that can compete in electric utility markets in the next decade. Fiscal Year1997 will see important advances in solar thermal electric technologies as the 10megawatt Solar Two Power Tower moves into its second operating year. Five 25kilowatt dish/Stirling systems are deployed at a grid-connected site in the Mojave Dessert tovalidate the design and performance of the systems. The Hydrogen Research Program works with industry anda scientific advisory panel to develop safe, practical and competitivehydrogen technologies to meet energy needs. The program achieves benefits from andcoordinates with other programs in the Department of Energy to develop thenecessary infrastructure for hydrogen, including fuel cells for buildings andtransportation use. In Fiscal Year 1997, the program will complete proof-of-concept of a lowtemperature (150 ) metal hydride storage and delivery system on board a utility vehicle. DOE leads the national effort to capture the energy-savingpotential of High-Temperature Superconductivity--the ability of certainmaterials to carry electricity without resistance energy losses. A key elementof the effort is the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative, anindustry-DOE collaborative intended to speed the commercialization of superconductingproducts. The program already has produced several world-record R&D advances. InFY 1997, industry teams working with DOE will provide the expertise andexperience necessary to exploit these breakthroughs in electrical wire fabrication bydeveloping electric motors, transformers and other electric power devices. Market Profile: Electric Power Electric and gas utilities represent a nationalcapital investment portfolio of $790 billion. Utilities provide roughly $260 billion each year inenergy services to homes, businesses and industries. This is 55% of total U.S. energyconsumption and 5.2% of the GNP, an average expenditure of $235 per monthfor each household in America. The production and consumption of energy by utilitieshas a significant impact on the environment, including one-third of total carbondioxide emissions. Renewable energy systems use domestic resources, havelow environmental impact and, once installed, are independent of pricefluctuations. The United States is expected to invest as much as $200billion in new electric generation capacity in the next decade to replace agingpower plants and to keep up with rising demand. Electricity is a crucial element in economic developmentworldwide. Nations are expected to spend an estimated $1 trillion over the nextdecade to provide electricity to their people. Benefits: Energy Savings: Total primary energy contributionsof 0.4 quadrillion BTUs by the year 2000; 1.2 quadrillion BTUs by 2010; and 3.0quadrillion BTUs by 2020. Cost Savings: More than $700 million in annual fuelcost savings by the year 2000 (in 1992 dollars); more than $3 billion by 2010; andover $12 billion by 2020. Pollution Prevention: 5 million metric tons ofannual carbon equivalent emissions savings by the year 2000; 23 million metric tonsby 2010; and 75 million metric tons by 2020.

Like many other foods you buy in the supermarket, black olives are processed before they are shipped. The current processing method generates millions of gallons of liquid waste that contains not only olive pits and parts, but also a high concentration of salts. The waste poses an expensive disposal problem that some experts say threatens the U.S. olive industry. Oberti Olives in Madera, California, is an example. Oberti used evaporative ponds to hold its wastewater. State officials said the ponds were leaking, contaminating underground water. Industry-wide, such contamination could cause salt to spread through fresh water supplies, making them unfit for irrigation. Oberti found it would cost $40 million to reline its ponds, an expense it could not afford. The company faced a choice: close down or find a new solution. Now, with the help of a $400,000 grant from DOE's NICE3 program, matched by $7 million from the food industry and $16,000 from the State of California, Oberti is demonstrating an innovative "membrane" filtration technology that removes salt and other contaminants from its wastewater, allowing 80% of the water, a total of 800,000 gallons a day, to be recycled. The other 20% contains useable byproducts, including olive pomace (pits and other material) that will be used as animal feed. Experts believe the new membrane system will also clean up wastewater from processing sugar, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots and peas. Thus, a small DOE grant, a public/private partnership and a high-tech membrane are saving energy, water and jobs in the food processing industry. American industries need capital to grow, to help their workers obtain new skills, and to invest in new technologies and production capabilities. Yet industries spend enormous amounts of capital on energy and pollution control. Isn't there a better way? There is. A growing number of industries are discovering that energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can lower costs, increase productivity and prevent pollution. The Office of Industrial Technologies helps industries develop and adopt these new technologies through programs that have produced more than $2 in economic benefits for every $1 in Federal spending. The Office has invested $965 million in Federal funds, which have produced more than $1.3 billion in energy savings for American industries plus more than $1.2 billion in increased capital productivity. These programs helped increase employment in the industrial sector by more than 16,000 person-years in 1993. Fiscal Year 1997 Highlights Energy for Today The Office operates four partnership programs: NICE3, Motor Challenge, Climate Wise and the Industrial Assessment Center program. NICE3 (National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment and Economics) awards grants to industry and state partnerships for projects that demonstrate advances in energy efficiency and clean production technologies. The 47 projects currently funded by NICE3 are leveraged with industry funds, resulting in the co-investment of $5 for every $1 of Federal funding. The Fiscal Year 1997 budget will fund approximately 30 additional projects. Electric motors and motor-driven systems such as fans, pumps, compressors and blowers consume more than half of all the electricity generated in the United States. The Motor Challenge program works with industry, motor/drive manufacturers, distributors and others to inform companies about energy-efficient electric motor system technology. The goal is to capture more than $590 million in energy savings by the year 2000. Motor Challenge has more than 1,000 partners and last year reached more than 10,000 consumers through video conferencing and the program's information clearinghouse. The Fiscal Year 1997 budget will provide technical assistance to the Industries of the Future program described below. The Climate Wise program promotes industrial energy efficiency and pollution prevention. Companies voluntarily pledge to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. By the end of 1995, more than 60 Climate Wise partners, representing 6% of U.S. industrial energy consumption, have committed to a reduction of 5 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by the year 2000. By improving resource productivity, these partners are saving $80 million annually. The program has created partnerships with seven states. In Fiscal Year 1997, these partnerships will be expanded to 15 states. The Industrial Assessment Center program offers no-cost energy and waste assessments to small and medium-sized manufacturers in 43 states. The 30 industrial assessment centers are operated out of universities by faculty and students who conduct the assessments and recommend improvements. The centers perform 900 assessments per year. The average assessment recommends improvements that could save the manufacturer $55,000 per year. The program returns $13 for every Federal dollar invested. The Fiscal Year 1997 budget will allow the centers to conduct longer, two-day audits to provide pollution prevention and productivity recommendations. Energy for Tomorrow The Industries of the Future initiative is a fundamentally new approach to the development of industrial technology. The initiative aligns Federal R&D with the needs of seven of the nation's most energy and waste-intensive industries: forest products, steel, metalcasting, aluminum, glass, chemicals and petroleum refining. These industries are vital to the U.S. economy. They employ 2.3 million people directly and provide the basic materials essential to the entire U.S. manufacturing sector. At the same time, they account for 80% of the energy consumed and about 80% of the wastes generated in manufacturing. Each participating industry creates a vision reflecting the dynamic impact of market, business, social and regulatory drivers in their sectors. The vision provides a framework for shaping major advancements in technology. DOE facilitates the process, then draws from the vision's menu of possibilities to shape a portfolio of near, medium, and long-term research, development and deployment activities. This strategic planning also enhances productivity and reduces environmental compliance costs. Current negotiations between the American Forest and Paper Association and the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, may result in substantially reduced compliance costs for air and water regulation--from $11.5 billion down to $3-$4 billion. By the end of Fiscal Year 1996, visions are expected to be completed for all seven target industries. The Fiscal Year 1997 budget will increase funding for research in all seven industries to respond to needs identified in the vision process, such as sensors and controls for the forest products industry; recycling and environmental research for the steel industry; and advanced materials and improved energy and combustion technologies for the glass industry. Benefits Energy Savings: Reduce annual industrial end-use energy consumption by 0.6 quadrillion BTUs in 2000 and 2.0 quadrillion BTUs in 2010. Cost Savings: Save $3 billion in direct energy costs annually by 2000 and $11 billion by 2010 (in 1995 dollars). Pollution Prevention: Reduce annual emissions by the equivalent of 14 million metric tons of carbon in 2000, and 43 million metric tons in 2010, with associated decreases in regulated air, water and toxic emissions. Market Profile: Industrial Efficiency U.S. industry accounts for 25% of America's gross national product (GNP) and more than 25 million jobs. Technologies that improve the productivity of U.S. industries improve the entire economy. Small and medium-sized manufacturers (employing 20 to 499 people) comprise about 64% of the overall manufacturing sector. Typically, these firms do not have in-house expertise for pollution prevention or energy efficiency. Industries consume 36% of the energy used in the U.S., at a cost of nearly $100 billion each year. This level of energy use provides ample opportunities for savings. Industries spend $45 billion per year to meet emissions control regulations. Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can prevent pollution before it occurs, freeing industrial capital for more productive purposes. The development of new U.S. pollution prevention technologies can help American businesses capture the growing world markets for environmental technologies. That market is expected to reach $425 billion annually by 1997.

Designers, builders,developers, financiers, material suppliers and household equipment manufacturers areworking together to build 300 homes that are much more energy efficient thanconventional houses in the Chicago area. Built by Shaw Homes, these houses will reduceenergy use by 19% over Shaw's current practice in Prairie Crossing, which isalready 36% better than the Chicago area's current codes. Energy savings are only oneof the benefits. The cost of constructing the new houses will be reduced by $1,000. They also feature improved indoor air quality, enhanced health and comfort foroccupants, greater durability and reduced construction wastes. The Chicagoteam is one of four sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy under itsBuilding America Program. The goal is to show how America's housing stock can becomemore affordable and more resource efficient when the diverse professionsinvolved in homebuilding work together in a "systems engineering" approach. BuildingAmerica promises to revolutionize the home building industry. America's buildings have an extraordinary impact on ourlives. They affect the health of the economy: Residential and commercial buildings usemore than one third of all the energy consumed in the U.S., at a cost of $200 billioneach year. They affect the environment: The energy used in U.S. buildings isresponsible for as much greenhouse gas emissions as the total carbon emissions ofJapan and the United Kingdom combined. They have an impact on poverty: Families earning less than 150% of the poverty level typically spend as much as 15% oftheir income on energy compared to less than 4% for other families. New technologies and new design and construction practicescan make buildings healthier, cleaner and more efficient. But bringing thesenew technologies to the U.S. building industry is difficult. The industry investsrelatively little in research and development. One reason is that it consists of a largenumber of small builders, architects, suppliers and manufacturers of buildingequipment and appliances. DOE's buildings programs are designed to encourage closecollaboration among these professions. DOE's buildings programs focus on three areas: commercialbuildings, residential buildings, and building equipment and appliances. In eachof these, DOE invests to capture near-term energy savings as well as save energy inthe longer term. Fiscal Year 1997 Highlights Energy for Today The Office works to capture the many opportunities fornear-term energy savings in the building sector. Residential Buildings The Weatherization Assistance Program partners withstates and local service organizations to lower the energy costs ofresidences occupied by low-income people, particularly the elderly, the handicapped andfamilies with children. More than 4.4 million homes have been weatherized under thisprogram. The typical family served by the program earns less than$8,000 a year, and realizes an 18% reduction in heating costs. Each million dollarsinvested in the program directly or indirectly supports 74 jobs. DOE funding hasencouraged state and local weatherization agencies to leverage more than $200 millionannually from other sources. The Affordable Homes for Low-Income Housing Programhelps develop energy efficient design guidelines for new low-incomehousing and rehabilitated public housing. The program offers technical assistance topublicly owned and assisted housing agencies and non-profit housing providers,including Habitat for Humanity. Its goal is to achieve energy efficiency gainsof 30%. The Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS) Program supports pilot efforts by states to implement home rating systems linked to energyefficient financing. Home Energy Rating Systems demonstrate the value of energyefficiency to lenders, and help homeowners recover that value in the housingmarket. Commercial Buildings The Office's flagship program for retrofitting existingcommercial buildings is Rebuild America. Initiated in 1995, it has createdpartnerships among community and regional organizations, private businesses,utilities and technical experts to renovate commercial and multi-family residentialbuildings. In partnership with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, withnon-profit organizations in Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco, and with the statesof Colorado, Wisconsin and Tennessee, the program will reduce operating costs forbuilding owners and tenants by $650 million annually within the next five years,while increasing the comfort of the tenants and reducing air pollution. Theprogram has attracted a private-to-DOE funding ratio of 70:1. Appliances and Building Equipment The Technology Introduction Partnership Program workswith appliance retailers, manufacturers, and other organizations toaccelerate the commercialization of efficient appliances and equipment. Examples includeworking with major hotel and motel chains to improve the efficiency of the bestavailable packaged terminal air conditioners. The program also includes a collaborativeeffort involving 40 utilities to produce coordinated rebate and information programs thathelp customers purchase high-efficiency heating, ventilating and airconditioning equipment. The Lighting and Appliance Standards Program uses ananalysis-based process to develop energy efficiency standards. In FiscalYear 1997, the program will continue improving this process for increased and earlierparticipation by stakeholders, and for more thorough economic analysis. Theprogram will also develop new analytical methods and improved data collectionfor all lighting and appliance rulemaking. It will review efficiency testprocedures and revise them to ensure that innovative designs can be tested fairly. The Solar Buildings Appliances Research and DevelopmentProgram, through support to the Utility Solar Hot Water Consortium,has achieved 20-30% increases in market penetration for solar domestic hot watersystems with 15-20% reductions in installed costs. The next generationprototype of equipment will have 25-40% increases in cost-effectiveness. State and Municipal Programs The State Energy Program consolidates two previousgrant programs--the Institutional Conservation Program and State EnergyConservation Program--giving states greater flexibility to address their own energyproblems. The program helps states, territories and the District of Columbia maintaintheir capacity to plan and implement their own programs, respond to energy emergencies,leverage other resources and enter into technology deployment and relatedpartnerships with DOE and private partners. The program will supportapproximately 6,300 jobs in Fiscal Year 1997. The Municipal Energy Management Program supportslocal government projects that help communities become more energy efficientand more economically and environmentally sustainable. Reduced energy costsallow cities to cut taxes or devote tax resources to other needs. Energy for Tomorrow The Office also operates programs designed to developadvanced technologies and construction practices that will produce greater benefits inthe future. Residential Buildings The Building America Program creates industryconsortia to develop a systems engineering approach to work together toproduce more efficient and affordable housing and faster, less wastefulconstruction practices. The first prototype of the Integrated Building and ConstructionSolutions consortium has achieved a 40% reduction in annual energy use. The Exemplary Residential Buildings Program advancesthe contribution of passive solar design in combination with energyefficiency, to provide up to 75% of the heating, cooling and lighting requirements in newbuildings with little or no increase in construction cost. The Building Standards and Guidelines Programprovides technical and financial help to states to upgrade and implement theirresidential and commercial building energy codes to eliminate inefficient design andconstruction practices. The program also helps upgrade voluntary model codes anddevelops energy efficiency codes for Federal buildings. About 20 grants to stateswill be provided in 1997. Commercial Buildings The Design for Best Practices Program develops designtools that provide information on energy efficiency at each phase ofthe building life cycle to help architects, builders, owners and operators optimizeefficiency investments. Research on Building Materials and Structuresdevelops environmentally benign materials, including advanced insulation and buildingenvelopes, to significantly lower heating and cooling demands. Windows and Glazing research focuses onelectrochromic and "superwindow" technologies, including government-industrypartnerships to commercialize electrochromic windows by 1999, reducingenergy loss through windows by 20%. Appliances and Building Equipment The Lighting Research Program works with industry todevelop improved lighting systems and applications that will reduce energyuse by 50%. Space Conditioning Research and Development, inpartnership with industry, is developing advanced technology to enable thehighly efficient use of natural gas in heating and cooling. The generator-absorberheat exchange (GAX) cycle heat pump developed by this program will be introducedto the market in 1999. The Advanced Refrigeration Systems Program conductsapplied research to develop highly energy-efficient heat pump andrefrigeration technology using refrigerants that don't deplete the earth's ozone layer. Benefits Energy Savings: 0.6 quadrillion BTUs per year by2000, 2.9 quadrillion BTUs by 2010. Cost Savings: $5 billion per year by 2000 and $23billion by 2010. Pollution Prevention: 13 million metric tons ofcarbon equivalent by 2000, 58 million by 2010. Market Profile Buildings use 36% of America's energy and 66% ofits electricity. The trend for energy use is upward. Between 1995 and2015, America will add an estimated 24 million households and 17 billion square feetof commercial floor space. This could increase energy use by 5.7 quadrillionBTUs--equivalent to the total energy use of Virginia and Ohio. The potential for savings is great. A 30% improvementin U.S. building efficiency would reduce consumer costs by approximately $100billion. Many buildings were built long ago and contain obsoleteenergy systems. About 80% of our commercial buildings were constructed prior to1979. In new construction, the consequences of energy-relateddecisions last a long time. The median lifetime for commercial buildings isbetween 60 and 90 years. Nearly 28 million households are eligible for DOE'sWeatherization Assistance Program. These households typically have incomes below$8,000 and spend a disproportionate share of that income on energy.

Thousands of American drivers already have taken a step toward that future, driving alternative fuel cars like those running on natural gas. But these pioneers have been forced to sacrifice some conveniences. Natural gas cars typically have lower driving range, and their cargo space is consumed by fuel tanks. Many motorists consider those sacrifices too steep a price to pay. Now, DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies is leading a team of partners that has unveiled a major breakthrough--an Advanced Natural Gas Vehicle (ANGV) with a range nearly double that of its predecessors and within 15% of gasoline cars. The new vehicle reclaims most of the trunk space lost in early models. The breakthrough, honored by Popular Science Magazine as one of the 100 most significant achievements of 1995, uses an advanced engine for fuel efficiency, a restructured underchassis for fuel tanks and a racing-type tire that can operate without air, creating more trunk space by eliminating the need for a spare tire and jack. The Office and its partners -- including Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Lincoln Composites, Chesapeake Automotive Enterprises, Goodyear Tire and Chrysler--now are working on a second generation ANGV with even greater range and space, and capable of mass production. The vision of a transportation system powered by clean domestic fuels is coming into reach. If the United States hopes to make any real progress in reducing the foreign trade deficit, oil imports and greenhouse gases--and if we want America's automotive industry to remain strong against tough international competition--then we must accomplish two goals. First, we must develop vehicles with radically improved fuel economy--and get them on the road. Second, we must develop and use cost-competitive, domestic and clean transportation fuels. We must do both without sacrifices in the cost, convenience, safety and performance of our vehicles and transportation systems. Fiscal Year 1997 Highlights Energy for Today Through its popular Clean Cities Program, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Deployment Program has helped bring about a 300% increase in the number of alternative fuel refueling facilities nationwide, and an increase in the number of alternative fuel vehicle models available to American consumers from U.S. automakers. In Fiscal Year 1997, the program will launch a coast-to-coast "clean corridor" system linking clean cities along major interstates. The program's near-term goals are to make cross-country travel as convenient in alternative fuel vehicles as in those using gasoline, and to get 435,000 alternative fuel vehicles on U.S. roads in 1997. The Alternative Fuel Vehicle R&D Program conducts research on innovative engines that use alternative fuels. Grants to states have funded 235 alternative fuel school buses and heavy-duty municipal vehicles and helped develop an advanced natural gas car that achieves a 300-mile range. In Fiscal Year 1997, the program will continue to demonstrate advanced alternative fuel vehicles that provide improved range and reduced emissions, with performance equivalent to conventional vehicles. With fleets paving the way for more, lower cost vehicle production, and the installation of refueling capability, the goal is to make alternative fuel vehicles the choice of many individual private vehicle purchasers by the year 2000. Energy for Tomorrow In Fiscal Year 1997, the Office of Transportation Technologies will continue its lead research and development role in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), an initiative begun in late 1993 involving eight Federal agencies, the Big Three automakers, and their supplier base. The program's top priority during the year will be work on technologies most critical to tripling automobile fuel economy--a key part of the objective of developing a production prototype six-passenger family sedan in the next 10 years that will get up to 80 miles to a gallon of gasoline and will emit 80% fewer greenhouse gases, with no sacrifice in safety, cost or performance. PNGV-related research includes Hybrid Propulsion System R&D, with the goal of doubling automotive fuel economy through propulsion system advances by 1998. Light Duty Engine R&D focuses on engines with significant near to mid-term potential for improving fuel efficiency in either prime power or hybrid vehicle applications. The near-term objective is to demonstrate a light-duty engine with a 20-30% improvement in fuel economy over conventional engines. The Propulsion System Materials Program will develop thermally resistant materials for propulsion subsystem efficiency gains. The Lightweight Vehicle Materials Program will reduce vehicle mass, which is essential to achieving significantly higher fuel efficiency and reduced emissions in automobiles. Fiscal Year 1997 funding will restore the goal of reducing vehicle weight 35% by 2005, compared to a 1995 baseline. Activities in 1997 also include Fuel Cell R&D aiming for exceptionally energy-efficient vehicles with almost zero emissions. Funding will be used to complete major lab validation of on-board fuel cells powered by methanol and hydrogen. Other research programs include Heavy Duty Engine R&D to develop clean diesel technologies with dramatically reduced emissions while further improving the already high fuel efficiency and alternative fuel capability of these engines. The second major element of the Office's longer-term R&D program is development and use of fuels that are low-cost, clean and domestic. This includes development of alternative fuels and vehicles, and advanced batteries that enable the use of electricity as an alternative fuel. The Biofuels Program is helping industry develop transportation fuels from domestic biomass resources. Key research focuses on producing ethanol from switchgrass, agricultural and forestry residues and waste paper. The program plans to reduce the cost of ethanol from its current $1.22 per gallon to 70 cents within 10 years. The program will result in commercial production of 200 million gallons of biomass fuels by the year 2000, rising to 9 billion gallons by 2020, displacing more than 220 million barrels of imported oil each year. In Fiscal Year 1997, the program will work with an industrial partner to complete design and initial construction of a cost-shared biomass- to-ethanol plant. The Electric Vehicle R&D Program focuses on advanced batteries for electric vehicles. The program is conducted under a cooperative agreement between DOE and the Big Three's Advanced Battery Consortium, with participation by the Electric Power Research Institute. Advances by the Consortium will reduce the cost of batteries while greatly increasing the range and performance of electric and hybrid vehicles. Market Profile: Transportation Efficiency Each day, Americans use 4 million more barrels of oil for transportation than we produce. The gap is projected to rise to 8 million barrels by 2010. America imports about 50% of the oil it uses, adding to our trade deficit and making the economy vulnerable to price swings and supply disruptions. Transportation energy consumption is up 19% since 1980. A key reason: Americans are driving over 50% more miles. Only 13% of the energy used by vehicles actually propels them forward; much of the rest could be saved with advanced technology. Under EPACT and a Presidential Executive Order, 75% of new Federal fleet vehicles must be powered by alternative fuels by 1999. EPACT also requires DOE to develop and deploy enough alternative fuels to replace 10% of the oil consumption of light-duty vehicles by 2000 and 30% by 2010. Benefits Energy Savings: Total primary oil savings of 0.1 quadrillion BTUs by the year 2000, 1.9 quadrillion BTUs by 2010 and 4.7 quadrillion BTUs by 2020. Cost Savings: Over $2 billion in energy cost savings by the year 2000 (in 1995 dollars), $33 billion by 2010 and $60 billion in 2020. Pollution Prevention: One million metric tons of carbon equivalent emissions by the year 2000, 24 million metric tons by 2010 and 65 million metric tons by 2020.

At Kirtland Air Force Base, the Defense Department expects to save more than $500,000 annually with new procedures to reduce water and sewage use, plus more than $7 million annually through energy efficiency improvements. Kirtland is the first project in the "New Mexico Initiative", a comprehensive energy and water savings program at Federal facilities throughout the state. The Kirtland agreement -- signed by the City of Albuquerque, Kirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, the State Engineers Office, and Public Service Company of New Mexico--is making the base a model of resource efficiency for other Federal installations. Energy efficiency projects like this expanded to all Defense Department installations will save more money than the scheduled base closures. Translated throughout the Federal government, efficiency projects can save $15 billion by 2015. As the world's largest consumer of goods and services, the Federal government has a major impact on the marketplace. When the government buys energy efficient and environmentally-sound products, it saves money for taxpayers, helps good products obtain a foothold in the economy and reduces waste and environmental damages. Today the Federal government spends about $8 billion yearly on energy for its fleets, buildings and operations. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Executive Order 12902 direct agencies to reduce consumption 30% by the year 2005, compared to 1985 levels. Cumulative net savings will total more than $15 billion by 2015. At the same time, we get free pollution prevention. DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) is charged with leading this effort and is establishing public-private partnerships to achieve deficit reduction. Fiscal Year 1997 Highlight Energy for Today In Fiscal Year 1997, FEMP will attract at least $40 million in new private investments for Federal energy efficiency projects. A new Energy Saver Performance Contract will be issued to simplify and accelerate private sector investment. FEMP will expand its efforts to utilize incentives offered by utilities. In addition, FEMP provides technical assistance and is establishing Partner Resource Centers with utilities, energy service companies, industry and states to make FEMP publications, training, audits and software widely available. FEMP also leads energy efficiency efforts within the Department of Energy. The In-House Energy Management program saves DOE more than $100 million in utility expenses annually. Each $1 invested in energy efficiency at DOE facilities yields approximately $5 in net return. Energy for Tomorrow During Fiscal Year 1997, FEMP will develop and implement a Federal Renewable Initiative, providing technical training, project financing negotiations and renewable energy showcase projects in Federal facilities. Through the FEMP-State Initiative, FEMP is working closely with State Energy Offices, some of whom have considerable experience with their own facilities, to strengthen the local infrastructure and investment pool so more Federal and state projects can be implemented. FEMP has worked with the Office of Management and Budget to issue a Federal Procurement Challenge--a voluntary, government-wide commitment to use Federal buying power to reduce energy costs and expand markets for energy efficient and water-conserving technologies. Twenty-two agencies, representing more than 95% of Federal buying power, pledged to take the Challenge. FEMP is providing its customers direct technical help through Regional Energy Action Project Teams at DOE's six Regional Support Offices: Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Seattle. In Fiscal Year 1997, the teams will continue to support FEMP and its customers through direct technical help. Benefits Energy Savings: A 20% reduction in energy use by all agencies by 2000, and a 30% reduction by 2005. Taxpayer Savings: $380 million annually by 2000 for a cumulative net total of $20 billion by 2015. Leveraging: More than $1 billion in private investments from utilities and other organizations by the year 2000. Pollution Prevention: Over 2 million metric tons of carbon equivalent in 2005.

General Comments "The (emerging era) brings with it a genuinely new way of life based on diversified, renewable energy sources...sensible technologies matched to the new, sustainable energy system toward which we are beginning to reach." Author and Futurist Alvin Toffler "Energy is one of the critical ingredients of our Nation's economic security. The Department of Energy is the vital nexus between energy security and national security and should not be abolished. To dismantle the focal point of U.S. energy policy in order to realize only a small budgetary savings would send a strong message that the United States no longer recognizes the importance of energy security to our Nation's economic future." Joint letter from Thomas Kuhn, Edison Electric Institute; Richard Lawson, National Coal Association; Randall Swisher, American Wind Energy Association; Gary Elliott, National BioEnergy Industries Association; Scott Sklar, Solar Energy Industries Association; and Linda Church Ciocci, National Hydropower Association Renewable Energy "The Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology Program is making a positive contribution to the U.S. PV industry. The PVMaT program helps U.S. photovoltaic companies compete with foreign competitors (many of whom are receiving support from their governments) and helps develop photovoltaics as an alternative energy source." Harvey Forest, President, Solarex Corporation "PVMaT has enabled AstroPower to bring an exciting new product to the marketplace. This is the first new solar cell technology to come to the market in the last 15 years. It likely would not have happened with continuing U.S. ownership without PVMaT." Allen M. Barnett, President, AstroPower, Inc. Energy Efficient Buildings "Continued support and assistance from the Department of Energy is vital. The industry is at a critical juncture ready to assimilate new approaches into the residential building process....This is truly a public and private partnership where combined research, know how and funding is aligned in a positive way, and not in a regulatory way, to help the homebuilding industry." Michael Dickens, President of IBACOS, on Building America Program "Kansas City is particularly pleased to be a partner in DOE's Rebuild America program. Our program, the Kansas City Energy Efficiency Partnership, is an exciting new way of doing business for DOE; it provides local communities the flexibility to design and tailor a program to their own needs. We are encouraged by the potential of programs like Rebuild America and urge Congress to continue to fund these partnership programs, particularly those that are helping our nation's cities to help themselves." Mayor Emanuel Cleaver II, Kansas City, Missouri Industrial Energy Programs "The Motor Challenge serves as a model for public and private teamwork to accomplish shared goals in the energy and environmental arenas." David Buzzelli, V.P. and Corporate Director, Environmental, Health and Safety and Public Affairs, The Dow Chemical Company "The NICE3 Program provided the last one hundred yards of the product development marathon to my company. It does exactly what it is designed to do and gives small companies a chance to be competitive. My company would not be in business today if it weren't for the NICE3 Program." John Gaughan, President, Catalyst and Chemical Services, Inc. "I am not a big fan of government. Over the years I've been critical of many regulatory, legislative and judicial actions, particularly as they affect the pulp and paper industry. That's why the next statement may be a bit strange. There is a very positive governmental program that directly affects the pulp and paper industry. Specifically, it's the Department of Energy's Industries of the Future Program." Alan Rooks, Editor-in-Chief, Paper Industry Management Association Magazine Alternative Fuel and Turbine Engine Programs "What is really nice about getting involved in alternative fuels and the Clean Cities Program is we get a lot of private companies to buy into the program. We're looking at a lot of different ways to improve the environment but at the same time new products, which of course create new jobs . That is what I think most Governors and elected officials have got to look to. How do we improve the quality of life so...(it will be) better to live in that community and that state (tomorrow) than it is today and-- Clean Cities gives us that opportunity." Governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin "The DOE ceramic gas turbine programs have enabled U.S. ceramic and gas turbine manufacturers to introduce structural ceramics into commercial use, such as the auxiliary power oil pump parts for the new Boeing 777 and Airbus A330/340. The continuing partnership between DOE and Allied Signal in the transportation and industrial ceramic programs ensures that there will be a competitive manufacturer and leading edge turbine engine technology in the U.S., which will provide more energy efficiency power sources, both in the U.S. and abroad." Dr. Maxine Savitz, General Manager, Allied Signal "With the Clean Cities network, we don't have to sell the concept of alternative fuels, we only have to sell the vehicles, which is what we do best." Tom Artushin, Ford Motor Company Federal Energy Management Program "The New Mexico Initiative is a great example of how the public and private sectors can work together to save our important energy and water resources. We need these types of water and energy resource champions for our future." Senator Pete Domenici, New Mexico "FEMP has been and continues to be the honest broker helping agencies reduce their energy costs by bringing together utilities like ConEd with our Federal partners. ConEd's commitment to the environment has been greatly aided by FEMP's efforts. FEMP should be applauded for their continuing outstanding work for citizens of this country."

FromDOE's laboratories and from its partnerships with states and industries, newproducts are coming to your home, your community and your workplace. For example, some utilities are already talking about building their next powerplants on the roofs of their customers' homes, in the form of rooftop solar energysystems. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is helping tomake that happen. It has helped the U.S. solar industry develop a revolutionarynew roofing shingle that produces electricity. The new shingle is just as durableas an ordinary asphalt shingle, but it is covered by a thin film of photovoltaicmaterial that generates power when exposed to sunlight. The shingles can provide electricity to the homes underneath them, or back into the utility grid. And they avoid the aesthetic concerns sometimes raised by more traditional rooftopsolar collectors. Solar shingles are just one of the new energy technologies DOE is helping produce. Better lighting, appliances, wind turbines, industrial processes, automobiles--allare part of the portfolio of new products that will prevent pollution, saveenergy, reduce oil imports and create new jobs. More examples are included inthis booklet, along with details of DOE's proposed energy efficiency and renewableenergy budget for Fiscal Year 1997. The budget is a blueprint for America'senergy future--a future in which the environment is cleaner, the economy is morerobust, and the nation is more secure.

It examines the investments made to create the savings, the savings achieved, and the projected savings to the year 2015. The Federal Energy ManagementProgram (FEMP) providesthis report to document one of the most successful energy managementprograms in the country. Federal energy management has been an activity of the governmentsince the late 1970's, when energy conservation was a necessary response to the energy crunchbrought on by the Oil Embargo of 1973–74, natural gas shortages in 1977–78 and theIranian Hostage Crisis in 1979. Through a series of energy policy laws and executive orders, theFederal government was mandated to become more efficient and reduce its use of petroleum. Under these mandates Federal energy management is a shared responsibility, met throughindependent but coordinated actions of Federal agencies. By responding to the initial energycrises of the 1970's the Federal government discovered that energy efficiency improvement madeeconomic and fiscal sense—that it was just good business practice. FEMP's role is to serveas the advocate, enabler and facilitator of Federal energy management, leading Federal agenciesto accomplish energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water conservation goals. The Federal government is the single largest energy consumer inthe nation, with 1.2 quadrillion Btu (quad) delivered to the point of use in Fiscal Year (FY) 19941. This energy helps house and support our service men and women; fuels vehicles, aircraft, andships; powers government research and development; and keeps government offices lighted,heated and cooled, allowing Federal employees to more productively perform their jobs. Thereare approximately 500,000 Federal buildings, with over 3.1 billion square feet of floorspace. It is also probably the most diversely located set of energy uses as well—covering all 50states and overseas, and all climate zones. Federal energy management has already achieved significant success,with quantifiable results. Federal energy management is sound business practice; increasedenergy efficiency through improved training, maintenance methods, conservation practices,capital retrofit projects, efficient new building design and efficient product procurementhas led to reduced energy consumption and costs and increased pollution prevention, as wellas increased Federal productivity. The accumulated savings from energy improvements in Federal buildingsand facilities, FEMP's mandated programmatic focus, was $9.8 billion through FY 1994. Looking ahead, consistent application of energy efficiency improvements and use of solarand renewable energy technologies in Federal buildings is expected to result in additionalannual savings of approximately $1 billion per year by 2005 from current levels,and an additional cumulative net savings of $15 billion by 2015. The Record of Success—Meeting the Fiscal Year 1995 Goal The National Energy Conservation Policy Act, Section 543, as amendedby the Energy Policy Act of 1992, established the FY 1995 goal of improving energyefficiency in Federal buildings by 10 percent from 1985 levels on a Btu per gross square footof floor area basis. This goal was exceeded in FY 1994, with a total government reduction in Btu per gross square foot of floor are of 11.2 percent. In meeting this goal the Federal agencies compiled tremendous successes in energy and cost reduction. As part of the Federal energy management effort, the major agenciesreport information on energy use and cost, as well as other relevant information, toCongress on an annual basis2. This information provides a validated record of achievement. This record runs from Fiscal Year 1980 through Fiscal Year 1994. Preliminary results for Fiscal Year 1995 are currently being reviewed and confirmed by FEMP and the agencies. All energy andcost amounts in this report are based on this historical record. Savings are calculated fromFiscal Year 1985 levels, the base year for goal measurement specified in current legislation andexecutive orders. All dollar amounts are expressed in constant 1994 dollars. The key resultsare: FY 1994 energy costs decreased by $1.5 billion from1985 levels. $9.8 billion in cumulative energy cost savings accruedover the FY 1985 through 1994 period. FY 1994 site energy consumption in buildings was18.2 percent less in absolute terms than in Fiscal Year 1985. FY 1994 Federal buildings petroleum-based fuel usedeclined 45.4 percent from 1985 levels, addressing energy security goals. Electricity consumption increased 7.7 percent from1985 levels. The Federal government has invested taxpayer dollars to achievethese accomplishments. A cumulative total of $3.3 billion dollars in Federal appropriationswere invested from FY 1980 through FY 1994 for capital energy efficiency projects. Basedon the experience of the Department of Energy In-House Energy Management Program (IHEM),these investments can, on average, be expected to return $5 for every $1 invested, witha 25 percent annual return on investment over a 20 year project life. Based on this experience the investment in place in FY 1994 can be reasonably expected to produce an additional $10 billion in energy cost savings through the year 2015. Analysis of Federal Energy Cost Savings The reported $1.5 billion reduction in Federal energy bills representsthe sum total of all changes that contributed to energy use and cost reduction in Federal buildings. Based on the IHEM experience, cost savings from Federal efficiency investment inFY 1994 should have been about $5.2 billion, or about $4.6 billion less than that reported. In order to partially explain this difference, the energy costs savings were adjusted3 for an observedreal energy price decline and a reduction in Federal buildings gross square footage over theFY 1985 to FY 1994 period. Federal buildings energy cost reduction in FY 1994 from the 1985 baseline, as reported by Federal agencies was $1.498 billion. This annual energy cost savings is reduced by $ .181 billion to reflect real energy price decreases from 1985, and $ .067 billion to reflect decreased gross square footage in Federal buildings. These effects represent 17 percent of the FY 1994 cost reductions resulting in net savings of $1.25 billion. This $1.25 billion in annual savings can be attributed to investmentsin efficiency projects (reported as $3.3 billion from FY 1980, the earliest reporteddata, to FY 1994), and to operations and maintenance actions, and other non-investment actions thatresulted in net energy use reductions. While energy and cost savings directly resultingfrom investments are not available, cost savings in FY 1994 from the investment stream can be reasonablyestimated using the DOE IHEM experience. Based on the Federal energy project investment stream from FY 1980 through FY 1994, approximately $ .718 billion of the $1.25 billion in energy cost savings, excluding price and gross square foot effects, can be attributed to those investments. The remaining $ .532 billion in savings can be partially attributed to operations and maintenance actions, the costs of which are not separately accounted for by agencies. Federal energy cost savings are also effected by two other importantfactors, weather variability and change in energy utilization. Weather variability can benormalized through use of heating and cooling degree-days, however integrating the differences inweather conditions at thousands of Federal sites nationwide is impractical. It is reasonableto assume that weather effects, when averaged over the entire nation over a ten year period, wouldnot have a significant effect on savings. Federal energy utilization in buildings since FY 1985has probably changed substantially, with office automation accelerating in the late1980's through FY 1994. Although not tracked, increased use of energy consuming equipment wouldtend to reduce reported energy and cost savings, thus understating the effectiveness of Federalenergy management efforts. Further, changes in energy utilization can also be positivelyaffected through installation of more modern equipment that, while not accounted for in energy projectinvestments, consumes less energy to operate (e.g. photocopiers). It should be noted thatFederal investments in energy efficiency retrofits do not account for replacement of inefficientequipment that has reached the end of its useful life; these replacements are made from otheroperating accounts. This analysis suggests that the Federal energy management infrastructure,in addition to identifying and installing capital energy efficiency retrofits,is seeking out and implementing efficiency changes in operations and maintenance, new buildingdesign, replacement equipment procurement, as well as undertaking simple conservation actions(e.g. removing unneeded equipment). It also suggests a future need for assessing thecosts and impacts of these non-investment actions. Projected Savings—Meeting FY 2000 and 2005 Goals The Energy Policy Act of 1992, and Executive Order 12902 establishedFederal buildings efficiency goals of 20 percent and 30 percent reduction in FY2000 and FY 2005, respectively, in energy consumption per gross square foot of building area. Thesegoals challenge Federal agencies to double the rate of efficiency improvement over thatof the past ten years. Successful accomplishment of the FY 2000 and FY 2005 goals willresult in enough energy savings to produce a net $15 billion in energy cost savings through2015. FEMP, in a draft study4 of investment needed to meet the established energy savings goals, estimated that over $6 billion in funding from FY 1996 through FY 2004 would be neededto meet the energy savings goals. The draft study projected a significant shift in fundingsource from Federal appropriations to private sector financing in the form of Energy Savings PerformanceContracts (ESPCs). While private sector financing accomplishes the same energy savingsas those funded through Federal appropriations, the cost savings realized by the government aredivided between the government and the private sector contractor. This results in a net totalreturn of $2.5 to the Federal government for every $1 invested through ESPCs. Table 1. Estimated Efficiency Investment and Net Energy Savings*Over Life of Projects 1994 Constant Dollars Investment Period and Type Cumulative Project Investment (Billion) Cumulative Net Energy Cost Savings (Billion)** FY 1982–1994 Federal Appropriations $3.3 $13.3 Savings end in 2014 FY 1995–2004*** Federal Appropriations $2.8 $11.2 ESPCs $1.1 $ 2.8 Utility Incentives $ .4 $ 2.0 Sub-Total $4.3 $16.0 Savings end in 2024 Grand Total $7.6 $29.3 * Does not account for savings resulting from O&M, utilizationchanges, building retirements, weather, etc. Historical experience1985–1994 showed a real cumulative savings of $9.8 billion in Federal energybills versus an estimated $5.2 billion savings attributable to project investments. ** Gross estimated savings minus investment.

The cost saving impacts of Federal energy management investment,should investment continue through FY 2004 at anticipated levels, should extend through theyear 2024. Table 1 summarizes the net investment and energy cost savings from Federalenergy management. FEMP's additional mission focus of water conservation will providecost savings as well. While specific data on Federal water use has not been precisely measured,FEMP estimates that the annual Federal water/sewer bill approaches $1 billion annually. FEMP also estimates that the Federal government could save over $240 million each year by installingcost effective water conservation measures such as low-flush toilets, faucet controls,and landscape irrigation controls. Conclusion Reported Federal energy costs, when examined in a constant dollaranalysis, demonstrate the effectiveness of Federal energy management efforts. Key conclusionsof this study are: FY 1994 18.2 percent energy consumption reductionand $1.5 billion energy cost reduction from FY 1985 are significant and real. An additional $10 billion in energy cost savingswill accrue over the life of investment projects already in place in FY 1994. Over $15 billion in additional net energy cost savingswill accrue from FY 1995 through FY 2015 if sufficient Federal and private sectorinvestment is put in place through FY 2004. Net cost savings should exceed $21billion over the life of all past and potential future investment. An active and effective Federal energy managementinfrastructure is critical to implementing efficiency investments, and securing significantsavings from non-investment energy management actions. Federal investment accounts for 48 percent of therealized FY 1994 cost savings; other non-investment actions account for 35 percentof cost savings. Average total return on Federal energy efficiencyinvestment can be expected to be $5 for $1 invested; net return to the governmentis $4:$1 for projects funded through appropriations, $2.5:$1 for private sector fundedprojects. Real energy price decline, and reduction Federalbuilding gross square footage account for 17 percent of FY 1994 savings. APPENDIX A. Adjusting FY 1994 Federal Buildings Energy Cost Savings for Changesin Energy Prices and Gross Square Footage The purpose of the following set of calculations is to estimatethe net cost savings impact of Federal energy management actions in Federal buildings over theperiod of FY 1985 to 1994. Two effects are removed from the reported energy cost savings,1) energy savings resulting from reductions in Federal buildings gross square footage, and 2) energycost savings due to real reductions in the reported cost of energy. All calculations use1994 constant dollars.

Energy efficiency and renewableenergy are economic "wins" for participants in "Energy Partnershipsfor a Strong Economy: A Better Climate for Jobs." Business, industry, States, local communities and consumers benefitfrom new job opportunities; more affordable housing; cleaner air;and a sustainable, and therefore stable, economic base of businessand industry. Citizens benefit from redirection of their tax dollars into reduced energy costs. Industries enjoy newcost savings, smaller energy bills and renewed viability throughthe direct and indirect benefits of emerging technologies and thejobs they create. And yes, America's children will enjoy a cleaner environment. DOE's "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" is not a newbureaucracy. It is a fresh, innovative approach to environmentalquality and economic growth designed to leverage Federal dollarsthrough partnerships with private industry. These activities do not duplicate, but rather incorporate, existing State andFederal programs and accelerate their benefits. Above all, "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" is flexibleenough to meet the needs of our diverse Nation, while focusedenough to achieve America's economic and environmental goals.

At the U.S. Department of Energy, we call our activities "EnergyPartnerships for a Strong Economy," and we mean every single wordof it. Under a strong commitment to energy efficiency, renewable energyand environmental stewardship, programs are co-created by thepartners themselves. It is business, industry and government working together. Why participate? Because energy efficiency and renewable energysave money and the environment. This collaboration is flexible and responsive. It accelerates theimplementation of energy initiatives mandated by Congress in theEnergy Policy Act of 1992. And it's profitable. Our goal is sustainable economic development, including: greater productivity, increased competitiveness and higher profits, all accomplished while protecting the environment through energyefficiency and the use of renewable energy. You'll find that energy efficiency and renewable energy are oftenthe cleanest and least expensive ways to obtain energy - and theystrengthen the national economy, too. Energy efficiency activitiesimplemented from 1973 to 1986 are today saving American consumers $225 billion annually! Today's new energy technology gives us the opportunity to make evengreater strides. The American Council for an Energy EfficientEconomy estimates that national energy use could be cut in halffrom our 1988 levels by the year 2030 - saving $2.3 trillion and reducing carbon emissions by 70%. Take a moment to review the programs outlined in this guidebook. You'll learn how these national benefits extend to your bottomline. You'll discover that there are partnerships for everyonefrom utility companies to small businesses; from financialinstitutions to commercial and residential builders, owners andmanagers; from state and local governments to environmentalorganizations and other advocacy groups. If you find a program you'd like to participate in, or have one youwould like to create, call us at 1-800-DOE-EREC. Partnership Guide Table of Contents Commercial A national fast-food chain recently redesigned its retail outlets,putting more windows in front and removing an eave. Unfortunately,the changes caused the restaurants to overheat, particularly whenthe front of the building was oriented toward the sun. The Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratoryteamed with a heating and cooling contractor and the chain'sfacilities manager to audit the new design. Based on the team'srecommendations, the chain is using more efficient heating and cooling systems and reducing its window area. These changes areexpected to cut heating and cooling costs by 30% in each building. Consuming 11% of the nation's energy, commercial buildings offersignificant opportunities to save energy and prevent energy-relatedpollution. Heating and cooling systems, lighting and engineeringsystems in commercial and multi-family residential buildings are all targets for new energy-saving technologies. The"Energy Partnerships" initiative hits these targets with: Financial and technical help for community and regionalpartnerships that promote commercial efficiency. Financial and technical assistance to partnerships betweenmanufacturers, utilities and others to develop and markethigh-efficiency equipment. Competitive grants and training to help States update theircommercial building codes. Partnership Guide Table of Contents Rebuild America Goal Improve the energy efficiency of existing commercial andmulti-family buildings. Approach Form public/private partnerships that accelerate energy efficiencyimprovements to commercial and multi-family buildings. Promote wide-scale energy efficiency improvements throughestablished community and regional organizations involved inbuilding management, renovation and energy service. Provide financial and technical help for new efforts that improveand accelerate building renovation programs. Benefits More cash: Lower operating expenses lead to increased cash flowfor building owners. Greater economic growth: Lower energy costs free up cash forspending on other goods and services, leading to new jobs. Better marketability: Properties are more attractive to potential tenants. Increased pride: Building revitalization improves the businessclimate and community pride. Quality of life: Upgraded buildings increase comfort andproductivity. Partners Building designers Business leaders Business and trade organizations Educational institutions Financial institutions Economic development agencies Energy and environmental organizations National laboratories Product manufacturers and vendors Public and private building owners and managers Utilities State and local governments and energy offices For more information call 1-800-DOE-EREC Partnership Guide Table of Contents High-Efficiency Commercial Equipment Goal Increase development and sales of high-efficiency commercial gas and electric building equipment for waterheating, space heating and cooling, refrigeration, lighting anddishwashing.

A team of American experts from a variety of disciplinesranging from construction and economic redevelopment to environmental planningare offering their expertise to help with the rebuilding of the Kobe region inthe aftermath of the recent tragedy. This American team would work togetherwith local counterparts to develop a vision and series of concrete steps forthe sustainable re-development of Kobe. The process of providing thissustainable design assistance could be greatly facilitated by support from ourtwo countries' governments. The core American team would be comprised of members of the American Instituteof Architects (AIA), the Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology(CREST), Daybreak International, Global Environmental Options (GEO), theNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and the Union of InternationalArchitects (UIA). These organizations have consulted with staff in the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE) andDepartment of State (DOS) on this proposal. The American team is seeking todevelop a public/private partnership with both the Japanese and U.S.governments, as well as with private sector parties in both countries. Membersof the team have begun to make contact with their counterparts in Japan. The organizations represented by the American team have carried out"Environmental Design Charrettes" (EDC) of one form or another to kick-offsustainable design programs. Simply stated, an Environmental Design Charretteis a cooperative and integrated approach to design and planning problemsolving, which recognizes long-term economic and social development, andenvironmental responsibility as key components to the realization of asustainable vision. EDCs succeed in bringing diverse elements of a communitytogether in collaboration to develop a comprehensive view of theinterconnection between economic need, community development and long-termenvironmental sustainability. Over a several-day period, design professionals and community participantscould conduct an EDC to target opportunities to rebuild Kobe, taking intoaccount the community's vision for Kobe in the 21st century. Kobe could becomethe model environmental city advocated by Madame Wakako Hironaka, formerEnvironment Minister of Japan. A multi-discipline group ofexperts--experienced in the EDC process--will assist the local participants.In addition, teleconference, Internet, and satellite links can be establishedto create on-going communication between the project and outside resources. Bythe end of the Charrette, a successful EDC will have used a multi-faceted groupof community participants to identify and address the key sustainability issuesfor their chosen design problem. The EDC process has been successfully undertaken in several places in theUnited States, sometimes in response to natural disasters (Mississippi FloodwayCommunities), sometimes in response to economic problems (Chattanooga), or anenvironmental problem (Grand Canyon). Here are some specific examples of EDC'sthat have successfully merged environmental sustainability considerations andeconomic viability with building and community design: The Greening of the White House: A comprehensive, multi-year projectdesigned to improve energy efficiency and cut waste through the complex.Nearly 100 national experts from the fields of architecture, engineeringbuilding management and environmental concerns were brought together to engagein this process. Valmeyer, Illinois & Pattonsburg, Missouri: The EDC processassisted their efforts toward disaster mitigation in rebuilding thesecommunities after the Mississippi River's Great Flood of 1993. The projectinvolved technical design assistance to help the civic leaders and residents tocreate more environmentally sound community plans. The Sustainable Grand Canyon Workshop: At the Grand Canyon--which isthreatened by overuse--the EDC team is working to create an on-going regionalpartnership to address and implement integrated environmental solutions in theareas of: economic development, energy efficiency, land use, wastewater,buildings, and human factors. The focus and emphasis of each charrette depends on the design problem, but thefollowing sustainability elements should be included: Energy building envelope and windows; lighting and daylighting; plug loads;heating; cooling and ventilating systems. Building ecology; materials; indoor air quality. Air, water and landscaping: site design; aquifer recharge; surfaces. Physical infrastructure: water, utilities, parks, transportation, etc. Waste management: pollution prevention; construction and demolition waste;building operations waste; water and waste nutrient recovery. Economic development: creation of "green"industries; reducing pollution fromexisting business. Human Factors: cultural issues;, environmental equity; social and communityinvolvement; city scale and liveability. The number of participants varies according to the needs of each EDC and isdetermined in conjunction with the host community. Most Charrettes to datehave consisted of 30 to 60 people usually working in small groups. An EDCplanning team will work to integrate approaches developed by the groups toachieve a comprehensive set of recommendations. Three elements are essentialto a comprehensive solution: economic opportunity, social equity andenvironmental responsibility. However, the EDC workshop is only a small step toward creating awareness ofopportunities and the need for long-standing commitment to environmental andeconomic development of our communities. Experience has shown that a number ofelements are essential for effective and sustained community development thatbuilds upon design assistance initiatives: 1. Multi-disciplinary linkages: link university-based and community-basedprofessions. 2. Impact area methodology: create focus by combining project and programswithin "high-impact" areas selected for demonstrable and replicable results. 3. Community participation and initiative: emphasize working with communitiesin collaborating and participatory partnerships that maximize local initiative,volunteerism and community based leadership. 4. Integrative coordination: link local initiatives (bottom up) to broadnetworks of programs and policies (top down). 5. Participatory design process: emphasize the skills of group brainstorming,design and decision making, best illustrated by the "charrette" process. 6. Sustainable community development: emphasize the need to combine economic,social and environmentally sustainable practices. 7. Research and documentation: summarize the work including evaluation of EDCprocess so that others can learn from the process. The power of the EDC is that the community is given the key role in helpingcreate their vision of the future. The role that the American team of expertswould provide is one of facilitation and sharing of experience and knowledge.The process of developing this project results from lessons learned during theprocess of these Environmental Design Charrettes: The first lesson involves the need to get involved early, before too manydecisions are made. Often some of the best opportunities to incorporatesustainable design are lost because the urgent need to return life back tonormal forces decisions to have been made before the EDC process could takeplace. Another lesson is: do not cause delay in the redevelopment process.Fortunately, experience has shown that the EDC process can take place asquickly as conventional redevelopment planning, while leading to spectacularlyimproved results. The third lesson is that technologies and designs which reduce energyconsumption and improve environmental quality often cost the same as or lessthan conventional approaches, but result in significantly reduced costs andwaste produced. The final lesson is that by being a leader in implementing forward-lookingapproaches to re-development results in economic opportunities which were notpresent before. For example, it is possible that Kobe could become themanufacturing and distribution center for Japanese energy efficient and other"green" products. Their initial market base, of course would be their ownrebuilding efforts, but as environmental opportunities continue their explosivegrowth around the world, there should be a ready market for both the productionas well as the implementation expertise developed through this project. It should be stressed that Environmental Design Charrettes are only thebeginning of a process. This process is begun with the EDC and can besustained through follow-up visits, teleconferencing, Internet links, and theuse of digitally-based live/video communications technology, depending upon theinterests of the host community. Based on our past experience, a project ofthis nature is likely to have three basic phases: (1) Project Development: This phase would involve establishing aconstituency in Japan for the services being offered, and assembling bilateralteams of specialists in the U.S. and Japan. During this phase the potentialfor incorporating sustainable development principles and technologies into thenormal rebuilding process will be assessed. The scope and content of theEnvironmental Design Charrette would be agreed upon by both sides andfoundational organization would be undertaken. Because of the urgency ofreturning Kobe to normal, this phase would need to be accelerated. (2) Conduct Environmental Design Charrettes: The actual workshops wouldtake place and the working contacts between Japanese and American experts wouldbe formalized. The American expert team would be there in support of Japanesespecialists. Plans for future in-situ and electronic follow-ups would bedeveloped as appropriate. (3) On-going Exchange and Support: Since this process will be alearning experience for both sides, opportunities to apply lessons learned inKobe to situations in the U.S. should be explored. The "nitty-gritty" workthat follows the long-range planning most likely would be conducted by sitevisits and through various electronic link-ups. Conclusion Hope and opportunity often spring from tragedy. We hope that both sides willembrace this opportunity to build an enduring relationship between our twocountries in order to create a more sustainable vision for our shared future.Our organizations stand ready to work with our Japanese neighbors to quicklydevelop an environmental design process to help Kobe rebuild sustainably.

A Guide to Sustainable Redevelopment for Disaster-Affected Communities Written by William S. Becker U.S. Department of Energy With the assistance of Roberta F. Stauffer National Center for Appropriate Technology Foreword As this booklet is being prepared in the Fall of 1994, several profoundchanges are evolving in federal policy. Sustainable development, a concept defined by a United Nations commission in1986, is becoming an accepted principle among government agencies, as well as awidely valued strategy for economic development worldwide. Renewable energy resources, which experienced a burst of national interestafter the oil shocks of the 1970s, only to be forgotten by most consumersduring the 1980s, are enjoying a comeback. Solar, wind, geothermal and biomasspower all are being appreciated by policy makers again as keys to makingeconomic development compatible with environmental health. National disaster policy is undergoing a revolution. Since the mid-1930s, whenthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was told by Congress to tame the nation'srivers, considerable treasure and know-how were spent building flood controlstructures -- dams, levees and the like. Now, humbled 60 years later by the Great Flood of 1993 in the Midwest, policymakers are accepting a new approach: It's time to make peace with rivers.The Great Flood appears to be giving birth to a nonstructural era in which theprincipal strategy will be not to fight flooding but to avoid it, often bymoving people out of the way. These developments are important signs of maturity in federal policy. But as itturns out, the seeds were planted long ago and far away from Washington, D.C.,by a village deep in the Mississippi River watershed. Soldiers Grove,Wisconsin, pioneered the three-cornered strategy of relocation, renewableenergy and sustainable development starting in 1975. Few people paid attention.After the Great Flood forced other Midwest communities to decide whether andhow to rebuild, however, the story of Soldiers Grove surfaced as a model. In 1978, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) played a role in helping SoldiersGrove study its energy options. Now, at a time when more communities arethinking about following a similar path to find their futures, we are pleasedto offer this case study of the Soldiers Grove project. Christine A. Ervin Assistant Secretary Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy September 1994 Table of Contents Introduction Chapter One: Why Sustainability? Chapter Two: Soldiers Grove Chapter Three: How to Begin Planning Chapter Four: Citizen Involvement Chapter Five: Making a Master Plan Chapter Six: Sustainable Design Choices Chapter Seven: Financing Relocation Chapter Eight: Real Life Problems Epilogue Resources Introduction Hurricanes, earthquakes and floods of nearly biblical proportions havedevastated regions of our country in recent years, causing great loss of life,property and livelihood. Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki caused nearly $20 billionin property damage when they touched down in South Florida and Hawaii,respectively, in 1992. The Northridge earthquake, which lasted only 30 seconds,caused an estimated $30 billion in property damage in Southern California inJanuary 1994. And in what is now commonly referred to as the Great Flood of1993, communities spread over 10 million acres were inundated by floods thatcaused as much as $16 billion in countable damages in the nine Midwesternstates of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa,Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri. These enormous damage tallies represent hundreds of thousands of disruptedlives and hundreds of shattered communities. But, just as it is certain thatsuch disasters will continue to strike, the human response to them is equallyinevitable: People will want to return their lives to normal as soon aspossible, even if that means moving back into the path of danger. There is another way. Disaster victims can rebuild their lives better than theywere before, taking advantage of reconstruction to fix a variety of personaland community problems. Particularly after major disasters, reconstruction isan opportunity for individuals to replace aging, damaged buildings with newstructures, built with the latest techniques and equipment to lower heating andcooling costs. Reconstruction can restore local tax base and boost the localeconomy with new jobs. Businesses can re-size or even change their character tobetter meet the community's needs. Local wells and emergency services canbe rebuilt outside the reach of floodwaters. Aging infrastructure can berestored. And, perhaps most importantly, communities in areas of predictabledisasters can take advantage of reconstruction to reduce or even eliminate thedanger of further damages, removing that dark shadow from their futures. In the aftermath of the Great Flood of 1993, a movement has begun toward"sustainable redevelopment"-- the practice of recovering fromdisasters in ways that improve the quality of people's lives, thedurability of their communities, and the prospects of their children. As thisbook was being written in the Spring of 1994, at least three Midwesterncommunities were actively employing sustainable redevelopment principles intheir recovery from flooding the year before. A White House Task Force wascalling for profound reforms in the nation's disaster recovery policies,including the use of sustainable redevelopment practices as communitiesrebuild. "Relocations, in particular, offer a unique opportunity to startfrom scratch in planning and constructing to assure that sustainabledevelopment becomes an integral part of the entire community," the TaskForce says. "Each community would choose the characteristics it wished to sustain,such as an agricultural base, the historic or rural nature of the town,affordable housing, energy and/or water efficiency, diversity of species ornatural resources," the Task Force recommended. "Com-munities wouldincorporate these into planning and construction. Individuals also would useenergy-efficient technologies to conserve limited natural resources withresultant cost savings. As part of response and recovery, a team of federalexperts would work through state agencies to provide communities andindividuals technical assistance and information on the use of more innovativetechnologies." Nearly 20 years before the Great Flood of 1993, one small river town pioneeredthe path of sustainable redevelopment. In 1975, the flood-prone village ofSoldiers Grove, Wisconsin, was offered a levee by the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers. It chose instead to leave the flood plain and rebuild on higherground. In the process, it identified and attempted to solve a wide variety ofcommunity problems, and it made dramatic use of energy efficiency measures andsolar heating in its new business district, becoming America's first "solarvillage." This booklet recounts the story of Soldiers Grove, in hopes that the lessons itlearned can be beneficial to other communities that are now exploring or fullyembarked upon the path of sustainable redevelopment. Table of Contents Chapter One: Why Sustainability? What is sustainable development? The most commonly accepted definition was written by the United NationsCommission on Environment and Development. Sustainable development, it said,"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of futuregenerations to meet their needs." Another definition calls sustainabledevelopment "the practice of living off the Earth's interest, not itsprinciple." For the purposes of this book, we'll talk about sustainable"redevelopment" -- in other words, how sustainable developmentcan be applied in communities that are rebuilding after disasters. Andwe'll give "sustainable" a very practical definition, relatingto the very practical problems a community faces in the aftermath of naturaldisaster. Sustainable redevelopment... Reduces or eliminates a community's conflict with its environment.The most evident conflict in disaster-prone communities, of course, is thepotential loss of lives and property due to natural events like flooding,hurricanes or earthquakes. In a number of cases, particularly in defineddisaster zones like flood plains, communities can remove themselves fromdanger, not by trying to control natural events (a strategy that the GreatFlood proved can be very risky) but by getting out of harm's way. Byrestoring a community's physical security and its prospects for a future,relocation is an important sustainable redevelopment strategy. Most communities suffer from many other forms of environmental conflict, too.Industrial pollution, the handling of solid wastes, air quality problemsstemming from transportation, the lack of adequate sewage treatment -- allare potential areas of reducing the conflict between people and environment.Why bother? Because in the long term, a strong economy and a livable communitycannot be sustained without a healthy environment. The goal of sustainableredevelopment is to find ways that people will prosper, while nature prospers,too. Improves the quality of life for the community's residents. Are theresidents of your community's disaster-prone areas living in substandardhousing? Are residential and commercial buildings below health and safetycodes, so damaged that it's prohibitively expensive to fix them? Is yourtown lacking certain important businesses -- a clothing store, for example,or a pharmacy -- encouraging people to shop elsewhere? Are there safetyproblems in the community's traffic patterns, health problems in the wellor infrastructure? A community can't be sustained if its residents are nothappy with it. A significant post-disaster redevelopment project can bedesigned to become a "multi-purpose recovery"-- a project thatsolves a variety of problems. Improves the prospects of the community's future generations.Disaster victims rebuilding their community are, in effect, the foundingfathers and mothers of a new town. Every new home, new business, new villagehall, church or school, must be built not just to return life to normal today,but to serve the community for a century to come. For their work and theircommunity to be sustainable, today's disaster victims must rebuild fortheir children and grandchildren as well as for themselves. Among other things,that means using tomorrow's technologies, not yesterday's. Goodtechnology -- in buildings, waste systems, transportation patterns andcommunity design -- can make a world of difference. Today's mostenergy-efficient homes are heated and cooled with one-third to one-tenth theenergy of a typical home. Strengthens the community's economy. Eliminating the prospect ofdisasters and replacing old structures with new ones can help improve the localeconomy. But communities can redevelop with methods that bolster the economy inmany other ways as well. In many communities, for example, a significant partof local income leaks away as consumers pay their energy bills. Many localdollars spent on gasoline, heating oil and other petroleum products end upoverseas. A community-wide effort to reduce energy costs can plug that leak,keeping dollars at home where they can purchase other goods and services,strengthening the local economy. How much money are we talking about? One study sponsored by the State ofNebraska indicates that 80 cents of every dollar spent on energy bills leavesthe typical local economy without generating any other economic activity. Everydollar spent on energy efficiency rather than fossil fuels, however, stimulates84 cents worth of additional local economic activity. Another economy-booster: Local businesses involved in relocation can becomestronger by improving their locations to become more visible to shoppers, or tobecome closer to needed transportation facilities. They can resize or changethe nature of their businesses, becoming better able to meet the needs of localconsumers. Shifts the community's resource consumption to renewable rather thanfinite resources. A community whose economy depends on finite resources-- petroleum again is a prime example -- builds its future on afoundation of sand. In the long term, as they are depleted, finite resourcesbecome more expensive, their supplies become less dependable and theirextraction often becomes more environmentally costly. Renewable resources-- like solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy and agricultural cropsspecifically grown for energy production -- will remain plentiful. Acommunity rebuilding for the next century can build upon a foundation ofresource abundance, rather than resource scarcity. According to a 1993 report published by the Energy Information Administration,renewable resources could provide 93 percent of the nation's energysupply, if they were fully utilized. Today, however, they provide only afraction of the nation's power. Many renewable resources are nowdependable, affordable and clean sources of power. In regions with sufficientwind, wind power can produce electricity at 7 cents a kilowatt hour, comparableto the electricity most consumers buy from their utilities and down from 25cents in 1980. Well-designed passive solar buildings are perfectlyeconomical. Common Misconceptions Misconceptions continue to surround sustainable development, blocking the wayto more widespread adoption of the technologies involved. Below are a fewcommon myths, along with explanations of why they are unfounded. Sustainability is a utopian concept for the future and not practical in thepresent. Throughout history, communities have been developed near available naturalresources, and a region's architecture was a direct response to the localclimate. Towns and villages were laid out to allow pedestrian access to thecenters of cultural and economic activity. This center may have focused on aseaport, a river confluence, a crossroads, a church, a sawmill, a factory, oranother facility of significance that caused the settlement to exist. The mixedvariety of shops, markets, apartments and houses that congregated around thecommunity's center grew out of the necessity for people to walk to wherethey worked, shopped, played and governed themselves. Food, energy resources,building materials and other supplies were locally derived and processed atmany decentralized locations and were continually recycled back into thecommunity and its adjacent environment. Until the late 18th century, humankind relied solely on renewable sources tomeet energy needs. However, as society became more industrialized andexperienced rapid growth, renewables were displaced by "modern,"nonrenewable energy sources. The proliferation of automobile mobility fed theincreasing consumption of fossil fuels and led to the decentralization ofcommunities. As cars became more common, it was no longer necessary to maintaina close-knit community center. Rather than being a utopian concept for the future, sustainability actuallyhearkens back to the past. It does not signal a return to the "horse andbuggy" days, however. Sustainable communities of the 21st century will bevery comfortable places to live, mixing the best of modern technology with thepractical, centralized community focus of the past. In addition to Soldiers Grove, several other emerging communities exemplifythis trend toward sustainable development. In Michigan, the small villages onBeaver Island practice economic development through energy self-reliance,harvesting dead trees for fuel and using solar and wind energy systems.Residents of Beaver Island have looked at wildlife and wetlands preservation ascontributors to economic development and have recognized that a healthy naturalenvironment surrounds them with values not readily measured in dollars andcents. Starting from scratch, a new community is being developed at Ithaca, New York,called EcoVillage. Offering a new and creative approach to building design anduse of space, Ecovillage includes preservation of 80 percent of the land fornatural wildlife and vegetation areas, permaculture and organic foodproduction, and recreation. The remaining land harbors high-density,energy-efficient housing, with neighborhoods of homes grouped around a centerof community buildings that provide most basic necessities within walkingdistance. EcoVillage at Ithaca is emerging as a model of how an ecological andsocially sustainable community can function, evoking the interest ofarchitects, landscape developers, design engineers, horticulturalists andothers who see in this project the principles needed to guide futuredevelopment. Sustainability costs too much. Actually, sustainable development often costs less than conventionaldevelopment, particularly when long-term costs are counted. A enlighteningexample is illustrated by reviewing current suburban development, which iscentered around the automobile, which depends on oil, which costs money. Recentfigures place the real cost of owning and driving a car in urban and suburbanAmerica at an average of $500 per month, per person, per car. This figure takesinto account only the measurable dollar costs attributable to purchase price,insurance, fuel and maintenance, and the associated fuel and infrastructuretaxes. It does not take into account the costs of increased health care due toair pollution; the costs of traffic accidents; the social and economicdisplacement resulting from construction of new highways; the costs of shippingpetroleum from foreign locations; the costs of military protection of theshipping routes, and the costs of environmental damage caused by extracting andtransporting the fuel. Present-day society assumes that the movement of goods and services overever-increasing distances is a necessary part of development. Yet, tosustainable community advocates, excess transportation is an expensive sign ofsystem failure. Sustainable communities are likely to provide cleaner renewablefuels, more efficient transportation systems and pedestrian access to manynecessities, thereby decreasing the cost of oil dependence and increasing localdisposable income. If sustainable development were a viable option, the market would havecreated a demand for it by now. Sustainability does not represent a service or a commodity. Kentucky author andpoet, Wendell Berry, commenting on American economic culture, writes:"Anything that cannot be weighed, measured or counted does notexist." As proposed by Adam Smith over 200 years ago, free marketeconomics has been largely successful due to this quantifying nature ofhumanity. What has occurred in recent decades, however, is a growing failure ofcapitalism to assign proper value to many of life's most preciouscommodities. What cannot be readily weighed, measured or counted is the qualityof human experience or the value of natural systems. In a market economy,wetlands and agricultural fields have a low monetary value, relative to realestate development potential, but their value to human health andsustainability may be far greater than any development would be. Society has begun the difficult task of assigning monetary values to these"priceless" commodities. For example, many electric utilities are nowrequired to factor the costs of "externali-ties" such as pollutionand habitat displacement into their resource plans. This trend will expand andcontinue until the price of resources reflects much more of their true cost andvalue. Then sustainable development will very often emerge as the mosteconomical option. With today's imperfect yardsticks, it's often difficult to weigh thereal costs and benefits of sustainable options. The key is to make alladvantages and disadvantages of each option known to the community, includingconsequences that carry environmental, social or aesthetic -- rather thaneconomic -- price- tags. To quote Tom Hirsch, Soldiers Grove'srelocation coordinator from May 1975 to August 1982, "It is a hard path,but it's doable, and Soldiers Grove proved that it's doable. Thebenefits did outweigh the costs, and the issues important at the time --energy management, job creation, community cohesion -- are every bit asimportant 20 years later." Our town can't get itself organized enough to do sustainableredevelopment. Any community whose people have enough spirit to help each other build leveesout of sandbags can pull together to build a new future. They need the will tomake their town survive; the leadership to keep them working together; and aclear understanding of why all the work is worth the trouble. The community spirit that disasters often spawn -- bringing out the best inpeople and prompting them to work in unison for the benefit of all -- cangather steam and propel the community on into the sustainable development mode.People can work together to preserve and remember the best of what they'releaving behind, while looking forward to the creation of something much better.Disasters often leave their victims with the depressing realization that theycannot control their own fate. Sustainable redevelopment allows people to begintaking control of their futures again. There are no models we can follow. Read on. Soldiers Grove did it. Other communities are doing it today.

Table of Contents Chapter Two: Soliders Grove When the waters of the Great Flood of 1993 finally receded, some Midwesterncommunities were convinced that it wasn't smart to move back into theflood plain. They searched for a different model. Some heard about SoldiersGrove, a village in the upper portion of the Mississippi River watershed thatdecided to move from harm's way nearly 20 years ago. Soldiers Grove was a typical Midwestern village incorporated in 1888 on thebanks of the Kickapoo River in southwest Wisconsin. As the lumber industry,then farming and urbanization, began stripping vegetation from the river'swatershed, the Kickapoo began to flood. The river hit Soldiers Grove with itsfirst major flood in 1907. It dumped record amounts of water into the communityagain in 1912, 1917, and 1935. The 1935 flood finally made it clear to thevillagers that flooding was a serious and permanent problem. In 1937, SoldiersGrove joined other Kickapoo communities in petitioning Congress for a floodcontrol project. It was not until 1962 that Congress approved a flood control plan for theKickapoo River Valley -- a dam and recreational lake near the top of theriver, and a supplemental levee at Soldiers Grove, all to be built by the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of the dam and design work on the leveebegan in the late 1960s. In the three decades that Soldiers Grove waited for dam construction to begin,the Kickapoo delivered four more floods, including a disastrous recordinundation in 1951 which severely damaged downtown buildings and speeded thecommunity's economic decline. In 1974, the State of Wisconsin required Soldiers Grove to pass a floodplainzoning ordinance, a law that villagers felt would do more damage to propertythan the river itself. The law prohibited any new construction in the businessdistrict and placed strict limits on maintenance or repairs to existingbuildings. The ordinance was a severe blow to the economic heart of thecommunity. The Corps of Engineers presented its final plan for a levee in early 1975. Thevillagers had hoped that the levee would solve both the flooding problem andthe need to comply with floodplain zoning. But when the Engineers unveiled thedetails of the proposed levee, their message was depressing. The levee wouldcost some $3.5 million, yet would protect about $1 million worth of property.Each year for the next 100 years, the village would have to raise funds equalto twice its 1975 property tax levy to pay for maintenance of the flood controlstructure. And the dike would do little to solve many of the village'sproblems -- the outmigration of young people to urban areas, the severeblight in the downtown, the feeling that Soldiers Grove was slowly dying. Their backs against the wall, community leaders came up with a radicalproposal, believing it was the only way to save the village. They suggestedthat the federal government spend the same $3.5 million to help the communityevacuate its floodplain and rebuild the business district on higher ground.Federal assistance would amount to 60 percent of the project's total cost,with state, local and private investments making up the balance. With a small planning grant, Soldiers Grove hired a team of University ofWisconsin specialists headed by landscape architecture Prof. Phil Lewis tostudy the feasibility of relocation. The team concluded that relocation madegood sense. In 1977, the village invested its own funds to purchase a site for the newdowntown and begin the extension of utility services. However, federal agencieswere slow to support relocation. For three years -- from the time the ideawas first proposed in early 1975 to 1978 -- the village's appeals forassistance were denied. Then in July 1978, the Kickapoo hit the village again, with the largest floodin its history. The flood inflicted a half-million dollars in damages,completely destroying several buildings, including the community'srelatively new concrete block bank. While no one would have wished for such aflood, it accomplished what community leaders had not been able to: Itgalvanized opinion inside and outside the village that Kickapoo River floodingwas inevitable and that relocation must proceed at once. With the help ofthen-U.S. Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson, the flood jarred loosethe support of federal agencies. The Secretary of the U.S. Department ofHousing and Urban Development granted the village $900,000 in the fall of 1978so that relocation could begin. Multipurpose Recovery In planning the relocation project, the villagers took the opportunity toaddress a number of development goals, reaching beyond their initial objectiveof moving the town off the floodplain. Though flooding was the village'smost visible problem, it was not the only one. The nationwide drain of moneyand people from rural to urban areas was another hard reality. SoldiersGrove's population had peaked in 1940 at 778, and since then, both thepopulation and the economy had been on the decline. Also, in the 1950s, U.S.Highway 61 had been moved to bypass the Soldiers Grove business district. Thehighway, which used to coincide with Main Street, bringing traffic into theheart of the community, was relocated a half-mile to the east. Downtownbusiness had not been the same since. By 1975, these factors had helped create a local economy in which 36 percent ofthe village's families earned less than $3,000 a year. Soldiers Grove hadbecome a community largely of elderly and low-income people. The relocation, started in 1979 and completed in 1983, proved to be just whatSoldiers Grove needed -- a community heart transplant. Besides eliminatingflooding, the multipurpose recovery process achieved additional key benefits.The downtown was moved back to U.S. Highway 61, bringing new economic life intothe community. The old floodplain was developed into a municipal park, completewith tennis courts, picnic areas, and a number of other recreationalfeatures. For years, Soldiers Grove's municipal well had been located in thefloodplain, near the business district. Even minor inundations contaminated thecommunity water supply. So, the village decided to add a second well and alarger storage reservoir outside the floodplain in the new downtown. The extension of sewer and water services to the relocation site opened up newdevelopment area along its route. It also provided an opportunity for thevillage to fix a long-standing problem -- discoloration and odor in thewater in one nearby neighborhood, caused by aging pipes. Soldiers Grove's fire and rescue station was located in the floodplain. Soin the move, the community relocated the fire station to a site where emergencyvehicles would not be disabled or cut off during floods. Nation's First "Solar Village" Of all the relocation decisions made by Soldiers Grove, one was particularlydramatic. That was the decision to make all the new town center buildingsenergy-efficient and solar-heated. The new Soldiers Grove would be the firstbusiness district of its kind in the nation. As with many other aspects of the project, the inspiration grew from a problem.Energy bills had been a major and increasing cost for many of the Main Streetbusiness owners. Their structures were not only badly deteriorated by flooding,but old and poorly insulated. They were costly to heat and cool, especiallywith fuel oil, the most expensive of fossil fuels at the time. Early in the planning stages of relocation, it occurred to some villagers thatconstruction of a new business district opened the opportunity for SoldiersGrove to build efficient structures and to promote the use of renewable,alternative fuels. Thus, the project could have even more local benefits, plusfurther value as a national demonstration. Conservation and renewable energysystems held the promise of increasing local self-reliance while insulating thecommunity from oil and gas shortages of the future; reducing air pollution in avalley whose terrain often causes air inversions; and -- most attractively-- substantially lowering energy bills for businesses. The lower energycosts would provide a form of "new income" for business owners. To capture these benefits, Soldiers Grove passed energy performance standardsfor its new buildings twice as stringent as those required by state law at thetime; approved a community-wide "solar access" law that prohibitedany building from blocking another building's sunlight; passed a lawrequiring that all new commercial buildings receive at least half their heatingenergy from the sun (the first such ordinance in the nation); conducted acareful analysis of the relocation site to determine its wind and sunfallpatterns throughout the year; helped businesses position their buildings tomake maximum use of summer breezes and solar heating, while using earth bermingand careful landscaping to block the buildings from winter winds; and conductedan evaluation of possible building materials to find those that were mosteconomical, including costs to the environment. In the process, the villagepioneered a new approach to disaster recovery. "Soldiers Grove had no road map to follow," said Tom Hirsch, whoserved as the community's relocation coordinator from May 1975 to August1982. "We forged new territory, but now the strategy is there to be takenup by other communities." Table of Contents Chapter Three: How to Begin Planning Of all the various components making up Soldiers Grove's pioneeringrelocation project, one will be particularly valuable to today'sdisaster-affected communities: the process the community followed tomake its new downtown a reality. Today's communities will fashion theirown unique versions of sustainable development, but at least they don'thave to reinvent the wheel when it comes to deciding how to go aboutresearching their options and carrying out their plans. Through the painstaking, often intimidating, process of trial and error,Soldiers Grove discovered four main components in the early stages of planningan innovative relocation project: focusing responsibility, doing adequatehomework, locating sources of technical help, and assuring strong citizeninvolvement from the beginning. The first three are explained in this chapter;the fourth -- citizen involvement -- deserves a chapter of its own andis covered in Chapter Four. Focusing Responsibility In planning the relocation project and its solar component, Soldiers Grovefound it was necessary to assign one individual responsibility forcoordination. The clear identification of a single individual allowed citizenswithin the village and agencies from outside to know exactly where to go withconcerns, questions or ideas. A great many headaches and a great deal ofpotential confusion were avoided by appointing and publicizing the role of acentral coordinator. In larger communities, the sustainable redevelopment coordinator might be amember of an existing planning commission or community development office. InSoldiers Grove, it was necessary to create a new full-time position since thecommunity at first had only a minimum governmental structure (a village clerkand a Board) and no existing employees qualified to carry out reasonablysophisticated planning functions. Using a small federal grant, the villagehired a local architect, Thomas Hirsch, to serve as relocation coordinator.Later, when the move was about to begin and the complexities of the projectgrew, Hirsch was made part of a formal Community Development Office (CDO). Andduring the planning process, the Village Board created various citizencommittees to provide guidance and information to Hirsch and the CDO. Yet throughout the process, Hirsch was clearly identified as the primarycontact person and the coordinator of the revitalization effort. Thatdesignation was particularly useful to government officials and private firmswhich became involved in the project. Government officials analyzing thesuccess of the project cited the appointment of a competent central coordinatoras a key factor. Soldiers Grove found that an accessible central coordinator given sufficienttime and resources to perform the job served as a kind of human glue which heldthe project together and helped it proceed as smoothly as possible. Doing Homework The second component of the initial planning process -- homework -- wasalso critically important. Before investing significant time and money in asolar project, the village assessed three factors: local energy resources,solar potentials and local barriers to solar and other forms of renewableenergy. These were not sophisticated assessments. Rather, they involved simpledata-gathering which was useful immediately in guiding the project. Soldiers Grove found it was important to do the homework itself rather thanhiring it out. The assessments were educational, an exercise in introspectionabout the community's energy profile. That education allowed villagers todeal more knowledgeably with outside firms and funding sources, when it becamenecessary to use them. It also allowed the project coordinator to exercisequality control over outside firms contracted later to conduct moresophisticated feasibility studies. Consulting firms often are tempted to cutcosts by using standard information about such things as sunfall, wind speedsand the availability of renewable fuels, collecting data from state andnational reports. They are reluctant to spend time gathering local information.Having done his data-gathering, the coordinator could make sure consultantswere basing their studies on realistic information. Based on its experience, the village recommends that communities carefullyinventory their sustainable development needs and resources. A "Quality ofLife" inventory, for example, determines from residents what features theymost want to retain from their old community as it is redeveloped and what newfeatures -- social, recreational, cultural -- they most want toacquire. An "Economic Development" inventory might poll localconsumers on what new commercial services they want to see in a reconstructedcommunity. It might also poll local business owners to find out what they needto improve their health. To provide a more detailed example of how a community can do its homework, therest of this chapter tells how Soldiers Grove assessed its energy needs andeventually decided upon creating a solar village. The community'sinnovative decision grew from careful information gathering about 1) its oldenergy consumption patterns, 2) its potentials for using sustainable energy, 3)the energy characteristics of available redevelopment sites, 4) barriers thatwould influence the village's energy decisions, and 5) programs that couldhelp it carry out its decisions. Assessing Energy Consumption An inventory of local energy consumption should include all the conventionalfuels -- oil, natural gas, LP gas, coal and electricity -- used by thecommunity before it was disrupted by a natural disaster. Communities shouldstrive to gather specific information on fuel costs, availability, andconsumption. Local utilities are the likely source for such information. This detailed look at conventional energy use can help communities determinehow much money has been leaving their local economies to pay for energy. Inmany cases, the grand total will provide a strong incentive for redevelopingcommunities to reduce energy costs and explore local sustainable options. Assessing Sustainable Energy Potentials An inventory of local sustainable energy potentials should also focus onavailability and cost. Among the alternatives which might be assessed aresolar, wind, hydroelectric, wood, burnable wastes and sources of alcohol orbiogas -- whey, septic sludge, animal wastes and other byproducts ofagricultural, municipal or industrial operations. An important additionalsource of heating energy may be waste heat from electrical generating plants orfactories, heat that can be transferred to neighboring buildings in anarrangement commonly called "district heating." The purpose of such an inventory is fact-finding and direction-setting. It isnot meant to be a feasibility study -- a very sophisticated process whichought to be performed later by qualified professionals. Rather, this firstassessment is meant to help determine the community's obvious resourcesand the questions which need answering by technicians. The data will also helpthe community prepare convincing applications for assistance in funding moredetailed feasibility studies. For help with this initial inventory, communities can turn to their stateenergy offices, local utilities, nearby universities, or the U.S. Department ofEnergy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory which is listed in thispublication's resource section. These contacts may be able to supply dataon a specific locale's wind, sun, or biomass resources. The community should also inventory potential sources of financial help forcarrying out its energy choices. Information about federal energy programs isavailable from the U.S. Department of Energy; state program information can beobtained from state energy offices, and local utilities can provide details ontheir programs. Many utilities now offer financial incentives for consumers touse energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. Assessing Available Sites If the community is relocating, it should assess how available developmentsites will affect its energy options. For example, do nearby trees block thewind? Do existing buildings or natural terrain features cast large shadows onthe site? These site characteristics will affect the community's energychoices -- or conversely, the community's energy preferences mayaffect which site it chooses. For the purposes of this initial assessment, solar potentials, for example, canbe judged by simple observation. The optimal time for making such observationsis December 21, the day at which the sun is lowest in the sky and the shadowswill be greatest. Portions of the site which do not receive direct sunlightbetween 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. throughout the winter generally are not suitable fordirect use of the sun for heating. And, unless the community has a solar accesslaw prohibiting one property owner from blocking sunlight for another, futuredevelopments could be a factor. Assessing Barriers Barriers to alternative energy sources such as solar or wind take severalforms. Some, like buildings and trees, are physical. Some are attitudinal.Others are legal or institutional. A good assessment of energy potentials musttake all into account. A growing number of states and federal agencies are attempting to removebarriers to alternative energy sources from building codes, design standardsand other laws and regulations. Still, such barriers exist. Most of our presenttaxing policies, building codes and standards have been designed in the era ofcheap fossil fuels, and not with alternatives in mind. It is impossible to identify all barriers early in the planning phase of aredevelopment project. Inevitably, some obstacles will appear as the projectprogresses. If your community is among the first in your state to attemptlarge-scale development involving innovative sustainable technologies, you willbe forced to deal with unanticipated barriers, helping remove them forcommunities which follow. For example, Soldiers Grove decided to create "passive solar attics"in many of its buildings -- superinsulating the attic spaces and allowingsunlight to enter through fiberglass roofing panels. One state code classifiedthe solar attics as heating ducts and prohibited any combustible materialsinside them, including the buildings' wooden roof joists. The villagereached accommodation with state officials by lining the attics with sheetrock. It is important to avoid as many unpleasant surprises as possible by assessingbarriers in the planning phase. Attitudinal barriers can be assessed bysurveying opinions within the community. Are the people most directly affectedby the development project willing to consider solar or other alternativesources of energy? If not, why not? Do they have questions they want answeredfirst? What are they? Such surveys can be taken formally or informally,depending on the size of the group involved and the traditional patterns ofplanning and communication within the community. (Soldiers Grove'sprocedures for surveying attitudes are covered in the next chapter.) Assessing legal barriers is somewhat more tricky. Are there communityordinances or codes which obviously will stand in the way of solar development?A common difficulty is the lack of solar access legislation at the local level,an ordinance which guarantees that once a building owner invests in solar,sunlight will not be blocked in the future by other development. Is there aneasy way to assure solar access at the new development site? Taxing policies also can present barriers. If building owners install solarsystems, will the systems cause a significant increase in property taxassessments on those properties? If they do, part of the savings the owner willrealize on fuel bills to help pay for the system will be negated by taxes, andsolar will be made, from a purely economic standpoint, less desirable. Another barrier may be how much a community will have to rely on governmentsupport in carrying out its project. Oftentimes, the more a community has torely on state and federal government support, the more difficult a projectbecomes. Funding uncertainties, delays, paperwork and compliance withcomplicated restrictions are often included with government grants and loans. Acommunity may want to consider designing a project which minimizes the need foroutside financial assistance and maximizes self-reliance. Finding Technical Help When the time comes to bring in outside help -- whether a governmentagency, an engineering firm or an architectural firm -- the community willfind that such consultants often are not objective. They will tend to favorthose technologies with which they are most familiar. A preliminary assessmentof energy resources -- both conventional and nonconventional -- willallow a community to seek help from programs and firms able and willing toassist in application of the energy technologies which seem to have greatestpotential. Often, preliminary assistance can be obtained at little or no cost and usedsimply to confirm or amend the community's own hunches about its energypotentials. Short of actual design work or detailed feasibility studies,preliminary technical assistance is used again to set direction, provide datafor future funding applications and continue realistic appraisals of energyoptions before major investments of time and money are made. Among the possible sources of preliminary guidance are government agencies,universities and private firms. Government agencies and universities cansometimes fit a study into existing programs at little or no cost to themunicipality. University programs can sometimes make such a study a classproject, providing free student labor in exchange for the educationalexperience. Some private firms, hoping that they will win more substantial contracts later,will offer relatively low-cost preliminary technical assistance to a communityor a developer. Again, it would be wise to solicit those firms with establishedexpertise in the energy options which the local assessment indicated are mostlikely to be practical. But there are pitfalls. You get only what you pay for. Low-cost or no-coststudies are generally cursory. They should not be taken as gospel. A goodpreliminary feasibility study is often more expensive and time-consuming than afinal study, since it must sort through a universe of options. While SoldiersGrove's experience with government and university-sponsored studies wasvery good, such studies can take a long time and produce little. Taken for what they are, these sources of technical help can be beneficial. Butthey do not replace the detailed feasibility and design work which can make thedifference between success and failure of a particular energy application. Soldiers Grove Experience Soldiers Grove applied each of these steps as it moved toward development ofthe solar downtown. Following the July 1978 flood when initial funding for floodplain relocationwas obtained, the Community Development Office (CDO) conducted a detailedinventory of energy resources within the community. The village found smallsupplies of whey from local cheese factories, septic sludge from the municipalwaste treatment plant, some burnable solid wastes and useable agriculturalwastes from township dumps and farms surrounding the community, and somepotential for low-head hydroelectric generation on the Kickapoo River. But noneof these indigenous resources seemed to meet the village's needs: a low-cost source of heating energy in sufficient supply to justify the capitalexpenditures involved in its conversion and use, and immediately available tothe buildings about to be constructed. The CDO collected the best available wind data from airports in the region, anddata on the percentage of sunlit days from nearby weather stations. It alsolocated an inventory of wood wastes in the Kickapoo River Valley, done by anearby city which at one time had considered using the wastes to help generateelectricity. The inventory indicated that within a 30-mile radius of SoldiersGrove, lumber mills were producing 3,000 tons per month of sawdust, wood chipsand scrap bark. Phone calls to the lumber mills confirmed that the wastes were available and could bepurchased at low cost -- less than $10 per ton delivered. Most mills had noother market for the wastes, and were simply letting them rot on the ground. The CDO observed that most space heating in the old downtown was done by oilfurnaces. No natural gas was used in the community, and only a few businessesmade use of LP gas. As the 1978-79 heating season began, No. 2 fuel oil cost50.5 cents per gallon and electricity just over 4 cents per kilowatt-hour. Soldiers Grove had already selected the site for its new downtown, a farm fieldabout a half-mile from the old downtown, still within municipal borders.Purchased by the Village Board in 1977 when it came up for sale, the site was favored by business owners because itwas adjacent to U.S. Highway 61, a main thoroughfare that promised to boosttrade. Another farm field on the opposite end of the village had been available fordevelopment, and that site offered unrestricted access to sunlight. But theHighway 61 location had an historic and emotional appeal for the businessowners. The highway had been Main Street for Soldiers Grove un-til themid-1950s, when it was relocated to the outskirts of the community. Businessesconsidered the loss of proximity to the highway a major factor in the economicdecline of the village. The site chosen and purchased was not the best for solar. Split by the highway,the portion furthest from the old village was well situated for solar heating.But the portion closest to the old sections of the community and chosen forretail business development was partially obstructed by two 300-foot hills onits southern edge. To make matters worse, the hills were topped by 50- to60-foot trees. Local Barriers As for the barriers presented by existing local ordinances, Soldiers Grove hadfew pertaining to construction, land use or other issues with a bearing onsolar. Since it had experienced little development in recent years, there hadbeen no need for regulation other than floodplain zoning. However, state building codes for residential and commercial structures didapply in the village, and the village had no legal mechanism for assuring solaraccess. Village officials would have to come up with solar access regulation ofsome kind. As for the state building codes, they seemed not to contain anyobvious barriers to solar. Village officials decided any obstructions containedin the codes could not be detected until specific building designs had beenproposed. Attitudinal barriers also existed in the community. Coordinator Hirschdescribed the general opinion of solar heating as "healthyskepticism" when the idea was first raised. Many of the villagerssubscribed to the standard myths -- that solar wouldn't work in anorthern climate, that it was risky, exotic and high-priced. There was alsoconcern that with the trauma of the relocation project already taxing theircourage, villagers might be reluctant to change further. Village leaders fearedthe citizenry might quickly reach a psychological threshold beyond which it wasno longer willing to innovate. Positive Attitudes But the CDO staff knew from formal surveys of villagers' values in thepast, and from countless hours of talking with the people, that there wereseveral attitudes which might make solar particularly appealing. First theKickapoogians were a ruggedly independent lot, very much attracted toself-sufficiency. Local lore had it that during one flood, the villagers askedthe Red Cross to leave town, saying they could take care of their own. Insofaras it would allow the village more independence and self-sufficiency, solarwould be attractive. Secondly, there was a strong environmental ethic in the village. Thoughvillagers often seemed to take the pristine beauty of the Valley for granted,surveys showed that environmental quality was very high on the list of theirpriorities for the future. Solar was saleable as an environmentally benign wayto heat the new downtown. Thirdly, there was a strong desire to improve the economic health of thecommunity. If solar systems could be shown to be inexpensive to install andoperate, yet beneficial to the local economy, there would likely be support fortheir use. All in all, the local assessment of solar potential at Soldiers Grove indicatedto Hirsch and other village leaders that solar heating and other alternativeenergy systems ought to be seriously explored, and should be considered a highpriority in planning for the move. Technical Input Having established that priority, Hirsch put out a call for assistance late inthe fall of 1978. The village had proposed the project in 1975 and had beentrying to push it forward for years; now, suddenly, local leaders were undertremendous pressure to begin the move. Their buildings damaged by flooding,some of them beyond repair, business owners were anxious for construction tobegin. Hirsch and CDO director Ron Swiggum made a difficult decision. They would beginthe relocation of 10 residences from the floodprone downtown immediately. Butthe purchase of existing businesses and the start of construction of the newbusiness district would wait until the spring of 1979, after the village hadtime to perform final planning of the development. Hirsch contacted the U.S. Department of Energy's Region V office inChicago to appeal for assistance in analyzing the community's energychoices. That office contacted the Wisconsin Division of State Energy (DSE),which in turn contacted the Wisconsin Energy Extension Service (WEES), afederally funded energy education project within the University ofWisconsin-Extension (UWEX). The WEES allocated half its assistant director's time for three months tohead a task force of state and federal agencies which would carry out an energystudy for the community. Answering the call to take part in the study werespecialists from the UWEX Department of Engineering and Applied Science, theDivision of State Energy and, at the request of the Department of Energy,Argonne National Laboratory. Representatives of the electric utility servingSoldiers Grove also were invited to take part. The task force began its work early in January 1979. The involvement of thestate and university specialists was financed by their agencies as a publicservice. Argonne assigned two engineers and a community planning specialist tothe project, folding it into an existing program, the Integrated CommunityEnergy Systems project, at no cost to the village. Argonne's engineers, accustomed to large, high-technology projects, balkedinitially at the Soldiers Grove challenge. The square footage involved at thevillage was little more than that for a standard shopping center. Nevertheless,Argonne agreed to take the technical lead in analyzing the village'soptions, with other task force participants acting as devil's advocates. Argonne performed a two-step analysis, first considering dozens of energysystems representing a wide range of technologies. Solar ponds, photovoltaics,active solar collectors and a host of more experimental options were given atleast cursory attention. Argonne rejected many of these technologies for a variety of reasons. Some weretoo costly. Some were too unproven to be used safely in a real-life situation.Other technologies, though proven and safe, simply would take too long toimplement. The community needed heating energy immediately in the newdowntown. In addition, because the village was receiving funding for the move a little ata time, construction of the new downtown was to be incremental. The new energysystem would have to be flexible enough to serve incremental needs and toremain economical even if federal funding dried up, allowing only some of thebusinesses to make the move. Recommendations Argonne finally boiled the options down to 12 which would be given moredetailed analysis. Included were conventional furnaces, two types of windturbine use, three types of heat pump use, two types of central heating systemsfired by oil, two types of diesel generators providing both electricity andheat, and two types of wood-fired central heating plants. The laboratory'sanalysis indicated that a central heating plant fueled by wood wastes and usingsteam as its distribution medium would be the village's most economicalchoice. Throughout the study, the WEES chairperson coordinated the energy investigationwith three other technical assistance efforts carried out by UWEX. At a cost ofroughly $10,000 to the village, Extension had assigned faculty members toadvise the community on a master plan for the new downtown, zoning and otherlegal tools which might be employed to guide development, and economiccounseling for individual business owners to help them in their planning. Thechairperson found that it was necessary to carefully monitor and prod theagencies involved in the energy study, keeping them moving according thevillage's exceedingly short time table. In March 1979, the energy task force issued a report to the village containingfour recommendations. First, the new commercial structures should be designedfor maximum economical thermal efficiency. Second the village should constructa central wood-fired heating plant to serve as the major source of heatingenergy for the downtown. Third, passive solar heating systems should be used toprovide back-up to the central plant. And finally, the village should continueexploring ways to use the other native, renewable energy sources it had foundin its assessment. Local Decisions Meanwhile, business owners decided they would like the design of theirbuildings coordinated to make the downtown as attractive as possible. At thesame time, there were no legal mechanisms to guide construction. Individualowners could construct any kind of building they wished, utilizing any type ofenergy system. Business owners were unwilling to turn the project over to anoutside developer who would oversee design and construction. UWEX specialists advising the community on zoning recommended that the villagetake advantage of municipal ownership of the site and declare it a Planned UnitDevelopment (PUD) district. Under that arrangement, the village could devise amaster plan setting out construction standards, energy efficiency standards,building placement and other critical guidelines. If approved in publichearings and by the Village Board, the PUD plan would have the force of zoning.Thus, in effect, the village government would serve as developer of thedowntown, an arrangement that was favored by business owners. The two leaders allocated a portion of the village's initial $900,000 HUDgrant to hire a private firm expert at fashioning PUD plans. Now thoroughlycommitted to solar, they drew up a list of 20 architectural firms which thevillage would consider for three tasks: the design of three municipalstructures; the refining of the site layout to accommodate solar heating; andthe development of that portion of the PUD plan concerning the use of energy.Twelve firms responded to the village's request for proposals. Refining the Recommendations After interviewing four firms, the Village Board hired Hawkweed Group Ltd., apioneer in solar building design in the Midwest. Hawkweed introduced the boardto the startling claim that site-built solar heating systems could beincorporated into the new business buildings at virtually no extra cost tobuilding owners. And the systems would typically provide 75 percent or more ofthe annual space and water heating energy needed for each building. If Hawkweed was correct, the energy task force had underestimated the potentialof energy-efficient design and solar heating. Indeed, as Hawkweed began formalstudies and planning for the village, its estimates indicated that thermalefficiency and passive solar would probably make a central wood-fired heatingsystem uneconomical. The plant and its expensive distribution pipes throughoutthe business district simply would not get enough use to pay for themselves. Given Hawkweed's input, the Community Development Office modified theenergy guidelines submitted by the task force. Buildings would be designed formaximum thermal efficiency, with passive solar systems serving as the mainsources of heating energy. For backup, building owners would be encouraged toinstall small conventional furnaces fired by LP gas.

Due largely to recent advances in building technologies, it is possible to rebuild your home with a little extra care and not much more time or cost and have a home that is much more energy efficient than it was before disaster struck. If you are faced with the task of repairing or rebuilding a flooded home, you have several opportunities to make that home more energy-efficient. By doing so, you will increase your family's comfort, reduce energy consumption and utility bills, increase your property's value, and save money and energy for years to come. In normal times, any decision to upgrade or improve the energy performance of your home would have to be based entirely on the energy economics involved. The silver lining behind the cloud of rebuilding is that most equipment or material must be replaced after a flood anyway so it frequently makes sense to buy the most efficient equipment and materials available. Repairs to your flood-damaged home can add energy efficiency at the same time you address pressing structural needs, mainly by replacing and upgrading insulation in walls and floors, and checking your foundation for flood damage. Many energy efficiency options are available to you today that may not have been widely available when you built your house even if that was only a few years ago. Cost effectiveness depends on several factors, including cost of fuel and materials, efficiency levels of the structure and components, and climate. This booklet offers some general tips to improve the efficiency of your home's shell and equipment. Additional information on any issue covered in this booklet is available from various agencies within or near your community, including your state energy office, local community action agency, utilities, Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) offices. While this booklet focuses on the energy efficiency aspects of rebuilding a flood- damaged home, there are many other issues involved in rebuilding. Further information on these topics is also available from several sources. Probably the best single source for written help is a free 60-page booklet titled Repairing Your Flooded Home, which is a joint publication of the Red Cross and FEMA. For a free copy, write to FEMA Publications, P.O. Box 70274, Washington, DC 20024, or contact a local Red Cross chapter and ask for ARC 4477. Back to Table of Contents Part I: Dos and Don'ts About Personal Safety and Entering the Home After a Flood Returning to your home after a flood to survey the damage can be overwhelming. Usually, the first urge is to set upon the task of getting things back to the way they were as quickly as possible. Before any of that can happen, however, you must first verify that the threat of other dangers no longer exists. This section is offered to provide useful information to help you take care of the most important things first: protect your personal safety, the safety of your family, and the safety of your community. Make personal safety your first priority when returning to your home. DOs: Walk around the premises and look for structural damage. Note any downed, fallen, or damaged power lines or broken water lines and smell for gas leaks. If power lines or water lines have been damaged, or if you smell gas, notify your utility company immediately. Wear protective gloves, boots, headgear, goggles, and a respirator (check with your local health department for recommendations on the best type). Flood water contains raw sewage and other contaminants. Wash hands thoroughly after contact with flood water or flood-contaminated surfaces. If you are directly exposed to flood water, get a tetanus booster shot if you haven't had one within five years, or if you're not sure when you last had one. See your doctor immediately if you experience abdominal cramping with nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Contact your county health department about testing your water to be sure it's safe to drink. Have the wells pumped and the water tested before drinking. Use battery-powered lanterns or flashlights to examine buildings. Never use matches, lighters, or anything else with an open flame as this could cause an explosion if propane, natural gas or other flammable fumes or gases are present. Keep a battery-powered radio or television handy and tune in frequently for information on where to get medical care, housing, clothing, and food, and on how to help yourself and your community recover. Report fallen utility lines or submerged utility equipment to the police, fire department, or your utility company. Keep others away until the authorities arrive. DON'Ts: Don't eat food that has come in contact with flood water. Don't use oil or gas lanterns or torches, matches, lighters, or anything else with an open flame that could cause dangerous flammables present in the home to explode. Don't handle live electrical equipment in wet areas. Always have a professional check and dry electrical equipment before returning it to service. If you're uncertain whether equipment is live, assume it is. Don't visit the disaster area unnecessarily. Your presence may hamper rescue and other emergency operations. Don't restart any electrical equipment before having it assessed by a qualified contractor. Submersion of electric or gas heating and cooling equipment can cause system damage. Restarting without proper inspection could result in electrical shock, fire hazard, carbon monoxide poisoning, or explosion. Don't go near a submerged or overflowing septic tank, or try to service it yourself in any way. If you have a pumped system, disconnect the power to the system before checking it, and don't restart the system without having it professionally checked and serviced. Entering the Home DOs: Turn off the power in your home as soon as it is safe to enter, even if the utility has turned power off in your neighborhood. Turn all electricity off at the main breaker box or fuse box. Use a dry wooden stick to switch off the main breaker, if necessary, instead of stepping in water to reach the electrical box. Shut off the gas by turning the handle of the gas valve perpendicular to the pipe. If the valve handle is parallel to the pipe, the gas is on. Leave the premises immediately if you smell gas. Check for broken or leaking water pipes. If you find any, turn off the water supply at the main. If your pipes don't appear to be leaking or broken, you can use tap water for hosing and some cleaning, but not for drinking, cooking, or washing dishes or clothes until you're sure it's safe. Find and protect valuable items, such as money, important papers, jewelry, photographs, and family heirlooms. Wash the mud off these items before they dry, if possible. Move them to another location to safe-keeping. Step carefully as water and mud can make floors very slippery. Also watch out for loose flooring and ceilings that are sagging, as well as for snakes and animals. DON'Ts: Don't step in water when turning off the electricity in your home. Instead, use a dry wooden stick to switch off the main breaker, if necessary. Don't ignore the importance of turning off power in your home, regardless of whether the utility company has turned it off in your neighborhood. The utility company may restore power without warning. Don't try to pick up or clean everything until the more important things are taken care of. Back to Table of Contents Part 2: Drying Out Your Home Now you're ready to begin drying out your home and establishing your plan for rebuilding. The information contained in this section will help you to dry out and decontaminate your home, sort through the debris, and get ready to rebuild your home with energy efficiency in mind. Drying and Disinfecting Your Home Flooding in your home has several consequences. Materials submerged in flood water can decay, swell, and warp. Electrical equipment and components can become damaged and may cause fires or electrical shock if not replaced after a flood. Wet surfaces encourage mold growth, which discolors surfaces, leads to odor problems, deteriorates building materials, and may cause allergic reactions and other health problems in susceptible individuals. Mud leaves things dirty and the contaminants that may be contained in this mud can pose potential health threats. Controlling and preventing decay is easier to accomplish and reduces the health risks to occupants if done correctly. Control and prevention of the effects of mold and other contaminants is more difficult to accomplish. However, the stakes are much higher. You can minimize these risks by reducing moisture levels in your house through drying, and by decontaminating building surfaces. After a flood, you must both dry and decontaminate your home. Either measure alone is not enough. Because flood water and mud contain sewage, hazardous and toxic materials released upriver, micro-organisms, and other contaminants, it is essential to both dry and decontaminate your home. Drying without decontamination, or decontamination without drying, are ineffective. Remember too, that all materials and tools you use in the process, such as clothing, wet/dry vacuums, etc., will become contaminated and in need of disinfecting when you are finished. CAUTION: Contact with flood water may result in severe health risks. Contaminants in flood water can induce cancer, induce birth defects, reduce immune system performance, poison tissues, cause "sick building syndrome," tuberculosis, Legionnaire's disease, aspergillosis, hypersensitivity pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, and viral respiratory infection. Measures to Help Dry the House Ventilate the building as soon as possible. Open doors and windows, as well as cabinets, drawers, and closets. Circulateas much air as possible through the building and its cavities, such as walls and attics. Heat the building as soon as possible. Moisture will move from inside the home if the indoor temperature is warmer than the outside temperature. Ventilating and heating are more effective when done together than either is alone. If your electricity has been safely restored, use portable fans, window air conditioners (set on fan exhaust only), and dehumidifiers to help speed drying. Remember that it is more effective to remove air from the building than to bring air in. Therefore, if you are using a fan to speed drying, aim it toward the outside to move moist air out. Use a wet-vacuum to remove as much water as possible from the floors and carpets. CAUTION: Don't use a regular vacuum cleaner on wet carpet. Regular vacuum cleaners are not designed to remove water and mud and attempting this may result in electric shock. The central fans and blowers of forced-air heating and air-conditioning systems can be disconnected from contaminated ductwork and can be operated for exhausting moist air. Temporary ducts can be connected in such a way that the central blower removes air from the building and discharges it through a temporary duct installed through a window or other opening. This procedure should only be attempted by individuals confident in their ability to rewire electrical systems. If you're unsure how to do this, contact a professional. Also remember that if the fan or blower motor has been submerged, it will need attention by a professional before it can be safely operated. Also, while forced-air heating and air- conditioning systems can be used to help dry your home, because duct work will likely have become wet and contaminated from mud and debris, you will need to clean the ducts before using them. Sheet metal ducts must be hosed out and decontaminated. If liners or insulation are present in sheet metal ducts, remove and discard them. Also remove and discard fiberglass ducts, as they cannot be properly decontaminated. CAUTION: Powerful exhaust fans can cause harmful flue gases to be drawn down chimneys and into the living space if the house is closed up tight. If you are using a powerful exhaust fan when heating systems with chimneys are also present, proper venting, such as opening doors and windows, is essential. How can you tell when your home is dry? Depending on things such as the extent of flooding and the weather, drying your home after a flood could take anywhere from several days to several months, or even longer. To determine whether your house is adequately dried, you should consult with a professional, such as a local contractor, your county extension agent, or the local building inspector,who may have a moisture meter to test your home's moisture level. Since acceptable moisture levels vary in different parts of the country, also consult with these professionals about the recommended levels for your area. If you're unable to locate anyone in your community who offers moisture level testing, see the list of moisture meter manufacturers in Appendix 1. How can you prevent recurrent moisture problems in the future? Moisture may persist as a problem in your home even after you feel that you have dried out everything that can be dried. Excessive moisture that remains in your home can lead to mold, mildew and rot, causing damage that goes beyond the initial mess caused by the flood if it is left unattended. For human health and comfort, relative humidity in a home should be kept between 30 and 50 percent. During winter months, when outdoor temperatures are colder, relative humidity should be kept as close to 40 percent as possible. You can buy simple inexpensive instruments to measure indoor relative humidity at a local hardware store. If you find that the relative humidity of your home is higher than 50 to 60 percent, you should take steps to reduce it, as this might be the source of problems. Take care not to aggravate any moisture problems in your home as well. Seek out and reduce the causes of dampness: a lot of cooking with uncovered pots; unrepaired leaks; hanging clothes indoors to dry; long, hot showers without adequate venting. These few examples might not apply exactly in your case, but they may point you toward potential sources in your home. One suggestion is to open your windows and doors once or twice a day during milder weather to provide a complete change of air. Good circulation of indoor air prevents trapped pockets of moist air from causing problems. Measures to Help Decontaminate the House Your home should be cleaned from mud and silt immediately to remove any sewage and micro-organisms that may have been deposited on building surfaces by flood water. However, removing mud and debris is only the first step. Surfaces that have been cleaned will still be wet and will require time to dry. As these surfaces dry, they will become hosts for mold and other biological growth. Therefore, your home may have to be decontaminated again once it is dry. Cleaning or decontamination alone is not sufficient. You will need to do both. To decontaminate surfaces, apply a solution of diluted chlorine bleach on surfaces that have come in contact with flood water or mud. Experts suggest a solution of 5 to 10 percent bleach. If you can respond right away, the 5 percent solution will be enough. The higher concentration is recommended for surfaces that have heavier contamination. In all cases, repeat the treatment at least twice within a 30-minute period. Be sure the area is well-ventilated, and wear a mask and gloves to protect yourself when doing any cleaning or decontamination work. New decontamination techniques done by trained professionals are also an option to consider. For more information, check your Yellow Pages under "Restoration," "Fire Restoration," or "Carpet Cleaning," or see Appendix 2. Some products and materials, such as some carpets, ceiling tiles, upholstered furniture, and mattresses, will be virtually impossible to dry and effectively decontaminate after a flood. Such products should be removed and discarded. Removing Debris Before installing new materials in your house, remove and dispose of the wet, broken, and unusable materials. Since flood damage is usually widespread throughout affected areas, there will be a significant impact on local landfills. Check with your local health department and sanitarian for recommendations on how best to dispose of debris. Back to Table of Contents Federal Occupational Health Protocol for Controlling Microbial Growth After a Flood 1. Inventory all flooded areas so that every water damaged area is treated and cleaned. 2. Remove and dispose of wet ceiling tiles and drywall within 24 hours of water contact. 3. Remove and replace all drywall and insulation damaged by water up to 12 inches above the water line. Wicking can cause water to move up several inches above the water level. 4. Dry all wet light fixtures. 5. Water damaged furniture should be replaced or cleaned with a diluted 10 bleach solution. Furniture made of particle board or pressed wafer board should be discarded. Wood furniture can be salvaged by removing microbial growth with a bleach solution. However, check to see whether the solution will damage the furniture finish. Fabrics soaked in standing water should be treated the same as carpets (see below). 6. Leave all cabinets and drawers open to facilitate air flow for drying. All surfaces of cabinets and drawers should be wiped and disinfected with a diluted bleach solution. 7. Remove any essential wet paper from the flooded area to a location where it can be dried, photocopied, and then discarded. 8. If a large amount of tiles and paperwork cannot be dried within two days, essential tiles and paperwork may be rinsed with clean water and temporarily frozen until proper drying of the tiles and paperwork can be completed. Never let paper products become moldy. 9. Immediately remove as much water as possible from wet carpeting using wet vacuums. 10. Upon completion of the wet vacuuming, shampoo the carpet with a 10-percent bleach solution twice within a 30-minute period. Begin shampooing as soon as the wet vacuuming is finished. Before beginning the bleach treatment, conduct a spot test in an inconspicuous area to see if the bleach fades the carpet 11. If the carpet fades with the bleach solution, then the area must be immediately dried and treated with an alternate biocide. Consult a microbiologist to determine what type of biocide to use, since certain biocides are inhibitors and may not effectively kill microbes. 12. Rinse the carpet with clear water to remove the bleach solution. Take steps to ensure that the carpet is totally dry within 12-24 hours of treatment. 13. Increase air circulation and ventilation if any biocide is used. 14. Air and material testing for microorganisms should be performed immediately after the flood and periodically thereafter by a trained environmental health professional to ensure that no microbial amplification and excessive human exposure occur. Post-cleanup clearance sampling and inspection are necessary to ensure that no excessive concentrations of microbes still exist in the building. 15. Use dehumidifiers and air conditioning/ventilation to speed up the drying process. Back to Table of Contents Part 3: Planning For Rebuilding - Adding Energy Efficiency This section is offered to provide what you need to know about your house and its damage before you start to rebuild. It also provides details about the many steps you can take at this stage to add energy efficiency into your home to make it more comfortable, affordable, and energy efficient in the years to come. Building Shell Issues Rebuilding a flooded house can be very expensive, so it is important to understand which items you must replace, which items you can salvage, and what you can do yourself. First, you need to estimate your building construction and technical skills. This will tell you how much work you can do yourself without hiring contractors. Second, you need to collect information on the extent of damage, how you would like to rebuild, and your financial resources. Rebuilding is an opportunity for homeowners not only to rebuild, but to upgrade their houses in the process. To accomplish this inexpensively you need to know: the degree of flood damage, the level of improvement you would like to reach during the rebuilding process, what you can do by yourself, what can be done only by professionals, and which materials, if any, can be reused. By carefully inspecting every part of your home and surrounding area, and by answering these questions, it should be possible for you to develop a work- program aimed at inexpensive rebuilding. Air Leaks Increasing a home's airtightness will lower its space heating and cooling requirements, allowing you to install a smaller, less expensive heating or cooling system. Airtightness is essentially accomplished by minimizing leaks using caulking and weatherstripping. While you are repairing, pinpoint where air is leaking into the home and then seal those leaks. Common air leakage points include openings for plumbing and wiring, recessed lights, attic hatches, and at the top of foundation walls (See Figure 1). Caulking can effectively seal smaller gaps (less than about 1/4"), but be sure to select a caulk that is suitable for the materials you are sealing. For larger gaps (1/4" to 1"), use an expanding foam, or a backer rod followed by caulk. If your windows and doors have been broken or damaged due to flooding, now is anopportune time to upgrade their efficiencies. A simple and quick way to cut down the heat loss from your existing windows is to seal around them with caulk. Doors should also be weatherstripped to make a tight seal when they are closed. Back to Table of Contents Windows Windows can account for as much as 25 percent of the heat loss in homes. If existing units are in good condition, you can cost-effectively improve their performance with weatherstripping and caulk, as mentioned earlier. To double the energy efficiency of single-pane windows, install storm windows. If your existing windows have been damaged or are in poor condition, consider replacing them with new, higher efficiency units. Double-pane windows incorporating the new technologies of low-emissivity coatings and gas-filling for greater insulation value are now the standard with many major window manufacturers. These units could cost about 25 percent more than a standard, double-glazed unit, but they are about twice as efficient, making the cost premium worthwhile. Select wood, vinyl, or fiberglass frames rather than metal ones. Metals such as steel or aluminum are poor insulators and can account for as much as 24 percent of a window's overall heat loss, in addition to contributing to condensation problems. There are, however, metal windows which include a "thermal break" to avoid high heat loss. Be sure to ask for this feature if you decide to select metal windows. And finally, windows that close against compression seals, such as casement and awning windows, tend to be more airtight than windows with sliding seals, such as double-hung and horizontal sliders. Doors Inspect exterior doors to be sure they are in good condition. Solid wooden doors that swell will tend to return to their original size when dry. Give them time to dry thoroughly before making adjustments. Check for warping or other structural damage if the doors have been exposed to flood water. Quality construction, proper fit, adequate weatherstripping, airtight jambs, and tight-fitting hardware are important to a door's efficiency. Obviously, any broken glass in the door should be replaced. Sweeps installed on the bottoms of doors can also help to ensure a tight seal. If your door is not very airtight, consider installing a storm door to reduce heat loss, or replacing the door with a new, insulated model with good weatherstripping. Many wood doors are made from hardboard or contain hardboard spacers. However, wood products such as hardboard, plywood and oriented-strand boards will not regain their original shape when dried after substantial wetting. Plywood and oriented-strand boards may delaminate. Hardboard swells when wet and can lose its strength. These products will have to be discarded and replaced. Insulation If flood water has reached the insulation of your walls, floors, or ceiling, you will need to replace it (See Figure 2). Some sources say that fiberglass insulation can be dried and reused with no loss of thermal performance. However, once any type of insulation has been exposed to flood water, the possibility for mold or mildew growth and the resultant potential indoor air quality problem exists. Therefore, flood-contaminated insulation should be replaced. Insulation is not the most expensive of materials and salvaging it is probably not worth the effort given the potential for problems. Replacing your insulation provides an opportunity to select a product with a higher insulating or R-value, which will slow down the heat lost or gained within the house. For example, many homes with standard two-by-four framing have fibrous batts rated R-11. Within the same limited space, you can boost the insulating value to R-13 or R-15 by installing medium- or high-density fiberglass batts. Another option to increase your wall's R-value is to add insulating foam sheathing to the outside walls. While availability and cost of these materials may vary in different areas, they can be cost-effective especially where energy costs are high. Added insulation may allow you to downsize your heating or cooling systems, saving energy and money. You should also insulate attics and floors above unconditioned spaces to at least the minimum recommended levels. To determine what these levels are for your area, see Figure 3. As you replace your insulation, you will discover that drywall and wood framing may also be wet. While you'll want to replace your insulation and drywall as soon as you can, be aware that it can take weeks or months for a house to completely dry out. The house must be completely dry before it is re-insulated to avoid later damage to building materials and serious health problems for your family that may develop if moisture, mold, and mildew are allowed to go untreated in your house. Back to Table of Contents Foundations Wet or flooded foundations will be a continuous source of moisture, and can increase the time needed to dry the rest of the house. Homes with basements require special attention during the aftermath of a flood. Do not be in too big a hurry to pump water out of your basement. Water in the ground outside your house is pushing hard against the outside of your basement walls. At the same time, the water inside your basement is pushing back. It is important to keep these two forces balanced as the water subsides. If the forces become unbalanced by pumping too rapidly, the basement floors or walls may crack. It's important to keep basement floor drains open and clear as flood water recedes to allow the pressures from outside and inside the foundation walls to equalize. Crawl spaces require special attention as well. First, remove and discard all wet insulation and plastic sheeting you find there. Next, dry out the crawl space using natural or powered ventilation such as a fan if necessary. This may be a good time to check with local building officials to determine if your crawl space is adequately vented. Finally, crawl spaces should have continuous plastic ground covers installed once standing water has been drained or pumped out of the crawl space. Damp ground that is not covered will continue to be a major moisture source. Crawl spaces should be ventilated as much as possible to dry them out. Floors and Flooring Unfortunately, most floor coverings will not survive a flood and should probably be replaced. If you can remove them yourself, you can save a lot of time and money. By removing them you will also be helping the house to dry. And doing so doesn't require any special equipment or experience. If the floodwater reached wall-to-wall carpeting, you should discard it. To make this job easier, cut carpet and padding into strips that are small enough to carry. Tile, vinyl, and linoleum should also be removed to speed the drying of the floor. Although a good floor finish helps by preventing the water from penetrating the surface from above, the underside of the floor allows water to penetrate from below and cause swelling and damage. When the floor is dry, you can sometimes correct "cupping" by sanding and refinishing. Otherwise, you must replace the flooring. Tile, vinyl, and linoleum are usually installed over an underlayment, which in turn is installed on a structural subfloor. Water can loosen these materials directly or through swelling of the underlayment so it may be necessary to replace the flooring material and probably even the underlayment. Structural subflooring is usually plywood or oriented-strand board. Older types of plywood made for interiors are especially susceptible to damage since they may not have waterproof glue between the veneers. Water penetrates the unfinished edges and surfaces of the plywood causing the veneers to soften, swell and delaminate. If this has occurred, you may need to replace the structuralsubfloor as well. If in doubt, check with your local building department or a contractor. Before you begin to rebuild or refinish, it's important that the wood structure of the home be completely dry. Refer to the earlier section on drying and decontaminating your home. Walls Interior Finish In most homes, ceilings and walls are covered by either plaster or drywall. Plaster can regain its strength when dried, however it can not be decontaminated. Therefore, wet plaster should be removed and discarded. Drywall acts like a sponge drawing water up above the flood level. Drywall becomes very fragile if it stays wet for a long time, and it will fall apart when bumped. Drywall can't be decontaminated either and should also be discarded. Because new drywall will be installed horizontally, a good line to remove old drywall to will be about 48" above the floor. Check to make sure that the insulation above this line is dry and hasn't wicked water any higher. Insulation can act like a paper towel does with a counter spill, pulling up water much higher than the point of contact with flood water. If it is wet, remove all drywall. All wall coverings inhibit drying so they should be removed and discarded, even in homes where the flood water has not actually reached the walls. New wall coverings can be installed once the building has been dried and decontaminated. Wood construction is durable and will normally be structurally sound even after being in water. But once the water recedes, the moist contaminated environment allows decay organisms to flourish. If the environment persists, the decay will cause structural damage. Therefore, you must dry the structure. Kiln-dried or well-seasoned wood used for residential framing can absorb water and will swell as a result. However, as the wood dries it will often return to its original shape and strength. Remember that even if this occurs, you will need to decontaminate. Exterior Finish Most homes will have either siding or brick on the exterior. To facilitate drying, walls can also be opened from the exterior. In the case of wood-lapped siding, plastic wedges can be inserted under the siding at the horizontal lap joint. Use a pry bar carefully. Place a wedge beside each nail. The wedges will stay in place permanently and will improve paint performance. These wedges under siding are only an additional measure, not an alternative measure - you must still open and completely expose all exterior walls from the inside of the home. In the case of brick, generally good quality brick masonry can withstand flooding over long periods. Most types of brick will dry out and show no permanent damage from water. However, if the mortar is old or of poor quality, damage can occur from strong water currents or wave action. In addition, a disturbance or subsidence of the foundation can cause cracks in brick masonry. Do a careful inspection or get professional help. Even tiny cracks may be evidence of much larger and costly problems with the foundation. Electrical Electrical wiring in walls may suffer damage from wetting. The damage will depend on how well-sealed and impervious its shielding is. In many homes, plastic coated wiring is used, and it is fairly waterproof. Plastic-coated wiring will probably not need to be replaced after a flood. Any outlet or switch, and all connections that have been under water for any period, however, may corrode. It is cheaper and safer to replace outlets and switches and to redo connections than to repair them. All electrical work should only be done by a qualified electrician. During the rebuild, you may want to consider adding or moving outlets, switches and fixtures. Ground fault interrupters installed in each branch of an electrical circuit are a good idea to consider as well. If the house is old, it is possible the existing electrical service maybe undersized. Consult your contractor about the feasibility of adding a larger service entry and more breakers. Since you'll be doing electrical work anyway to recover from the flood and the walls will be open for easy access, it may be a timely opportunity to consider electrical system improvements. Also, cabling for television, audio, and even security systems will be easy to install at this time. Ceilings A ceiling may not have been touched by flood water, but it can still be damaged by humidity. Check to see if drywall has swelled or pulled away from the framing. If it has, replacement will probably be necessary. If sections of the ceiling are sagging, carefully punch a few small holes at the low spots to drain collected water. If flood water reached a drywall ceiling, you should remove and replace it. If the ceiling is plaster, it will dry eventually but will likely sag or crack, so it should also be removed and replaced. Remove all ceiling insulation to allow the joists to dry. Consider upgrading the ceiling insulation as you rebuild. Remember, once the insulation contractor is on site to reinsulate walls, the extra cost of additional ceiling or attic insulation could be relatively minor. Back to Table of Contents Building Systems and Equipment Issues Flooding Effects on Equipment and Appliances Residential heating and cooling systems, refrigerators, water heaters and other appliances in contact with flood water can pose an extreme risk to the homeowner. CAUTION: Gas and electricity are dangerous and if not properly handled and controlled, can result in explosion, electrical shock, and even death. Therefore, from a safety standpoint, it is essential to restore heating and cooling systems and appliances to safe operating condition through repair or replacement before restoring power. In addition to safety, there are health concerns associated with equipment and appliances affected by floods. Always assume that flood water brings contaminants. If equipment in the home has been in contact with flood water, the equipment could be contaminated by harmful bacteria and organics from the flood water. It is essential to eliminate these substances from appliances, particularly those used for food storage and preparation, and any equipment in contact with potable water. While thorough cleaning of all surfaces with a disinfectant is necessary, you need to do more to return equipment to safe operation. The general procedure involved is cleaning, disinfecting, drying, and having a qualified professional inspect equipment. Repairing your home and replacing its various systems represents a big opportunity for you to save significant amounts of energy and money in the long term. If your heating system, water heater, air conditioner and other major appliances have been damaged, you can upgrade to more energy-efficient models. Some energy-efficient appliances cost no more than their inefficient counterparts. And while an energy-efficient furnace or air conditioner may cost you more initially, it will be cheaper to operate and will pay for itself in energy savings in just a few years. For example,if your gas furnace is only about 60-percent efficient, as many older models are, upgrading to a 90-percent efficient model can lower your annual heating bill by about one-third. A new energy efficient refrigerator will consume about half the electricity of a model built 15 years ago. Depending on your local electric rates, a new model could save you up to $100 per year. Additionally, your utility may offer rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners or refrigerators. Utilities, along with government and private agencies in your area, are ready to help you make informed energy-saving decisions as you rehabilitate your flood-damaged home. The Federal Government sets energy consumption limits on furnaces, clothes washers, water heaters, dishwashers, refrigerators and freezers, room air conditioners, central air conditioners and heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. As a result, today appliances are more energy-efficient than their predecessors. However, many appliances are more efficient than the minimum standards. Use the EnergyGuide labels to compare efficiencies of appliances. These labels display the appliance's annual energy cost, based on estimated annual hours of use and on a national average energy price. Because energy prices vary from region to region, the labels also include a cost table that allows consumers to estimate operating costs based on local rates. An excellent reference to help you choose energy efficient heating, cooling, and water-heating equipment is the Consumer Guide to Home Energy Savings, which lists the most energy efficient models available in all of these categories and more. See other sources of information in Appendix 2. Special Considerations For Electric Motors There are a considerable number of electric motors in your home. The furnace, whether gas or electric, washer, dryer, air-conditioner, dishwasher, refrigerator, and freezer all have an electric motor which may be damaged by exposure to flood water. As always, safety should be your first consideration. CAUTION: Don't start up any heating, cooling, or other electrical equipment that has come in contact with flood water. Serious damage and life- threatening injury can occur. Be sure that all electrical equipment is either unplugged or power to it has been disconnected at the main breaker. Any electrical equipment that has an electric motor and has been subjected to flood water will need to be inspected and evaluated individually by appropriate professionals before using. Contact your insurance adjuster to determine your coverage for repair versus replacement, especially of heating and air conditioning equipment. Also check your warranty, if possible. Flood damage to this equipment may not be covered by warranty. The objective is to make an informed decision on whether repair or replacement is the best course. Successfully repairing an electric motor depends on the following considerations: the length of time the motor was under water, the age of the motor, the type of bearings involved and how they are lubricated, and the type of contaminants in the flood water. Repair costs, particularly for heating and cooling equipment that has been exposed to flood water will likely be extensive. Manufacturers usually recommend that all motors, electrical components, safety controls, and (in the case of gas appliances) gas valves be replaced. A detailed and thorough cleaning and disinfecting of all components is also recommended. Given the likely expense of attempting to have equipment repaired, replacement may be the best option. Especially considering the potential for selecting new equipment which is much more energy efficient. Space Heating Systems Gas Furnaces and Boilers Natural gas furnaces, space heaters and boilers all have gas valves and controls that are especially vulnerable to water damage from floods. Corrosion begins inside the valves and controls, and damage may not be readily visible, even if the outside of the device is clean and dry. At a minimum, this damage can result in reliability problems. More severe consequences could be fire or explosion. If there is any question whether flood water has reached a gas appliance, have the unit checked by a professional. In all cases where you have decided to try to salvage the unit, you will need to replace gas valves, pilot and burner orifices, controls, and the filter. This work should only be done by a qualified professional. There are differing opinions regarding replacement versus repair of flood- damaged heating systems; however, most experts recommend replacement. Even if a furnace has been cleaned of debris and mud, and disinfected (often at great cost), and seems to be working properly, parts may later corrode or malfunction and you may also lose your warranty coverage. The older a heating system is, the more likely it is to be inefficient, so you may be better off replacing yours even if it hasn't sustained much damage. Replacing a heating system is a complex matter, difficult under any circumstances. Yet, as a result of flood damage, you may have no choice but to replace your furnace. You can turn misfortune into opportunity by considering a new, energy-efficient model that will lower your future heating bills. Depending on the type of fuel you use - oil, electricity, propane, wood or natural gas - this may be also a good time to consider switching fuels. See the worksheet in Appendix 3 to help determine which fuel will be cheapest for you. Also ask your local utility about available rebates for new energy-efficient gas or propane furnaces. If you have a central forced-air furnace in the house you are repairing, devote some attention to your ductwork too. Do not try to salvage duct insulation that has been in contact with flood water. It is impossible to decontaminate. Next, clean, dry and disinfect the ductwork. Doing a thorough job will require disassembling the ductwork. Sincemany ducts are leaky, uninsulated, and lose a tremendous amount of heat, this is also your opportunity to eliminate wasteful heat loss. The best approach is to carefully seal all joints in the ductwork, and insulate all ducts located in unconditioned spaces such as attics and crawl spaces. Special Considerations for Propane Systems Propane-fired heating equipment should be dealt with the same way as indicated for natural gas-fired equipment. In every case, you should replace all valves and controls that have been in contact with flood water. Propane systems also require attention to their gas pressure regulator. This regulator contains a small vent hole in its body to sense outside pressure. For effective gas regulation, this hole must always remain unobstructed. During a flood, debris can easily plug the hole, causing dangerous malfunction and corrosion. CAUTION: You must replace all pressure regulators used in propane systems affected by flood water. Unlike natural gas, propane is heavier than air. Consequently, propane can settle to the floor or to the basement of a home, and being invisible, would produce a hazardous situation that could easily go unnoticed. Basements and other low places are locations where propane would tend to collect. This makes working around areas where propane has leaked quite dangerous. Use extreme caution where there is the potential for propane leaks and get propane equipment checked, repaired and/or replaced by a qualified professional as quickly as possible. Electric Heat Electric resistance space heating for homes exists in a variety of configurations, but the most common type is the wall- or baseboard-mounted units. Although they can be costly to operate depending on the price of electricity in your area, these systems have flexibility in providing heat to individual rooms in a house and can even be operated from individual thermostats in each room or zone of a house. The baseboard-mount types have no moving parts and unless they are damaged by an electrical short, they will withstand flood conditions. Before returning these systems to operation, disconnect electrical power to each unit by switching off the main breaker. All connections at the heater and control thermostat should be allowed to dry carefully and thoroughly. Before restoring electrical power, a qualified electrician should check for shorts on all heating circuits. You can then restore electrical power and use the heaters to help dry out the interior of the house. Sometimes in emergencies, stand-alone, plug-in heaters are used by homeowners as a source of temporary supplemental heat. These heaters, however, usuallycontain a small fan, and its motor will likely need special attention after being submerged. A second type of electric space heat is the central electric furnace. This furnace consists of electrically heated coils, a fan to provide air circulation across the coils, and controls which include safety relays. Just like the gas forced-air furnace, the electric forced-air system is susceptible to corrosion and damage, resulting in reliability problems or safety hazards. If there is any question whether flood water has reached an electric furnace, have the unit checked by a professional. In all cases where you have decided to try to salvage the unit, a qualified professional will need to replace all controls, safety interlocks, and probably motors. Electric forced-air heating systems have essentially the same ductwork as gas- forced air systems, so the same actions are in order. Discard any wet duct insulation. Disassemble, clean, disinfect, and dry the ductwork. Take extra care in reassembling the ductwork to avoid leaks. Carefully insulate all ducts in unconditioned spaces. Radiant Ceiling Heat In this type of heating system, electrically-heated cables are embedded in the plaster or drywall ceiling. The cables warm the ceiling, which in turn warms the room by radiant heat. If the ceiling becomes wet from a flood, the plasterboard will weaken, and perhaps crack and the ceiling will need replacement. Although the electrical cables themselves may appear to be undamaged due to their tough, waterproof coating, there may have been large mechanical stresses on the cable, and a qualified electrician should be consulted to determine whether the cable is reusable. Heat Pumps And Air Conditioning Systems Heat pumps extract heat from the outside air and transport this heat into the house with the aid of a refrigerant. Reversing this process allows the same heat pump system to provide air conditioning for the home, eliminating the need for a separate cooling system. Some heat pumps (the unitary type) are simple wall-or window- mount, and some (split systems) are more elaborate, with part of the components indoors and part outdoors. Of the various types of split-system heat pumps that are in use, two things they have in common are the power and control wiring between the indoor and outdoor parts of the system, and the piping that moves the refrigerant from inside to outside the home and back. The refrigeration circuit of virtually all residential heat pump (and air conditioning) systems is sealed at the factory. In a split system it is sealed by the contractor during installation. Even if the system is in contact with flood water for a long period, this sealed system is likely to remain intact. However, if flood water has repositioned either the indoor or outdoor units of a split system by only a small amount, there is the potential for a breached refrigerant system. The heat pump (or air conditioning system) will then require major repair or full replacement. If the refrigerant system remains intact after the flood, the entire system should be cleaned, dried, and disinfected. You should have a qualified electrical or refrigeration mechanic check all electrical and refrigeration connections for both indoor and outdoor units, including all control circuits. The decision to repair or replace should be made by a qualified professional on a case-by-case basis. As with the other types of heating systems, the heat pump system will also have a system of distribution ducts. The same procedures of disassembling, cleaning, disinfecting, and drying are in order. Remember to carefully reassemble the ductwork without leaks, and to insulate those portions of the ducts that go through unconditioned spaces. If you need to replace your existing heat pump, or if you are considering switching to a heat pump because your existing heating system is beyond repair, consider the most energy-efficient model available. If electricity is the only energy source available, and the climate requires considerable cooling and heating during the year, a heat pump system can be more cost-effective than electric resistance heating with a separate air- conditioning system. Using the worksheet in Appendix 3, you can analyze the relative costs of various fuels and heating systems. To compare the energy efficiency of residential heat pumps, consult the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) for cooling and the Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) for heating. Efficiency ratings for heat pumps are listed in the Consumer Guide to Home Energy Savings, Third Edition. More extensive ratings of heat pumps can be found in an annual directory published by the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI). You may be able to obtain this directory in a library or from a contractor. See Appendix 2 for sources of both references. Space Cooling Systems whether your home has been cooled with a central air conditioning system, a heat pump, or room air conditioners, you can replace flood-damaged units with energy-efficient models that can cut energy use by more than 20 percent. A professional can help you select a unit based on the size and tightness of your home. Your local utility may offer rebates on the purchase of energy-efficient air conditioners, too. Consumers can compare the efficiency of central air conditioners and heat pumps (in the cooling cycle) using the SEER. The higher the SEER, the more efficient the unit. Room air conditioners are rated by a counterpart system called the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommends central air conditioners with a SEER of at least 12, and room conditioners with an EER of at least 9. No matter what type of system you choose, make sure that it is sized properly by a qualified air-conditioning technician. If your cooling needs are modest, then room air conditioners are probably your best choice. Water Heating Systems Whether your water heater is gas or electric, if it was exposed to flood water, the unit should be replaced. A new water heater is a relatively small investment, and replacing it is fairly easy to do. In a gas unit, valves and controls will likely corrode. In an electric unit, the thermostat and controls will likely corrode. In both types, the insulation surrounding the unit will be contaminated and will be nearly impossible to disinfect. Additionally, the insulation would take a long time to dry, leading to corrosion of the tank from the outside. Even if water heater components have been cleaned and the unit seems to operate properly, parts may corrode in the future. Both gas and electric water heaters have a pressure relief valve that can corrode and stick after being exposed to flood water. Be sure, therefore, to replace this valve as well. Next to space heating, water heating uses the most energy in the home. As with furnaces, new energy-efficient models are available. Insulation levels in new gas and electric water heaters are higher today than in the past. Some utilities offer rebates on their purchase. You may even be able to get a package deal from your heating supplier on a furnace and a water heater. And, as with furnaces, you may want to look at the operating costs of electric versus gas water heaters. Depending on your electric rates and availability of gas, a gas water heater can be cheaper to operate. Remember, too, that many different measures are available to reduce hot water consumption and thereby decrease water heating costs. For example, low- flow shower heads use 1 to 4 gallons per minute (gpm), compared to standard- flow shower heads, which generally use 5 to 10 gpm. A shower head flow restrictor can save as much as 6 gpm. Similarly, insulating hot water pipes in your home can reduce the amount of energy (and water) lost while waiting for water to become hot at the tap. For more useful information on conserving water in the home, consult Water Efficiency for Your Home: Products and Advice Which Save Water, Energy, and Money (See Appendix 2). Back to Table of Contents Appliances Large Appliances Large appliances include stoves, refrigerators, freezers, washing machines and dryers. Evaluate these items one-by- one and determine whether it is more prudent to salvage or replace them. In all cases, there are some general guidelines to follow. Stoves With stoves, an assessment by a qualified appliance technician will help the homeowner decide if it is better to replace or to refurbish the damaged stove. As a start, disconnect the stove and remove the back cover to expose portions of the insulation. Allow the insulation to dry thoroughly before turning the stove on. If the controls and rheostats have gotten wet, have them replaced. With gas stoves, you should always replace the pilot orifices and gas control system if water was present. The interior surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected. Once the stove is operable, an extended "bake out" period is recommended. The high operating temperature of a stove will help eliminate residual moisture that could cause later problems. If your refrigerator or freezer was submerged in flood water, these appliances should be replaced. Refrigerators and Freezers Refrigerators and freezers contain insulation that could be wet if the units were under water. This insulation is difficult to reach without destroying the cabinet of the unit. It will dry very slowly since the cabinet walls remain relatively cool while the appliance is on. Mullion heaters in some refrigerators, which eliminate condensation, are of further concern in water-soaked cabinets because they present a shock hazard. Further, the slow dry-out of the insulation in refrigerator/freezers is conducive to the formation and growth of bacteria carried between the walls of the cabinet by the flood. This also presents a health hazard. Refrigerators alone can account for as much as 15 percent of a home's energy budget, so replacing an old unit with a newer energy-efficient one can save considerable amounts of money and energy. A typical new refrigerator with automatic defrost and a top-mounted freezer uses about 800 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year; a typical 20-year-old model uses about 2,000 kWh per year. When shopping for a new refrigerator, keep in mind that different features can have an impact on energy consumption. For example, side-by-side refrigerator/ freezer units typically consume about 18 percent more energy than units with a top-mount freezer. Of course, larger units consume more than smaller ones,and units with automatic defrost tend to use more energy than their manual defrost counterparts. Select an energy- efficient refrigerator with only the features that you need. The expected long life of refrigerators coupled with high efficiencies available in the newer models will produce savings to the homeowner for years to come. If flood water covered only a few inches of the kitchen floor, it is likely that the insulation for refrigerator/freezers is dry, and you will only need to check the refrigeration system along the bottom and back of the unit. Like heat pump and air conditioning units, the refrigeration system is sealed in refrigerators and freezers. Unless punctured during the flood, they should be in good shape. Check all electrical controls including the defrost timer, thermostats and other safety interlocks in refrigerators and replace them if there is significant water damage. Washers and Dryers As with other appliances, clean, dry and disinfect your washing machine and dryer and have an electrician or appliance technician check all electrical contacts and connections. Replacement of the timer controls of these units will likely be necessary. If you decide to replace your clothes washer, you should be aware that most of the energy used by washing machines is used to heat the water. Look for machines that offer several water temperature selections for both the wash and rinse cycles. A load of laundry washed and rinsed in hot water can cost as much as 20 times more than one using cold water for both cycles. Also look for machines that allow you to select different water levels. If you decide to replace your clothes dryer, you should be aware that newer models are able to sense dryness and automatically shut off. Compared with the older models, which operate on a timer, these new models can save between 10 and 15 percent on energy costs. Dishwashers As with other appliances, clean, dry and disinfect your dishwasher and have an electrician or appliance technician check all electrical contacts and connections. Replacement of the timer control system will likely be necessary. If you need to replace the dishwasher, consider a new energy efficient model. Most dishwashers today use about 8 to 14 gallons of water per wash. Most of the energy used by dishwashers goes toward heating water, so units using less water also use less energy. Many dishwashers available have energy-saving features, such as "no heat" drying cycles and light wash cycles, which can save both water and energy. Units equipped with booster heaters will heat water to the higher levels necessary to adequately clean anddisinfect dishes (generally 140 degrees F). This feature allows you to keep your water heater at a lower setting, thus reducing your household water-heating costs. For each ten degrees you can reduce your water heater temperature, you will save about 3 to 5 percent. Small Appliances You will need to unplug, clean, dry, and disinfect small appliances including microwave ovens, TV's, etc. inside and out. Examine them carefully and determine whether to repair or to replace them. In some cases, simply drying the entire unit with careful attention to the electrical parts will be enough. Allow an extended drying time before testing the appliance. Lighting Incandescent bulbs are the most common source of lighting in American homes, and they waste a lot of energy. Ninety percent of the energy consumed is dissipated as heat. Fluorescent lamps have much greater efficiency than incandescent lamps, especially when combined with the high-efficiency electronic ballasts now on the market. Compact fluorescent lights are available that can replace incandescents using the same fixture, and save considerable energy for the same light output. Compact fluorescent lamps are more expensive than incandescents, costing about $15 to $20 each. But they last much longer and use a great deal less electricity. Depending on how long your lights are typically on each day, installing compact fluorescents could save you quite a bit of money over time. And, if your utility offers rebates that lower the initial cost of these lamps, they'll pay for themselves even more quickly. Back to Table of Contents Part 4: Summary The ravages of a flood will require you to replace some, if not all, of the major heating and cooling equipment in your home and replace some of the building components. In cases where replacement is the best solution, selecting equipment or components with higher energy efficiency can often be accomplished at relatively little additional cost. Often the improved energy conservation features used in rebuilding the home's shell will allow downsizing of some of the heating and cooling equipment to the point where the additional costs, if any, of higher efficiency equipment is offset by savings from buying a smaller system. Energy conservation will add substantial value to the house and will provide increased dividends to the homeowner in reduced utility bills, especially if fuel costs rise in the future. Perhaps the major question left involves financing, or from the homeowner's point of view, "Improved energy efficiency sounds fine, but how can I pay for it?" Many sources of funds and techniques are available and should be explored to reduce the cost of adding energy efficiency in homes which are being rebuilt after flooding. Some of these are listed below. Utility rebate programs. Many utilities offer incentive programs that promote residential energy conservation. These programs range from outright subsidies to offset the additional costs of high efficiency systems, to low (perhaps zero) interest loans that are repaid in installments added to your monthly utility bill. By installing an energy- efficient system in a home, the energy costs are smaller than before. These reduced energy costs, even when combined with an interest payment for amortizing the loan from the utility, frequently result in a monthly utility bill that is lower overall than the pre-flood bill. Low-interest home improvement loans. Current low interest rates make home improvement loans more attractive than in the past. The avoided costs from energy savings will help to offset principal and interest payments to service the loan. Disaster relief programs. Funds may be available through disaster relief programs. Remain aware of disaster relief efforts and discussions between local, state and federal organizations and authorities. Bulk purchase buying. Flood damage is usually widespread. Consequently, your equipment replacement needs will probably match those of your neighbor. Therefore, you may be able to save by purchasing similar energy-efficient equipment in bulk quantities by coordination with neighbors, insurance companies, and neighborhood associations. Energy-efficient mortgages. If you do consider adding energy efficiency measures to your home, you may qualify for a special mortgage that rewards such features based on the idea that your energy payments will be lower as a result and you will be a better credit risk. While these mortgages may slightly increase the amount of monthly payments, they will also extend your ability to borrow. These mortgages are offered through four federal lending agencies. Check with your local bank for more details about how to qualify or how you can apply for an energy-efficient mortgage. Finally, after a natural disaster where major rebuilding is necessary, be wary of opportunists who will come into the area trying to make a fortune from your misfortune. Be a cautious consumer. Hire licensed contractors. Always ask for references from previous customers, or check with consumer protection agencies. Don't sign any contracts if you have doubts. Don't pay for work in advance.

Back to Table of Contents Appendix 3: Comparing Heating Fuel Costs Choosing Fuels People decide to switch fuels or heating systems usually for economic reasons. They feel that their current heating system is costing too much money. Sometimes people feel that their existing heating system is inefficient and should be replaced. Or, they are choosing a heating system for a new building. At the same time they wonder, "What fuel should I choose for my new heating system." Useful Heat Useful heat is the heat that reaches the living space providing comfort to the occupants of the space. Useful heat is always less than the potential heating value of the fuel because heat is wasted in the combustion process, in the heat transfer process and in the delivery process. As the efficiency becomes less the cost of useful heat becomes greater. The energy cost index chart will help you to estimate the comparative cost of various fuels. The fuels are listed at the top of each column on the chart and an assumed seasonal heating efficiency is listed at the bottom of each column. The left vertical axis of the chart gives costs per one million Btus (A Btu or British thermal unit is roughly the amount of heat contained in a kitchen match.) Each column contains a yardstick marked off in dollars or cents. Written in each column is the assumed Btu content of the fuel and a ratio like $/MCF or /kWh that will inform you of the units used on the yardstick. Natural gas, propane and oil are assumed to have seasonal heating efficiencies of 60% which is characteristic of central heating systems with pipes or ducts to distribute the heat. All the other fuels are assumed to be space heating systems without the distribution losses. See the second page for a glossary of terms and abbreviations.

IEA data showed that during 1995 the installedcapacity of wind energy systems expanded 40% to over 4900 MW,with energy production exceeding 8 terawatthours last year alone.In Germany and India installations increased more than a megawatta day. In addition to these grid-connected wind power plants therewere thousands of small systems installed to provide electricityfor isolated homes and to cut diesel fuel consumption in remotevillages. The IEA Wind Turbine Systems R&D Agreement, as its name implies,has traditionally focused on cooperative research and development.In recent years the focus has been expanded to address technologydissemination and market deployment questions. Now there is increasinginterest in extending IEA cooperation to additional countriesoutside the 25 that are members of the parent Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Specifically the Executive Committee for Wind Energy R&D,through the IEA Renewable Energy Working Party, has been approachedby the World Bank to assist in the unprecedented expansion ofwind deployment. Because of its diverse international makeup,with 16 member countries including all of the major wind energydevelopers, the IEA is viewed as a source of reliable technicaland economic information and ideas. The World Bank has asked forassistance in the preparation of a series of official notes thatcould be used to describe the technology, economics, its deploymentand implementation and financial issues. The first of these notesis now being developed. Interest in the Agreement has also been expanded to include countriesthat are beginning to develop and deploy wind systems. Recently,representatives from Brazil and Mexico attended the AgreementExecutive Committee meeting for the first time. Mexico is in theOECD and could become a Member in the Agreement. Brazil couldbe eligible to join the Agreement as an Associate Member. Thisis a membership category introduced by the IEA Governing Boardin December 1991 to allow participation of countries that arenot currently members of the IEA and its parent OECD. Associate membership in other IEA Agreements has been increasing.There are now 23 Associate Members in the 19 separate IEA Agreements.Participating non-OECD countries include China, India, Israel,Korea and Russia. To qualify to join the Wind Energy Agreementa country must agree to join at least one of the Agreement Annexesand be invited by the current voting members of the ExecutiveCommittee. Annexes to the Agreement are discussed later in thisNewsletter. The overall question of expanding participation inWind Energy Agreement activities has broad and far-reaching considerations,both to the operation of the Agreement and in encouraging thelarge scale deployment of wind turbines. To consider these questionsan ad hoc Task Force has been formed. It is chaired by R. Rangi(Canada), Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee. Members ofthe Task Force include: E. Sesto (Italy), Past Chairman, M. Legerton(UK), J.'t Hooft (Netherlands), M. Pedersen (Denmark), J. Beurskens(Netherlands) and I. Page (UK). Please feel free to contact themor your country representative with your thoughts and ideas orfor more information about IEA. Their addresses are listed atthe end of this Newsletter. Dan Ancona, Chairman Executive Committee WIND ENERGY R&D NEEDS: IS THE WORK ALL DONE? The following note is based mainly upon two recently publisheddocuments: (1) Current R&D Needs in Wind Energy Technology. Report ofthe 27th Meeting of Experts of IEA Wind Energy Annex XI, heldin Utrecht, Netherlands, September 1995. (2) Prospects and Expectations for Wind Turbine R&D. G.A.M.van Kuik, J.L. 't Hooft and B. Maribo Pedersen. Paper presentedat 1996 European Union Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition.Göthenborg, Sweden, 2024 May 1996. It has been estimated that since 1974 the equivalent of at least1000 million US dollars must have been spent to support wind energyresearch, development and demonstration by those OECD countriesthat have wind energy programmes. This activity, together withthe experience of industry in construction, operation and maintenanceof wind turbines, has led to steady improvements in all aspectsof the technology. These include a more than 10-fold reductionin the cost of wind energy, the development of design guidelinesand international standards and the achievement of high turbinereliability. Wind energy technology has clearly reached a "mature"stage. As a consequence, national and international R&D budgetshave tended to shift from general, basic R toward manufacturer-relatedD. Nevertheless, there are still areas of general wind energy knowledgethat show weak spots or even gaps. So it appears appropriate tostep back and take a fresh look at where future R&D spendingmay best contribute to the overall goal of decreasing the costof wind energy to the point where it is truly competitive withenergy from conventional sources. The views of the manufacturingindustry on this issue are particularly valuable, since thereis often a feeling within industry (a feeling by no means confinedto the wind energy industry) that their R&D needs are notalways best served by some of the basic research carried out byresearch institutes. There seems to be a need for cooperativeprioritisation of research projects, and for improved intercommunication. This review has already begun in the Netherlands and Denmark anda start at international discussion was also made at the IEA expertmeeting last September (ref.1 above). In these discussions thereseems to be a consensus that there is still a need for basic,generic research to be carried out outside of the manufacturingcompanies and wholly or partly funded by public money. However,since the industry has moved from the precompetitive into thecompetitive stage, most of the product and component developmentshould take place within the companies, who should be able tofoot a larger share of the R&D bill. In 1995 a new Dutch plan for wind energy R&D prioritisationwas established, partly as a result of a workshop with industry,designers, consultancy firms, programme managers, scientists andfunding agencies (Novem, ECN and Technical University Delft).Its agreed R&D priorities included aerodynamic modelling,development of design tools, testing, wind field description,modelling of blade buckling, direct drive generators, conditionmonitoring of rotors and reduction of aerodynamic noise. The manufacturersalso asked for special emphasis on transfer of knowledge throughtraining of engineers employed by them at the research institutes.The plan is to be reviewed regularly. In Denmark a Plan of Action is to be finalised shortly. The DanishMinistry of Energy will probably continue to support R,D&Dat approximately the same level, i.e. of the order of 30 MDKK(approximately 5.4 MUSD), half of which will be devoted to basicand applied research. As part of the preparation of the Plan,a small task force was set up to probe the manufacturing industryfor their views. Briefly, the recommendations were that R&Dprojects without much industry interest should receive no priorityand that all R&D related to manufacturing techniques, costoptimisation, structural design, etc. must be carried out by industryitself rather than by public R&D institutes. Public R&Dshould be directed primarily to generic problems in aerodynamics,aerodynamic noise and materials, including exotic ones. Otherresearch is needed in variable speed operation, installation problemswhen installing megawatt turbines, offshore concepts, energy storageand power quality in weak grids. Plans by other IEA countries for future research activities aredescribed in the Country Reports in this issue of the Newsletter. The IEA Meeting of Experts (ref. 1 above) was attended by 22 persons,7 from industries in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden andUK, and other attendees from the same countries and from the USDepartment of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory(NREL) in Colorado. The consensus of the participants regardingpriority areas for future generic research was rather similarto the topics mentioned above (aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, fatigueprediction, aeroacoustics, materials, power conversion, etc.).A more detailed listing of priority subtopics is given in reference1. The idea of trying to pool some of the efforts was discussed,for example costly experimental projects such as wind tunnel testingof new aerofoils and blade dynamic stall. It was also emphasisedthat the size of research teams must be kept above "the criticalmass". One attendee suggested that the present state of theart is comparable with the Douglas DC3 technology of the 1930sand 40s in aviation history a reliable product, but only in basicconcept similar to present day aircraft. One of the conclusions of reference 2 is that as long as windenergy is evolving, there will be a continuous need for R&Don some essential areas. So it seems that the work is notall done! TASK REPORTS Since 1977 a number of collaborative R&D projects, calledTasks, have been undertaken under corresponding Annexes to theWind Energy R&D Agreement, with overall control by the ExecutiveCommittee. Summaries of the status of ongoing Tasks are givenbelow. A complete list of all Tasks will be found near the endof this Newsletter. Task XI Task XIV Task XV Task XVI Task XI Base Technology Information Exchange Most of the member countries participate in this Task; its OperatingAgent is the Department of Fluid Mechanics, Technical Universityof Denmark. One of the activities under this Task is the preparation of aset of Recommended Practices for guidance in wind energy development.The Experts group on "Noise Immission Measurements"held its fourth meeting at the National Wind Test Centre (NWTC)in Boulder, Colorado in March. The group foresees two more meetingsin 1996, and expects to have the document ready before the endof the year. The Experts Group which is preparing the recommendationon "Point Wind Speed Measurements" met in Lyngby, Denmark,in February. Due to scarcity of funding, the first draft of theirdocument has been delayed until about the end of June this year.Another Expert Group on "Lightning Protection and RelatedIssues" had its first meeting in February at AEA, LTT, Culham,UK. They intend to finalise their document this year. From time to time, Experts Meetings are held to exchange informationon specific topics of current interest. The results of the meetingon "Current R&D Needs in Wind Energy Technology",held in Utrecht last September, are summarised in the above note.The 28th Experts Meeting took place on 1112 April in Denmark.The topic was "State of the Art of Aeroelastic Codes forWind Turbine Calculations". The proceedings of the meeting,which was attended by 23 experts, was issued recently. A few topics of continuing interest, referred to as Joint Actions,are periodically reviewed in symposia. The 9th Symposium withinthe Joint Action on "Aerodynamics" took place in Stockholmon 1112 December 1995. There were 23 participants and 16 presentationswere given. Proceedings have been distributed to participants and Executive Committee Membersin April this year. The 4th Symposium within the Joint Actionon "Fatigue" was held on 12 February 1996 at DLR, Stuttgart,Germany with 18 participants. 14 presentations were given. Proceedingshave recently been issued. TASK XIV Field Rotor Aerodynamics The objective of this Task is to coordinate measurements of bladeforces and pressure distributions on different operating windturbines by five participants in four countries (Denmark, TheNetherlands, UK and US). The aim is to permit the validation ofaerodynamic design codes and to develop improved methods for thedesign of stall controlled turbines. The Operating Agent is StichtingEnergieonderzoek Centrum Nederland (ECN). The Task is an ambitious one, involving close cooperation amongthe participants, and the measurement, collection and filing ofhuge quantities of data, particularly from blade pressure distributionmeasurements. As the project has progressed, there have been fivemeetings of participants, the first in Delft on 2 December 1992,and the latest on 56 February this year at NREL (US). After thethird meeting (in March 1994) the project became closely relatedto the EU JOULE project, "Dynamic Stall and 3D Effects". Measurement conditions include rotating and nonrotating operation,at near zero yaw and also at several yaw angles, so that angleof attack variations are deliberately triggered. Methods of determiningangle of attack have been studied, but no "best method"has been chosen. In order to alleviate the "psychologicalbarrier" for potential users of the large data file, mucheffort has been spent on the precise documentation of the fileformat to make it possible for every user to extract relevantinformation easily. Most parties have already supplied data, whichis stored on a public ECN file, retrievable by the participants.Most of the subtasks have been completed, and it appears possibleto meet the scheduled end date of 1 January 1997, which had beenrescheduled with the agreement of the Executive Committee fromthe original target of October 1995. TASK XV Annual Review of Progress in the Implementation of Wind Energyby the IEA Member The Operating Agent (OA) for this Task is the Energy TechnologySupport Unit (ETSU) at Harwell, UK. By May this year 10 countrieshad notified the OA of their participation. The task objectiveis to produce an annual review giving an overview of the progressin the commercial development of wind turbine systems in IEA membercountries in a form suitable for presentation to decision makersin, for example, government, planning authorities, the electricitysupply industry, financial institutions and the wind industry.The final draft of the annual review for 1995 was issued for commentin April, and was presented to the meeting of the Executive Committeein May. The Task has two more years to run, during which timeannual reviews for 1996 and 1997 will be produced. A final reportwill be prepared on completion of the Task. It will collate theresults of the annual reports so that the underlying trends inthe commercial development of wind energy can be identified. TASK XVI Wind Turbine Round Robin Test Programme This is a new Task. A draft Annex XVI to the Wind Energy Agreement,incorporating comments from IEA Paris, was presented for discussionat the May meeting of the Executive Committee. The Task objectivesare to validate wind turbine testing procedures, and to analyseand resolve sources of discrepancies between similar tests atdifferent sites. A series of "round robin" comparisontests is to be carried out at participating national laboratories,using identical machines, comparable test instrumentation anddata acquisition equipment. Joint reports on the results of noise,power performance and loads tests will be published. In additionto forming a basis for improvements in testing procedures andcalibration methods, this project may also assist in the recognitionof foreign certifications. It is expected that the participants in the Task will be the RisøTest Station, Denmark, The Italian Agency of New Technology andEnvironment (ENEA), the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES),Greece, the Atlantic Wind Test Site (AWTS), Canada, and the NationalWind Technology Center (NWTC) of the National Renewable EnergyLaboratory (NREL), United States, which will also act as the OperatingAgent for the Task. COUNTRY NEWS Australia Brazil Canada Denmark Finland Germany Italy Japan Mexico The Netherlands Norway Spain Sweden United Kingdom United States of America Australia The deregulation of the Australian electricity industry is changingthe nature of the utilities from being wholly integrated governmentowned to private generation, transmission and distribution corporations.While each State of Australia is following a different deregulationmodel, a State Government owned regulator is a common theme.The regulator in New South Wales is legislating to require thedistribution corporations to take account of the full costs ofthe environment, including greenhouse effects. This, togetherwith the need for each utility to differentiate itself from itscompetitors, has sent a signal to the Electricity Corporationsto reinvestigate renewable energies. Wind power is particularlywell suited to be the generation source of preference as it isseen as a mature technology that has been successfully establishedin Australia and overseas. In South Australia, ETSA Corporation will spend up to AUD 500,000on a 12 month feasibility study of a 5 MW wind farm in the State.It will determine whether an economically viable wind farm canbe developed to sell "green energy" into the plannedNational Electricity Market, which will comprise South Australia,New South Wales and Victoria. If the wind farm goes ahead it willbe the largest in Australia and the first to be connected to thepower grid. The study results should be available around June1997. In order to assess the wind power potential in New SouthWales (NSW), Pacific Power established an assessment programmeseveral years ago. Wind monitoring towers were set up in the moreprospective regions. The programme is being continued at promisingsites to improve data reliability and to reduce commercial riskof any wind generation projects, and also at new sites resultingfrom experience gained during the programme. Studies are alsobeing conducted to identify the types of wind turbines best suitedto the wind regime in NSW. The 150 kW Windmaster turbine locatedat Malabar in Sydney's eastern suburbs, originally installed inSeptember 1986, is being recommissioned. It is nearing the endof a major refurbishment and is expected to be operational laterin the year. In Western Australia there is a proposal to establish a 225 kWwind turbine at Denham, a diesel grid located about 725 km northwestof Perth. Stage one of this project will examine a high penetrationautomated wind/diesel system. Stage two will investigate the storageof off-peak power generated by the wind turbines. In Tasmania, the Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) is proceedingwith the development of a wind farm at Huxley Hill on the remoteKing Island at an estimated cost of 2.5 MAUD (about 1.9 MUSD).Once installed, the wind farm will provide valuable experiencein the operation of an integrated wind/diesel system. The proposeddevelopment includes three or four turbines at Huxley Hill ofabout 150300 kW capacity on about 30 m high towers. The wind powerwill provide about 18% of the Island's electricity needs. Theproject will also include further monitoring and investigationsinto increasing the wind component to 21% of the combined powersystem at a later date. Wind power is seen in Tasmania as themost promising large scale new renewable energy source, due tothe excellent prevailing westerly winds. City Power in Victoria is offering "green energy" ata price premium. So far the response has been positive,with the Body Shop being identified as one of the larger customers. Brazil As mentioned in the Chairman's article, Brazil is not a memberof the OECD, but could become an Associate Member of the WindEnergy Agreement, and was represented by an observer at the recentmeeting of the Executive Committee in Helsinki. Brazil has a total installed electricity capacity of 64 GW. Morethan 95% of generation is by large highly efficient hydro powerplants. However, in several regions the hydro potential is becomingscarce so that additional utilisation will entail huge investments,high costs and many ecological problems. At an increasing electricityconsumption rate of 6% per year, Brazil will experience seriousshortage of electricity after 2000. Faced with these facts, windis now being considered as one of the most economical alternativesfor future supply. The Ministries of Science & Technologyand Mining & Energy are working jointly for federal policyon wind utilisation, and a R&D Wind Energy Programme is beingimplemented. The specific projects are being carried out jointlyby the universities, the utilities and the private sector. Wind resource assessment has begun in several regions. In thelast 5 years more than 60 modern wind loggers have been installedin 8 states. The Weibull shape parameter for the probability distributionof wind speeds for most of the sites is 3 or more (compared withabout 2 for most temperate zone sites in Europe and North America).This reflects the very steady behaviour of the tropical tradewinds. Moreover, the winds are almost unidirectional on the coastof northeastern Brazil, and the turbulence intensity is low (ofthe order of 0.14). These data have implications on the optimumdesign of wind turbines and of wind farm arrays. A Wind TurbineTest Centre has been set up at Pernambuco in order to demonstratethe technology, certify machines, and to be the focal point forresearch activities. Current research projects include the adaptationof large wind turbines to the Brazilian wind regime, developmentof small and large desalination plants using wind turbines, developmentof special standalone turbines for large water pumping systemsand the design, installation and monitoring of Fernando de NoronhaIsland large hybrid wind/diesel system (1 MW). The first windturbine (75 kW) was commissioned on the Island in 1992. At presentBrazil has about 1.1 MW of wind power capacity in operation, mostof it in the 1 MW wind farm installed in 1994 in the state ofMinas Gerais in the southeast. A prognosis for wind energy development in the period 19962005has been made from the results of several analyses carried outby the Wind Energy Group (UFPE) of the Federal University of Pernambuco.It suggests that a total of 860 MW could be installed by 2005,most of it (620 MW) in the northeast. At present there are fourprojects being planned with a total capacity of about 2.1 MW:(1) several large irrigation projects, (2) a demonstration windfarm in the State of Bahia, (3) a wind farm in the State of Alagoasand (4) a hybrid wind/diesel system in the State of Paraná. Canada The annual budget of the Wind Energy R&D Programme of NaturalResources Canada (NRCan) is about 0.65 MCAD (about 0.48 MUSD),the same as last year. Contributions from contractors, researchinstitutes and provinces are expected to be about 1.5 MCAD. Canada supports two wind test sites: the Atlantic Wind Test Site(AWTS) in Prince Edward Island and the Alberta Renewable EnergyTest Site (ARETS) in western Canada. AWTS is testing a new inverterfor the Lagerwey 80 kW turbine and will participate in the "roundrobin" testing of an AOC 15/50 turbine as part of IEA TaskXVI. The HydroQuebec high penetration wind/diesel concept is beingtested in automatic mode, which permits full shutdown of the dieselunits under high wind conditions. ARETS is testing wind and PVwater pumping systems. The 80 kW Lagerwey turbine at Cambridge Bay has been performingwell. Since installation on 22 September 1994 to the end of April1996 it has generated 262 MWh in 7967 generating hours. Averagewind speed at the site is about 6.4 m/s. The local utility ispleased with its performance and has ordered two Lagerwey turbinesto be installed at Coppermine in the Northwest Territories. Bothsites are above the Arctic Circle. The cold climate version of the Tacke 600 kW wind turbine waserected on 25 September 1995 at Tiverton, Ontario, near the easternshore of Lake Huron, and has performed with high reliability,generating 937 MWh of electricity in 4,804 generating hours. TackeWindpower Inc. (TWP) has set up a manufacturing plant for Tacke600 turbine blades in Ontario. They have received an export orderfor 16 MCAD worth of blades from their parent company in Germanyfor projects in other countries and are currently manufacturingone blade per day. In August 1993 a 150 kW Bonus turbine was installed on a hill(1450 m height) in Yukon for testing with heated blades in rimeicing conditions. By December 1995 it had produced 557 MWH in11,717 generating hours. Its average capacity factor in that periodwas 17.8% with an availability of 95%. The oldest operating windturbine in Canada is the 50 kW Indal VAWT, installed on VancouverIsland in March 1981 It has generated 592 MWh in 34,688 generatinghours during its more than 15 years of nearly maintenance-freeoperation. About 22 MW of wind power plants operate in Canada. Total electricitygenerated during 1995 was about 55 GWh. 120 MW are planned forinstallation in Ontario; bidders have been short listed, but announcementhas been delayed. Kenetech has contracted to install 100 MW inQuebec but they have delayed the project until their larger turbinebecomes available. Denmark As of 31 December 1995 the total number of grid-connected windturbines in Denmark, privately as well as utility owned, was 3893units with a total electrical capacity of 635 MW. The 3288 privatelyowned turbines totalled 445 MW and the 605 utility owned machinestotalled 190 MW. The total increase in 1995 was 199 turbines withoutput capacity of 98 MW. Nearly half were utility owned. Thetotal electricity production by wind turbines in 1995 was 1160GWH, supplying about 3.7% of annual Danish electricity consumption.The technical availability of new Danish wind turbines is usuallyin the range of 98 to 99%. The second 100 MW agreement between government and utilities reachedin 1990 was expected to be implemented before the end of 1995.This has been true for the ELSAM (Jutland) area, but in the ELKRAFT(Zealand) area continuing siting problems have caused a delayregarding the last 10 MW of capacity. According to a new executiveorder from the government, the electric utilities are now committedto install additional 200 MW of wind power before 2000. The overallDanish target for year 2005 is 1500 MW of wind power, providing10% of the country's electricity demand. Preliminary estimatesof new sites available for further deployment of wind turbinessuggest that there will be a considerable number of inland sites,once municipal planning is completed. In addition to this thereis a large offshore potential. Turbines with ratings of 600 kW are now commercially availablein Denmark, and at present three manufacturers (Bonus, Nordtankand Vestas) have installed one 50m/750 kW and two 60m/1.5 MW prototypemachines at Tjæreborg in Jutland. They were ordered by theELSAM utility in order to promote the technological developmentof wind turbines. The Bonus turbine suffered from a runaway accidentin October 1995 but a new 54 m/1 MW turbine will be installedby mid-1996. Using accounting rules issued by the Ministry of Energy in 1993,the electric utilities now pay private wind turbine owners aboutDKK 0.58 (0.10 USD) per kWh delivered to the grid, and for utilityproduction the subsidy is DKK 0.10 per kWh. The total installationcosts for 500600 kW turbines installed in wind farms are at presentin the range DKK 6,0007,000 (roughly 11001250 USD) per kW. Witha depreciation period of 20 years at a real interest rate of 7%and O&M costs of 2.5% per year, the total production costis in the range of DKK 0.300.40 per kWh depending on the windregime, neglecting capacity credit. New coal-fired plants generateelectricity at an average price of DKK 0.330.35 per kWh includingdistribution costs. The first Danish offshore wind farm at Vindeby was commissionedin 1991. A second has now been installed by ELSAM at TunøKnob in the area between Jutland and Samsø. Installed capacityis 5 MW. The total installation costs are about DKK 74 millionand by experience from the first 6 months the cost of energy isexpected to be about DKK 0.47 per kWh. The installation costsdo not include about DKK 4 million to finance a comprehensivestudy of bird life around the new site. The total amount being spent by the Danish government on R&Dfor 1995 was 29 MDKK. Of this amount 13 MDKK was in support ofgeneric research. Approximately 8 MDKK was for industrial developmentand demonstration and 8 MDKK went to support of the Test Stationat Risø. Finland The IEA Wind Energy Executive Committee held its 37th meetingin Helsinki on 2829 May, and visited the Pyhätunturi windturbine test station above the Arctic Circle on 30 May. The 220kW test turbine was operating in a snow storm at a steady windspeed of about 14 m/s. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has published a proposal fora 100 MW programme in Finland to promote the use of wind energy.The programme includes elements such as support for R&D, subsidisedconstruction of installations, options relating to land use planning,information dissemination and voluntary agreements between governmentand power producers. However, present development remains slow.The total capacity of wind turbines reached 6.7 MW in 1995. Dependingon planning and financing resolution, new installations will beabout 23 MW in 1966. Three regional studies to identify sitesfor wind energy development have been initiated in cooperationwith local and other authorities to minimise planning delays infuture projects. Wind energy research in Finland is performed as part of the NEMO2(Advanced Energy Systems and Technologies) programme, which isone of the energy research programmes of the Ministry for theyears 19931998. The main area of research is arctic wind technologyincluding wind resource assessment and technology development.The test turbine mentioned above has been in operation since October1993 and has been used as a test bed to develop blade heatingsystems and for load measurements. The first stage of a 3 MW demonstrationwind farm in Lapland will be built during late summer 1996. Otheractivities include projects on integration of wind energy in localgrids and development of direct drive generators. Three new JOULEprojects have been started recently. The erection of the"offshore-on-the-rocks"test turbine has been postponed due to difficulties in findinga suitable site. The industry's own development projects include arctic applicationsof wind energy, ice detector development and hydraulic power transmissionfor wind turbines, which has been tested since 1995. A 150 kWwind/diesel system on Prangli Island north of Tellin, capitalof Estonia, has been developed with Finnish/Danish/Estonian cooperation,but its installation has been delayed pending building permission.The manufacture of turbine components has been active and growing.The total export of components, such as generators, amounted toabout 100150 MFIM (about 2335 MUSD). Yet there is scope to increasethe share of domestic components especially in new turbines installedin Finland. Germany The use of wind energy in the Federal Republic of Germany hasmade enormous progress in the years since 1990, significantlyby funding programmes of the federal and state governments, especiallyby the "250 MW Wind" Programme of the Federal Ministryfor Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF). This developmenthas been decisively influenced by the adoption of the so-called"Electricity Feed Law" (EFL) of December 1990. Thisregulates the input and payment of electricity from renewableenergies (e.g. wind, solar, hydro) by the utilities. The paymentfor electricity from wind power amounts to 90% of the averageproceeds per kilowatt-hour of electricity delivered by the utilitiesto the final consumer. This corresponds to 0.1721 DEM/kWh (about0.12 USD/kWh) for the year 1996. By 31 December 1995 the number of installed wind turbines in Germanywas 3655, corresponding to a total rated power of 1137 MW. Ofthese, 1452 turbines rated at 303 MW, have been installed underthe "250 MW Wind" Programme of BMBF since 1989. Duringthe year 1995 1070 turbines corresponding to 305 MW were installed. Tacke Windtechnik Tw1500, 1.5 MW prototype near Emden, Germany BMBF also supports R&D aimed at the development of large-scaleprototypes. For example in 1995/96 three large turbines are tocome into operation: an Enercon E66 (1.5 MW), a Tacke TW1500 (1.5MW) and an Autoflug A1200 (1.2 MW). They are installed in NorthGermany at Aurich, Emden and Brunsbüttel respectively. Additionally,a 1000 kW turbine, based on a 750 kW prototype supported by BMBF,is on the market. Wind turbine operation is possible economically only at or nearGerman coastal sites with the special German boundary conditions.Continuity on the market with growing export and in R&D isconsidered to be necessary for stable further development of windpower. Limits to the development depend on a sufficient acceptanceby the population in the future and on the further existence ofthe electricity feed law. This law is being discussed, as theburden is concentrated on a few regional coastal utilities. Italy Work is in progress by ENEA (the Italian Agency for Energy, NewTechnology and the Environment) during the past six months torestore the GAMMA 60 turbine prototype on Sardinia after the accidentthat occurred last year. Although the main structural componentshave shown no major damage, substantial work has been requiredto inspect and repair or replace all parts damaged by fire insidethe nacelle. Advantage is being taken of the repair period toalso carry out a number of modifications to improve efficiencyand reliability following an evaluation of the experimental operationof the turbine by an ENEA\ENEL\WEST working group. These improvementsconcern mainly the control system, the hydraulic system and thebraking system. This review confirmed the viability of the GAMMAproject, and the prototype is expected to be back in operationby the coming autumn. A very detailed analysis of the energy cost,based on the data obtained from the machine and taking accountof all the elements of an operating system will be made. Thiskind of analysis, together with the next prototype experimentaldata, will be used to define preseries unit specification. The draft of certification procedures is being drawn up. The Sardiniatest site still requires a few permissions. The environmentalimpact evaluation has been submitted to local authority. Sitingactivities are in progress: data from four sites in Teramo provinceare transmitted to ENEA Cassaccia Centre and a measurement campaignat Maddalena Island is being planned. ENEA intends to set up agroup for the evaluation of design planning, construction andoperation phases including environmental aspects. This is in responseto growing interest by private investors and the assignment toENEA by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MICA) of the taskof monitoring market and technology. ENEA will also assist someRegions to evaluate wind farm projects. The interest shown by private investors in wind energy far surpassesthe power system capabilities. Proposals for 3,583 MW have beensubmitted to MICA and a capacity of 750 MW have been declaredadmissible. So far the public financial support consists mainlyin a premium tariff, but recently the Regions of Apulia and Campaniahave launched announcements of competition on wind farm installationwith a capital cost contribution. In the meantime 13.8 MW havebeen installed in three sites in marginal areas in Campania andApulia Apennines. Work on the construction of the ENEL (electrical utility) windfarm at Collarmele (36 Riva Calzoni machines totalling 9 MW) isin progress. The current schedule provides for completion beforethe end of November 1996. Some problems have been encounteredin the Monte Arci wind farm (34 WEST machines totalling 11 MW).The WEST company discovered some design defects on similar turbinesrunning elsewhere, requiring modifications on all 34 Monte Arciunits. As a result the completion of this wind farm is now foreseenin the second half of 1997. A further serious hindrance was caused,in late 1995, by the Italian Air Force, which forbade the operationof wind turbines on the ridges of the Monte Arci plateau (750m a.s.l.), since they saw a hazard to low-lying aircraft. A signallingsystem, based on the four 40 m high wind measuring masts at theplant, had to be devised and submitted to the Command, and a visibilitystudy simulating an approach to the plant area had to be madeto demonstrate the adequacy of the system Japan Newly installed wind energy capacity in Japan during 1995 was3.8 MW with 13 units. The total installed capacity was nearly10 MW with 54 units at the end of 1995. The national wind energy R&D programmes of the New SunshineProject includes R&D on large-scale WTGS, demonstration ofa MW-class wind farm and R&D for basic environmentally innocuoustechnologies. A national 500 kW prototype turbine is now underconstruction at Tappi Wind Park site and will be completed thisautumn. An experimental 1.7 MW wind farm was completed in October1995 on Miyako Island in Okinawa. It consists of two units ofMHI 250 kW WTGS and three newly installed Micon 400/ 100 kW WTGS.A research WTGS, WINDMELII is now being tested at Tsukuba TestSite. The turbine has optional modes of constant/variable speedoperation. Recent data show not only that the concept decreasesmechanical stress, but also suppresses torque and power outputfluctuations. In support of the national decision on new energy policy, in whichwind energy is to be promoted up to 150 MW capacity by 2010, aNEDO (New Energy and Industrial Development Organisation) fieldtest project was started in 1995. In the first year, meteorologicalmeasurements at 7 potential sites and two system designs werecarried out. The levels of government subsidy are 100% for windobservation and 50% for system design and construction. The amountof this subsidy for wind was 80 MJPY (about 800,000 USD) in 1995. Mexico Mexico, an OECD country, could become a member of the IEA WindEnergy Agreement and was represented by an observer at the recentmeeting of the Executive Committee. Although there is as yet noofficial Mexican programme for wind energy development, thereis some activity and incentive to plan further effort. Total electricitydemand is growing at about 7% per year and domestic rates areabout 56 cents/kWh (US) and rising. Legal framework is now inplace to allow small generating plants. It was the lack of a regulatingframework for licensing and setting allowable capacity that preventedprogress toward a 2 MW wind project a few years ago. The first wind farm now in operation, La Ventosa Pilot Wind Farm,was commissioned in January 1994. It has seven 225 kW Vestas turbines,for a total capacity of 1.6 MW. Its operational experience showssomething of the nature of the wind regime at the site. The averagewind speed is about 7 m/s or more, and is so persistent that thereare frequent limitations due to high winds, and all generatorshave already been replaced. Wind resource assessments carriedout so far have identified some of the main sites suitable forwind turbine installation, some of which appear to have averagewind speeds of 89 m/s. There are good winds on the east coast,near the eastern tip of Mexico, on the high central plateau, andnear the southernmost lagoon. Other wind energy applications are being examined, including waterpumping and the development of small turbines for electricitygeneration. There are also applications for combined wind andsolar energy production. An interesting project is the installationof small (50 W) wind turbines and solar panels for water heatingon the roofs of individual units at a hotel complex in Cancún. The Nederlands By May 1996 the installed wind capacity in the Netherlands was260 MW. By the end of 1996, 350 MW should in place. In Decemberthe government set new targets for renewables, with a 10% contributionto electricity supply by 2020. The budgets for R,D&D willbe doubled. The target for 2020 is about 3,000 MW, implying anaverage growth of 100 MW/ year. Novem has developed a new nationalprogramme, TWIN2, for the period 1996-2000. It supports technicaldevelopment and implementation on both the short term and thelong term. The programme is aimed at a 30% reduction of the price\performanceratio and an installed power of 750 MW by 2000. The Ministry ofEconomic Affairs provides the necessary means for the introductionof wind energy through market incentives (carbon tax, green funds,allowance for fast investment depreciation) and funding of theTWIN2 budget. Improving the price\performance ratio by 30% by 2000 will be realisedby industry through competitive research in the next generationof turbines and blades. Results so far include a doubling by theDutch wind turbine manufacturers of their turnover in 1995, halfof this coming from exports. NedWind has certified its 55m/ 1000kW turbine and the 3-bladed 30m/ 250 kW turbine. Type certificationof the 2-bladed 30m/250 kW version has been completed. The firstof a 2-bladed 43.3m/500 kW version has been built and certifiedin Germany. Lagerwey has certified its 27m/250 kW turbine andthe prototype of the 30m/250 kW machine. The prototype Lagerwey45m/750 kW turbine was erected in April 1996. It is a variablespeed, direct drive, 3-bladed machine with pitch control. WindMasterhas certified its 43m/750 kW turbine. Netherlands blade manufacturersincreased their turnover by 50% in 1995. Aerpac's capacity ina new 8,000 m2 is now 600 blades per year with 140 people. In 1995 a new Netherlands R&D Wind Energy Plan was discussedon the initiative of Novem, ECN and TU Delft. Further detailsof the plan are mentioned in the short note on future wind energyR&D needs near the beginning of this Newsletter. The planis unique for the Netherlands since it is based on consensus ofall interested parties. The model of the plan could be usefulfor international R&D programmes. A recent study of long term implementation of wind energy showedthat the inland of the Netherlands has a wind potential of 1,000MW. Economically viable exploitation seems possible with hub heights$55 m. Within a range of 20 km off the coast several hundred MWcould be installed, but the effect on marine life would need examination.Further offshore, large wind farms could generate 8,000 MW by2030, representing a 20% share of national electricity supply.Further penetration would require storage or major adjustmentsto the national grid. Norway The Norwegian wind energy R&D activities are focused on thedevelopment of components for the market. The budget frame forthese activities is about 2.0 MNOK (about 0.3 MUSD) for 1996. The testing of a second generation wind\diesel prototype systemcontinues. It was put into operation on the Norwegian island Frøyain January 1995, supplying an isolated group of customers. Itconsists of a 55 kW stall regulated wind turbine, a 50 kW standarddiesel generator set and a force commutated control unit, includinga short-term battery storage and dump load. The converter andcontrol unit is manufactured by ABB Energy A/S and developed incooperation with the Norwegian Electric Power Research Institute(EFI) with financial support from the Norwegian Water Resourcesand Energy Administration (NVE). Some minor problems had limitedthe system availability during the first year, but by the endof 1995 the operating hours had corresponded to 7.5 months ofcontinuous operation, with excellent voltage quality. The totalfuel saving in 1995 was 54.3% of the corresponding consumptionwhen running the diesel generating set only. The intermittentoperation of the diesel set has resulted in approximately 23 startsper day, or a total of about 600 starts and stops during operationin 1995. Unfortunately, availability in 1966 has been limited by threeunexpected problems: interruptions caused by a partly choked dieselfuel supply system, a damaged fuel pump, and uncertainties aboutthe storage batteries. The batteries include 170 NiCad cells witha nominal capacity of 27 kWh. They were chosen for their superiorquality concerning long-term operation, rapid charging and discharging,and their ability to withstand a high number of discharge cycles.Moreover the battery unit originates from the earlier first generationsystem, which operated for eight years mostly unattended. In Marchit was discovered that about 15% of the battery cells did notaccept recharging. It is assumed that the problem may be causedby inadequate maintenance or weaknesses in the charging/dischargingstrategy. An important result from this project is the developmentof a forced commutated step wave converter technology. This isbeing further developed within the JOULE III project ('Power Controlfor Wind turbines in Weak Grids'). The R&D activities also include a programme for analysis ofwind turbine blade structural and aerodynamic design, to developblades with better yields and more efficient manufacturing processes.Some analyses with intent to find niches for profitable integrationof wind turbines into existing distribution networks are alsoin progress. Spain Fifteen wind farms with a total power of 172.5 MW and 640 windturbines are expected to be installed in the Spanish mainlandand islands during 1996. Their rated power varies between 225and 600 kW. The regional distribution is 69 MW in Galicia, 42in the Canary Islands, 31 in Navarra, 25 in Tarifa and 5 in Aragón.During June two wind turbines have been installed in Tarifa. Themanufacturer is Ecotecnia, and the rated power of each machineis 500 and 600 kW. The turbines are now in the testing phase.During the summer a new turbine of 500 kW (MADE AE41) will beinstalled in Tarifa The wind industry is being consolidated through several companiesdistributed in different regions. At the legislative level, the regions with wind development haveelaborated or are elaborating specific legislation about windplanning and the auxiliary industry development. The importanceof these new regulations is reflected in the great number of windprojects presented in these regions. For example, in Galicia theStrategic Wind Plans presented for permissions have reached 2550MW, with an investment in a period of 10 years of 374,000 MESP (about 2,000 MUSD). In Aragón the power associated to theStrategic Wind Plans is 1005 MW with an investment of 160,000MESP. 30% of the total investment (48,000 MESP) must be used inthe location where the wind farm is to be installed. In the Canary Islands the Renewable Energies Plan (PERCAN) foreseesthe installation of 128 MW by the year 2002 with an investmentof 25,000 MEP. The most important restriction within the winddevelopment in the Islands is the behaviour of the grid, whichis of small size. Sweden The number of wind turbines by 31 March has increased to 223 witha total of 68.4 MW including the demonstration plants. The marketstimulation programme (35% subsidy, total 250 MSEK about 38 MUSD)was fully spent by September 1995 except 25 MSEK that was allocatedfor technology procurement. At the end of 1995 the SwedishNational Board for Industrial and Technical Development (NUTEK)received another 100 MSEK which was immediately spent as the numberof applications on hand far exceeded the extra budget allocatedto the programme. At the end of 1996 it is expected that a totalof 95 MW will have been installed. The technology procurement process is based on an initiative fromNUTEK. Five Swedish wind turbine operating companies (the twolargest power utilities, a major distribution and power generatingcompany and two companies specialising in wind turbine operation)have formed the Swedish Wind Turbine Buyer Consortium (SWT BC).Their main task is to prepare a joint specification of user requirementsto serve as a basis for wind turbine procurement. The key purposeis to minimise the technical and economic risk of the buyer, andto make sure that promised performance really will be delivered.Following a prequalification phase for prospective tenders theSWTBC is evaluating tenders focusing on two parameters: reducedcost per kWh and a lower noise level. Unlike most other requestsfor tenders, the SWTBC will not specify nominal power or designconcept to allow the manufacturers to optimise their systems. On 1 January 1996 a new Electricity Act came into force to introducecompetition, thus creating the conditions for efficient pricingand a more open trade in electricity, and making it possible forbuyers to choose freely between different vendors on the market.To protect small power producers during transition to the newcompetitive market, a 'delivery concession' has been introducedfor a limited time. The holder of a delivery concession is responsiblefor purchasing electricity from each generation plant within hisconcession area and capable of delivering a maximum of 1500 kW.The electricity price paid today is generally around SEK 0.25(about 0.04 USD) per kWh, increased by a government 'environmentalbonus' identical to the ordinary tax on electricity. During 1995this was SEK 0.09 per kWh, increasing to SEK 0.097 in January1996, and in two further steps to SEK 0.17 from 1 July 1997. Technical development is continuing in Sweden. Zephyr Energy ABhas manufactured a 250 kW 2-bladed turbine with passive pitchcontrol and flapping hub. Vattenfall has ordered three for erectionsouth of Halmstad on the west coast by summer 1997. The 1 MW Nordic1000 turbine, erected in April 1995, has produced over 800 MWhsince June 1995. The 3 MW Näsudden II has continued highavailability, generating 16,365 MWh by 30 April 1996 during 15,339operating hours. Kvaerner Turbin AB is near the end of a developmentstudy, financed by Kvaerner, NUTEK, and Vattenfall AB for a new3 MW 'Näsudden III + Aeolus III' turbine, and will presenta tender for its delivery. This would be the last generation ofdevelopment before commercial introduction. United Kingdom There have been three rounds of the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation(NFFO) so far, one round of the Scottish Renewables Obligation(SRO) and one round of the NFFO Renewables Order covering NorthernIreland. (NINFFO). In NFFO 1 and 2 by the end of March seven projects (27.7 MW totalrated capacity) of the 9 offered contracts under NFFO 1 (28.9MW) were generating. NWPL have withdrawn Carmarthen Bay from theNFFO and the vertical axis machine on the Isles of Scilly, whichproved uneconomic to repair. Twenty-six projects (125.3 MW rated)of the 49 offered contracts under NFFO 2 (197 MW rated) were generating.The installed capacity under NFFO 1 and 2 is unlikely to increasefurther because the 1998 cutoff of the contracts makes any furtherdevelopments uneconomic. Some of the projects awarded contracts in December 1994 as partof the NFFO 3 and SRO 1 Orders have now been commissioned. HagshawHill in Scotland has been operating since November 1995 whilstTrysglwyn in Wales has been commissioned in May. Developers arestill finding it difficult to obtain planning permission at present.Of a total of 55 projects in NFFO 3 (22 of which have not yetbeen submitted), 11 have been approved, 11 yet to be determined,and 11 refused. Of the 11 refused, 7 are being appealed. Of atotal of 12 projects under SRO 1 (2 of which are not yet submitted),8 have been approved and public inquiry has been called in 2.Five of the six wind farms awarded contracts under NINFFO 1 havenow been commissioned. The total installed capacity in the UK from wind projects underNFFO 1,2&3, SRO 1 and NINFFO 1 is 199 MW from 41 projects.Expressions of interest have been received under the Fourth Order(NFFO 4) for 227 wind projects with a total rated capacity ofapproximately 3400 MW. United States of America In the restructuring of the US electric utility system, the movementaway from a vertically integrated system has been continued. Thedebate on the optimum structure and how best to convert to a marketsystem has been intensified, including such key issues to windas transmission pricing and ancillary services. The effect onwind markets has been negative in the near term. With IntegratedResource Planning and other regulatory mechanisms seemingly goingby the wayside, utilities have been reluctant to commit to windpower development. The focus on near-term cost and reluctanceto recognise indirect or nonmonetary benefits has had severe implicationsfor US wind manufacturers and developers (contributing to thefinancial distress of the largest manufacturer, Kenetech). Muchof the near-term market stagnation has been based on perceivedrisks associated with an uncertain future utility structure. InApril 1996 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took a definitivestep toward the future structure by directing electric facilitiesto open their lines to wholesale power producers. Many view thisas a possible step to opening the market up to full retail competition.Potential future positive developments which could help the USdomestic wind market are 1) the inclusion of a mandated renewablemarket share, and 2) direct marketing of clean wind power to "green"consumers. It is clear that the restructuring process will belengthy and that uncertainty during the transition period willhinder a quick change in the difficult situation U.S. wind developersare experiencing. The DOE Wind Programme is assisting the U.S. industry in incorporatingadvanced technology into new wind turbines for global energy markets.NREL is currently supporting field testing of five design effortsfor new machines, several of which are now commercially available.In addition, six innovative component development projects areunder way, focusing on advanced controls, generators, rotors andtowers. The final selection of three industry partners has beenmade for the prototype development stage of the Next GenerationTurbine Development project. Kenetech Windpower will design a50 m, 650 kW, 3-bladed upwind machine; The Wind Turbine Companywill design a 54 m, 1000 kW, 2-bladed downwind machine; Zond Systemswill design a 56 m, 1000 kW, 3-bladed upwind machine. All threecontracts are currently under negotiation, and each project isexpected to have a duration of up to five years. DOE cost shares the installation, testing and evaluation of newwind turbine hardware under the Turbine Verification Programme.The first of these projects, a 6.6 MW project in Texas using theZond Z40 wind turbines completed acceptance tests in February.Initial performance data indicate an average machine availabilityof over 95% for 2,300 hours of operation as of April. A totalof over 3,200 MWh was generated during this time period, resultingin a capacity factor of over 21%. The facility upgrades at the NWTC are on schedule. The IndustrialUsers Facility is under construction with occupancy expected in July. It will providefacilities to support industrial activities, such as blade structuraltesting. The NWTC will also provide certification testing servicesthis fall, beginning with power performance and noise testing.A 1 MW dynamometer is planned to be operational in the summerof 1997. The Hybrid Power Test Bed is also under construction,and will be fully operational this fall. This facility will allowresearchers and industry to test hybrid systems, including windturbines, PV arrays, diesel units, and batteries with a programmableload bank.

Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116-0121; tel: 1-800-DOE-EREC; e:mail: doe.erec@nciinc.com Introduction Americans want comfortable, attractive, functional, and durable housing. Yet,many increasingly find high quality housing beyond their means. Conventionalbuilding methods rely on plentiful resources. With some of these resourcesdwindling, housing costs are sky rocketing. The cost of a home includesmaterials, construction, financing, taxes, energy consumption, and insurance.This booklet explores recent attempts to reduce those costs. Constructiontechniques discussed in this booklet focus on building resource-efficient andenergy-conserving homes, without sacrificing affordability or quality. In a cooperative demonstration project between the U.S. Department of Energy(DOE), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and theNavajo Nation, current home designs on the Navajo reservation were evaluatedand recommendations were made to improve quality and lower the costs. Theresulting design utilized straw-bale wall construction. Straw-bale building is a practical and perhaps under utilized constructionmethod. Initiated in the United States at the turn of the century, straw-balebuilding is showing new merit in today's marketplace. Walls of straw, easilyconstructed and structurally sound, promise to take some of the pressure off oflimited forest resources. Straw is a viable building alternative, plentiful and inexpensive.Straw-bale buildings boast superinsulated walls (R-50), simple construction,low costs, and the conversion of an agricultural byproduct into a valuedbuilding material. Properly constructed and maintained, the straw-bale walls,stucco exterior and plaster interior remain water proof, fire resistant, andpest free. Because only limited skill is required, a community house-raisingeffort can build most of a straw-bale house in a single day. This effort yieldsa low-cost, elegant, and energy-efficient living space for the owners, agraceful addition to the community, and a desirable boost to local farm income.This booklet offers an in-depth look at one such community house-raising, inaddition to a general overview of straw-bale construction. Straw-Bale Construction History of Straw Bale Construction People have built homes using straw, grass, or reed throughout history. Thesematerials were used because they were reliable and easy to obtain. Europeanhouses built of straw or reed are now over two hundred years old. In the UnitedStates, too, people turned to straw houses, particularly after the hay/strawbaler entered common usage in the 1890s. Homesteaders in the northwesternNebraska "Sandhills" area, for example, turned to baled-hay construction, inresponse to a shortage of trees for lumber. Bale construction was used forhomes, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores. Nebraska historian Roger L. Welsch writes: "It was inevitable that some settler, desperate for a cheap, available buildingmaterial, would eventually see the big, solid, hay blocks as a possibility.Soon, baled hay was indeed asignificant construction material. The bales, about three to four feet long andone and one-half to two feet square, were stacked like bricks, one bale deep,with the joints staggered. About half used mortar between the bales; the otherssimply rested one bale directly on the other. Four to five wooden rods (in afew cases iron rods) were driven down through the bales to hold them firmlytogether. The roof plate and roof were also fastened to the top bales of thewall with rods or stakes. The most common roof configuration was some sort ofhipped roof. . . .Window and door frames were set as the walls rose aroundthem. . . .Walls were left to settle a few months before they were plasteredand the windows installed." Matts Myhrman and Judy Knox, straw-bale construction consultants, have visitedmany of these "Nebraska-type" bale structures, built between 1900 and 1940.Myhrman rediscovered the area's oldest existing bale building, the Burkehomestead, constructed in 1903 outside Alliance, Nebraska. Although abandonedin 1956, the Burke homestead continues to successfully withstand Nebraska'swide temperature swings and blizzard force winds. Long-time Nebraskan LucilleCross recalls the hay-bale house of her childhood was so quiet that her family,not hearing a tornado outside, just sat there playing cards, while the tornadowrought havoc all around them. In Wyoming, straw-bale structures have consistently withstood severe weatherand earthquakes. "The earthquake was in the 1970s and it was either 5.3 or5.8," Chuck Bruner, a resident of one of the houses told The Mother Earth News."There wasn't a single crack in the house. You can live in this housecomfortably during the summer. It stays nice and cool. We have never needed anyair conditioning, and in summer we get days up in the 90s. Also, last winter, Ionly turned our small bedroom heater on twice. If I had to guess how ourutility bills compare to those of our neighbors, I'd have to say our bill isabout half. Straw: A Renewable Resource Straw, the stalks remaining after the harvest of grain, is a renewableresource, grown annually. Each year, 200 million tons of straw are underutilized or just wasted in this country alone. Wheat, oats, barley, rice, rye,and flax are all desirable straws for bale walls. Even though the early balehomes used hay for the bales, hay is not recommended because it is leafy andeasily eaten by creatures great and small. Straw, tough and fibrous, lasts farlonger. Straw-bale expert Matts Myhrman estimates that straw from the harvestof the United States' major grains could be used to construct five million,2,000 square-foot houses every year! More conservative figures from the U.S.Department of Agriculture indicate that America�s farmers annually harvestenough straw to build about four million, 2,000 square-foot homes each year,nearly four times the houses currently constructed. Building a straw-bale house is relatively simple. A basic 2,000 square-foothouse requires about 300 standard three-wire bales of straw (costingapproximately $1,000). Placed on a foundation, the bales are skewered on rebarpins like giant shiskabobs. After wiring and plumbing, the walls are sealed andfinished. Because grains are grown in almost every region of the country, strawbales are readily available, with minimal transportation costs. Lumber fromtrees, in addition to becoming more scarce and expensive, must be transportedover longer distances. TYPES OF STRAW BALES Straw bales come in allshapes and sizes, from smalltwo-string bales to largerthree-string bales andmassive cubical or roundbales. The medium sizedrectangular three-stringbales are preferred forbuilding construction.Three-string bales are betterstructurally, have higherR-value, and are often morecompact. A typical medium-sized,three-wire bale maybe 23" X 16" X 42" andmay weigh from 75 to 85pounds. The smaller two-wirebales, which are easierto handle, are roughly18" X14" X 36" and weigh50 to 60 pounds. If thecurrent trend continues, itmay not be long before"construction-grade" balesbegin to appear. The Navajo Project The Navajo Nation (located in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah) is thelargest American Indian reservation in the United States. With a population ofclose to 200,000 people spread over 17 million rural acres, the Navajocommunity has a continuous need for adequate housing.This need for housing iscomplicated by the lack of affordable electricity to remote homesites,dwindling supplies of firewood, and increasing cost of building materials andlabor. Navajo community leaders wanted housing that boosted the local economy,used local materials and labor, and maintained the integrity of theirculture. In 1991, the Navajo Nation asked the DOE for assistance in creating moreenergy-efficient, affordable housing. Under the proposal, DOE and HUD providesfunds for technical assistance to review home designs and suggest alternatives,while the Navajo Nation provide funds for construction of a demonstrationhouse. A team was assembled in December 1992 to discuss local housingconstruction, evaluate design options, identify the needs of home occupants,and inventory community sentiment. In architectural circles, this process isknown as a "design charrette." Charrette participants were selected forexpertise in energy, finance, indigenous materials, passive solar design, andknowledge of the Navajo community and traditions. The design charrette wasconducted in Gallup, New Mexico and focused on the following design criteriafor the prototype home: Energy efficiency; Affordability; Resource-efficient building technology; Use of local materials; Community involvement and use of local labor; Cultural compatibility; and Design simplicity, adaptability, and comfort. The final design that was agreed upon was a unique combination of"Nebraska-style" straw-bale walls and adobe walls with passive solarorientation. This combination has several benefits. Straw-bale and adobe areinexpensive, locally available materials that can be used for building bylocal unskilled labor after only minimal training. Straw-bale walls aresuperinsulated (about R-50), and adobe and passive solar orientation have beenused for centuries by Native Americans in the southwest. Because of thetwo-foot thick bale walls, the resulting structure has approximately 1,000square feet of living space. Construction of the demonstration home began in July 1993 near Ganado, Arizonaand was completed in December 1994. The home successfully met the designcriteria in the following ways. Energy Efficiency. The high elevation desert climate of the NavajoNation, characterized by wide daily temperature fluctuations, low humidity, plentiful sunshine, and cold winters, dictated the design parameters for theprototype home. Well-insulated walls,good air-leakage control, and taking advantage of the solar radiation were keyto reducing the use and cost of space heating. Unlike a wood frame wall thathas many pieces assembled at the site, bales provide an nearly monolithic layerof straw that is covered inside with plaster and outside with stucco. Coupledwith a simple geometric design, the monolithic wall coverings result in verylittle air leakage. Straw is a form of cellulose that has reasonably good insulating properties;and because a bale can be up to two feet thick, a straw-bale wall has extremelyhigh thermal resistance. Recent tests following ASTM procedures resulted inbale R-values between R-2.4 and R-3.0 per inch, depending on the direction ofthe straw, and showed that thermal resistance is affected by moisture anddensity of the pack (Joseph McCabe, January 1993). Matts Myhrman, anotherstraw-bale expert, suggests that R-2.4 per inch is representative of straw-balethermal resistance in the field. Therefore, straw-bale homes should have lowerheating and cooling costs than conventional homes. METHODS OF BUILDING WITH STRAW Straw has been used for centuries by builders who recognizedits structural integrity. A piece of straw is simply a tube madeof cellulose. Tubes are recognized as one of the strongeststructural shapes. Straw was first used to reinforce mudagainst cracking. A lattice of straw criss-crossing a layer ofmud produced a surface that remained crack free fordecades, or in many cases, centuries. With the late 19thcentury invention of the baler, builders were given aconvenient new building block,the rectangular bundle ofstraw. Straw-bale building in the United States has beenmostly structural (Nebraska-style) and non-structural. PlinyFisk III of the Center for Maximum Building Potential inAustin, Texas, describes the following five methods ofbuilding with straw. 1. In-fill or non-structural bale - This building system, usefulfor construction of large structures, depends on a pole orpost-and-beam building design. Post-and-beam constructionemploys a skeleton of vertical posts and horizontal beams tosupport the roof. The straw-bale walls have only themselvesto support. The bales are attached to each other by piercingthe bales with rebar or bamboo and attaching the bales tothe pole or column. Fisk�s Center has completed threebuildings totaling 4,500 square-feet of space using thismethod. 2. Structural bale - Automatic straw balers create tightbuilding blocks that are stacked up to one and one-halfstories. The "Nebraska-style" buildings originated on theGreat Plains where structural wood was not available. Balesare stuccoed on the exterior and plastered on the interior toprotect them and provide an attractive finish. The stucco andplaster add to the structural integrity of the wall system. 3. Straw-clay building - A pancake like batter of clay andwater stirred into the loose straw produces a straw-reinforcedclay mud. In the past, this mixture was packed into a double-sidedwood form between the posts and beams of a timber-framebuilding. Today, a light weight wooden ladder likeframe replaces the old heavy timber frame. European heavytimber structures using this method are still standing aftermore than 200 years. This method has passed the moststringent European fire codes. 4. Mortar bale - Structural mortar, made of portland cementand sand, is applied between the straw bales. When dry, itslattice structure remains intact if the straw bales should everfail. This method, developed in Canada, passes Canadianbuilding codes. Bales are stuccoed on the exterior andplastered on the interior to protect them and provide anattractive finish. The mortered joints, stucco, and plaster alsoadd to the structural integrity of the wall system. 5. Pressed straw panels - Straw is compacted under certaintemperatures. The resulting panels are 100 percent straw thatcan be used to build pre-fabricated structures, not only walls,but also roofs and floors. The Department of Energy, interested in the magnitude of potential energysavings of the wall design options, asked building scientist Jim Hanford ofLawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) to analyze the thermal characteristics ofthe various wall materials and project energy savings for the prototype home.The energy efficiency of various building design options was analyzed duringthe design charrette at Navajo and continued to be evaluated during theconstruction and testing phases of this project. Hanford's analysis, whichfollows, assumes R-2.4 per inch for a straw bale, with sensitivities conductedat R-1.8 and R-3.0 per inch. Table one compares thermal characteristics of thestraw-bale wall with the other wall constructions considered at the Navajodesign charrette. Table One.

Wood frame walls have 25 percent (R-11) and 20 percent(R-19) stud areas. The R-19 batt compresses to R-18. Compressed straw panel, insulated case, has 2 inchespolystyrene on exterior. Fibrous Concrete panel have 1 inch polystyrene inside andout. Straw bale wall R-value is calculated for 3 unit R-valuesfor straw to cover potential variability. Average material thickness across foam block wallsections are as follows: 6 inch foam has 2.9 inches polystryene each side and 3.4inches of fill. 8 inch foam has 3.1 inches polystryene each side and 4.8inches of fill. Wall properties are based on 75 percent adobe and 23percent concrete fill. Adobe walls , insulated case, have 2 inches ofpolystyrene on exterior. 24 inch wall is two 10 inch layers with 4 inch airgap. The thermal performance for buildings using these wall constructions iscompared in figures one and two. The data shown are simulation predictions ofbuilding heating and cooling loads per unit of floor area, using the DOE-2building energy simulation program. The building size, shape, and othercomponent characteristics are based on the Navajo straw-bale demonstrationhouse. In the final case, straw-bale construction is combined with passivesolar design. Weather data used in this analysis is from Cedar City, Utahrepresenting the colder, mountainous areas of the reservation, and Albuquerque,New Mexico, representing the warmer climates. Notes for Figures 1 and 2: Prototype building is 1,050 square feet (42 ft. X 25 ft.) with 120 squarefeet of windows. Base house has R-30 roof, R-19 wood frame walls, slab floor with 1 inchperimeter insulation, double glazed windows with aluminum frames, and mediuminfiltration levels (ELF=0.0005; ACH=0.52). Prototype has equal window area in four cardinal orientations (30 squarefeet each). Prototype has concrete slab floor and wood-frame interior walls. Albuquerque, New Mexico represents Navajo Reservation climates (4186heating degree days (HDD) @ 65 degrees F base); Cedar City, Utah representscolder climates (5918 HDD). The straw-bale wall has the best energy performance because it has the highestR-value by a wide margin, regardless of the assumed unit R-value for straw. Forthe entire building, changes in just the wall construction change the heatingload by plus or minus twenty percent from the R-19 wood frame base case. The results assume that the building infiltration rate is the same for all wallsystems. All building components, including the roof, floors, windows, doors,and air infiltration need to be considered in the analysis of anenergy-efficient dwelling. The design team chose plastered straw-bale walls for their high R-value(approximately R-50) and adobe walls to absorb and radiate solar gain. Thestraw-bale walls face the northwest and join the adobe walls on the north andeast sides of the building, exposing the adobe to the maximum solar radiation,yet shielding it from the prevailing winter wind. Both the adobe and straw balewalls are coated with three layers of stucco inside and out for protection.The attic, windows, and doors of the demonstration home are alsowell-insulated and sealed to minimize drafts. The resulting building issuperinsulated, remaining cool on hot summer days and requiring minimal heatingin winter. Further computer simulations and other research summarized in Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory's forty-page final report show that the program currently undertakenby the Navajo Nation has the potential to improve the energy efficiency andthermal comfort of new residences when compared to those currently being builton the reservation. LBL analyses show that (1) there are alternative construction technologies thatprovide equal or better energy performance than current practice, (2) thedemonstration building, with a few modifications, could be substantially moreenergy efficient and comfortable than current practice, while meeting otherprogram goals of architectural interest and long term environmentalsustainability; and (3) straw-bale construction, along with appropriatebuilding conservation technologies and simple passive solar design, couldprovide up to a 60 percent reduction in building heating loads over currentpractice. SUMMARY OF LBL'SFINDINGS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS Straw-bale buildingtechnology offers the bestenergy performance of anyof the new constructiontypologies currently beingconsidered, with 15 percentimprovements in overallbuilding energy-efficiency inheating for the climates onthe Navajo reservation. The wall panel technologiesthat were part of thisanalysis, either straw orfibrous concrete, wheninsulated with an additionaltwo inches of polystyreneinsulation, perform aboutthe same as an R-19 woodframe wall. Similarly, adobeshould be insulated forbetter thermal performance. Small changes in thestraw-bale/adobe prototypedwelling, specifically slabinsulation, higher insulationin the vaulted ceiling, andeither insulating or replacingthe adobe walls with strawbales, would vastly improvethe performance of thisbuilding. Energy-related testing ofstraw-bale buildings in thefield is warranted.Infiltration characteristicsand the effects of moistureon energy performanceneed further evaluation. Future design and buildingprograms on the Navajoreservation should considerusing better technologiesfor all building components,including increased roofinsulation, advancedwindow features, andinfiltration reduction details. Affordability. The Navajo project has demonstrated that straw-baleconstruction can be inexpensive compared to other materials. Table two detailsthe costs of the project. The cost of the finished 988 square-foot home equates to $58 per square foot,not including the cost of utility hookups (water, power, and sewage). A similarsized wood-frame house constructed in the same area would probably have costabout the same as the demonstration prototype. However, future straw-bale homesshould cost considerably less than the prototype because of required changesand modifications during building of the prototype. In addition, thelabor-intensive double adobe walls of the "hearth" area added more than $3,000to the project. Had the exterior walls been entirely straw-bale, the over-allcosts would have been lower. Straw bales were supplied at a cost of $2.50 abale, including transportation. Normally, the cost of a bale wall is aboutone-fourth the cost of a comparable, superinsulated wall built withconventional materials. Construction crews and volunteers with no straw-balebuilding experience erected the walls in a single day. Approximately 2,500labor hours, a portion of which was donated, went into construction of theprototype house. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Table Two.

Resource efficiency was oneof the important elements considered during the four-day Navajo designcharrette. For a house to be truly efficient, the energy expended in theextraction, refinement, and transportation of building materials to the site,and the total resources used during construction, should also be included inthe calculation of the structure's efficiency. The integration ofresource-efficiency concepts into design, materials, and building practices canreduce the environmental impacts associated with home construction. In the sameway that the occupant's habits and conservation consciousness affect the home'soperating efficiency, the selection of building materials and techniques alsoreflects the resource-efficiency consciousness of the architect, builder, andhomeowner. These considerations led to the selection of straw bale and adobe as buildingmaterials for the demonstration house at Ganado. Straw bales were available notfar from the building site and adobe blocks were manufactured from soil takenfrom the site. Plastered straw-bale building was just one component theresource-efficient strategy employed in the Navajo demonstration project.Passive solar design and the use of adobe as the thermal mass were also used tosave energy and lower heating and cooling costs. Solar Energy. In the Navajo area, the daytime average solar radiation is1200 Btus per hour during the six winter months and 1800 during the six summermonths. This ample sunshine makes solar energy a good strategy for winter spaceheating. Solar heat, however, needs to be controlled during the summer monthsto prevent overheating. At the Navajo demonstration project, the home's design oriented the windows touse passive solar heating and passive cooling. Due to the width of straw bales,the windows are naturally shaded from the high, hot summer sun, while thelower, winter sun is allowed to enter. Most of the passive solar heat isprovided by the wood-frame and glass sunspace on the south side. The concretefloor and adobe walls within the sunspace provide heat storage of daytime heatfor nighttime use. During winter, solar heat collected in the sunspace isvented into the home. For back-up heating, the Navajo demonstration homeutilizes a wood pellet stove and two electric baseboard heaters. During summer,the sunspace is shaded and vented to prevent overheating. Adobe Walls and Thermal Mass. Adobe and rammed earth construction aretwo of the oldest and most commonly used building materials. Adobe has beenused to shelter the Navajo people for centuries and, consequently, wasintegrated into the demonstration project. Exterior adobe walls are appropriatein a desert climate with wide day-to-night temperature swings. Adobe wallsstabilize the home's interior by moderating the indoor effects of high and lowoutdoor temperatures. Adobe walls absorb solar heat during the day, and atnight radiate their heat back into the cool night sky leaving the home at acomfortable temperature. Exterior and interior adobe walls provide excellentthermal mass. In the Navajo demonstration project, adobe serves as thermal massin the common wall between the solar sunspace and main house, and also ininterior house walls. BUILDING MATERIALSFROM THE EARTH Rocks and soil are the sourceof some of naturesstrongest, most weatherproof,and most economicalbuilding materials. Buildingsmade of stucco, plaster, andmortar have survivedcenturies. Stucco,plaster, and mortarare very similar.Stucco is a rougher-surfacedexteriorwall siding. Plaster, stucco's in-doorcousin, is a smoothmixture of mostly lime. Theyare both mixtures of crushedrock and sand. The mixture'smost adhesive component isportland cement, a blend ofpulverized rock. Lime, which is limestonecrushed to a powder, addspliability or spreadability tothe mix. And sand, called theaggregate, gives the mixsubstance. The best aggregatescombine different sizesof clean, sharp-edged sand. Mortar, also a mixture ofcement, lime, and sand,is used in masonry orplastering. Adobe is compressedearth. The best adobes arehigh in clay, which is veryfine soil with good cohesion.The adobe is rammed intoforms or pressed into blockswhile damp, then sun-driedto form a durable buildingmaterial. Use of local materials. The Navajo demonstration project utilizedstraw bales from the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry, a neighboringagricultural enterprise. Portland cement and gravel for the foundation wereobtained from a cement batch plant in nearby Chinle. A hydraulic adobe pressformed adobe blocks directly from the building site's soil. This compressedadobe was used immediately, without curing time. Blocks were dry-stacked,without mortar, by wetting the top of the previous course of adobe, beforesetting the next layer. The walls were then stuccoed. Community involvement and use of local labor. Part of what makesstraw-bale construction so affordable is its ability to effectively utilizehomeowner participation and unskilled labor. Material costs of straw-balewalls represent less than one-fifth of the cost of a wall system; four-fifthsof the cost of building a wall goes for labor. Owner-builders can achieve greatsavings by providing their own labor. For the Navajo demonstration project, thehomeowner contributed ten hours a day assisting with construction. Manyadditional hours were donated by friends, family, and other visitors to thesite. Experienced labor was necessary for foundation work, roof framing, andelectrical wiring. The construction manager was the only one at the site whohad had straw-bale building experience; none of the paid or volunteer laborcrew had previous experience with straw-bale construction. Cultural compatibility. The home incorporated aspects of thetraditional Navajo hogan--a six-sided structure with a central hearth built oftimbers and adobe, the main entrance facing east, living or gathering areas tothe south, cooking area on the north, and sleeping area to the west. In thedemonstration home, the main living area or hearth, signifying the traditionalhogan, was surrounded by adobe walls. The straw-bale walls comprised thebedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom, extending the "hogan" into a more conventionalhome design. The simplicity of design and the natural materials blended wellinto the high southwestern desert landscape. Navajo visitors to theconstruction site commented on how much they liked the concept of usingindigenous materials. Although somewhat leary of the new material (straw), theywere amazed at how quickly the walls were raised. Many visitors felt the needto "pitch-in" and were soon up to their elbows in cement, adobe, and/orstraw. Design simplicity, adaptability, and comfort. The simplicity of thedesign of straw-bale and adobe homes has comfort, energy, maintenance, andadaptability advantages over conventional American homes. A rectangular designwith smooth seamless walls and ceilings minimizes air leakage, which could beboth an energy and comfort problem. The simplicity of design also allows for asuperinsulated shell with few thermal flaws leading to exceptionally stableindoor temperatures and effective noise exclusion from the outdoors. The designof simple straw-bale and adobe homes can easily be expanded to includeadditional rooms. Other Contemporary Straw-Bale Homes Although the straw-bale method has a long history, official recognition ofstraw-bale construction is just beginning. In the last decade, modernstraw-bale construction pioneers have braved reluctant contractors andhesitant local building officials. The result has been a slow, but continuous,growth in construction of straw-bale houses. Straw-bale dwellings range fromsmall owner-built units to large, contractor-built luxury homes. Costs varyfrom $5 to more than $100 a square-foot depending on a number of variables, asdiscussed in the next section. Photos on the opposite page depict the varietyof styles of contemporary straw-bale buildings. The 1,400 square-foot home of Virginia Carabelli near Santa Fe, New Mexico wasdesigned by local architect, Ken Figuerado. The Carabelli house cost $60 asquare-foot, which included radiant floor heating, three fireplaces, and othercustom features. The home of Catherine Wells in Santa Fe, New Mexico, measuring 1,224square-feet (exterior measurement), was built by Ted Varney at $56 asquare-foot. The width of the straw-bale walls (ranging from 14 inches to to 24inches) reduces the interior square footage dimensions when compared with theexterior measurements. The cost includes interior features such as radiantfloor heating supplied by solar panels located on the roof and flooring laidwith tile pavers. The main interior wall was also constructed of straw bales toincrease sound insulation. The pottery studio of Kate Brown (720 square-feet), in Mimbres, New Mexico,could be used as a small home. It was owner-built for $12 a square-foot. InCorrales, New Mexico, the private chapel of Dykeman Vermian, 215 square-feet,was built by Cadmun Whitty for $18 a square-foot. The chapel is an example ofstraw bales used in a pueblo-style building. The straw-bale home of Mark Hawes is located in the Sangre De Cristo mountainsof northern New Mexico. The house is post-and-beam construction with strawbales used as fill for the walls. Because it is in a remote location andoff-the-grid, a photovoltaic system provides the electricity. The 1,400square-foot structure was engineered by DeLapp Engineering of Santa Fe andbuilt to code in 1992 by Hawes, a building contractor. The interior of thehouse contains custom southwestern features that added to the cost, which wasapproximately $46 a square-foot. The first legal building in California constructed primarily of straw bales wascompleted in 1992. The Noland project, a 2,500 square-foot ranch headquartersand residence, is located in the Owens Valley in eastern California. Designedby architects Ken Haggard and Polly Cooper with Pliny Fisk and built bycontractor Greg McMillan, the passive solar structure used straw bales for thewalls on the north and east sides of the building. In Arizona, straw-bale construction is steadily increasing. Pima County and theCity of Tucson are expected to adopt straw-bale construction into theirbuilding codes in the near future. The straw-bale demonstration home of MaryDiamond, approximately 1,200 square-feet (exterior measurement), is insoutheast Arizona. The house is off-the-grid, using photovoltaic power. It hasa wind cooling tower, a composting toilet, and a greywater system. Built forapproximately $50 per square-foot, the demonstration house is open to thepublic for overnight visits. Affordability How Affordable is a Straw-Bale House?A straw-bale house may cost the same as a conventional wood frame house.However, there are many factors that can make a straw-bale house lessexpensive; and, there are additional benefits to building with straw. Accordingto a 1982 Housing magazine cost guide, exterior and interior wall systemscomprise approximately 30 percent of the cost of construction for a typicalwood frame, slab on grade house in Albuquerque, New Mexico. With the recentincreases in the costs of materials, particularly lumber, this cost ispresently estimated to be considerably higher. For example, lumber prices rose70 percent during the last six months of 1993. This hefty increase addedapproximately $4,000 to the cost of a typical 2,000 square-foot house. A 2,000 square-foot straw-bale house requires about 300 standard, three-wirebales at a cost of approximately $1,000. The cost of a "Nebraska-style"(structural) bale wall is about one-fourth that of a comparable superinsulatedwall. Of course, there are many other variables that go into building a housesuch as the cost of labor, choice of finishes such as siding, roofing,flooring, and other amenities. Unique to straw-bale construction is the broadrange of costs associated with different levels of quality available tobuilders. Table three compares the range of straw-bale construction costs basedon a number of variables. Table 3.

Prices do not include land costs, sitedevelopment or utility interface. Compiled with data from Hofmeister, Kemble,Macdonald, Perry, and Myhrman. The cost of a straw-bale house depends on the size of the building, the cost ofmaterials including bales, the design of the house, and the amount of"sweat-equity" donated by the owner and friends. Straw-bale costs range fromfifty cents each when purchased from the fields of Montana to $3.50 to $5.00for three-wire bales delivered to a site in Arizona. Homes have been built foras little as $5,000 to well above $200,000. Construction costs range from $5 to$120 per square-foot. ($53 per square-foot is the national average forconventional construction.) Straw-bale houses come in a variety of shapes andsizes from A-frames to tipis to two-story custom homes. Simple, owner-builtstructures tend to be less expensive. Long-lasting, low maintenance building materials and protection from theelements are key for a long-term, maintenance-free house. Providing proper sitedrainage is the most important factor for the home's longevity. If the groundaround the house remains dry and the house is sufficiently maintained, thelife-span could be hundreds of years. The roof is another crucial component.Leaky roofs damage many homes each year. Steeper roofs constructed of morepermanent roofing materials are preferred. Properly built and maintained,straw-bale walls can last hundreds of years. Table four compares the life-cycle costs of a conventional house with astraw-bale house. The Plastered Straw Bale Working Group (September, 1993)estimated that the straw-bale homes use half as much energy as conventionalhouses do for heating and cooling. This could translate to a savings of severalhundred dollars a year over the life of a home. Table 4.

HOW TO BUY A BALE Straw-bale constructionconsultant Judy Knox fromOut on Bale (un)Ltd. raisesthe following considerationsabout selecting bales. 1. Purchase bales followingthe harvest when theyare usually inexpensive andabundant. Make sure thebales are stored highand dry. 2. Obtain the bales fromfeed stores and other retailoutlets, wholesale brokers,or directly from the farmer.Retail outlets are the easiestand most expensive sources.Wholesale brokers offer directaccess to the bale supplierand often offer commercialtransportation. Dealingdirectly with farmers maygive you more say about balequality and consistency, butyou will likely have to addressbale transportation. 3. Don't rely on hearsayconcerning the size and conditionof any bales you mightbuy. Check out the balesyourself. 4. Bales must be tightlytied with durable materialpreferably polypropylenestring or baling wire. Avoidbales tied with traditionalnatural fiber baling twine.When you lift the bale, itshould not twist or sag. 5. Make sure the bales areuniformly well-compacted. 6. Look for thick, long-stemmedstraw that is mostlyfree of seed heads. Wheat,oats, rye, barley, rice, or flaxare all good. 7. Test most bales tomake sure they have alwaysbeen dry. Bale moisture contentshould be 14 percentor less. 8. An ideal bale size proportionis twice as long as itis wide. This simplifies maintaininga running bond incourses. 9. Try to get bales ofequal size and length. If theydo vary in length (as manywill), lay ten bales end-to-end.Measure this entirelength. Then, divide by ten.This is the average balelength to use for planning. Frequently Asked Questions About Straw-Bale This section answers some of the most commonly asked questions about straw-baleconstruction. Will the bales rot? Without adequate safeguards, rot can occur. The mostimportant safeguard is to buy dry bales. Fungi and mites can live in wet straw,so it's best to buy the straw when it's dry and keep it dry until it is safelysealed into the walls. Paint for interior and exterior wall surfaces should bepermeable to water vapor so that moisture doesn't get trapped inside the wall.Construction design must prevent water from gathering where the first course ofbales meets the foundation. Even if straw bales are plastered, the foundationupon which the bales rest should be elevated above outside ground level by atleast six inches or more. This protects bales from rain water splashing off theroof. Will pests destroy the walls? Straw bales provide fewer havens for pestssuch as insects and vermin than conventional wood framing. Once plastered, anychance of access is eliminated. Are straw-bale buildings a fire hazard? The National Research Council ofCanada tested plastered straw bales for fire safety and found them to performbetter than conventional building materials. In fact, the plaster surfacewithstood temperatures of about 1,850� F for two hours before any cracksdeveloped. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, "Thestraw-bales/mortar structure wall has proven to be exceptionally resistant tofire. The straw bales hold enough air to provide good insulation value, butbecause they are compacted firmly, they don't hold enough air to permitcombustion." Are straw-bale buildings acceptable to my local building code? Mostcities and counties have adopted one of three or four model building codes.City, county, and state building codes may be different. Straw bale isacceptable to some codes, and not acceptable to other codes. HINTS ON OBTAINING APERMIT TO BUILD ASTRAW-BALE HOUSE If your community hasadopted a building code,you will need a buildingpermit before beginningconstruction. The localgovernment's buildingofficial is the community'sdesignated expert andenforcer. He or she has theresponsibility of interpretingthe codes, inspecting homesunder construction, andmaking exceptions to thecode, if requested. As a firststep, identify local buildingofficials and code requirements.Out on Bale (un)Ltd.recommends the followingsteps to help you obtain astraw-bale house buildingpermit. 1. Obtain and read a copyof the current building codesfor your area. 2. Gather as much informationas you can aboutstraw bale construction.See page 14 for a list of selected resources. 3. Talk with straw-baleexperts and others interestedin straw bale building. 4. Before drawing up specifichouse plans, meet withlocal building code officials.If they are not familiar withstraw-bale construction, youmay want to take along aknowledgeable architect orbuilder. Give the building officialscopies of supportiveinformation; allow them todigest the information, thenmeet with them again. Developa rapport with themduring the planning andbuilding process. 5. Become familiarenough with the code andstraw bale to be able to discussand defend your designdecisions as they relate tothe code. If necessary, youmight suggest a small straw-baledemonstration structure,perhaps a small storageshed. This will allow buildingofficials to become familiarwith the materials and constructionmethods.

Using combinations of the following measures can save you 10% to 50% on your energy bills. Also, your local utility may provide technical guidance and rebates or other financial incentives for many energy efficiency measures. Your state may even have tax credits, loans, or sales tax exemptions. Here's a menu of can't-go-wrong items to get you started. Adjust thermostats. Turn down the building's heating thermostat and turn up its cooling thermostat, especially when the building is not occupied. No Cost. Reduce the hot water temperature. Reducing the temperature on your water heater thermostat can decrease heat loss from your tank. For washing hands, you may be able to turn the temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C). Dishwashing may require higher temperature settings such as 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). No Cost. Install water flow restrictors and aerators in sink faucets. These measures can save you money by reducing water use (including hot water). Low Cost. Reduce lighting. Remove lamps where you have more lighting than you really need, but be sure to maintain safe lighting conditions for work areas. Turn lights off when they're not in use. No Cost. Seal heating and cooling ductwork. Leakage from areas such as joints, elbows, and connections can be substantial--as much as 20% to 30%. This is especially costly if the ducts travel through unheated or uncooled spaces such as attics, basements, or crawlspaces. Use duct tape or caulk to seal ducting. Low Cost. Wrap the hot water tank with jacket insulation. This simple, inexpensive measure will reduce standby heat loss from the tank. Be sure to leave the air intake vent uncovered when insulating a gas water heater. Low Cost. Replace air filters regularly and follow maintenance schedules for furnace and air-conditioning equipment. Replacing a dirty air filter can save money by reducing the amount of electricity needed to run a blower motor (because there is less resistance to airflow with a clean filter). Low Cost. Install programmable thermostats. These inexpensive devices, most incorporating modern microprocessor-based electronics, can help optimize your building's heating and cooling needs. And you won't need to remember to change thermostat settings every time you open or close your business. Low Cost. Install automatic room-lighting controls. Similar to programmable thermostats, these devices help optimize lighting use by automatically turning lights on or off, depending on occupancy or time of day. Sensors and timers work well and are usually installed by a specialist. Low Cost. Clean heat exchangers and perform routine maintenance on refrigerating equipment. These simple measures will ensure the most efficient operation of heat exchangers needed for cooling or refrigerating equipment. No Cost. Seal off unused areas and don't heat or cool these areas. Storage areas represent a good place to start; turn off heating and cooling to these areas. No Cost. Turn off machines and equipment when not needed. In many businesses, this simple approach can achieve big savings. Don't underestimate the energy savings you can get by turning off unused computers, monitors, printers, and copiers. No Cost. Buy energy-efficient equipment. When buying or replacing computers, copiers, and other office equipment, compare energy requirements of various models. Low Cost. Seal exterior cracks and holes, and ensure tight-fitting windows. Seemingly small cracks or holes in the building exterior (like walls, windows, doors, ceiling, and floors) can really add up to substantial heating or cooling losses. Install weather stripping and caulking to stop these air leaks. Low Cost. Shade sun-exposed windows and building walls. In most areas of the country, direct sunlight streaming through windows at the wrong time of the year can substantially increase your air-conditioning costs. During the cooling season, use shading methods (like window coverings, awnings, trees, and bushes) wherever possible. Low Cost. Repaint building exterior with light colors. When it's time to repaint the exterior of your building, consider using light colors. More sunlight will be reflected away from the building, thus lowering air-conditioning expenses--perhaps your largest energy expense. This is especially true for your roof. Low Cost. Keep exterior doors closed as much as possible. Don't heat or cool the outdoors. No Cost. Block and insulate unneeded windows and other openings. Aside from the important security benefit, covering unneeded windows and doors can greatly reduce energy losses from these openings. Low Cost. Buy energy-efficient vehicles. When buying or replacing company-owned vehicles, compare energy requirements of various models. No Cost or Low Cost. Encourage employees to be energy conscious. The importance of getting employee cooperation shouldn't be underestimated; their practices and activities can make or break efforts such as these. Consider offering a small reward or other incentive for the employee who saves the most energy. No Cost. This document was produced for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

The $19.6 million, 115,000 square-foot facility is made up of three adjoiningmodules. Each module has two pods, a laboratory pod in the back, and an officepod in the front. SERF accommodates approximately 190 employees. The facilityincorporates numerous energy saving features that make it one of thegovernment's most energy-efficient buildings. SERF's Energy-Efficient Features Daylighting-office areas and adjoining corridors are lit by sunlight,greatly reducing the need for artificial lighting. Since artificial lightinggenerates considerable amounts of heat, cooling costs are reduced. Highlyreflective interior surfaces enhance daylighting. Energy-Efficient Lighting-standard office fluorescent lights operate at72 watts. SERF's high-efficiency lights use only 52 watts of power and providesimilar lighting levels. Window Shades Controlled by Photovoltaic Sensor-glare and solar heatgain are managed by sensor-controlled, motorized shades that automaticallyraise and lower based on the sun's intensity. Direct Evaporative Cooling-uses evaporation to lower air temperature andincrease humidity, and then distributes air throughout the building. Directevaporative cooling uses less energy than conventional air conditioning. Indirect Evaporative Cooling-an intermediary heat exchanger is used tocool air streams without using water vapor. It can also be used to cool aclosed-loop system, such as is used to cool the building and equipment. Laboratory Exhaust Heat Recovery-a heat exchanger recovers heatgenerated by equipment and lights and uses it to preheat fresh, incoming air,displacing 50% to 60% of the energy that would otherwise be required to heatincoming air. High-Efficiency Motors-use 2% to 3% less electricity than standardmotors to produce the same mechanical output. Variable Frequency Drives-fan rotors used for ventilation are operatedat the speed and power needed to meet demand, unlike conventional systems thatoperate at maximum power. Upsized Cooling Tower-oversized to provide more contact area betweenwater to be cooled and the circulating air stream. Air-flow pressure drop isreduced, and less fan horsepower is required to provide the same cooling towerperformance. Selective Glazing-used in certain areas of the building to reduce directsolar heat gain. Energy Conservation SERF was designed and constructed to meet or exceed all applicableenvironmental, safety, and health codes and standards. SERF's annual energycosts are expected to be 30% to 40% lower than a similar building designed tomeet federal standards. SERF cost $170 per square foot to design and construct, less than half the costof a typical research facility. The facility demonstrates that an innovativeresearch laboratory can be both cost effective and energy efficient. Laboratories SERF provides scientists with laboratory space that was specifically designedto support internationally recognized photovoltaic and related technologydevelopment. The laboratories are composed of two parallel rows of baysseparated by a 14-foot-wide service corridor. Materials Research Laboratories on the first floor of SERF's west module are used to developsemiconductor material for high-efficiency crystalline solar cells. Researchersfrom these labs have made a 29.5% efficient Gallium-Indium Phosphide/GalliumArsenide solar cell, a world record for solar cell efficiency. Efficiency isthe amount of sunlight a solar cell converts into electricity. Materials for thin film solar cells and superconductors are fabricated in labson the second floor. Thin film solar cells are about 50 times thinner thancrystalline solar cells and are easier to make. With an efficiency of 17.1%,NREL's Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide solar cell holds the world record for athin film device. Device Fabrication Prototype solar cells are fabricated in laboratories in the center module.These labs include a device development laboratory and a clean room where airand light are filtered to minimize impurities in the solar cells. The centermodule also includes laboratories to analyze the semiconductor material used tomake solar cells, and for research into hydrogen generation and storage. Measuring Performance Labs in the east module are used to measure and characterize the performance ofsolar cells and modules made by NREL researchers, industry partners, anduniversities. NREL conducts more than 17,000 measurements each year.Researchers analyze materials, characterize device performance, evaluatefabrication problems, and model solar cell and module performance withcomputers. PV Systems On top of SERF's east and west office pods, 10 photovoltaic panels have beeninstalled to study the performance of integrated PV systems on commercialbuildings. The panels generate as much as 12 kilowatts of electricity that isfed into the Public Service Company of Colorado's power grid.WT02-B16-121IA059-000321-B010-425http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/pv/aboutpv.html 205.168.79.27 19970114203648 text/html 2445HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 20:36:56 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 21:16:44 GMTContent-length: 2271 DOE Photovoltaics Program - About PV U.S. Department of Energy Photovoltaics Program Photovoltaic (or PV) systems convert light energy into electricity. The term "photo" is a stemfrom the Greek "phos," which means "light." "Volt" is named for Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), a pioneer in the study of electricity. "Photo-voltaics," then, could literally mean "light-electricity." Most commonly known as "solar cells," PV systems are already an important partof our lives. The simplest systems power many of the small calculators and wrist watches weuse every day. More complicated systems provide electricity for pumping water, poweringcommunications equipment, and even lighting our homes and running our appliances. In asurprising number of cases, PV power is the cheapest form of electricity for performing thesetasks. Here, we describe the PV effect that allows various materials to produce electricity from sunlight; showhow PV cells, modules, and arrays are made; explain why PV is the mostlogical power choice in many different cases; and provide real examples of how this science is improving the lives of people all over the world!

More than two decades of research and development (R&D), inpartnership with industry, has taken PV from a laboratory novelty to today"s growing U.S.industry, which grossed more than $350 million in 1995. With further R&D, PV will contribute much more to the national economy. Reducing systemcosts from about $7 per watt to $3 per watt could result in a domestic industry with billions ofdollars in annual sales. A recent market study by the Utility PhotoVoltaic Group estimated apotential domestic market for PV of 9000 megawatts at a system price of $3 per watt. But PVhas even more potential as a cost-competitive source of electricity, because reducing costs tobelow $3 per watt is also possible. Through continued research and development, we can achieve our long-term goals. 1991 1995 2000 2010-2030 Electricity price (�/kWh) 40-75 25-50 12-20 <6 Module efficiency* (%) 5-14 7-17 10-20 15-25 System cost ($/W) 10-20 7-15 3-7 1-1.50 System lifetime (years) 5-10 10-20 >20 >30 U.S. cumulative sales (MW) 75 175 400-600 >10,000 * Range of efficiencies for commercial flat-plate and concentator technologies.

It provided jobs for 25 million workers in 1993. Technologies that improve the productivity of U.S. industries improve the entire economy. Industries consume 36 percent of the energy used in the U.S., at a cost of $100 billion each year. This level of energy use provides great opportunities for savings. One example: Industry spends $30 billion annually to operate 40 million electric motors spread throughout industrial and manufacturing operations. Electric motors consume 70 percent of all energy in a typical manufacturing facility. These costs can be cut in half with efficient motor systems. Industries spend $45 billion per year to meet emissions control regulations.

Electric and gas utilities represent a national capital investment portfolio of $790 billion. Utilities are significant energy consumers, accounting for 55 percent of total U.S. energy consumption. Utilities provide roughly $260 billion each year in energy services to homes, businesses and industries. This is 5.2 percent of the gross national product, an average expenditure of $235 per month for each household in America. The production and consumption of energy by utilities has a significant impact on the environment. For example, carbon dioxide emissions attributed to primary energy use by utilities constitute 33 percent of the U.S. total. Renewable energy technologies will help utilities assure clean and ample energy supplies to meet America's growing demand, while making our economy less vulnerable to swings in fossil fuel prices. Because they are cleaner than conventional power plants, renewable energy systems can help utilities and industries meet environmental goals. Renewable energy systems are reliable, versatile and flexible. The need for renewable energy worldwide is creating dynamic business opportunities forthe U.S. renewable energy industry. DOE's Programs . . . Help develop new sources of clean energy, including energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Assist utilities in long-range planning. Will save $14.5 billion in utility energy by the year 2000. Help U.S. industries develop technologies to capture part of the $1 trillion global market for electric generation systems.

The electricity required just to light the nation's buildings equals 75 percent of the energy produced by America's nuclear power plants. Energy use in buildings has an enormous impact on the economy. The nation's 95 million households and 4.5 million commercial buildings spend $200 billion each year for energy. The potential for savings is high. A 30 percent improvement in U.S. building efficiency would reduce energy bills by $100 billion in 15 years and eliminate the need for 80 new nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. Many buildings were built long ago and contain obsolete energy systems. 80 percent of our commercial buildings were built prior to 1979. When new buildings are constructed, energy decisions are long-lasting. The median lifetime for commercial buildings is between 60-90 years, far longer than most power plants. Better lighting and thermal systems produce measurable increases in worker productivity. In fact, because labor costs dwarf energy costs per square foot, productivity gains often are the prime motivator for businesses to improve energy efficiency. Building efficiency is critical to environmental quality. Primary energy use by U.S. buildings accounts for 8 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. DOE's Programs . . . Will cut energy consumption in commercial buildings by 2 quads over the next 10 years. Save businesses $12.5 billion annually. Create up to 125,000 jobs in the commercial sector. Lower residential energy demand by 2 quads, saving families $17 billion by the year 2005. Create another 125,000 jobs in residential construction industries.

We are importing more oil than ever before, and the trend is upward. The gap between what we use and what we produce is projected to rise to 8 million barrels per day by the year 2010. Oil imports contribute significantly to the nation's foreign trade deficit, and make our economy vulnerable to price swings and supply disruptions. Emissions from the nation's nearly 200 million cars and trucks account for about half of all air pollution in the U.S. and more than 80 percent of air pollution in cities. The American Lung Association estimates that America spends more than $60 billion each year on health care as a direct result of air pollution. America's cars are more efficient than ever, but our rate of fuel use continues to grow. Since 1980, the miles-per-gallon rating of passenger carshas improved 39 percent, yet fuel consumption is up 19 percent. A key reason: we are driving 50 percent more miles. Only 13 percent of the energy used by today's vehicles actually propels them forward; much of the rest could be saved with better equipment technology.

Some of the EE programs delivered in partnership with state governments include: State Energy Program (SEP) The SEP is the result of a merger of State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) and Institutional Conservation Program (ICP) activities. The SEP provides grants and technical assistance to states and U.S. territories to develop and implement state energy plans. SEP has flexibility comparable to a block grant program, allowing states to tailor activities to their needs. Each dollar provided by the federal government catalyzes an average of $19 in additional state and private spending. SEP is funded at $25.9 million in FY 96, which is 50 percent of the funding level from FY 95. In addition to this funding, $11 million were provided to states for individual energy projects they identified in FY 95. SEP provides cost-shared grants to states to conduct energy analyses and energy capital improvements in schools and hospitals. The traditional program requires a 50/50 match of state and federal money.

Why Should We Care About Sustainable Energy? Environment Problem Today, the production and use of energy causes more environmental damage than any other human activity. If current trends continue, it will get worse. U.S. energy consumption is projected to rise 20 percent between 1995 and 2015. World energy consumption is expected to rise 50 percent in the next 20 years. Opportunity Energy efficiency allows economic growth to continue with lower rates of growth in energy consumption. Renewable resources provide clean alternatives to traditional fuels. Public Health Problem Energy use is a public health issue, even in developed nations like the United States. Some 54 million Americans live in counties that regularly violate air quality standards. Opportunity Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are proven ways to prevent pollution by businesses, industries and cars. Economy Problem Wasted energy is wasted money for U.S. businesses, taxpayers, and families. Enormous amounts of capital are wasted today in the form of unnecessary energy expenses. Opportunity Less energy waste would free money for new investments in business plant and equipment, higher profits for stockholders, reduced consumer prices, better wages and training for workers, more disposable income for homeowners types of spending that research shows produce more jobs than building new power plants. Oil Imports Problem America's high reliance on imported petroleum makes the economy vulnerable to supply disruptions and price shocks. Oil prices are projected to increase with higher consumption caused by economic development programs worldwide. Opportunity Energy efficiency and renewable, domestic energy resources reduce our dependence on imported oil and insulate the economy from price shocks. Trade Deficit Problem The U.S. imports more oil today than at any other time in its history. In 1993, oil imports contributed $51 billion to the nation's trade deficit. Imports are projected to rise to 62 percent of U.S. consumption in the next 20 years. Oil prices also are projected to rise over the next 20 years by approximately 50 percent. Both trends will cause more upward pressure on the trade deficit. Opportunity Energy efficiency and domestic, renewable energy resources slow the growth of oil imports. That's not all. With the world market for environmental technologies expected to grow to $425 billion annually by 1997, U.S. energy efficiency and renewable energy Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy Benefits Programs Targeted for Urban Centers and Municipalities Why Industrial Energy Use Matters Why Utility Energy Use Matters Why Building Efficiency Matters Why Transportation Energy Matters Partnering With States Energy Tip of the Day [Home][EREN][DOE] Return to EREN Home Page Test Your Energy IQWT02-B16-134IA059-000321-B011-296http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/greenpower/new.html 205.168.79.27 19970114204143 text/html 3442HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 20:41:47 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 30 Sep 1996 14:31:47 GMTContent-length: 3268 What's New U.S. Department of Energy - What's New - Wisconsin Public Service�s SolarWise for Schools� program selected the first three participants to receive 12-kW photovoltaic systems. Two of the systems were installed this summer and the third will be installed in October. These participants are Antigo High School, Green Bay East High, and Southern Door Schools. In addition to the photovoltaic systems, the schools will integrate renewable energy and environmental education into the curriculum with the help of Public Service. In October, SolarWise for Schools� will begin to select the next program participants. Northern States Power, under the EnergyWise� Solar Advantage program, is offering residential customers the opportunity to generate solar electricity for use in their homes. NSP has already installed ten photovoltaic panels in homes in the Twin Cities and plans to install seven additional units. The system allows the home-owners to utilize the power generated by the unit and sell any excess power to the utility at the customer�s regular rate. NSP pays for and installs the systems with help from the U.S. Department of Energy and the Utility PhotoVoltaic Group. Program participants pay an additional $50 on each month�s utility bill for five years and receive the power generated by the unit at no cost. New York State Electric and Gas Company installed two residential photovoltaic systems in August under the UPVG TEAM-UP PV Friendly Pricing program. The City of Austin has developed its green-pricing program under the UPVG TEAM-UP PV Friendly Pricing program. The program will be very similar to Detroit Edison�s SolarCurrents program. Customers will have the opportunity to purchase 100 watt increments of power from photovoltaic systems that will be in three different types of applications: shade structures for parking lots, ballast-mounted arrays, and flat-topped commercial buildings. The first installation is scheduled for October. Arizona Public Service Company plans to kick-off its PV Friendly Pricing program in October with PV installations beginning in December. Central and Southwest Services plans to install two residential PV systems under the UPVG TEAM-UP PV Friendly Pricing program. Installation is targeted for the fall. Detroit Edison recently announced plans to build three additional photovoltaic systems in addition to the 28.4 kW system installed in April. The plans call for three new facilities with a total output of 160 kW, including two 30 kW facilities serving residential customers and schools and a 100 kW facility serving and industrial customer.

Background on Green Power Marketing The passage of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978 expanded the market for larger, bulk-power-oriented renewable electric projects. This legislation partially addressed the restrictive market power of utilities by requiring utilities to interconnect with and purchase power from certain qualifying facilities (QFs) at a utility�s avoided cost, or the cost that the utility would have incurred by generating or otherwise supplying the power itself. In the early days of PURPA implementation, electricity costs were rising and electricity demand growth was higher than it is today, which led to favorably proced, long-term avoided cost contracts for renewables developers. More recently, low natural gas prices and the increased competition in the wholesale electricity markets initiated by PURPA have lowered generation proces and caused utilities and regulators alike to adopt a vert short-term perspective of the electricity market. In this environment, renewables, with their higher front-end investment requirements and longer-term contractual needs, are at a disadvantage. Indeed, annual renewables electric capacity additions have fallen to between 200 MW and 300 MW during the 1990�s from a level of more than 1,000 MW during the late 1980�s. Currently, electric utilities are facing increasing competition because of a nationwide movement to deregulate the power-supply industry. The promotion of greater competition in electricity markets is premised on the belief that a more competitive market will result in lower market prices than the traditional regulated monopoly industry structure. This will be achieved by giving a greater number of suppliers access to the market. Renewables, with higher-front end costs, will be disadvantaged in this strictly price-based segment of the market. However, full competition should also provide electricity customers with a greater choice of how their electricity is produced, and this opens a new market for renewables. In the face of this competition, utilities have a growing impetus to strengthen their image with their customers and build customer loyalty. Two important factors in customer loyalty are: 1) Most utility customers want their utilities to pursue environmentally benign options for generating power. 2) Some utility customers are willing to pay extra to receive (or even just to fund) power generated from renewable sources. Some utilities are now offering customers the option of paying more to receive such environmentally-preferable power a concept known as "green pricing." Green pricing is an evolving utility service that responds to utility customers' preferences for electricity derived from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or biomass. Under green pricing, utilities offer customers a voluntary program or service to support electricity generated from renewable energy systems. Customers are asked to pay a rate premium, which is meant to cover the costs that the utility incurs above those paid for electricity from conventional fuels. Utilities are considering green pricing as a way to build customer loyalty, deploy popular renewable technologies, expand business lines and expertise, and improve understanding of customer response to unbundled pricing and services. The more general concept of marketing green power is usually referred to as "green power marketing." Green power marketing capitalizes on an expressed public preference for cleaner energy options, such as renewables, by giving consumers a market option to purchase renewables-based electricity services. Green marketing has the potential to expand domestic markets for renewable energy technologies by fostering greater availability of renewable electric service options in retail markets and is compatible with ongoing attempts to introduce greater competition into the generation and delivery of electricity.

S. Department of Energy About the Building Energy Tools Directory Many Office of Building Technology, State and Community Program (BTS) programs develop software tools to help researchers, designers, architects, engineers, builders, code officials, and others involved in the building life-cycle to evaluate and rank potential energy-efficiency technologies and renewable energy strategies in new or existing buildings. This electronic directory provides information on more than 70 tools--from research grade software to commercial products with thousands of users. The common thread for all the software is improving energy efficiency or incorporating renewable energy concepts in buildings. Many tools in the first version (August 1996) were sponsored by DOE at some point in their life-cycle. The energy tools in this directory include databases, spreadsheets, component and systems analyses, and whole-building energy performance simulation programs. For each tool in the directory, a short description is provided along with other information including expertise required, users, audience, input, output, computer platforms, programming language, strengths, weaknesses, technical contact, and availability. The directory is organized in four major categories with subcategories Whole-Building Analysis Energy Simulation Load Calculation Retrofit Analysis Materials, Components, Equipment, and Systems Envelope Systems HVAC Equipment and Systems Lighting Systems Special Applications Energy Economics Multibuilding Facilities Water Conservation Ventilation, Indoor Air Quality, Airflow Other Standards and Codes When you click on a category, a list of tools will appear along with descriptive information including applicability to building life-cycle phase, building type, system, equipment, or other important capabilities. Acronyms not defined in the tools descriptions can be reviewed here.

S. Department of Energy Getting Your Software in the Building Energy Tools Directory Interested in having your software tool included in the directory? We are looking for software for improving energy efficiency or incorporating renewable energy concepts in buildings. The software must be available--no vaporware--either directly downloadable or for purchase. Tools intended primarily for research users are ok if they are available and well documented. Commercial software is also welcome--no ads please. We intend the directory to act as an impartial clearinghouse -- providing consistent information about a broad variety of building software available worldwide. The information we need for the directory is shown at the end of this message--a good example from the directory is the BLAST energy simulation program. How best to get information on your software to us? We prefer that you e-mail the information as text in a message. Attach electronic versions of logos or screen captures to the message. We really want and need graphics! Simple screen captures are fine. Do not worry about formatting the information or the graphics. We can convert most common formats. When you send us information on your software, include the category where your software fits best and a list of five keywords that describe what it does. Once we get the information, we will evaluate it to ensure it is complete, consistent, and not too much of an ad for your software. We will then format it and put it up on the web page. Yes, it is that easy. Generally it takes less than a couple of days. I hope that you will be interested in having your software in the directory. If you have questions or would like to recommend other software for the directory, please contact me.

FEMP accomplishes its mission by creating partnerships, leveraging resources, transferring technology and providing training and support. Each of these activities is directly related to achieving not only the goals set forth in law and Executive Order, but also those which are inherent in sound management of Federal financial and personnel resources. The Federal Energy Management Program is a customer focused organization providing services to other Federal agencies. When FEMP succeeds at its mission, agencies have the skills, the means, and the initiative to undertake projects to use energy and water more efficiently, and that promote the use of renewable resources. Only when agencies complete these projects can the Federal sector achieve its broader energy and cost saving goals. The program attempts to set an example for the Nation by transferring the Federal energy experience to State and local governments and ultimately to the private sector. In the process of achieving FEMPís mission, it is necessary to provide technical assistance for project identification, alternative methods of financing projects, technical support and training necessary to successfully implement projects, and transfer of knowledge about successful projects to encourage others to achieve additional progress toward the goals. A long-term benefit of these activities is building an infrastructure in Federal agencies that institutionalizes energy efficiency as a good business practice. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, requires each agency to achieve: a 10 percent reduction in energy consumption in its Federal buildings by FY 1995, when measured against a FY 1985 baseline on a Btu-per-gross-square-foot basis; a 20 percent reduction in Btu per gross square foot by FY 2000. Furthermore, agencies are required to achieve a 30 percent reduction by FY 2005 per Executive Order 12902. The activities of FEMP have contributed to an 11.2 percent decrease in energy consumption in buildings in FY 1994, compared to FY 1985, measured on a Btu-per- gross-square-foot basis. The Federal Government Energy Situation The Federal Government is the largest energy consumer in the United States, although its pattern of consumption is widely dispersed throughout the world. In fiscal year (FY) 1994, the Government reported direct energy use of 1.2 quadrillion British Thermal Units (quads). Taking into account losses for electricity and steam production and transmission to Federal facilities, the total energy required at the point of generation to satisfy the Government's needs was in excess of 1.7 quads. This represents approximately 2.0 percent of the total 85.3 quads used in the United States. The 1.2 quads of delivered energy consumed by the Government in buildings, facilities, and operations is used to provide essential services to its citizens, including the defense of the Nation. The Federal Government provides energy to approximately 500,000 buildings comprising over 3.1 billion square feet of floor area. This energy is used to provide lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other standard building services, as well as to support a significant amount of process operations. Approximately 77 percent of the Government-owned floor area is used for housing, office, storage, and service purposes, with the remaining 23 percent devoted to hospital, school, prison, research and development, industrial, and other uses. Approximately 13 percent of Federal floor area is located in California, followed by Texas with 7 percent, Virginia with 5 percent, and New York with 4 percent. The Government also uses energy in vehicles and equipment ranging in size and function from aircraft carriers to forklifts. It includes aircraft and naval fuels, automotive gasoline consumed by Federally- owned and leased vehicles and privately-owned vehicles used for official business, and the energy used in Federal construction. Energy consumption in vehicles and equipment is at its lowest level since agencies began reporting in 1975. The Department of Defense consumed 93.3 percent of all energy in this category during FY 1994. The Government's total net energy consumption in FY 1994 decreased 16.9 percent from 1,445.5 trillion Btu in FY 1985 base year to 1,200.9 trillion Btu, a reduction of 244.6 trillion Btu. This reduction of 244.6 trillion Btu could satisfy the energy needs of over one million households for one year. Contributing to this decrease was an 18.2 percent decrease in buildings and facilities energy and a 22.7 percent decrease in vehicle and equipment fuels. Energy used in energy intensive operations in excluded buildings increased by 132.2 percent over FY 1985, but this energy accounts for only 7.8 percent of the total 1,200.0 trillion Btu. Changes in agency reporting procedures for excluded buildings over the years has also influenced consumption levels in this category. The figures below illustrate the share of each type of energy used in FY 1985 and FY 1994. In FY 1994, the Department of Defense consumed 81.4 percent of the Government's total energy; this is compared to 86.5 percent in FY 1985. Energy Savings and Deficit Reduction Federal energy management programs generate cost savings and contribute to deficit reduction. In FY 1994, the Government's energy bill was $8.0 billion. $8.0 billion and represented approximately 0.6 percent of the total Federal expenditures of $1.461 trillion for all purposes in FY 1994. In real dollars, the Government spent $4.4 billion less than in FY 1985 and has accumulated savings of almost $26.5 billion (which includes vehicle fuel savings). In nominal dollars, the Federal energy bill for FY 1994 decreased approximately $900 million from the $8.9 billion reported for FY 1993. In FY 1994, jet fuel and electricity accounted for 74.6 percent of the Government's total energy costs. The Government's energy bill for buildings was $3.8 billion in 1994. In real dollars, the Government spent $1.1 billion less than in 1985 and has accumulated savings of $7.4 billion. Energy efficiency efforts contributed to this savings with annual avoided energy costs totaling $2.9 billion from 1986 through 1994. In real dollars, energy costs per square foot decreased 22 percent in 1994 relative to 1985. Federal electricity costs decreased 15 percent from 1985 to 1994. During that period, the real cost to the Government for electricity fell 1.2 cents to 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The Government's energy bill for vehicles was $3.3 billion in 1994. In real dollars, the Government spent $3.6 billion less than in FY 1985 and has accumulated savings of $20.4 billion. Reductions in fuel use contributed to this savings with annual avoided energy costs totaling $2.1 billion from 1986 through 1994. Energy costs for energy intensive operations were $975.3 million in 1994, 12.1 percent of the Government's total energy bill. Success Stories DOE Forrestal Headquarters Building. Using a PEPCO utility incentive and an energy savings performance contract, FEMP, with its In-house Energy Management Program and the Departmentís Human Resources Division, replaced over 30,000 lighting fixtures with high efficiency T-8 lamps and electronic ballasts. While improving the lighting quality and employee productivity, the project reduced the lighting cost more than $1 million over the seven year life of the project. With the private sector funding, this was accomplished at no capital cost to the government. If all lighting in the Federal sector achieved the same 70% lighting cost reduction, the government could save one-quarter of a billion dollars on lighting alone each year. After the retrofits, DOE surveyed the employees on lighting quality. The results showed that employees thought the retrofits significantly improved lighting conditions. The physical data supported the survey results. The retrofits improved the pattern of luminance in the office, with fewer dark spots on the ceiling and brighter surfaces in the upper portion of the walls. 26 Federal Plaza, New York. An unprecedented partnership between FEMP, GSA, and Consolidated Edison is successfully reducing energy consumption in GSA-owned and operated facilities through an agreement, known as the Federal Plaza Modernization Project. As a result of the Modernization Project at several sites, more than $10 million in utility incentives has been invested by ConEd for energy efficient lighting, motors and new buildings. For a new U.S. Courthouse, built by GSA, ConEd provided nearly $700,000 in rebates for installation of the most energy efficient lighting system, variable frequency drives, and high efficiency motors. The annual cost savings associated with the use of these advanced systems is almost $310,000. As a result of the success of this partnership, Con Ed is expanding the work to 29 other sites. Southern California Edison. Recently, through the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program and the General Services Administration, Edison, through its ENVEST two year pilot program, signed the first of many agreements with the U.S. Government to begin modernization projects at sites within its service territory, including the Chet Hollifield Federal Building in Orange County, Fort Irwin National Training Center, and Edwards Air Force Base. ENVEST also signed 5 new contracts with naval bases and more than 70 with Postal Service facilities. The FEMP and SCE agreement has lead to $54 million in utility incentives and financing to reduce the cost of government. As a result, multiple projects, initiated by ENVEST, have helped the Federal Government reduce electrical energy consumption by approximately 66.2 million kilowatt hours. The projects have also reduced operating demand by almost 10 megawatts. Several agencies have received rebates totaling $2.1 million for installation of energy efficient measures. SCE has financed $52 million in Federal projects through the ENVEST program and expects to save its Federal customers approximately $8.7 million annually. Environmental Benefits Improved efficiency, which avoids the need to supply energy, is by far the most cost-effective way to invest in pollution prevention, to mitigate climate change, and to reduce the depletion of non-renewable resources. Carbon emissions resulting from Federal energy consumption fell 10.5 percent from 33.3 million metric tons (MMT) in 1985 to 29.8 MMT in 1994, a reduction of 3.5 MMT. The largest decrease in carbon emissions during the period occurred in the vehicles and equipment category which fell 4.3 MMT from 18.5 MMT to 14.2 MMT. Carbon emissions from energy used in buildings fell by 1.2 MMT while carbon emissions from energy used in energy-intensive operations increased by 2.0 MMT. From 1986 to 1994, the Government has avoided carbon emissions from energy consumption totaling eight million metric tons when compared with 1985, contributing almost one percent to carbon emissions reduction efforts. Achieving the energy reduction goals will produce an additional 12 million metric tons of reduced carbon emissions. Environmental benefits of this program will help the United States meet international obligations of reducing overall carbon emissions to 1990 levels. Success Stories Greening of the White House. This project, which began with a Presidential Challenge in 1993 to make the White House a symbol of energy efficiency and waste reduction, has achieved impressive gains in energy and cost savings. The project has already achieved more than $150,000 in energy cost savings and has contributed to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Measures taken to date include a program to recycle paper, glass, aluminum, cardboard and electric light bulbs, light fixtures, paint solvents, and a study to recycle polystyrene plates and cups. Yard waste is removed to an off site area where after two years it is returned as top soil. Energy saving measures include replacement of incandescent bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent ones (more than 90 percent complete in the Old Executive Office Building) and relighting with efficient halogen lamps. The White house has even purchased the very first super efficient refrigerator and is currently installing an energy efficient and environmentally friendly air conditioning system. Water is saved using low flow aerators and low flow toilets. FEMP is continuing to work with the White House to implement this project. Dangling Rope, Utah. FEMP, in a partnership with the Department of Interior and Utah Department of Natural Resources, is helping to fund installation of photovoltaics and energy efficiency measures at the National Park Service Marina on Lake Powell at Dangling Rope, Utah. This project will combine $350,000 from the Federal Energy Efficiency Fund with $438,500 of non-Federal funds contributed by the state, utility, and park vendor along with $404,500 of Park Service and other Federal funding. Besides the 59% improvement in energy efficiency and the positive cost savings of $270,149 (net after investment), the project offers environmental benefits which reinforce the value of the project. Chief among these is the replacement of diesel fuel which is barged into the marina to power electric generators. In addition to a reduction of exhaust gasses which can accumulate at lake level during certain weather conditions, several minor fuel spills have occurred in the past and a recent mishap nearly resulted in a diesel tanker truck sinking in the lake during the off-loading. The cost of cleaning such a fuel spill has been estimated at over one million dollars. Projected Benefits and Costs To achieve the 30 percent energy reduction goal, agencies must double their investments in energy efficiency. With a relatively small Federal investment, Federal energy management programs will save $20 billion by the year 2015. A successful Federal energy management program produces $4 in savings for every $1 invested. We achieve even greater savings with the resulting productivity growth. Federal energy management helps protect the national infrastructure. Success Stories New Mexico Initiative. A public and private partnership brought about by the Federal Energy Management Program will save taxpayers millions while creating jobs for the State of New Mexico. The partnership, consisting of the Department, General Services Administration, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, City of Albuquerque, Kirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico State Engineers Office, and Public Service Company of New Mexico, will be used to expedite the Federal energy and water efficiency requirements, improving the speed and economies of scale of these U.S. technologies. The savings from a 50 percent reduction in water and sewage usage will be more than $500,000 annually. A 30 percent reduction in energy use at Kirtland, now spending $21.5 million annually, will save more than $7 million per year. Federal Procurement Challenge. The Energy Efficiency and Resource Conservation Challenge is a voluntary, government-wide commitment that uses the buying power of the Federal government to support and expand markets for today's best-practice energy-efficient, renewable, and water conserving products, create new entry markets for advanced, energy-saving technologies and products, lower the costs of efficient products for all consumers by providing a large, reliable market, reduce operating costs for Federal agencies, saving taxpayers' money, reduce Federal energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a model for other levels of government, corporate, and institutional purchasers. FEMP provides Challenge participants with a variety of tools and technical support to assist them in achieving Challenge goals. FEMP publishes Product Recommendations which identify energy efficiency criteria for products that meet the "best-practice" as defined by EPACT 1992 and the Executive Order. This system will make it easy for procurement officials to locate such products, both electronically and through catalogs and schedules. The FEMP Products Working Group provides agency representatives with a forum for exchanging ideas on agency implementation programs. FEMP also provides a link to activities at the state level through the Energy-Efficient Procurement Collaborative and New York State Energy and Research Development Authority.

This Section required the Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Agriculture, and the Interior; the Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service; and the Administrator of the General Services Administration each to designate one Assistant Secretary or Assistant Administrator as the principal energy conservation officer of the respective Department or Administration. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Veterans Administration (currently the Department of Veterans Affairs), and the Environmental Protection Agency were asked by the Department of Energy to designate an individual of similar status to participate as a member. These 11 agencies and the Department of Energy consume approximately 98 percent of all Federal energy. The Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, State, and Treasury were invited to join in October, 1993. The "656" Committee is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy. It meets periodically to provide policy guidance and to review agency progress on Federal energy conservation plans and associated investments. The purpose of the Committee is to strengthen energy conservation programs which emphasize productivity through the efficient use of energy, and concurrently encourage interagency cooperation in energy conservation.

Department of Labor, Frances Perkins Building, Headquarters, Washington, D.C. The Francis Perkins Building is named for the first woman ever to serve as a Cabinetmember. The scope of the project encompasses all of the building's energy consumingsystems including water heating, heating, ventilating, and cooling, lighting, andwindows. FEMP provided technical assistance to assess the cost and performance ofinstalling window treatments to control solar gains and thermal losses. The netdollar savings of improving window treatment is estimated at $428,000. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, George C. Marshall Space FlightCenter, Project Engineering Facility Building 4203, Huntsville, Alabama Conservation measures included in the original design and construction of thefacility include energy efficient and ozone-friendly chillers, variable air volumeunits, a utility control system, ventilating and air conditioning equipment, andoccupancy sensors. An energy audit was conducted and addition energy and waterconservation practices were proposed: installation of variable speed drives;lighting upgrades, water conservation upgrades, and heat recovery. By implementingall proposed conservation measures, approximately $97,000 will be saved. Department of State, National Foreign Affairs Training Center, Arlington,Virginia The building has in place an Energy Management System to better control energy usageand peak demand. The lighting project consists of installing T-8 lamps andelectronic ballasts. Other proposed technologies include daylighting, light tubeand fiberoptic lighting combinations, absorption cooling, and a desiccant coolingsystem. The State Department has been working with FEMP to get an Energy SavingsPerformance Contract in place to fund this showcase. Department of Transportation, Nassif Headquarters Building, Washington, D.C. The Headquarters Building houses approximately 1.3 million square feet of officespace. Energy saving improvements such as an efficient T-8 lighting system,occupancy sensors, LED exit signs, efficient window air conditioning and heatingunits, and an Energy Management Control System will save the government over $1million annually. Pepco has provided over $587,000 in rebates, and additionalrebates of over $400,000 are anticipated for projects underway. Department of the Treasury, Headquarters, Washington, D.C. The Treasury Department staff is working with FEMP to obtain an Energy SavingsPerformance Contract to fund the implementation of cost-effective, energy savingmeasures. The redesign and computerization of HVAC controls will minimize waste ofconditioned air and result in a savings of $78,000 over two years. The installationof high efficiency chillers will save $54,000 each year. The lighting retrofitproject will incorporate high-efficiency light fixtures, daylighting controls, andoccupancy sensors, and will save approximately $15,000 annually. Department of the Treasury, Annex Building, Washington, D.C. The greatest savings opportunity in the Annex Building is the redesign of the lightsystem, which will incorporate high-efficiency light fixtures, daylighting controls,occupancy sensors, and night lighting. The total savings is estimated to beapproximately $7,000 per year. Department of the Treasury, Philadelphia Mint, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The agency has undertaken a project to reduce electrical demand and costs throughthe installation of capacitor banks on nine substations throughout the facility,improving the power factor and reducing the utility bill. The expected savings areapproximately $400,000 annually. The Mint will also implement the clean up andrenovation of the office HVAC and lighting systems, including the installation ofvariable air volume controls and replacement of the existing lighting fixtures withT-8 lights and electronic ballasts. U.S. Postal Service, Processing and Distribution Center, Fort Lauderdale, Florida Through the formation of a partnership with the local utility, Florida Power andLight, the facility has completed feasibility studies of the lighting and HVACsystems. The HVAC study determined that energy usage could be reduced throughbetter control strategies and new energy conserving equipment and designs. Therecommended lighting retrofit measures include LED exit signs, efficient lightingfixtures, reflectors, and high intensity discharge lighting. United States Postal Service, Processing and Distribution Center, Portland,Oregon A Proclamation of Partnership was signed between the United States Postal Serviceand Portland General electric to implement energy efficiency measures and eliminatewasteful energy use. The showcase project has four phases that include an audit, afeasibility study, implementation, and commissioning and training. Recommendedmeasures such as lighting redesign, HVAC controls, direct digital controls, VAVconversion, and occupancy sensors will be implemented in four packages and will saveapproximately $104,000 per year. United States Postal Service, Processing and Distribution Center, Saint Paul,Minnesota The local utility, Northern States Power, will provide a detailed study to help theagency identify energy conservation opportunities at this facility. Some parts ofthe study will include DOE-2 modeling, a Central Plant study, a photovoltaic study,and an Energy Management System study. Potential savings for the facility areestimated at $190,000. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Charleston, South Carolina Through a collaborative effort with the local utility, South Carolina Gas andElectric, a thermal energy storage system was installed at the facility. Ice ismanufactured during nighttime, off-peak hours to provide daytime cooling. Thebuilding will also have an energy management system to control the energy usage andtrack peak demand periods. Veterans Affairs may conduct a feasibility study todetermine if a solar water heating system is cost-effective for the MedicalCenter. After all the plaques were presented to the Federal Energy Saver Showcases, MarkGinsberg moved to the remaining agenda items. Site vs. Source Measurement of Energy Consumption Mark Ginsberg asked the Interagency Policy Committee to endorse the followingrecommendation developed by the Task Force: 'Section 301 of Executive Order 12902 directs each agency to develop and implement aprogram to reduce building energy consumption. Federal agencies are encouraged tocontinue to focus their response to the Executive Order by measuring and accountingfor energy use at the point of use of the facility site. However, the ExecutiveOrder also encourages agencies to facilitate the introduction and use ofcost-effective, energy efficient technologies into Federal facilities. To addressthis aspect of the Executive Order, all energy efficiency/conservation projects thatresult in operational cost savings and reduced energy consumption, when energy ismeasured at the source (as opposed to the point of use), are also encouraged'This statement was unanimously endorsed by the Committee. Federal Green Lights Program Partnership Mark Ginsberg asked the Task Force to agree in principle to encourage and endorsethe application of the Green Lights program to the Federal sector under a proposedMemorandum of Understanding budgeted between DOE and EPA with input from severalagencies. Christine Ervin noted that the EPA Energy Star Buildings Program will now beco-sponsored by EPA and DOE. She then asked for any discussion on the Federal GreenLights Partnership. Beth Shearer of GSA commented that they can not fully support Federal Green Lightsbecause of the decentralized nature of their commitment of funds beyond theappropriation year. Mr. Ginsberg reminded everyone that it is an agreement inprinciple. The Committee unanimously agreed in principle to the Federal Green Lights ProgramPartnership. Restructuring of the "656" Committee Christine Ervin stated that they are looking at making the "656" Committee moreeffective. She emphasized the issue of the non-participation of actual members ofthe Committee since no designated members were present at the meeting. Mark Ginsberg suggested that the concept of the Committee be revised and theCommittee be redesignated as a Government Energy Board of Directors with a corporateapproach. The Board of Directors would work to oversee and reshape policy. Heencouraged the agencies to participate in the effort of preparing a draft charter tobe reviewed by the Task Force. He asked participants to forward their ideas to himor to Rick Klimkos. He suggested renaming the "656" Committee, and providedpossible alternatives such as 'Federal Energy Executives' or the 'Energy ManagementBoard of Directors.' He asked that the "656" Committee continue to meet once ayear. He stated that agency energy managers are an "endangered species," and hewould like the new Board of Directors to be advocates for energy efficiency withinthe Government. He ended his request by asserting the idea of "good businesspractice." Budget Issues Assistant Secretary Ervin asked each of the representatives to give a brief overviewof the energy management budget situation at their agencies. Department of Agriculture--The budget for the renovation of the South HeadquartersBuilding has been eliminated; a $20 million cut. Department of Commerce--Commerce does not have a separate budget line item forenergy management. Their approach is to work with GSA to fund projects in delegatedbuildings. Buildings owned by the Commerce Department have only enough funding formaintenance. Department of Defense--The Senate moved $97 million of $120 million from DOD'senergy management account to the operations and maintenance accounts of theindividual Services. These funds are likely to be used by the Services formission-related activities rather than for energy efficiency projects. Environmental Protection Agency--EPA does not have a separate centralized budgetline item for energy management. General Services Administration--GSA's energy efficiency budget line item currentlystands at $50 million. Department of Health and Human Services--HHS does not have a separate budget lineitem for energy management. Department of the Interior--The budget situation at Interior was described as bleak,with the closing of the Bureau of Mines cited as one example. Department of Justice--Justice does not have a separate centralized budget line itemfor energy management. The renovation of the Justice headquarters will beaccomplished with GSA funds and will include energy efficiency elements. NASA--NASA has not had a separate centralized budget line item for energy managementsince the mid 1980s. Most energy efficiency projects are accomplished withConstruction of Facilities funding which is currently stands at $300 million. U.S. Postal Service--The Postal Service does not have a separate centralized budgetline item for energy management. Energy management functions at USPS have beenmoved to its environmental management division. Department of State--State does not have a separate centralized budget line item forenergy management. The Department's strategy for accomplishing energy efficiencyprojects is to rely on energy savings performance contracts. Department of Transportation--Funding is decentralized and at the discretion of thebureaus and sub-agencies. Department of the Treasury--Funding is also decentralized and at the discretion ofthe bureaus. Energy efficiency projects are funded out of facility accounts and theDepartment has done well in this environment. Many of the Treasury's historicbuildings have fared well. Department of Veterans Affairs--Funding is totally decentralized to level ofindividual medical centers. Department of Labor--There has been competition between security issues and energyefficiency for funding. Last year, security improvements were emphasized moreheavily. Department of Energy--The Department's budget for In-House Energy Managementprojects was eliminated last year. Water Working Group The Water Working Group has written water efficiency language to be inserted intothe Energy Savings Performance Contract How-To Manual. The edits specificallymention water efficiency, and should make it simpler for a facility manager tounderstand how to implement water conservation projects in an energy savingsperformance contract. The changes should be complete for the next printing of theManual. A sub-team of the Water Working Group has identified several methods for developinga water use baseline. The methods consist of both simple formulas that can begenerally applied and more complex simulation tools that can be used to more closelyestimate a baseline. A draft of this document is being circulated to Task Forcemembers for comment, and a final document should be ready by the end of thesummer. The Group is writing a Federal Register notice to explore the linkage between energyefficiency and water conservation; to list and explain acceptable baselining methodsfor water use; and to provide clarification of existing legislation that allowsfacility managers to complete water projects under energy savings performancecontracts. The notice will be published in the Fall. Procurement Challenge Update Rick Klimkos outlined Federal Procurement Challenge accomplishments andplans: Procurement Challenge was signed in September 1995 by 22 agencies Federal product efficiency recommendations: DOE identifies efficient productsin the "upper 25% of the market, or greater than 10% above national standards;coordinates EPA/DOE Energy Star, "volume purchases," third-party labels, ASHRAE,etc. Completed: refrigerator, room and central air conditioning, heat pumps,furnaces, gas and electric water heaters Drafts: lamps, ballasts, fixtures, exit signs, boilers, office equipment,ice-makers, water-saving products Next: boilers, commercial HVAC, motors, windows Applications: - EE symbol in GSA and DLA catalogs - BOA for CFC-free chillers - Future: on-line data bases, specifications Requesting 2 nominees per agency for Procurement Focus Groups FAR draft language, DOE policies and "greening" Partnering: Procurement Collaborative, regional and local networks, possiblyinternational Study of commercialization of new technologies. Preparing study, public meetingand will report to Congress Renewable Working Group Implementation Plan Anne Sprunt Crawley reported that ten agencies have signed the Federal RenewableWorking Group Implementation Plan. Those agencies signing the plan will work tosignificantly increase the use of cost-effective solar and other renewable energy inFederal facilities in accordance with Executive Order 12902, section 304. The plancontains three actions to be implemented by each agency within two years: trainingof staff, development of a least one renewable project, and adoption of a renewableenergy plan. DOE's Federal Energy Management Program and the Federal RenewableWorking Group will continue to support all agencies in these actions through theprovision of training courses, a model renewable energy plan, and projectassistance. Final Comments Mark Ginsberg noted a recent meeting at the Nevada Test Site, where CSTRR isproviding a major opportunity for renewable projects by assisting in the financingof solar power generating projects in Nevada. All major Federal agencies in thearea intend to purchase this solar generated power. FEMP is offering training andefficiency audits to all agencies these customers. The meeting adjourned at 10:25 am.

Water Conservation Working Group (WCWG) Katherine Mayo (NREL) announced a WCWG meeting June 12, 1996, 10 a.m., todiscuss a draft Federal Register Notice to incorporate water conservation intoenergy savings performance contracts. Ashley Houston (NREL - Golden Office,303-384-7412) has been named chair of the WCWG. Carlos Campos (NASA) reported that work is progressing on developing baseliningmethods for measuring water consumption. A two-tiered methodology is proposed:1) a fast-track approach comprised of four equations, and 2) a long-termresearch model. Mr. Ginsberg noted that the Monterey (CA) Water Conservation District isexperiencing a severe shortage and has an immediate need to implement waterconservation measures at agency facilities in that region. He asked the TaskForce members to notify FEMP of any of their facilities in the Monterey area. New Technology Demonstration Program (NTDP) Dean McCauley (FEMP) introduced himself as the new program manager for the NTDPprogram, succeeding Dean DeVine who retired. Mr. McCauley noted the programmission which is to reduce the time required for new technology to get intoFederal purchasing and use. The program looks at products with large potentialenergy savings. The program is based on partnerships in the form of Cooperative Research andDevelopment Agreements. Another program component is the Federal TechnologyAlert (FTA) publications which are essentially "consumer reports" of newtechnologies. Six FTAs have been published and are available on FEMP's internetweb site. In addition, two summary test bed reports have been released. Thereports focus on Seahorse water heater converter (electric-to-natural gas), andYork Triathalon natural gas cooling units. More information on these documentsis available from Karen Walker (PNNL) at 202-646-7794. Mr. Ginsberg asked that members call Mr. McCauley with feedback about NTDP. Agency Reporting of Vehicle Fuel Consumption Bill Rivers (GSA) gave an overview of reporting of gasoline and diesel fuelconsumption in Federal vehicles. He noted that there are two reporting channels- agency reporting to FEMP (Vehicles and Equipment) and the GSA's Federal MotorVehicle Fleet Reports (Vehicles Only). With the expiration of the Federal Property Management Regulations stemmingfrom the Executive Order 12795 10 percent reduction goal for gasoline anddiesel, a decision is needed on continued reporting of the fuels. The TaskForce agreed that continued reporting has value, particularly if a newrequirement is instituted in the future. Rich Wickman (NASA) noted that thereis some confusion regarding reporting for GSA vehicles that are assigned to anagency. Mr. Klimkos said that FEMP has no problem with agency vehicle consumptionreports coming from GSA. Larry Frisbee (GSA) noted that agencies should beinvolved in the reporting of assigned vehicles in the interest of agencymanagement of their assets. John Moresko (Interior) stated that any reductionof reporting burden would be appreciated. Mr. Ginsberg noted thataccountability of agency reporting is valuable, but that FEMP is sensitive toreporting burden. Mr. McGovern (Treasury) stated that he would like to see lawenforcement exemption for any future goals. Mr. Klimkos referred the Task Force to a draft paragraph distributed with theagenda: Although the 10 percent reduction goal for gasoline and diesel fuel (mandated byExecutive Order 12759) ended in FY 1995, DOE will continue to collectconsumption data on these fuels as it has since 1975. To relieve the reportingburden on smaller agencies that consume only gasoline and diesel in passengervehicles, DOE will work the General Services Administration to capture thatconsumption and cost data. Larger agencies, which use gasoline, diesel, andother fuels in vehicles and equipment for passenger transportation and otherpurposes will continue to report consumption and cost data directly to DOE. Inmost cases, these agencies already have reporting systems in place toaccommodate this. Mr. Ginsberg anticipates the possibility of a new goal and returned the issue ofreporting changes to Mr. Klimkos. Mr. Klimkos recommended keeping the samereporting mechanism for FY 1996 and consider a new reporting mechanism for FY1997. The Task Force agreed to continue status quo for one more year. Annual Report Guidance Mr. Klimkos stated that the major revision in the FY 1996 reporting guidancedeals with reporting of gasoline and diesel fuel. He again asked the Task Forceto review the paragraph distributed with the agenda. The guidance will bedistributed to the agencies in mid-to-late June. The FY 1995 draft AnnualReport will be distributed in late June/early July for agency review. Training Update Ted Collins (FEMP) invited the Task Force to attend a Training subcommitteemeeting on June 13th, 10 am to 12 noon, at the DOE Headquarters, Room 2E069. The meeting is being held to discuss declining enrollments for FEMP training andassess FEMP training in light of agencies' current and future needs and budgetenvironments. Later in the meeting Mr. Collins announced that FEMP is reducing training feesfor its workshops from $300 to $150. Outreach and Awards - Communication Plan Tatiana Muessel (FEMP) discussed the progress of the Interagency Five-YearCommunication Plan. Phase One, which identified message, audience, vision, andgoals, has been completed. The second phase will focus on process and products. The plan will feature a two-track approach: 1) target energy managers(implementation) and 2) target employees (energy awareness). Ms. Muessel askedthe Task Force to review the draft plan and provide comments. Ms. Muessel announced the theme for the TeleFEMP IV videoconference: theGreening of Federal Government. The videoconference will be held during EnergyAwareness Month. She also distributed samples of energy awareness computermessages to the group. Disk copies are available from DOE. The next meeting of the communications/outreach working group will be held onJune 11th from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm at DOE. Federal Energy and Water Management Awards Nellie Tibbs noted that, to date, she has received nominations from twoagencies. Ms. Tibbs solicited the Task Force for evaluators. The AwardsCeremony will be November 14, 1996 at the National Press Club. TheCongressional Reception will be tentatively held November 13, 1996 at the HartSenate Office Bldg., Room 902. She noted that the number of people who can benominated as a small group will be limited to 10 or less. Nominations submittedunder the category of small group with 10 or more people will be considered asan organization. Mr. Ginsberg noted a new two-tiered evaluation process will reduce the burden onthe agency evaluators. The local chapter of the Association of Energy Engineerswill screen the nominations. Agency evaluators are needed for June 25th and26th. Evaluators will not review their own agency's nominations. It was notedthat the 656 Committee meeting is also scheduled for June 26th. Procurement Challenge Aimee McKane (LBNL) discussed the status of the Procurement Challenge, beginningwith a review of its policy framework. She distributed a draft agenda for apublic meeting to be held on June 5th at DOE's auditorium. The meeting willfocus on Federal procurement to promote commercialization of energy efficientproducts. Other activities undertaken in the area of procurement include: Development of a Basic Ordering Agreement for energy-efficient, non-CFCchillers Incorporation of the "EE" symbol in the GSA home appliance catalog Outreach activities with State governments, Washington Metropolitan Councilof Governments, and the ACEEE '96, TEEM '96, and WEEC '96 conferences. Electronic Commerce integration 90 percent completion of product recommendations ( in peer review) John Guice, working with DOE Defense Programs, spoke about the Basic OrderingAgreement (BOA) for energy-efficient, non-CFC chillers. This procurementmechanism will be available in August 1996 and will allow for the customizationof the units, and the purchase, set-up, multi-year service, and maintenance. Hedistributed the draft specifications for the BOA to the Task Force. Majoradvantages of the BOA include reduction of engineering and procurement time andthe flexibility to allow for customization of the units. Vic Petrolati (DOE) asked if control systems are part of the BOA. Mr. Guiceresponded that it is available as an option. Mr. Guice gave the Task Force hise-mail address for more information: john.guice@dp.doe.gov. GSA willdisseminate the BOA when it is completed. Renewable Energy Working Group Anne Sprunt Crawley (FEMP) updated the Task Force on the activities of theRenewable Energy Working Group. The Renewable Energy Working GroupImplementation Plan has been approved and signed by the followingagencies: Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, General Services Administration, Department of Health & Human Services, Department of the Interior, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of State, Department of Transportation Department of the Treasury, and Department of Veterans Affairs. Ms. Crawley announced that there is a meeting of the Working Group scheduled forJune 6th, 9 am to 12 noon at the offices of the Solar Energy Industries Councilat 122 C St., NW. The meeting will focus on wind technology. Ms. Crawley isthe contact person (202-586-1505). The Center for Solar Technology and Renewable Resources (CSTRR) at the NevadaTest Site is sponsoring an informational meeting June 24th in Las Vegas, NV. Mr. Ginsberg asked the Task Force to invite their regional representatives toattend. Showcase Buildings Ms. Crawley reported on the Showcase Building Program in Karen Thomas (NREL)absence. She distributed handouts listing the text of the showcase plaques forthe designated showcase buildings. She noted that agencies still haveopportunities to designate new showcases. SAVEnergy Update Ms. Crawley announced that Karen Thomas will take over for Katherine Mayo asdirector of the SAVEnergy audit program. To streamline management of the auditprocess, two FEMP contacts have been designated to receive audit applications. Paul King of the DOE Boston Regional Support Office (617-565-9712) will acceptapplications from facilities east of the Mississippi River. Randy Jones of theDOE Denver Regional Support Office (303-275-4814) will accept applications fromfacilities west of the Mississippi River. The application forms must besubmitted through regional coordinator first. Measurement & Verification Guidelines Brad Gustafson (LBNL) briefed the Task Force on the three main protocols formeasurement and verification of energy savings: North American Energy Measurement and Verification Protocol, the DOE/privateindustry developed overarching guideline. Available through the EnergyEfficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC), 800-363-3732. Federal Energy Management Programs M&V Guidelines, for Federal projects. Available through EREC, 800-363-3732 or can be downloaded fromhttp://www.eren.doe.gov/ femp/new_MVdoc.html. ASHRAE GPC-14P is working on a standard for which information is planned tobe available at http://www.ashrae.org. ESPC Update Tanya Sadler (FEMP) announced the available of the draft Request for Proposalsfor the "Super Energy Savings Performance Contract" to be piloted in the westernstates. The final RFP should be available in 2 to 3 weeks. The contract willhave a 3-year base period with two 3-year option periods. Green Lights Update Gwen Taylor (EPA) briefed the Task Force on the proposed memorandum ofunderstanding between DOE, EPA, and agencies that will allow agencyparticipation in EPA's Green Lights program. The goal of the MOU is to fold inGreen Lights program requirements into Federal energy management activitiescurrently being undertaken by the agencies. There is no increase in reportingrequirements beyond what agencies currently report to DOE and no requirement tore-survey facilities. A similar MOU is also proposed for agency participation in the Energy StarBuildings Program. EPA will make available tools such as Quick Fan and QuickChill software for identifying profitable upgrades and The Scheduler for projectand budget planning. Bill McGovern (Treasury) asked if the MOU is targeted at the Departmental levelor if individual agencies or bureaus under a Department would need to sign on aswell. Ms. Taylor responded that the MOU is intended for the Departmental oragency headquarters level but that a Department could exempt certain bureausfrom the program if necessary. Representatives of the following agencies expressed agreement in principle withthe goals of the Green Lights/Energy Star MOUs and are ready to recommendsigning by their agencies: Department of State Department of the Treasury Department of Transportation Social Security Administration Department of Commerce US Postal Service NASA Budget Issues Mark Ginsberg led a brief discussion of issues surrounding the FY 1997 budget. He noted that Congressman John Kasich has introduced an amendment that wouldeliminate the Department of Energy's budget for energy efficiency and renewableenergy by the year 1999. The House recommends budget levels below those of1996. Interior and Energy and Water subcommittees have also provided guidanceto reduce the budget of DOE EE. FEMP's budget request for core activities is$33 million and $5.7 million for in-house energy management. American Gas Association Issues John Archibald (Deputy Director, FEMP) briefed the Task Force on three issuesraised by the American Gas Association Use of EIA Gas Price Data The computer program, BLCC, used to assist agencies in doing cost evaluations ofenergy projects incorporates EIA projections for natural gas and other energyprices. AGA would prefer that the EIA data was not used but will accept awarning to the users that their best estimate of local rates should besubstituted as a first option with EIA rates used in the absence of local rates. This issue was addressed in a recent issue of the FEMP Focus which madeavailable the latest EIA price projections. In the future, the schedule for therelease of BLCC will be adjusted to cooincide with the release of EIA's latestprojections. Anti-Gas Provision in Code of Federal Regulations CFR now says, under the old requirement for developing General Operations Plans,that Federal agencies energy management plans should promote: ". . .switchingfor petroleum fuels and natural gas to coal and other energy sources. . .and. ..shifting energy use from oil and natural gas to other fuels in more plentifulsupply from domestic sources . . .". FEMP has commenced a rule making toeliminate the requirement for the 10-Year Plans which would eliminate the"anti-gas" statements. Site vs. Source Calculation of BTU Consumption All agencies report progress against legislated and Executive Order energysavings goals based on energy savings measured at the site where the energy isput to use, i.e., at the Federal sites. This differs from the total effect ofenergy saved at the power plant which produced the energy for consumption at theFederal site, i.e., source energy. Currently, source energy use is estimatedbased on average conversion and delivery efficiencies for the electric and steamenergy. It is reported in an appendix to the Annual Report to Congress. In a fuel-switching application where natural gas is substituted for electricenergy, energy savings, measured in BTU per gross square foot, would not occurwhen measured at the site but large savings would occur when measured at thesource. Facilities which are attempting to meet their agency's energy savingsgoals might be discouraged from making the change to gas because it wouldreflect an increase in site energy use rather than energy savings. It ispossible the facility would reject the fuel switch even though there would becost savings to the Government. AGA feels this results in a bias againstnatural gas, limits the options of the energy manager to choose among competingfuels, and denies energy managers the opportunity for large energy cost savings. AGA recommends that energy decisions be made on the basis of cost savings. Mr. Archibald proposes two options for addressing this concern: Increase text emphasis in the Annual Report that discusses the conversion ofsite to source energy and highlight the Federal sector energy reduction usingsource energy. This will increase understanding of Federal sector efforts toachieve energy goals when measured at the source of generation. However, bymeasuring progress toward the goals on a source-measured basis will show anincrease in energy use of 1.4% rather than a reduction of 11.2% when measured atsite. Work with Interagency Energy Management Task Force and 656 Committee toissue a policy statement to achieve cost savings through fuel switching wheneither site energy or source energy decreases. This will allow cost savings tobe achieved without conflicting with energy savings goals. However, this addscomplexity to decisions of thousands of energy managers. Federal Utility Partnership Working Group Louis Harris (FEMP) announced that a Federal Utility Partnership Working Groupmeeting would be held on June 27th and 28th in New York City. He distributedregistration forms to the Task Force. Upcoming Meetings The 656 Committee meeting is scheduled for June 26th from 9 am to 12 noon. DOEis looking into holding it at the Old Executive Office Building. The next Task Force meeting will be held the last week of July or first week ofAugust. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.

Water Conservation Working Group Ms. Katherine Mayo (NREL) summarized the activities of the water conservation working group and stated that she would continue to oversee the group as she transitioned into a new position as Congressional Liaison for NREL. She noted that the working group is involved in ground-breaking initiatives to incorporate water conservation into energy savings performance contracts (ESPC). A Federal Register notice will be published that explains the linkage between water conservation and energy efficiency projects. Guidance on the use of ESPC for water conservation projects will be included in FEMP's training course and how-to manual on ESPC. Ms. Mayo noted that the working group comprises dedicated individuals representing a cross-section of the Federal sector. She also stated that the Department of Defense is making an effort to assure that water management is included in all ESPCs developed for their facilities. A document listing commercial water use estimates is available from the water working group and is attached to this memo of record. Ms. Beth Shearer of the General Services Administration advised the group that GSA distributed water management software to all of the agencies at the "656" committee member level and that Task Force members should track it down and use it. Ms. Mayo added that a computer program called Watergy is now being tested. This program addresses domestic water use, water and energy rates, and estimates the energy cost savings associated with water management projects. Audit Working Group Ms. Mayo also reported on the activities of the audit working group. She explained that in the future the SAVEnergy program would be represented by NREL coordinators in the east and the west, as well as by DOE regional support offices. There will continue to be an NREL representative at the headquarters level. FEMP is currently funding audits for Federal facilities and looking for co-funding for larger auditing projects. Mr. Ginsberg stated that there are 20 professional firms on-board to do audits and noted that interagency agreements are welcome. Requests for SAVEnergy services should be forwarded to the regional SAVEnergy personnel listed below, as they are good facilitators for audits. Nancy Hapstak (Philadelphia RSO) 816-426-5182 Arun Jhaveri (Seattle RSO) 206-553-2152 Randy Jones (Denver RSO) 303-231-5750 Paul King (Boston RSO) 617-565-9712 Bob MacDonald (Chicago RSO) 312-886-8586 Fred Singleton (Atlanta RSO) 404-347-3482 Showcase Program Ms. Patricia Plympton (NREL) provided an overview of the federal energy saver showcase program in the absence of Ms. Karen Thomas (NREL). She gave the Task Force a report on the Federal showcase facilities and indicated that the projects were moving into the outreach and recognition stage. Informational plaques that will explain the program and provide points of contact are being developed for display in the lobbies of showcase participants. Ms. Plympton also distributed a form which showcase managers can use to summarize their facility. Mr. Rich Wickman of NASA asked when the plaques would be available and how they would be distributed. Mr. Ginsberg responded that FEMP was still considering presenting the plaques at a future meeting of the "656" Committee, possibly as early as May. Renewable Working Group (Agencies Response Plan) Ms. Plympton also spoke on behalf of the renewable working group for Ms. Anne Sprunt Crawley (FEMP). The letters requesting "656" Committee endorsement of the renewable working group's Implementation Plan have been mailed. DOE Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin signed the letters to the Committee members. So far, six agencies have signed and returned their letters. The Implementation Plan is intended to give credit to agencies who are already developing and implementing renewable projects and to encourage training in this area and the implementation of renewable energy retrofits. The training schedule was put at the handout table for interested Task Force members. The renewable working group will next meet on Thursday, March 28, 9 am to 12 noon, at the DOE Forrestal Building in Room 7E-069. The focus will be on showcasing renewable projects and will feature presentations by the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of the Interior. Ms. Plympton noted that there was great interest expressed in Federal renewable projects at the recent Solar Energy Technology Conference (SOLTECH), as agency representatives gave presentations about their projects. Ms. Plympton also announced that the first ESPC for a Federal renewable energy project was recently signed. The contract is for the installation of a solar water heating system at a Federal Correctional Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. The system is designed to heat water at a cost that is 15 percent less per unit than traditional water heating systems and the contractor will also provide all operation and maintenance tasks. Ms. Plympton asked Task Force members to contact her if they would like to obtain copies of guidance on ESPC for renewables, which is currently in draft form and should be available soon. Mr. Ginsberg added that the American Solar Energy Society meeting will take place in Asheville, North Carolina April 15-19 and will include a discussion of Federal initiatives. Patricia Plympton has additional information on this conference and she can be reached at 202-651-7540. Mr. Carlos Campos from NASA said his agency is working with NREL on renewable projects. Ms. Plympton added that the Sandia National Lab provides a PV Assistance Service and they are doing great work with their renew the parks, renew the forests, and renew the BLM programs. These are inventory programs to identify renewable projects. Mr. Ginsberg briefly discussed FEMP's use of indefinite quantity contracts for energy savings performance contracting services. FEMP published an announcement in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) on February 21 on the western region indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) draft solicitation for energy savings performance contracts (ESPC) for all Federally owned buildings in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington. The Government anticipates multiple awards to result from this one solicitation. Through delivery orders executed under the IDIQ, fixed-price contract, performance-based energy savings services will be available to Federal agencies with Government-owned facilities within the western region. The concept is that an IDIQ will be issued in a region stating that there are 3 or 4 facilities within that region that would like to implement projects. That indefinite quantity contract can then be expanded to add other projects at the original 3 or 4 facilities, or to add other facilities simply by issuing a delivery order under that IDIQ. The IDIQ's can have agency wide, technology specific, or regional application. Attached with this memorandum of record is a copy of the CBD notice. Mr. Ginsberg discussed the recent establishment of a Solar Enterprise Zone, a nonprofit organization in Nevada, comprising representatives from the Department of Energy, the state of Nevada, Senator Bryan, and members from the private sector. These groups have joined together to promote the sale of solar-generated electricity through the Corporation for Solar Technologies and Renewable Resources (CSTRR). The solicitation has gone out and includes four technologies. Mr. Ginsberg handed out copies of the minutes from the February 29, 1996 meeting of CSTRR. (See Attached) He noted that one of the technologies, a thin film photovoltaic from Amoco/ENRON, had previously been advertised as providing electricity produced by photovoltaics at 5.5 cents per kWh as opposed to 25 cents per kWh (with 3% escalation a year) that will be on-line in 3 to 5 years. CSTRR's role is to assist in the development of a marketplace for the electricity. One advantage of the close proximity of the Nevada Test Site to Hoover Dam is a large concentration of transmission lines serving a wide area including California and Arizona. Mr. Ginsberg stated that he was encouraged about the possibility of having Federal agencies use this power source. Mr. Rick Klimkos added that it is a concept that has been widely accepted by the Secretary of Energy and throughout the Federal government and FEMP would like Task Force members to help identify others who would support this project. Mr. Kevin DeGroat of DynCorp discussed the four technologies proposed for use in the solar enterprise zone. They are: thin film photovoltaics; concentrator photovoltaics; energy mixed with photovoltaics, and solar thermal dish Stirling technology. (See attached) He stated that CSTRR has received proposals and is evaluating them to identify business plans that will be competitive. Mr. DeGroat suggested that more details will be provided to Task Force members as they become available and added that the Western Area Power Administration is planning to issue a Federal Register notice in April to target customers for this power. Mr. Ginsberg noted that there are already many Federal facilities that are served by WAPA, thus providing an immediate customer base. Ms. Plympton noted that some technologies are already in place, such as the Cummings Solar Thermal Dish. Mr. Ginsberg responded that the possibility exists for decentralized application of these technologies. FEMPTracks DatabaseMs. Katie Kroehle (FEMP) updated Task Force members on the status of the FEMPTracks Database project. FEMP continues to add records to the facilities part of the database in an effort to get a full listing which can be used to target good opportunities for projects. She stated that all facilities of more than 25,000 square feet have been entered into the database, but added that the records are based on 1993 data provided by the General Services Administration. Thus far, information for 3,600 facilities has been entered. She advised Task Force members that she has a report form for each agency and its subagencies listing the facility ID (main phone number), facility name, address, total number of buildings, and number of square feet, as well as space for data on the energy manager and phone number. These records are sorted within the agency by square foot size. A form should be completed for each site or group of buildings. Ms. Kroehle requested members to review these reports to verify the data, make corrections and additions, and to fill in the blanks. She offered to accept data in other existing formats, as well, which can then be entered into the FEMPTracks database. This information can be provided to FEMP either in hard copy or electronically. (Enclosed, for individual agencies, is the existing information we have in the FEMPTracks database. Following the guidance in the enclosed transmittal letter from Katie, please review your agencyís data as listed and return to Katie any corrections you have in the envelope enclosed.) Mr. Ginsberg reinforced that there may be data anomalies from the 1993 data due to events such as site closures or agency transfers. For example, Presidio may show up as an Army facility. Mr. Walter Aughenbaugh of the USDA asked how FEMP handled multiple-tenant buildings and Ms. Kroehle responded that those buildings were assigned to the largest tenant. The question was also raised as to whether leased facilities are included in the database. Ms. Shearer (GSA) indicated that only owned facilities should be included in the database as leased facilities change occupancy too frequently. Budget Issues (Budget Status, Budget Briefing Materials, Survey Results) Mr. Ginsberg then began a discussion of the current budget environment and related issues. He noted that some agencies are still without a fiscal year 1996 budget, but that President Clinton has sent forth his proposed budget for FY 1997. Mr. Ginsberg expressed hope that the FY 1997 budget will be not only embraced, but cheered by Congress. The FY 1996 budget contained $18 million for core FEMP programs which is significantly less that the $24 million requested. The Administration's proposed FY 1997 budget includes $31 million for core FEMP programs. Mr. Ginsberg suggested that this increase in funding would allow expansions in the programs and more opportunity for Federal/state partnerships. He also expressed hope for greater initiatives in renewable energy. He added that the budget for the In-house Energy Management Program, which was reduced to zero in FY 1996, has been restored to $5.7 million in the proposed FY 1997 budget. At the last Task Force meeting, Mr. Ginsberg had asked the Task Force to study the implications of Section 625 of Public Law 104-52, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996 and identify issues of concern. The legislation permits each Federal agency, except DoD, to retain 50 percent of: the amount of each utility rebate received by an agency for the implementation of energy and water conservation measures, and the amount of the agencyís share of measured energy savings resulting from ESPCs. The retained amounts will be credited to the agencyís accounts that fund energy and water conservation measures. The remaining 50 percent will be transferred to the General Fund of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year in which it was received. Seventeen of the 18 agencies queried responded to the request and Mr. Klimkos handed out a document summarizing the responses and briefly highlighted some of the general issues. (See Attachment) Among the action items that may come from this survey is the formation of a working group to meet with the Office of Management and Budget to facilitate the development of the Federal Energy Cost Accounting and Management guidance required by EPACT. Mr. Klimkos suggested another area to be further examined is the issue of transferring savings to the Treasury which is problematic in that many agencies reported "no mechanism" to perform such a transfer. Mr. Klimkos will contact Task Force members to address these issues. Mr. Ginsberg distributed a number of budget briefing materials that respond to the request of Task Force members for material to defend their energy management budgets in these changing times. The material is intended to serve as ammunition for internal budget discussions. Items in the package include talking points/factoids, funding or staffing guidance, and published articles. Amongst the articles is an October issue of the Economist and an April issue of Atlantic Monthly. Mr. Ginsberg turned the floor over to the Task Force to learn about the status of other agency budgets. DoD requested $238 million for FY 1996 and received $33 million (proposed $15 million for FY 1997). Ms. Shearer (GSA) noted that they asked for $45 million. They received $20 million and much of that was taken away to fund security enhancements such energy efficient lighting. For FY 1997, GSA is requesting $50 million, but they have been given no indication of how much they will actually receive. Other Items (EPA Programs, GSA Building Fund, Procurement Project) Mr. Ginsberg said FEMP is still considering how Federal agencies can best participate in the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Lights program, but that the approach has not yet been agreed upon. He added that the Task Force may want to reconvene its small group to work on this issue and that interested individuals should contact Rick Klimkos. Mr. Ginsberg provided an update on the Product Procurement Program managed by Mr. Jeff Harris (LBNL) who was unable to attend the meeting. He noted an initiative to establish a state collaborative that was presented at a meeting earlier in the month. Mr. Ginsberg thanked agency representatives for participating in that candid discussion and distributed thank-you notes to several attendees. By-laws were created and are in circulation for comment. Notices will be published in the Federal Register and the Commerce Business Daily to announce a public meeting to seek comments on the process of using energy efficient products. It is anticipated that this will be done in late May with a 30 day comment period. Outreach and Awards (Energy Awards, Success Stories/CD ROM, Customer Successes) Mr. Ginsberg confirmed that the 1996 Criteria and Guidelines for the Federal Energy and Water Management Awards has been distributed and requested that nominations come into FEMP early and often. FEMP is trying to identify a group of individuals to screen the nominations before they are evaluated by an interagency group. The Awards ceremony will be held on November 14th at the National Press Club. A separate room has been arranged at the Press Club for registration to simplify entry. A question was raised by Mr. Richard Wickman (NASA) concerning the handling of a nomination submitted last year under the renewables category. As it turns out, no awards were made in that category. NASA submitted the only nomination in that category and felt that it was a strong candidate. Mr. Ginsberg called on Ms. LaVanna Ortiz (ASI) to clarify this situation. Ms. Ortiz responded that a decision was made last year by the evaluators to fold the renewables into the energy efficiency category, but that the renewable category is included in the 1996 Criteria and Guidelines and that nominations in that category will be evaluated separately and will not compete with nominations in the Energy Efficiency category for 1996 Awards. Ms. Tatiana Strainic Muessel (FEMP) opened discussion on FEMP's Awareness Campaign. She noted that the Energy Efficiency Awareness Tool Kit is ready for distribution and passed out copies to the Task Force members for their preview. The Tool Kit is intended to provide the in-house energy manager with a menu of energy efficiency awareness activities to implement as needed and which can be tied to holidays or special events. The ideas are backed by case studies, factoids, and fact sheets. Another tool in the kit is an electronic on-line message program that provides log-on and log-off reminders of energy efficiency measures. It is designed to change habits and raise awareness. Ms. Muessel noted that this is now being tested by FEMP as a pilot project at DOE. The computer program has been created in standard software formats and includes messages that are action oriented and humorous. Once the pilot program has been completed, FEMP hopes to make them available to all agencies for use throughout the Federal sector. Ms. Muessel reminded Task Force members to contact her for extra buttons and posters and noted that graphics in the Tool Kit are available in camera-ready format that may be easily duplicated. Ms. Muessel announced the date for TeleFEMP III as May 15, 1996 from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time. This teleconference will be produced in conjunction with the National Association of Energy Services Companies (NAESCO) annual meeting. NAESCO and DOE will serve as the uplink sites and the topic will be energy savings performance contracts and utility savings. The title for TeleFEMP III is Saving Billions from Federal Energy Management. Ms. Muessel will hold an Awareness Working Group meeting at DOE on April 3 from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. The topic will be development of a 5-year outreach and communication plan with activities to coincide with the 1998 World Energy Congress. She encourages voluntary participation in this meeting with a goal of raising awareness and increasing outreach. Mr. Ginsberg recommended the book "Lean and Clean Management" written by Joe Romm of DOE that discusses the productivity side of energy efficiency. He also described the new CD-Rom software that provides visual summaries of five success stories. FEMP is producing 1,000 copies of the CD-Rom for distribution. Mr. Ginsberg noted that these five stories are just the beginning and appealed to the Task Force to submit other examples. He also noted that Mr. Jerry Dion of FEMP will be reviewing agency case studies that were done a couple of years ago and contacting agencies to refresh and revamp that information, which has been most useful in providing data for him and others as they testify before Congressional committees. Public Comment Mr. Ginsberg opened the floor to public comment. Ms. Maggie Carson of the Department of Labor asked Ms. Shearer of GSA about the status of the chiller replacement program in light of rumors that Congress has pulled back funding for the program. Ms. Shearer responded that funding has been cut, but that because agencies are legally required to replace CFC chillers, GSA will have to rethink their strategy for carrying out this task. She suggested that agencies may want to work with the regional offices, as they may be developing plans for chiller replacement. Mr. John Moresko said the Federal Energy Saver Showcase list mistakenly listed the Frances Perkins Headquarters Building under the Department of the Interior. Ms. Carson responded that the facility should be listed under the Department of Labor and Ms. Plympton concurred that it would be corrected and noted that some projects may not be in the report yet as they are still in the pipeline to be added. Mr. Klimkos thanked the 17 agencies that have submitted their annual report data and stated that one other agency has submitted partial data and 10 agency reports are delinquent. He encouraged those agencies to get their data in quickly and asked Task Force members to let him know when they would provide the data. Mr. Ginsberg stated that he is working with the Secretary of Energy and Christine Ervin's office to coordinate the next "656" Committee meeting. They are currently considering a date in May. Typically, the Task Force meets a few weeks ahead of that. He asked the Task Force members to consider volunteering their hospitality and space for the next meeting. (The "656" Meeting is now scheduled for May 15th from 9:00AM until Noon. The location is still to be determined. As a result, the Task Force meeting is scheduled for May 2nd. Time and location for the meeting are still TBD.) Ms. Shearer (GSA) gave a sales pitch on the TEEM '96 conference set for September. GSA has invited Secretary O'Leary and Vice President Gore, and is working on an invitation for President Clinton. She also distributed postcards for registering for TEEM '96. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:35 a.m. ATTENDEE LIST Name			Agency			Phone / Fax			E-MailJohn Archibald		DOE/FEMP		202-586-1613 / 3000		Roy Arnold		Interior		202-208-7588 / 3484		RArnold@USBR.GovWalter Aughenbaugh	Agriculture		202-720-2804 / 5019		Carlos Campos		NASA			202-358-1310 / 2861		Campos@HQOPS.HQ.NASA.GovMaggie Carson		Labor			202-219-5205 / 501-6886		MCarson@DOL.Gov                                                ext. 702Telora Dean		Agriculture		202-720-8765 / 3141		Kevin DeGroat		DynCorp			703-461-2067 / 2020		KevinD@DynCorp.ComBernie Denno		USPS			202-268-6014 / 6016		BDenno@email.USPS.GovD.R.

First to report was theaudit working group. Audit Working Group Mr. Rick Klimkos (FEMP) reported on the group's activities in KatherineMayo's (NREL) absence by reading from her notes. Ms. Mayo extended thanks tothe Task Force for responding to two questionnaires, one requestinginformation on potential funding sources at agencies for audits and anotherrequesting suggestions for name changes to clarify the two types of auditsoffered through FEMP's SAVEnergy Audit Program. Potential sources of fundingat agencies for audits were identified as originating generally fromheadquarters accounts, with some regional funding as well as funding fromoperations and maintenance accounts. Utility demand side management programsand other third-party funding sources also show potential. FEMP-fundedaudits are still available, but FEMP intends to market these regionally. Thestrategy is to provide initial audits within a region gratis as an incentiveto get project momentum started. Currently, the two SAVEnergy audits are known as 1) Walk-Through Audits and2) Comprehensive Audits. The group recommends that the term "comprehensive"needs to be included in both names because of its use in Executive Order12902. The proposed names of "Level 1 Comprehensive" and "Level 2Comprehensive" were vetoed due to potential confusion with ASHRAE'ssimilarly-named audits. (The two SAVEnergy audits correspond with ASHRAE'slevels 2 and 3.) The Task Force was asked to reach consensus on thefollowing names: SAVEnergy Comprehensive Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) Studyfor walk-through audits; SAVEnergy Comprehensive Plus Analysis for the audits formerly known ascomprehensive audits. Mr. Ginsberg thought that these names were not intuitive and did not clearlydefine the objectives of each type of audit. The Task Force agreed that thenew names just seem to add more confusion. Millard Carr (DoD) suggested"Comprehensive Audit A" and "Comprehensive Audit B." Mr. Ginsberg asked theAudit Working Group to revisit this issue and suggest other alternativenames. The Task Force was asked to consider whether the names of audited sitesshould be released to Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) that request them. Itwas suggested that a disclosure statement be provided at the time the auditis requested to advise building managers of these types of requests andobtain permission to release information. Jim Woods (Commerce), and BethShearer, General Services Administration (GSA), gave the go ahead for releaseof this information; however, Ms. Shearer would prefer that ESCOs contact theGSA regional energy manager rather than the building manager at the site. Millard Carr, Department of Defense (DoD), noted that the information isavailable through the Freedom of Information Act anyway. Bill McGovern(Treasury) and Rich Wickman (NASA) encouraged the idea, suggesting that ESCOscould help champion projects. Water Conservation Working Group Mr. Klimkos provided an update of the group's activities. The last workinggroup meeting had been cancelled because of furlough and snow, but projectsare moving along. During December, equipment (sinks, toilets, urinals) wasinstalled at the Denver Federal Center. The next meeting of the group isscheduled for Tuesday, February 6, at the National Renewal Energy Laboratory(NREL) offices in Washington, D.C. The meeting will focus on the use ofenergy savings performance contracting for water conservation projects. New Technology Demonstration Program Mr. Ginsberg acknowledged Dave Hunt of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory(PNNL) speaking on behalf of FEMP's New Technologies Demonstration Program. Mr. Hunt announced that the fifth Federal Technology Alert, "Natural Gas FuelCells," has been released. Another Alert scheduled to be released inFebruary is "Cooling Tower Water Ozonation." Anyone who is not already onthe mailing list to receive these publications was asked to contact the FEMPHelp Desk at 1-800-566-2877. PEPCO Update Mr. Steve Keisner of Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) announced theavailability of applications for the annual energy conservation competitionsponsored by PEPCO, Virginia Power, ASHRAE, and others. Any type of energyproject is eligible. He provided a handout and encouraged calls from anyonewith questions. The deadline for submission is February 16th. He noted thatwhile the winner receives a plaque, anyone that applies may participate inlocal recognition activities and use their involvement to inform others intheir agency of their energy conservation initiatives. Karen Thomas (NREL)added that in many cases the utility will help customers complete theapplication. The merger of PEPCO with Baltimore Gas and Electric is proceeding and willmake them the seventh largest utility in the United States. A new name hasbeen chosen, Constellation Energy Corporation, and will be in use by March31, 1997. Renewable Working Group Anne Sprunt Crawley (FEMP) announced that the letters requesting 656Committee endorsement of the Renewable Working Group's Implementation Planwill be mailed within a week. DOE Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin willsign the letters to the Committee members and ask for endorsement by themiddle of February. Copies will be provided to Task Force members. Theworking group will field any questions from the Task Force on this activity. Mr. Ginsberg indicated that the level of agency involvement has been veryhigh on this effort and expressed his appreciation of agencyparticipation. The last meeting of the Working Group concentrated on project case studiesand energy savings performance contracting. Renewable projects have anadvantage under ESPC arrangements in that they generate energy that can bemeasured easily. The Renewable Working Group will next meet on Friday,February 23, 9 am to 12 noon, (location to be announced) and will focus onpassive solar design. Building Commissioning Ms. Crawley discussed the draft guide on building commissioning that has beendeveloped in a joint effort by GSA and DOE. The guide was developed inaccordance with Section 306 of Executive Order 12902. Each member of theTask Force should have received a review copy. Written comments are due byFebruary 21st. Anyone who has not received a copy should contact Ms. Crawleyat 202-586-1505. Ms. Crawley provided an overview of a January 27th workshop on buildingcommissioning. It was well attended by representatives from GSA, DoD, andother agencies. Task Force members interested in receiving copies of theworkshop notebooks should contact the workshop organizer PECI at503-248-4636. Leasing Working Group Dean DeVine (FEMP) provided an update on energy efficiency activities forleased space. He distributed a handout containing 1) current standard clausesin GSA leasing contracts which might effect energy efficiency and 2) a draftclause for inclusion in agency standard contracts. The draft clause allowsany proposer/offeror to include in the base proposal energy efficiencyupgrades to be implemented during the first year of the lease. It alsodirects proposers to contact FEMP to receive the list of energy servicecompanies qualified to perform energy savings performance contracts. Theupgrades could pay for themselves through energy savings. Awareness and Communications Tatiana Strainic Muessel (FEMP) described the Energy Efficiency AwarenessTool Kit that will be distributed to Task Force members by March 1st. TheTool Kit will provide the in-house energy manager with a menu of energyefficiency awareness activities to implement which can be tied to holidays orspecial events. The ideas are backed by case studies, factoids, and factsheets. Another tool in the kit is electronic on-line messages that appearas log-on and log-off reminders of energy efficiency measures designed tochange habits and raise awareness. This year FEMP is planning to host three video conferences. The first willbe held in early May to coincide with the annual meeting of the NationalAssociation of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO). The topic will be ESPCPart II (a follow-up to the April 1995 video conference). Focus will be onupdates to the Final ESPC Rulemaking, the new indefinite quantity contracttypes, and showcase initiatives. The second teleconference will be held inSeptember, the third in November with topics to be determined. Ms. Muessel intends to reactivate the Awareness Working Group and willdistribute information on upcoming meetings and agenda items in the nearfuture. Mr. Ginsberg also discussed FEMP's experimentation with televideocommunication, using cameras mounted on computers to project a caller's imageduring telephone conversations. FEMP wants to use this medium as a forum tobring together regional offices, national laboratories, and others andthereby reduce transportation costs. There is potential use for thistechnology for set-up in the main auditorium perhaps for the TEEM '96conference scheduled by GSA for September. He added that there are someexciting technologies evolving that will facilitate future awareness andcommunication activities. Federal Energy and Water Management Awards Mr. Klimkos outlined the changes to the Awards Criteria Package from lastyear and distributed copies to the Task Force. He asked the group to reviewthe changes and submit comments to him by Tuesday, February 6th. A summaryof the changes follow: Award Categories--Increase size designation from 6 or less to 10 or less forsmall groups, and from 7 or more to 11 or more for organizations. Theincrease would allow full acknowledgment of partners or others vital to theproject. Mr. Woods (Commerce) asked if the definition further delineatesthat organizational awards will primarily emphasize program and policyimplementation as opposed to project development. Mr. Ginsberg noted twoissues that center on the distinction between small groups and organizations: 1) monetary awards (which are no longer authorized) and 2) elimination ofduplicate awards. Mr. Carr suggested that there be no limit on members inthe small group category and that the agencies should decide for themselves. Rich Wickman (NASA) suggested that small groups should be distinguished fromorganizations by the fact that each member is identified by name. Cost-Beneficial Landscape Practices--Further clarification is needed onexamples of cost benefit analysis. Currently nominees may use any method. Period of Eligibility--Notice the new definition of eligible contributors inthe ESPC category. Only contracts awarded in fiscal year 1995 will beeligible. Number of Awards--In a change from last year, up to 10 awards for renewableenergy utilization will be presented. Nomination Procedures--New this year, nominations will be accepted fromprivate sector organizations, such as utilities, energy service companies,and industrial companies and associations. These nominations should besubmitted to FEMP and FEMP will notify the agency's energy coordinator of thenomination. Format for Submissions--Mr. Klimkos asked if the number of nominations allowedfrom each agencies should be reduced from 30 to 15. Ms. Shearer, GSA, votedto keep it at 30 as her agency easily submits 30 nominations a year. Mr.Ginsberg noted that the reason for limiting the number is to distinguish thebest nominations from those received before they are forwarded to DOE forconsideration. It was clarified that nominations submitted by utilities andthe private sector would not be included in the 30 agency count. VicPetrolati, DOE In-house Energy Management (IHEM), suggested that notincluding nominations from utilities in the agency count would essentiallygive those nominations the advantage of not being screened by the agency. The final consensus of the Task Force was to limit each agency to 30nominations, including those received from the private sector. Selection Criteria--A paragraph was added concerning the use of an outsideindependent evaluator to pre-screen applications before the final evaluation. Mr. Ginsberg asked the Task Force for feedback and suggested that a possibleevaluator might be the local chapter of the Association of EnergyEngineers. Deadline for Submission--Feedback was requested on the May 31st deadline. Mr.Carr requested an extension. Mr. Ginsberg expressed the need for adequatetime to evaluate nominations, notify awardees, and make preparations. Heexpects a larger volume of nominations with the next awards cycle theevaluation of which would be more time consuming, but noted the awardsprogram has been moved to November. The task schedule will be reviewedbefore a decision is made but the deadline will not be earlier than May 31st.Mr. Ginsberg reminded everyone that this is an annual event and Mr. Klimkosconfirmed that the changes suggested here do not change the basic format oflast year's nomination. It was suggested that the guidance package could bemade available in electronic format on diskette and/or through theInternet. Mr. Klimkos again noted that all comments on the criteria are due by closeof business Tuesday, February 6th. In the spring, a working group willconvene to develop a form for documenting changes to the awards guidancepackage. Another issue that the working group will consider is the use ofweighting factors. FY97 Budget Issues and Congressional Strategies Mr. Ginsberg noted the change in direction of energy efficiency fundingnecessitates developing themes to defend energy efficiency funding elements. Agencies need to develop viable talking points/factoids to defend energymanagement budgets. These points would serve as ammunition for internalbudget discussions. Examples of these themes are: illustrate how much savings can accrue from a modest investment Federal energy management is sound business practice Government makes a profit with energy management Protects infrastructure Energy management is a Government-wide shared responsibility Environmental and job creation benefits. In an interesting legislative development, Section 625 of Public Law 104-52,the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Actpermits each Federal agency, except DoD, to retain 50 percent of: the amount of each utility rebate received by an agency for theimplementation of energy and water conservation measures, and the amount of the agency's share of measured energy savings resultingfrom ESPCs. The retained amounts will be credited to the agency's accounts that fundenergy and water conservation measures. The remaining 50 percent will betransferred to the General Fund of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal yearin which it was received. Mr. Wickman noted that the language on rebates ishelpful but that the provision may create barriers for energy savingsperformance contracting. Mr. Petrolati stated that it is not very clear howthis provision is to be implemented. Mr. Ginsberg asked the Task Force tostudy the legislation and identify issues of concern. Mr. Ginsberg noted that the Alliance to Save Energy has convened a year-longFederal energy reduction working group to study and support energy efficiencyin the Federal Government. The 40-member Federal Energy ProductivityCommission will support agencies by conducting a solid review of barriers andissues. Procurement Program Update Mr. Jeff Harris (LBNL) provided an update on FEMP's energy efficient productprocurement program. He noted that a major activity this year has been thedevelopment and release of product recommendations. Residential equipmenthas been reviewed. Residential appliances, lighting, and office equipmentare scheduled next for review. Mr. Harris also updated the Task Force on thedevelopment of a Basic Ordering Agreement which will streamline the purchaseof energy-efficient, CFC-free chillers through the GSA schedule format. Mr.Carr requested a one-page summary of the chiller replacement BOA. In the product coding area, GSA's forthcoming appliance catalog willdesignate energy efficient products with an EE symbol. The next meeting of the Procurement Working Group is scheduled formid-February. Measurement and Verification Protocols Brad Gustafson (LBNL/FEMP) discussed the new Federal protocols that giveguidance on verifying and measuring savings for all kinds of energyconservation measures. For the first time, Federal energy managers,procurement officials and private sector energy services providers will havestandard procedures and guidelines for quantifying energy savings from energyefficiency projects. He explained that while procedures existed, a standardapproach was not established before November 1995. The effort began on theheels of the National Energy Measurement and Verification Protocols (NEMVP)which has a broader scope and was developed by a coalition representing AEE,ASHRAE, and others. The Federal protocol was developed in parallel with theNational Energy Monitoring and Verification protocol, assuring consistencyfor companies doing business with both Federal agencies and privatecompanies. Both the FEMP protocol and the National Energy Monitoring and Verificationprotocol are based on three general approaches to assessing savings. Theapproaches, called Options A, B, and C, are designed to cover the spectrum ofproject complexity: Option A--measured capacity/stipulated operation Option B--measured capacity/measured operation (system level) Option C--continuous whole-building measurements or calibrated computermodel simulation Intended for use in Energy Saving Performance Contracting (ESPC) and utilityprogram projects, the protocol provides the methodology for establishingenergy cost savings called for in the ESPC rule. It is meant to provide atool or guidance but is not mandated. Its greatest use is as an educationtool for field personnel about solicitation development and means to evaluateproposals. Mr. Gustafson noted that the document could potentially result inlower interest rates for energy savings performance contracts and thus makemore projects possible. The protocols will be mailed directly to Task Force members in mid-February. Additional copies may be obtained by contacting the FEMP Help Desk. Natural Gas Issues John Archibald (Deputy Director, FEMP) summarized three issues raised by theAmerican Gas Association and proposed recommendations for how they should beaddressed. He asked the Task Force to consider the three issues andrecommendations and provide any feedback. Barring any objection, he proposedsubmitting the issues to the 656 Committee for approval of therecommendations. The three issues are: Site vs. Source Calculation of BTU Consumption All agencies report progress against legislated and Executive order energysavings goals based on energy savings measured at the site where the energyis put to use, i.e., at the Federal sites. This differs from the totaleffect of energy saved at the power plant which produced the energy forconsumption at the Federal site, i.e., source energy. Currently, sourceenergy use is estimated based on average conversion and delivery efficienciesfor the electric and steam energy. It is reported in an appendix to theAnnual Report to Congress. In a fuel-switching application where natural gas is substituted for electricenergy, energy savings, measured in BTU per gross square foot, would notoccur when measured at the site but large savings would occur when measuredat the source. Facilities which are attempting to meet their agency's energysavings goals might be discouraged from making the change to gas because itwould reflect an increase in site energy use rather than energy savings. Itis possible the facility would reject the fuel switch even though there wouldbe cost savings to the Government. AGA feels this results in a bias againstnatural gas, limits the options of the energy manager to choose amongcompeting fuels, and denies energy managers the opportunity for large energycost savings. AGA recommends that energy decisions be made on the basis ofcost savings. Mr. Archibald proposes two options for addressing this concern: 1) Increase text emphasis in the Annual Report that discusses theconversion of site to source energy and highlight the Federal sector energyreduction using source energy. This will increase understanding of Federalsector efforts to achieve energy goals when measured at the source ofgeneration. However, by measuring progress toward the goals on asource-measured basis will show an increase in energy use of 1.4% rather thana reduction of 11.2% when measured at site. 2) Work with Interagency Energy Management Task Force and 656 Committeeto issue a policy statement to achieve cost savings through fuel switchingwhen either site energy or source energy decreases. This will allow costsavings to be achieved without conflicting with energy savings goals.However, this adds complexity to decisions of thousands of energymanagers. Use of EIA Gas Price Data The computer program, BLCC, used to assist agencies in doing cost evaluationsof energy projects incorporates EIA projections for natural gas and otherenergy prices. AGA would prefer that the EIA data was not used but willaccept a warning to the users that their best estimate of local rates shouldbe substituted as a first option with EIA rates used in the absence of localrates. Mr. Archibald recommends: 1) Adding a warning "page" to the BLCC program which advises the userthat the best option is to seek out local rates which can be established withhigh confidence and use those rates. In the absence of those rates, the EIArates will still be provided. 2) Speed up timing of release of diskettes to provide most recent dataas soon as possible. Anti-Gas Provision in Code of Federal Regulations CFR now says, under the old requirement for developing General OperationsPlans, that Federal agencies energy management plans should promote: "...switching for petroleum fuels and natural gas to coal and other energysources...and...shifting energy use from oil and natural gas to otherfuels in more plentiful supply from domestic sources...". The followingrecommendations were proposed: 1) Commence a rule making process to change the CFR to eliminate the"anti-gas" statements. This would bring all Federal agency related ExecutiveOrders and Code of Federal Regulations into closer alignment on promoting, orat least not restricting, natural gas use. 2) Initiate a change to the original law followed by a change to the CFRto eliminate the language. Reimbursable Work Mr. Archibald noted that FEMP has received direction to investigateopportunities for reimbursement for work it performs for other agencies. Tothis end, he asked for Task Force approval to survey approximately 60 peoplefrom across the Government in order to get a handle on what customers wouldbe willing to pay for FEMP services. The 60 people selected to receive theseven-page survey were culled from FEMP's database of recent training programattendees. The three main areas in which FEMP would potentially seekreimbursement would be ESPC support, the SAVEnergy Audits, and training (forwhich fees are already being charged). Other technical assistance areas suchas renewable energy and design assistance might also be consideredreimbursable services. Phil Wirdzek (EPA) suggested that the Task Force members might be used as atrial response for the survey. Mr. Carr suggested that the agencies providenames of actual decision-makers rather than only class participants. Federal Utility Partnerships Lou Harris (FEMP) announced the next meeting of the Federal/UtilityPartnership Working Group will be held on March 6th and 7th in San Diego,California. The Partnership was formed two years ago to facilitate workingarrangements between utilities and Federal agencies. Agenda items willinclude: Washington Policy Update California Update Federal Utility Partnership Resource Centers DoD Update Monitoring and Verification Protocol: Impact on Financing Federal Partnership Resource Centers have been established at 15 utilities. These are: Bonneville Power Administration--John Garrick, (503) 230-5763 Con Ed--John Mitchell, (212) 460-4053 ENTERGY--Vickey Tilley-Moore, (501) 279-6947 Niagara Mohawk--Bill Conboy, (518) 433-5201 PG&E--Jim Loder, (415) 973-2638 PEPCO--Steve Kiesner, (202) 872-2187 Public Service New Mexico--Randy Ortgiesen, (505) 846-8264 Texas Utilities--David Roush, (214) 954-5052 Southern California Edison--Bill Bryan, (909) 394-8502 SCE&G--Bill Eisele, (803) 748-3220 SDG&E--David Rylaarsdam, (619) 654-1135 So Cal Gas--Diane Morrison, (310) 803-7400 Southern Company--Billy Wise, (404) 526-7236 Virginia Power--Kerry Wilson, (804) 771-6039 Western Resources--Scott Shreve, (913) 575- 6504 Training Ted Collins (FEMP) noted that FEMP training catalogs are available throughthe FEMP Help Desk. He also announced a conference titled New Directions inFederal Energy Management will be held as part of Globalcon '96, April 3-4,in Denver Colorado. Annual Report Mr. Klimkos expressed his appreciation for the agency annual reports whichhad already been submitted and asked those agencies which had not yetsubmitted reports to do so as soon as possible. He noted that the FY 1994Report had been signed and is being printed. He expects the ReportingWorking Group to meet sometime in March. 656 Committee Meeting The next 656 Committee meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, March 20, at DOEForrestal, Room 8E-089 (Program Review Center), from 9:00 a.m. to 12 p.m. FEMP will get letters out to the Task Force and the 656 announcing thedates.

Instead of conventional fuels, the technology uses biomass fuels - agricultural residues, or crops grown specifically for energy production - to power electric generators. Biomass is a promising source of fuel for utility-scale, base-load power production. This web site, sponsored by DOE's Biomass Power Program, is your access to complete information on biomass power, ranging from the latest developments and photos of biopower projects for the media to technical reports for scientists to a general explanation of the technology for the average citizen.

As we mention in How it All Works, silicon has a neutral atomic structure with no extra electrons or holes. Silicon is able to bondcovalently using its four valence electrons (electrons on its outer, valance band). On thePeriodic Table, this puts silicon in Group IV along with carbon and germanium. Similarly,Group III of the table contains gallium and Group V contains arsenic (the elements that make upgallium arsenide). Researchers first explored "binary" materials likegallium arsenide when they discovered that these materials had photovoltaic properties. (Thematerials are called "binary" because they contain two elements.) Better yet, they found thatmaterials similar to gallium and arsenic (other materials from the III and V groups) could bealloyed with them to provide great flexibility. For example, in high-efficiency cells, alloys of gallium and aluminum are common, as are alloys of galliumand indium. Likewise, phosphorous is often used in place of arsenic to provide more flexibilityyet.

Sunlight is composed of photons, or particles of solar energy. These photonscontain various amounts of energy corresponding to the different wavelengths of the solarspectrum (see "Light and the Sun" for more about that). When photons strike a PV cell, theymay be reflected or absorbed, or they may pass right through. Only the absorbed photonsgenerate electricity. When this happens, the energy of the photon is transferred to an electron inan atom of the cell (which is actually a semiconductor). With its newfound energy, the electronis able to escape from its normal position associated with that atom to become part of the currentin an electrical circuit. By leaving this position, the electron causes a "hole" to form. Specialelectrical properties of the PV cell--a built-in electric field--provide the voltage needed to drivethe current through an external load (such as a light bulb).

Gallium is a byproduct of the smelting of other metals, notably aluminum andzinc, and it is rarer than gold. Arsenic is not rare, but it is poisonous. Gallium arsenide's use in solarcells has been developing synergistically with its use in light-emitting diodes, lasers, and otheroptoelectronic devices. GaAs is especially suitable for use in multijunction and high-efficiency solarcells for several reasons: 1. The GaAs band gap is 1.43 eV, nearly ideal for single-junctionsolar cells. 2. GaAs has an absorptivity so high it requires a cell only a few microns thick to absorbsunlight. (Crystalline silicon requires a layer 100 microns or more in thickness.) 3. Unlike silicon cells, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat. (Cell temperatures can oftenbe quite high, especially in concentrator applications.) 4. Alloys made from GaAs using aluminum, phosphorus, antimony, or indium havecharacteristics complementary to those of gallium arsenide, allowing great flexibility in celldesign. 5. GaAs is very resistant to radiation damage. This, along with its high efficiency, makes GaAs very desirable for space applications. One of the greatest advantages of gallium arsenide and its alloys as PV cell materials is the widerange of design options possible. A cell with a GaAs base can have several layers of slightlydifferent compositions that allow a cell designer to precisely control the generation andcollection of electrons and holes. (To accomplish the same thing, silicon cells have been limitedto variations in the level of doping.) This degree of control allows cell designers to pushefficiencies closer and closer to theoretical levels. For example, one of the most common GaAscell structures uses a very thin window layer of aluminum gallium arsenide. This thin layerallows electrons and holes to be created close to the electric field at thejunction. More . . .

In a single-junction PV cell, only photons whoseenergy is equal to or greater than the band gap of the cell materialcan free an electron for an electric circuit. In other words, the photovoltaic response of single-junction cells is limited to the portion of the sun's spectrum whoseenergy is above the band gap of the absorbing material, and lower-energy photons are not used. One way to get around this limitation is to use two (or more) different cells, with more than oneband gap and more than one junction, to generate a voltage. These are referred to as"multijunction" cells (also called "cascade" or "tandem" cells). Multijunction devices canachieve a higher total conversion efficiency because they can convert more of the energyspectrum of light to electricity. A multijunction device is a stack of individual single-junction cells in descending order of band gap (Eg). The top cell captures the high-energy photons and passes the rest of the photons on to be absorbed by lower-band-gap cells. More . . .

Weperform the R&D in three primary areas: thin films, crystalline silicon, and advanced, high-efficiency concepts. Thin Films Our researchers investigate four thin-film materials—amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride,copper indium diselenide, and thin-layer crystalline silicon—because of their potential for lowcost and high performance. As part of this, we have established a major new initiative: the Thin Film PV Partnership. Under the partnership, we have awarded cost-shared contracts to nineindustry technology partners and about 20 university R&D partners to develop prototypeproducts based on the four thin-film materials.

More specifically, PV Program managers inDOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and in the national laboratories, develop comprehensive operating plans based on strategic, multiyear plans thatrespond to the broad policies for energy R&D determined by the executive and legislativebranches of the federal government. Through sound management practices and continual fine-tuning, program managers ensure thatthe budget allocations, direction, and individual elements of the National Photovoltaics Programmeet the objectives of the nation and stay on target. Individual project and research managers atthe national laboratories and DOE's field offices administer both in-house research and cost-shared R&D contracts with the private sector. Federal funding for the PV Program was $60million in fiscal year 1996. Industrial partners typically cost-share the contract research efforts50-50 in the program. In addition, private-sector investments in developing manufacturingfacilities exceed the government investment in R&D by a factor of 2 or more.

Thebulk of program research and development is currently conducted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia). In addition, Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, supports theprogram in environmental, safety, and health research. Engineers and researchers help develop advanced devices and modules, new PV materials andmaterial combinations, more-efficient fabrication and manufacturing processes, better moduleencapsulants, more sophisticated concentrators and sun-tracking equipment, and automatedmanufacturing systems. They also help improve PV system designs and refine balance-of-systemcomponents, including support structures, power-processing and control equipment, electronics,monitoring equipment, and storage technologies. Specialists work with national and international organizations to establish uniform standards andtest methods. Rigorous testing ensures that the electrical, mechanical, and safety aspects of PVsystems are sound. Analytic studies—including the results of environmental, resource, andmarket assessments—have an important impact on current and future R&D activities. But the laboratories also serve as incubators for new ideas. Because most companies cannotafford large R&D laboratories, the national laboratories provide long-term, high-risk, high-payoff R&D, which is essential to investing in the nation's future—toward clean, sustainable,affordable electricity.

It determines the Earth's surface temperature andsupplies virtually all the energy that drives natural global systems and cycles. Although someother stars are enormous sources of energy in the form of X-rays and radio signals, our sunreleases 95% of its energy as visible light. Yet, visible light represents only a fraction of the totalradiation spectrum; infrared and ultraviolet rays are also significant parts of the solar spectrum. The sun emits virtually all of its radiation energy in a spectrumof wavelengths that range from about 2x10-7 to 4x10-6 m. The majority of this energy is inthe visible region. Each wavelength corresponds to a frequency and an energy; the shorter thewavelength, the higher the frequency and the greater the energy (expressed in eV, or electronvolts). Each portion of the solar spectrum is associated with a different level of energy. Within thevisible portion of the spectrum, for example, red light is at the low-energy end and violet light isat the high-energy end (having half again as much energy as red light). In the invisible portionsof the spectrum, photons in the ultraviolet region, which cause the skin to tan, have more energythan those in the visible region. Likewise, photons in the infrared region, which we feel as heat,have less energy than the photons in the visible region. More . . .

The "p" and "n" types of semiconductors correspond to "positive" and "negative"because of their abundance of holes or electrons (the extra electrons make an "n" type becausean electron actually has a negative charge). Although both materials are electrically neutral, n-type siliconhas excess electrons and p-type silicon has excess holes. Sandwiching these together creates ap/n junction at their interface, thereby creating an electric field. When the p-type and n-type semiconductors are sandwiched together, the excess electrons in then-type material flow to the p-type, and the holes thereby vacated during this process flow to then-type. (The concept of a hole moving is somewhat like looking at a bubble in a liquid. Although it's the liquid that is actually moving, it's easier to describe the motion of the bubble asit moves in the opposite direction.) Through this electron and hole flow, the two semiconductorsact as a battery, creating an electric field at the surface where they meet (known as the"junction"). It's this field that causes the electrons to jump from the semiconductor out towardthe surface and make them available for the electrical circuit. At this same time, the holes movein the opposite direction, toward the positive surface, where they await incoming electrons. More . . .

At only 19, Becquerel found thatcertain materials would produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to light. The effect was first studied in solids, such as selenium, by Heinrich Hertz in the 1870s. Soon afterward, selenium PV cells were converting light to electricity at 1% to 2% efficiency. As a result, selenium was quickly adopted in the emerging field of photography for use in light-measuring devices. Major steps toward commercializing PV were taken in the 1940s and early 1950s, when the Czochralski process was developed for producing highly pure crystalline silicon. In 1954, scientists at Bell Laboratories depended on the Czochralski process to develop the first crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell, which had an efficiency of 4%. This PV panel, developed by TRW for a communications satellite in 1966, was typical for its day. More . . .

An individual PV cell typically produces between1 and 2 watts, hardly enough power for the great majority of applications. But we can increase thepower by connecting cells together to form larger units called modules. Modules, in turn, can beconnected to form even larger units known as arrays, which can be interconnected for morepower, and so on. In this way, we can build a PV system to meet almost any power need, nomatter how small or great. Modules or arrays, by themselves, do not constitute a PV system. We must also have structureson which to put them and point them toward the sun, and components that take the direct-current(dc) electricity produced by the modules or arrays and condition the electricity so it can be usedin the specific application. These structures and components are referred to as the balance of system (BOS). The basic photovoltaic cell typically produces only a smallamount of power. To produce more power, cells can be interconnected to form modules, whichcan in turn be connected into arrays to produce yet more power. Because of this modularity, PVsystems may be designed to meet any electrical requirement, no matter how large or how small. More . . .

One option is to employconcentrating optics, which gather sunlight with lenses, thereby increasing the intensity ofsunlight striking the PV cell. (This is similar to using a magnifying glass.) A typical basic concentrator unit consists of a lens to focus thelight, a cell assembly, a housing element, a secondary concentrator to reflect off-center light raysonto the cell, a mechanism to dissipate excess heat produced by concentrated sunlight, andvarious contacts and adhesives. Notice that the module depicted uses 12 cell units in a 2x6matrix. These basic units may be combined in any configuration to produce the desired module. The primary reason for using concentration is to decrease the area of solar cell material beingused in a system; solar cells are the most expensive components of a PV system, on a per-areabasis. A concentrator uses relatively inexpensive materials (plastic lenses, metal housings, etc.)to capture a large area of solar energy and focus it onto a small area, where the solar cell resides. One measure of the effectiveness of this approach is the concentration ratio (how muchconcentration the cell is receiving). More . . .

On one side, we havethe PV devices (cells, modules, arrays, etc.) that convert sunlight into direct-current (dc)electricity. On the other side, we have the load, or the application for which the PV electricity isintended. Between these, we need a third subsystem to enable the PV electricity to be properlyapplied to the load. This third subsystem is generally referred to as the "balance of system" orBOS. This simple illustration shows theelements required to get the power created by the PV system to the end load (in this example ahouse). The stand-alone system (a) uses battery storage to provide dependable dc electricity dayand night. Even for a home connected to the utility grid (b), PV can produce electricity duringthe day (converted to ac through the power conditioner). This configuration is desirable becauseextra electricity can be sold to the utility during the day, and the utility can in turn provideelectricity at night or during poor weather. See this in action. The BOS typically consists of structures for mounting the PV arrays or modulesand the power-conditioning equipment that adjusts and converts the dc electricity to the proper formand magnitude required by an alternating-current (ac) load.

This level ofenergy, known as the band-gap energy, is defined as the amount of energy required to dislodge anelectron from its convalent bond and allow it to become part of an electrical circuit. Theenergy that photons possess is called the "photon energy." This energy must be at least as highas the band-gap energy for a photon to free an electron. However, photons with energy higherthan the band-gap energy will expend the extra energy as heat when freeing the electrons. So,it's important for a PV cell to be "tuned" (through slight modifications to the semiconductor'smolecular structure) to maximize the photon energy. After all, one key to obtaining an efficient PV cell is to convert as much sunlight into electricity as possible. Effective PV semiconductors have band-gap energies ranging from 1.0 to 1.6 electron-volts(eV). (An electron-volt is equal to the energy an electron acquires when it passes through apotential of 1 volt in a vacuum.) That's because this level of energy is good for freeingelectrons without causing extra heat. For example, crystalline silicon's band-gap energy is 1.1eV. The photon energy of light, also measured in eV, varies according to the different wavelengthsof light. The entire spectrum of sunlight, from infrared to ultraviolet, covers a range of about 0.5eV to about 2.9 eV. For example, red light has an energy of about 1.7 eV, and blue light has anenergy of about 2.7 eV. About55% of the energy of sunlight cannot be used by most PV cells because this energy is eitherbelow the band gap or carries excess energy. Different PV materials have different characteristic energy bandgaps. Photons with energy greater than the band gap may be absorbed to create free electrons. Photons with energy less than the band gap pass through the material or create heat.

However, to be useful in solar cells, it must be refined to 99.9999% purity. In single-crystal silicon, the molecular structure of the material is uniform because the entirestructure is grown from the same or a "single" crystal. This uniformity is ideal for efficientlytransferring electrons through the material. To make an effective PV cell, silicon is "doped" to makeit n-type and p-type. Semicrystalline silicon, on the other hand, consistsof several smaller crystals or "grains," which introduce "boundaries." Theseboundaries impede the flow of electrons and encourage them to recombine with holes and thereby reduce the power output of the cell.

This is very important when discussing PV devices, because improving thisefficiency is vital to making PV energy competitive with more traditional sources of energy(e.g., fossil fuels). Naturally, if one efficient solar panel can provide as much energy as twoless-efficient panels, then the cost of that energy (not to mention the space required) will bereduced. For comparison, the earliest PV devices converted about 1%-2% of sunlight energyinto electric energy. Today's PV devices convert 7%-17% of light energy into electric energy. Of course, the other side of the equation is the money it costs to manufacture the PV devices. This has been improved over the years as well. In fact, today's PV systems produce electricity ata fraction of the cost of early PV systems.

It wasn't until 1974 that researchers began to realize that amorphous silicon could be used in PVdevices by properly controlling the conditions under which it was deposited and by carefullymodifying its composition. Today, amorphous silicon is commonly used for solar-poweredconsumer devices that have low power requirements (e.g., wrist watches and calculators). Amorphous silicon absorbs solar radiation 40 times more efficiently than does single-crystalsilicon, so a film only about 1 micron (one one-millionth of a meter) thick can absorb 90% of theusable solar energy. This is one of the most important factors affecting its potential for low cost. Other principal economic advantages are that amorphous silicon can be produced at a lowertemperature and can be deposited on low-cost substrates. These characteristics make amorphoussilicon the leading thin-film PV material.

Polycrystalline thin-film devices requirevery little semiconductor material and have the added advantage of being easy to manufacture. Rather than growing, slicing, and treating a crystalline ingot (required for single-crystalsilicon), we sequentially deposit thin layers ofthe required materials. Several different deposition techniques are available, and all of them arepotentially cheaper than the ingot-growth techniques required for crystalline silicon. Best of all,these deposition processes can be scaled up easily so that the same technique used to make a2-inch x 2-inch laboratory cell can be used to make a 2-foot x 5-foot module (in a sense, a hugecell!). Like amorphous silicon, the layers can be deposited on various low-cost substrates(actually "superstrates," see Transparent Conductors) likeglass or plastic in virtually any shape--even flexible plastic sheets. Single-crystal cells have to be individually interconnected into a module, but thin-film devicescan be made monolithically (as a single unit).

The back contact of a cell (away from the sun) is relatively simple and usually consists of a layer of aluminum or molybdenum metal. But the front contact (facing the sun) is more complicated. When placed in sunlight, the cell generates current (flowingelectrons) all over its surface. Attaching contacts just at the edges of a cell would not be adequatebecause of the excessive electrical resistance of the top layer in this configuration (only a smallportion of the electrons would make it into the contact). So, the contacts must be made across the entire surface to collect the most current. This is normally done with a metal "grid." Unfortunately, placing a large grid on the top of the cell shades the active parts of the cell from the sun, effectivelyreducing the cell's conversion efficiency. Therefore, in designing grid contacts, we must balance electrical resistance losses against shadingeffects. The usual approach is to design grids with many thin, conductive fingers spreading to everypart of the cell's surface. The fingers of the grid must be thick enough to conduct well (with lowresistance), but thin enough to block a minimum of incoming light. Such a grid keeps resistance lossessufficiently low, while shading only about 3% to 5% of the surface. More . . .

Sunlight then falls first on the material with the largestband gap, and the highest-energy photons are absorbed. Photons not absorbed in the first cellcontinue on to the second cell, which absorbs the higher-energy portion of the remaining solarradiation while remaining transparent to the lower-energy photons. Much of today's research in multijunction cells focuses on gallium arsenideas one (or all) of the component cells. Such cells have reached efficiencies of around 35% underconcentrated sunlight. Other materials studied for multijunctiondevices have been amorphous silicon and copper indiumdiselenide. This multijunction device uses a top cell of gallium indium phosphide, "a tunnel junction," to aid the flow of electronsbetween the cells, and a bottom cell of gallium arsenide.

This transition to first-time manufacturing is a period of extreme technical and financial risk. Moreover, for thin-film products to reach their low-cost potential, additional research is needed to develop materials and processes yielding devices with higher efficiencies, more uniform performance over the entire surface area of modules, and lower production costs. This grid-connected, 10-kilowatt cadmium telluride array was deployed by Solar Cells, Inc. (SCI). SCI developed the technology under a cost-shared partnership with the program. But high-technology research is expensive, and the short-term payoff is uncertain for today's PV companies. Therefore, DOE support remains crucial. By combining the talents of scientists performing fundamental research with engineers developing prototype modules, we can help ensure that a continuous stream of advanced thin-film technology is incorporated into future manufacturing facilities. In 1995, under the Thin Film PV Partnership program, DOE awarded major contracts to nine industrial partners and about 20 research partners in universities. Through the year 2000, each of the partners will contribute 10% to 50% of the value of these contracts. University researchers, including those at the DOE PV Center of Excellence at the Institute of Energy Conversion (University of Delaware), play key roles in this work. These collaborations will develop prototype products largely based on amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper indium diselenide, and thin-layer crystalline silicon technologies. Amorphous Silicon The first thin-film amorphous silicon devices made in 1974 had efficiencies of less than 1%. By 1994, a small, experimental module recorded a stabilized efficiency of 10.2%. Although amorphous silicon materials have lower efficiencies than does crystalline silicon, they have the potential to be less expensive to manufacture. Today, more than 15% of cells and modules produced worldwide are amorphous silicon. Most products using amorphous silicon are low-power consumer items like solar watches and calculators. Higher-power applications will demand amorphous silicon products with higher stabilized efficiencies so that more energy can be extracted from a given module area. Our research goal during the coming years is to raise efficiencies for our best laboratory cells from today's 10% to 13%. Key to the process is transferring to industry any techniques we perfect in the laboratory. To increase the efficiency of amorphous silicon, more than 40 researchers nationwide are working under the Thin Film PV Partnership program. These research teams are addressing a dozen issues surrounding the design and fabrication of multijunction amorphous silicon alloy cells. For example, one team is optimizing back reflectors that direct unused sunlight back up through the thin layers of a multijunction cell. Another team is modeling the effects of using various combinations of alloys and thicknesses in the multijunction layers and is investigating new structures. Other teams are improving the output from the individual component cells in the multijunction device. Current progress and goals for efficiencies of the best stable amorphous silicon cells and modules. In addition, researchers are developing ways to process amorphous silicon material to improve its stabilized efficiency. The most promising approach to date is hot-wire deposition. The extremely hot (2000°C) temperatures of the wire cause the feed gases to dissociate, and the active radicals are deposited at rates up to 10 times higher than those of the glow-discharge method used in industry today. The resulting material contains less hydrogen, the agent suspected as the cause of amorphous silicon's instability. Tests in early 1995 indicated that material created using the hot-wire method is much more stable than conventional amorphous silicon; later tests showed that efficiency can approach the state of the art. Future work will investigate the viability of this alternative approach to replace existing processes in industry. Hot-wire deposition promises to improve the efficiency and stability of amorphous silicon devices. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) By 2000, working with industry on device design and material deposition techniques, we aim to improve the stabilized efficiency of laboratory amorphous silicon devices. Moreover, we expect that our research results will be quickly transferred to the production line because there is a mature manufacturing base for amorphous silicon. The progress of amorphous silicon, from technical conception through manufacturing maturity and ongoing technical progress, has been a triumph of past DOE partnerships with industry. We expect the future to yield the fruits of such a combined approach. Cadmium Telluride We are exploring cadmium telluride because the techniques used to manufacture devices from this material (including electrodeposition, spraying, and high-rate evaporation) can be very low-cost. The technology also promises high efficiencies; small laboratory cells have reached nearly 16%, although commercial module efficiencies hover around 6%. Golden Photon and Solar Cells, Inc., are preparing to bring prototype products to market that should compete with established products made from crystalline silicon. Improving module efficiencies is challenging because, despite our progress, our fundamental understanding of the properties of cadmium telluride is limited. For example, some modules have exhibited stable performance for 6 years outdoors, while others have shown significant declines in efficiency in a matter of days. We have yet to characterize the mechanisms of this uncertain stability. In addition, researchers often achieve high cell efficiencies using approaches that are far from being available to manufacturers. For example, high-quality 7059 glass is used for the best cells, but the glass is too expensive to be used in mass production (where soda lime glass is used). Also, the high efficiencies of small-area cells are due in part to the deposition of very thin layers of cadmium sulfide. No one has learned how to deposit such a thin layer in a module-scale device, and a thicker layer reduces efficiency by about 25%. Current progress and goals for efficiencies of the best cadmium telluride cells and modules. To meet challenges like these, 25 researchers nationwide are working in teams under the Thin Film PV Partnership program. One team is studying instability in cadmium telluride materials and devices to learn how to design and build stable modules. Another team is working to adapt laboratory cell-fabrication techniques for large-scale production. These efforts should help the PV R&D community realize the potential of cadmium telluride cells for high-efficiency power modules. Scientists are using close-spaced sublimation to make and study high-efficiency cadmium telluride devices. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) Copper Indium Diselenide In 1996, researchers pushed the efficiency for devices based on copper indium diselenide to 17.7%, the highest efficiency recorded for any thin-film cell. A prototype power module has been measured at 10.2%. And copper indium diselenide is the only thin-film material with several years of outdoor exposure that shows no deterioration in performance. Yet, in 1995 there were no commercial products based on this material and its alloys. Copper indium diselenide is not yet commercial because significant further research is needed to understand the manufacturing processes. Fabricating high-quality films requires making a copper-rich layer and a copper-poor surface layer to form a junction with other alloys. Researchers studying this technology have difficulty avoiding defects that prevent the formation of uniform layers. However, they do know that using proper temperatures and correctly timing the process steps are critical to achieving quality results. Current progress and goals for efficiencies of the best copper indium diselenide cells and modules. To reach the goal of manufacturing commercial copper indium diselenide products, 40 researchers nationwide are working to devise simpler, more-effective fabrication methods as part of the Thin Film PV Partnership program. Basic to this activity is a better understanding of the chemical and physical properties of this material. Researchers in the program have learned much about how the various elements and compounds combine to form quality copper indium diselenide. And, the more we understand about temperature, phase-change reactions, and which steps can precede others, the better we can simplify the process for adaptation to industry. The world record for a copper indium diselenide solar cell was achieved under the national PV program. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) Thin-Layer Crystalline Silicon Although crystalline silicon absorbs sunlight about 10 to 100 times less effectively than other thin films, thin-layer crystalline silicon cells can be more efficient than those made of other thin-film materials if properly constructed to trap light. The advantage to using silicon is that it is familiar and well-studied. So far, researchers have deposited relatively thick layers of crystalline silicon on low-cost substrates. Future work will focus on thinning the material to less than 50 micrometers, while developing optimal substrate, light-trapping, and interconnection schemes.

With its relatively high efficiency and stability, competitive cost, and proven trackrecord, it plays a dominant role in both domestic and international markets. In 1994,modules made of crystalline and multicrystalline silicon accounted for about 95% of allthe modules sold by U.S. PV manufacturers. Today's crystalline silicon devices are more efficient than ever before.Laboratory cells made from single-crystal silicon have measured efficiencies as high as 24%. Research on manufacturing improvements has pushed theefficiencies of multicrystalline devices to nearly 18% for laboratory cells and over 15%for prototype modules. Commercial modules of 14% efficiency are made in massproduction. Current progress and goals for efficiencies of the best single-crystalsilicon cells and modules. Our research focuses on reducing the cost of electricity from commercial flat-platemodules by increasing the efficiency of low-cost materials. The low-cost silicon used byindustry has lower efficiencies than that of the pure silicon used in the laboratory.Defects and impurities in the material interfere with photo-electric conversion and thetransmission of electrons within the cells and modules. Armed with an understanding ofthe microscopic and atomic processes at work, researchers are working with industry todevise techniques of material growth and device processing that circumvent orcompensate for these impurities and defects. A commercialized NREL invention uses laser beam-induced-current maps to analyze silicon materials. We are also working with industry to push the efficiency limits of pure silicon-baseddevices. The emitter-wrap-through cell, for example, employs both positive and negativeelectrical contacts on the cell's back surface. This technology could reducemanufacturing costs and prevent current losses due to shading by metallic grids. Increasing the efficiency of crystalline materials through improved processing is a majorgoal of the PV Program's Crystalline Silicon Research Cooperative, whose partnersinclude six U.S. manufacturers and the national laboratories.Researchers at NREL and Sandia characterize materials prepared by industry to help them assess changes in manufacturing processes. Universityresearchers, including those at the DOE PV Center of Excellence at Georgia Institute ofTechnology, also play a key role in this work.

Today, balance-of-system (BOS) components represent about half the cost of a PV system, but they are responsible for 99% of system repair problems. Another problem is that about 15% of the electricity generated by PV modules is lost during conversion and transmission through BOS components. BOS components include charge controllers, batteries, control systems, mounting hardware, tracking systems, wiring, and power-conditioning hardware such as inverters. Failures of inverters, which convert the direct current (dc) from PV modules to alternating current (ac), are the number-one cause of PV system problems. Recent tests at Sandia's Power Processing Laboratory have shown that most of today's inverters exceed accepted levels of acoustic noise and radio-frequency interference (RFI). Cooperative R&D contracts support the development of quieter, more reliable inverters that can be mass-produced for the PV industry. We also plan to test and improve trackers, control units, charge controllers, and batteries. This Sandia technician is evaluating a state-of-the-art, 300-kilowatt inverter. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) Through this work, we expect to bring down the cost of BOS components and improve their performance. Many of today's systems are one-of-a-kind; they incur very high costs for design and installation, which should be reduced when the systems are mass-produced. Also, few designs for mechanical or electronic BOS components have been optimized for PV systems. So, their cost and performance should improve as system designs improve. Rapid advances in power electronics for a variety of applications will also improve the performance and reduce the cost of entire PV systems. Our goals are to keep the cost of BOS components to less than 50% of the total PV system cost, improve their reliability, and increase their efficiency. For inverters, we intend to increase their efficiency to 98% and the mean time between failures to at least 5 years. ("Mean time between failures" refers to the average amount of time that passes between equipment failures.) Current progress and goals for inverters in terms of efficiency (%) and mean time between failures (yr). For more details on our BOS projects, see technical briefs prepared by the PV Systems Assistance Center at Sandia National Laboratories.

These technologies include gallium arsenide, with a measured single-junction efficiency greater than 25% at one sun (no concentration) and nearly 28% under concentrated sunlight. Multijunction cells based on gallium arsenide and related III-V alloys have even achieved conversion efficiencies greater than 30%. We expect to exceed 32% efficiency using these devices in concentrator systems. Industry work in this area is driven by space markets today. High-efficiency device research improves our understanding of the electronic processes in PV devices so that we can better control the factors that cause efficiency losses. Improvements in basic science resulting from this work are often applicable to all other technology areas. For example, these materials may result in very high efficiency thin films (greater than 25%). Continued support for cutting-edge science through universities, research centers, national laboratories, and industry is an important aspect of the program. NREL researchers use metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) to make experimental high-efficiency devices like those based on gallium arsenide.

The first 8 companies to receive PVMaT subcontracts reduced module manufacturing costs by 50% or more and are expected to carve another factor of 2 from manufacturing costs by 1997. Participating companies also increased their combined manufacturing capacity from about 12 megawatts (MW) per year to about 35 MW. Three companies successfully introduced new product lines with lower costs and improved performance. Further cost reductions are necessary to expand PV markets, so the next 5 years of R&D are vitally important to the industry. We intend to achieve cost reductions by reducing manufacturing costs, modifying laboratory techniques for production, optimizing PV products, and testing product performance. Reducing Manufacturing Costs Manufacturing costs depend on many factors of production, and research is under way to optimize several of them. An important factor is throughput—the rate at which PV materials or devices are passed through the processes of material deposition, preparation, encapsulation, and connection to electrical components. Examples of measures taken under PVMaT to increase throughput include automating the assembly process, reducing the number of steps in a process, and moving from batch processing to continuous processing. Another important cost factor involves material. We are exploring ways to get more from relatively costly materials through thinner device designs and more precise fabrication methods that produce less waste. Under PVMaT, Spire Corporation developed a fully automated solar-cell assembler. The equipment reduces manufacturing cost by using silicon more efficiently, thereby providing higher product yields, and by improving process control, increasing processing rates, and providing flexible automation. (Photo: Spire) Modifying Laboratory Techniques for Production The high-efficiency materials developed in the laboratory must eventually be manufactured in quantity on the production line. Therefore, we develop and test ways to control parameters like temperature and pressure for processes on large batches of material. We also develop alternatives to costly laboratory techniques, which are often not possible to duplicate in a manufacturing environment. And, we explore ways to ensure the manufacturability of promising materials whose composition changes when manufactured in quantity. Under PVMaT, ASE Americas, Inc. (ASE) is focussing on advancing its manufacturing technology by reducing the manufacturing costs of edge-defined, film-fed growth (EFG) wafers, cells, and modules. The objective is to lower manufacturing costs by 25%. (Photo: ASE Americas) Optimizing PV Products While continuing work on PV processes and materials, PVMaT also addresses refinements of the entire PV product. Manufacturers and systems developers conduct R&D to integrate PV system components for optimal performance, reliability, and lifetime. They simplify systems and select the most durable components. And they work to improve BOS components such as inverters, batteries, and control systems. Testing Product Performance Documenting what works and what doesn't is crucial for improving PV products and processes. Typically,therefore, when a manufacturer produces a new or prototype product, it sends the product to NREL or Sandia, where researchers verify the product's performance, document the results, and send the information back to the manufacturer. For more information about PVMaT, see NREL's PVMaT project.

This researcher is using a hail tester to determine the ability of a PV module to withstand the impact of hail stones. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) Issues arise among manufacturers that cooperative research can readily address. For example, certain encapsulants used to seal PV modules discolor after several years in the field. So, we sponsored work to measure the degree of discoloration and its effects on performance, and researchers developed more durable encapsulants. As we explore new technologies and manufacturing techniques, researchers address issues of module performance and durability by testing thin-film modules, developing accelerated tests to predict the factors affecting the 30-year outdoor life of modules, measuring electrical performance characteristics, and analyzing failures.

Testing and Validation The program makes its facilities available to industry to evaluate the material, mechanical,electrical, and safety characteristics of PV cells, modules, BOS components, and completesystems. By providing U.S. PV manufacturers with laboratory assistance in the form of tests,measurements, and characterizations, program scientists and engineers can help these typicallysmall companies accelerate product improvements. By testing and evaluating prototype andprecommercial modules, the program helps industry understand and improve the performance,reliability, and operational characteristics of its products. Toward this end, scientists at theOutdoor Test Facility at NREL correlate the measured solar resource, airtemperature, humidity, and wind with the electrical performance of modules. The laboratoriesand their contractors have also organized an extensive network to evaluate the field performanceof systems, which is critical for understanding and improving hardware performance andreliability. Researchers at the Outdoor Test Facility study the performance of PV modulesunder actual operating conditions. (Photo: W. Gretz, NREL) Codes and Standards To be accepted in potential markets, PV systems must conform to national and internationalstandards of safety and reliability—such standards as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and theNational Electrical Code (NEC). Many of these codes, however, do not currently address PVsystems directly. So, we are working closely with industry in standards groups to ensure thatthere are appropriate requirements for commercial PV systems. Program personnel also workwith manufacturers to help get their products approved by such organizations. Many potentialconsumers are also interested in standard reporting of expected energy production, similar to theannual-energy-use stickers now on major appliances. The program also contributes its facilitiesand expertise to develop such standard reporting methods.

By 1995, the group contained 89 member utilitiesthat produce almost half of the electricity consumed in the United States. The program providesfinancial and technical support to the group to test PV systems in domestic utility applications. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) installed this 210-kW systemat its Hedge Substation. (Photo: SMUD) Photovoltaics for Utility-Scale Applications (PVUSA) Under this project, we study and validate utility-scale applications. We installed and continue tosupport the world's first transmission and distribution system powered by PV at the PVUSA testsite in California. Building Opportunities in the United States for Photovoltaics (PV:BONUS) Buildings use about two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States. There is also agreat deal of space on the roofs and walls of these buildings that could support PV generationcapacity. According to one study, between 270 and 320 megawatts of PV would be cost-effective on buildings at a system cost of $3000 per kilowatt. Incorporating PV into buildings atthe design and construction stage lowers costs and increases the value of the electricitygenerated. Through PV:BONUS, we help teams from the building industry develop prototype PV productsthat could replace conventional windows, skylights, and walls while generating electricity.Because incorporating PV into building materials is technically complex, we also help industrydevelop the technology for PV roofing material, PV modular homes, an alternating-current PV module, and peak-shaving PV that utilities can dispatch. Photovoltaics for Federal Agency Applications Federal agencies have been directed to reduce their energy consumption and their use of fossilfuels, opening a large potential market for PV. The Strategic Environmental Research andDevelopment Program (a joint program of DOE, the Department of Defense, and theEnvironmental Protection Agency) has estimated that more than 3000 megawatts of PV—mostlygrid-connected systems larger than 500 kilowatts—could be justified for military uses today. Wesupport federal agencies interested in deploying PV systems. Federal government procurementprocedures require information and certification of PV systems, and we're working onperformance testing and certification projects to provide uniform, long-term performance data.

To take advantage of this huge market, we must find ways to finance the purchase of PVsystems and establish reliable installation and maintenance services. In-country structures forfinancing, installation, and maintenance usually have to be worked out country by country.International lending agencies require assurances of a technology's performance before they willgrant a loan. This member of the Vietnam Women's Union (VWU) is making her downpayment for a home PV system. In a joint venture with the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF), theVWU set up a revolving credit fund that enabled 100 homeowners in southern Vietnam topurchase solar lighting systems in 1995. Over 80% of Vietnam's population is withoutelectricity. (Photo: SELF) Over the next few years, we will address these issues by helping to conduct demonstrations andto secure development loans from lending institutions. PV systems in Mexico and Brazil are already demonstrating the benefits of small and village systems for rural areas. Additional pilot projects are planned for India, China, SouthAfrica, Russia, and other developing countries.

Thesewavelengths indicate radiation with different amounts of energy; the longer the wavelength, theless the energy. Red light, then, has a longer wavelength and thus has less energy than violetlight. Each second, the sun releases an enormous amount of radiant energy into the solar system. TheEarth receives a tiny fraction of this energy; still, an average of 1367 watts (W) reaches eachsquare meter (m2) of the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs andreflects some of this radiation, including most X-rays and ultraviolet rays. Still, the amount ofsunshine energy that hits the surface of the Earth every minute is greater than the total amount ofenergy that the world's human population consumes in a year! The Earth's atmosphere and cloud cover absorb, reflect, andscatter some of the solar radiation entering the atmosphere. Nonetheless, enormous amounts ofdirect and diffuse sunshine energy reach the Earth's surface and can therefore be used to producephotovoltaic electricity. More . . .

In 1958, the U.S. Vanguard space satellite carried a small array of PV cells to power its radio. The cells worked so well that PV technology has been part of the space program ever since. Today, solar cells power virtually all satellites, including those used for communications, defense, and scientific research. Even today, PV plays an important role in space, supplying nearly all power for satellites. The computer industry, especially transistor semiconductor technology, also contributed to the development of PV cells. Transistors and PV cells are made from similar materials and operateon the basis of similar physical mechanisms. As a result, advances in transistor research provided a steady flow of new information about PV cell technology. (Today, however, this technology transfer process often works in reverse, as advances in PV research and development are sometimes adopted by the semiconductor industry.) Despite these advances, PV devices in 1970 were still too expensive for most "down to Earth"uses. But, in the mid-1970s, rising energy costs, sparked by a world oil crisis, renewed interest in making PV technology more affordable. Since then, the federal government, industry, and research organizations have invested billionsof dollars in research, development, and production. Often, industry and the federal government work together, sharing the cost of PV research and development (R&D). (See "About Our Program" from the home page.) Today's commercial PV systems can convert from 7% to 17% of sunlight into electricity. They are highly reliable and last 20 years or longer. The cost of PV-generated electricity has dropped 15- to 20-fold, and PV modules now cost around $6 per watt (W) and produce electricity for as little as 25 to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

Alternatingcurrent, in contrast, is electric current that reverses its flow directionat regular intervals. This is the type of electricity providedby utilities and is required to run most modern appliances and electronicdevices. In the simplest systems, dc current produced by PV modules isused directly.

Since PV cells are very costly componentsof a PV system, using large areas of cells could be an economic liability. Furthermore, forsizable applications, the large relative area of flat-plate collectors entails more land use, whichalso becomes an economic consideration. Flat-plate collectors, which typically employ large numbers ofcells mounted on a rigid, flat surface, can use both direct sunlight and some diffuse sunlight thatis reflected from clouds, the ground, and nearby objects.

How much theefficiency increases depends largely on the cell design and the cell material used. Anotheradvantage of the concentrator is that it can use small individual cells--an advantage because it isharder to produce large-area, high-efficiency cells than it is to produce smaller-area cells. There are, on the other hand, several drawbacks to using concentrators. The concentratingoptics they require, for example, are significantly more expensive than the simple covers neededfor flat-plate modules, and most concentrators must track the sun throughout the day and year tobe effective. Thus, higher concentration ratios mean using not only expensive trackingmechanisms but also more precise controls than flat-plate systems with stationary structures. High concentration ratios are a particular problem, because the operating temperature of cells increases when excess radiation is concentrated, and this creates heat. Cell efficiencies decreaseas temperatures increase, and higher temperatures also threaten the long-term stability of PVcells. Therefore, PV cells must be kept cool. This PV tracking concentrator array is part of the Photovoltaics for Utility-ScaleApplications (PVUSA) project in northern California.

This electric vehicle recharging station in southern Florida ispowered by a grid-connected PV array mounted on the roof.When no vehicles need charging, power from the modules istransferred to the utility line. (Photo: University of South Florida) Some homeowners, considered pioneers in the energy field, areusing PV systems connected to the utility grid.

They alsolike the fact that PV consumes no fuel and generates nopollution. The owner of a grid-connected PV system can not only buy, but can also sell, electricity each month. This is because electricity generated bythe PV system can be used on site or fed through a meter into theutility grid. When a home or business requires more electricitythan the PV array is generating (for example, in the evening), theneed is automatically met by power from the utility grid.

Although most of this equipment is standard stock, itis extremely important to match the capabilities of these devices with the characteristics of theload. Power conditioners may have to perform these functions: Limit current and voltage to maximize power output Convert dc power to ac power Match the converted ac electricity to a utility's electrical network Safeguard the utility network system and its personnel from possible harm during repairs. This 300-kW power inverter is part of a stand-alone PV system. (Photo: Jim YostPhotography) The requirements of power conditioners generally depend on the type of system they areintegrated with and the applications of that system. For dc applications, power conditioning isoften accomplished with regulators, which control output at some constant level of voltage andcurrent to maximize output. For ac loads, power conditioning must include an inverter thatconverts the direct current generated by the PV array into alternating current. More . . .

If tapping into the utility grid is not an option, a battery backup system will benecessary. The drawbacks to batteries are that they decrease the efficiency of the PV system,because only about 80% of the energy channeled into them can be reclaimed. They also add tothe expense of the overall system and must be replaced every five to ten years. They take upconsiderable floor space, pose some safety concerns, and require periodic maintenance. This bank of batteries stores dc electricity for a large PV system. (Photo: Jim YostPhotography) Like PV cells, batteries are direct-current devices and are directly compatible only with dc loads.However, batteries can also serve as a power conditioner for these loads by regulating power;this allows the PV array to operate closer to its optimum power output. Most batteries must alsobe protected from overcharge and excessive discharge, which can cause electrolyte loss and caneven damage or ruin the battery plates. Protection is usually achieved using a charge controller,which also maintains system voltage. Most charge controllers also have a mechanism thatprevents current from flowing from the battery back into the array at night.

The most commonmaterial for the window layer in CuInSe2 devices is cadmium sulfide (CdS), althoughsometimes zinc is added to improve the transparency. Adding small amounts of gallium to theabsorbing CuInSe2 layer boosts its band gap (from its normal 1.0 eV), which improves the voltage and therefore the efficiency of the device. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is another prominent polycrystalline thin-film material. With anearly ideal band gap of 1.44 eV, CdTe also has a very high absorptivity. Although CdTe ismost often used in PV devices without being alloyed, it is easily alloyed with zinc, mercury, andsome other elements to vary its properties. Like CuInSe2, CdTe films can be manufacturedusing low-cost techniques. Solar Cells, Inc., is one of the first U.S. companies to manufacture cadmiumtelluride PV modules. The manufacturing process was developed in cooperation with DOE'sPhotovoltaic Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) project. (Photo: Solar Cells, Inc.) Like CuInSe2, the best CdTe cells employ a heterojunction interface, with cadmium sulfide(CdS) acting as a thin window layer. Tin oxide is used as a transparent conducting oxide andantireflection coating. One problem with CdTe is that p-type CdTe films tend to be highlyresistive electrically, which leads to large internal losses. A solution is to allow the CdTe layer tobe intrinsic (natural, neither p-type nor n-type), and adding a layer of p-type zinc telluride(ZnTe) between the CdTe and the back electrical contact. Even though the n-type CdS and thep-type ZnTe are separated, they still form an electrical field that extends right through theintrinsic CdTe. One way around contacting problems inherent in typical CdTecells is to use an n-i-p structure, with an intrinsic layer of CdTe sandwiched between an n-typeCdS layer and a p-type ZnTe layer.

These defects provide places forelectrons to recombine with holes rather than contributing to the electrical circuit. Ordinarily,such a material would be unacceptable for electronic devices because the defects limit the flowof current. But if amorphous silicon is deposited in such a way that it contains a small amount ofhydrogen (through a process called "hydrogenation"), then the hydrogen atoms combinechemically with many of the dangling bonds, essentially removing them and thereby permittingelectrons to move through the amorphous silicon. Amorphous silicon's random structural characteristics result indeviations like "dangling bonds."

The advantage of TCOs is that they are nearly invisible to incoming light, yet form a good bridge from the semiconductor to the external circuit. TCOs are very useful in manufacturing processes when a glass "superstrate" is used for depositing layers of thin films (suchas those of amorphous silicon and cadmium telluride). In this process, the TCO is generally depositedas a thin film on the glass superstrate before the semiconducting layers. These layers are thendeposited, followed by a metallic contact that will actually be the bottom of the cell. In this manner, the cell is actually "built" upside down, from the top to the bottom. But the construction technique isn't the only thing that determines whether a metallic grid or TCO isbest for a certain cell design. The "sheet resistance" of the semiconductor is also an important consideration. In crystalline silicon, for example, the semiconductor carries charge (electrons) well enough toreach a finger of the metallic grid. Because the metal conducts electricity better than a TCO does, shadowing losses are less than the losses that would be associated with using a TCO. Amorphous silicon, on the other hand, conducts very poorly in the horizontal direction and therefore benefits from having a TCO over every bit of its surface. In silicon (a), horizontal electron movement is sufficient to reach a fingerof the metallic grid, making the grid contact preferable. Amorphous silicon (b) conducts very poorlyin the horizontal direction and therefore benefits from having a TCO layer over its entire surface.

Instead, it uses a thin layer of a transparentconducting oxide (such as tin oxide). These oxides are highly transparent and conductelectricity very well. A separate antireflection coating may be used to top off the device, or thetransparent conducting oxide may serve this function as well. Polycrystalline thin-film cells comprise many tiny crystalline grains of semiconductor materials. The materials used in polycrystalline thin-film cells have properties that are different from thoseof silicon, so it has proven to be better to create the electric field with aninterface between two different semiconductor materials. This type of interface is called aheterojunction ("hetero" because it is formed from two different materials, in comparison to the"homojunction" formed by two doped layers of the same material, such as the one in siliconsolar cells). Polycrystalline thin-film cells have a heterojunction structure, inwhich the top layer is made of a different semiconductor material than the bottom semiconductorlayer. The top layer, usually n-type, is a window that allows almost all ofthe light through to the absorbing layer, usually p-type. An "ohmic contact" is often used to providea good electrical connection to the substrate. The typical polycrystalline thin film has a very thin (less than 0.1 micron) layer on top called the"window" layer. The window layer's role is to absorb light energy from only the high-energyend of the spectrum. It must be thin enough and have a wideenough band gap (2.8 eV or more) to let all the available lightthrough the interface (heterojunction) to the absorbing layer. The absorbing layer under thewindow, usually doped p-type, must have a high absorptivity (ability toabsorb photons) for high current and a suitable band gap to provide a good voltage. Still, it istypically just 1 to 2 microns thick. More . . .

Overloadingheats up substation components, which shortens the life ofexpensive transformers, reduces power quality for customers, andincreases line losses during transmission. Analysts in PG&E'sresearch group looked to a PV array to meet the extra demand atKerman, because it occurred on days when the solar cells would beproducing well. PG&E's Kerman substation in California uses the electricityproduced by this 500-kW PV system to help meet peak demandon sunny summer afternoons. Researchers are measuring the valueof this system to PG&E in hopes of demonstrating yet another useof PV in utility systems. (Photo: R. Taylor, NREL) The analysts at PG&E believed using PV to support a substationduring peaks in electrical demand might make economic sense fortheir utility, but no one knew quantitatively how much the PVgrid support would be worth. Because upgrading the Kermansubstation would cost several million dollars, PG&E decided toinstall a PV system as a research project (as part of the PV for Utility-Scale Applicationsproject) to evaluate the benefits of grid support. The PV system, installed at Kerman in 1993, produces the most poweron sunny summer afternoons, when PG&E experiences its peak demandand when electricity has the highest value to the utility. The PVsystem maintains its electrical output close to its ratedcapacity with the PV modules mounted on trackers that change thetilt of the modules as the sun moves across the sky during thiscritical period. The Kerman substation experiment is designed to measure the valueto the utility of a 500-kW generating plant that can be quickly(within 6 months) placed where extra power is needed. Monitorsrecord electrical output throughout the day and provide detailedinformation on system output. The results of this experiment willbe widely distributed among utilities across the country.

Sandia is working with FIRCO to incorporate the use of renewable-energy technologies, like PV, in several pilot projects in four Mexican states. Work began in the northern state of Sonora, where five PV water-pumping systems (ranging insize from 350 to 1000 watts) have already been installed and at least 12 more projects will beimplemented by the end of 1996. The installed systems use Siemens and Solarex PV panels andGrundfos submersible pumps. Applied Power Corporation supplied design assistance andhardware through its Mexican partner. In Chihuahua, Sandia and FIRCO have helped form arenewable-energy working group, through which 11 PV water-pumping projects have beeninstalled and as many as 50 more are planned. This program has recently expanded to the statesof Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, where project development is already under way. FIRCO represents a major market opportunity for renewable-energy technologies like PV inMexico. Although FIRCO is a federal agency, it operates through offices in each of the Mexicanstates. In addition to livestock water pumping, FIRCO engineers implement a variety of ruraleconomic development programs, including automated milking and refrigeration for dairy farms,electric fencing for cattle ranching, cheese processing, electrified corn grinding, and small-scaleirrigation. Since many FIRCO projects are located far from the electricity grid, and becauseMexico has an abundance of renewable resources, PV represents a viable option for many ofthese development applications. Based on these recent successes, FIRCO and Sandia have agreed to expand the project and workto incorporate renewable-energy technologies, like PV, into a $225 million (financed by theWorld Bank) agricultural development program in 10 additional states.

Then, the villagers decided to secure a more reliablesource of electric power by connecting PV modules and wind turbines to thegenerating system. The people of Xcalak, a remote village on the east coast of the Yucatanpeninsula, wanted to replace their diesel generators because it was expensiveto ship fuel to the village and because the generators kept breaking down.Located 68 miles (110 km) from the nearest utility line, the village of 350could not convince the utility to spend $3.2 million for a line extension.But when the villagers turned to their government, a bold new solutionemerged: adding solar electric modules and wind generators to the existingdiesel system to make a large hybrid electrical generating system. In the village of Xcalak, Mexico, PV is part of thelargest hybrid generation system in the Americas. The system includes sixwind turbines, 234 PV modules, 36 batteries, a 40-kW inverter to convertpower to AC, a diesel generator, and a sophisticated control system. Aselectrical needs increase, the system can be expanded. (Photo: BergeyWindpower, Inc.) For Xcalak, the hybrid system offered many advantages. Construction costswould be a fraction of those required for a line extension, and fuel andmaintenance expenses for the hybrid system would be lower than those forrunning the diesels alone. The system itself would have greater generatingcapacity, thus providing more homes and businesses with electric power. Andthe hybrid system would be more reliable than diesel generators operatingalone because it included multiple backup generation and a larger batterybank. More . . .

Not surprisingly, the areas near the equator receive more solar radiation than anywhere else on Earth. Sunlight varies with the seasons, as the rotational axis of the Earth shifts to lengthen and shorten days with the changing seasons. For example, the amount of solar energy falling per square meter on Yuma, Arizona, in June is typically about nine times greater than that falling on Caribou, Maine, in December. The quantity of sunlight reaching any region is also affected by the time of day, the climate (especially the cloud cover, which scatters the sun's rays), and the air pollution in that region. Likewise, these climatic factors all affect the amount of solar energy that is available to PV systems. Although the quantity of solar radiation striking the Earth varies by region, season, time of day, climate, and air pollution, the yearly amount of energy striking almost any part of the Earth is vast. Shown is the average radiation received on a horizontal surface across the continental United States in the month of June. Units are in kWh/m2.

Atoms, in turn, are composed of positively charged protons,negatively charged electrons, and neutral neutrons. The protons and neutrons, which are ofapproximately equal size, comprise the close-packed central "nucleus" of the atom, where almostall of the mass of the atom is located. The much lighter electrons orbit the nucleus at very highvelocities. Although the atom is built from oppositely charged particles, its overall charge isneutral because it contains an equal number of positive protons and negative electrons. The electrons orbit the nucleus at different distances, depending on their energy level; anelectron with less energy orbits close to the nucleus, whereas one of greater energy orbits fartheraway. The electrons farthest from the nucleus interact with those of neighboring atoms todetermine the way solid structures are formed. The silicon atom has 14 electrons, but their natural orbital arrangement allows only the outerfour of these to be given to, accepted from, or shared with other atoms. These outer fourelectrons, called "valence" electrons, play an important role in the photovoltaic effect. As depicted in this simplified diagram, silicon has 14 electrons. The four electrons that orbit the nucleus in the outermost, or "valence," energy level are given to,accepted from, or shared with other atoms.

In a crystalline solid, each silicon atom normally shares one of its four valence electronsin a "covalent" bond with each of four neighboring silicon atoms. The solid, then, consists ofbasic units of five silicon atoms: the original atom plus the four other atoms with which it sharesits valence electrons. In the basic unit of a crystalline silicon solid, a siliconatom shares each of its four valence electrons with each of four neighboring atoms. The solid silicon crystal, then, is composed of a regular series of units of five silicon atoms. This regular, fixed arrangement of silicon atoms is known as the "crystal lattice."

The dopant has either three or five valence electrons, as opposed tosilicon's four. Phosphorus atoms, which have five valence electrons, are used for doping n-type silicon(because phosphorous provides its fifth, free, electron). A phosphorus atom occupies the sameplace in the crystal lattice that was occupied formerly by the silicon atom it replaced. Four of itsvalence electrons take over the bonding responsibilities of the four silicon valence electrons thatthey replaced. But the fifth valence electron remains free, without bonding responsibilities. When numerous phosphorus atoms are substituted for silicon in a crystal, many free electronsbecome available. Substituting a phosphorus atom (with five valence electrons) for asilicon atom in a silicon crystal leaves an extra, unbonded electron that is relatively free to movearound the crystal. The most common method of doping is to coat the top of a layer of silicon with phosphorus andthen heat the surface. This allows the phosphorus atoms to diffuse into the silicon. Thetemperature is then lowered so that the rate of diffusion drops to zero. Other methods ofintroducing phosphorus into silicon include gaseous diffusion, a liquid dopant spray-on process,and a technique in which phosphorus ions are driven precisely into the surface of the silicon.

So, boron, which has three valenceelectrons, is used for doping p-type silicon. Boron is introduced during silicon processing,where silicon is purified for use in PV devices. When a boron atom assumes a position in thecrystal lattice formerly occupied by a silicon atom, there is a bond missing an electron (in otherwords, an extra hole). Substituting a boron atom (with three valence electrons) for asilicon atom in a silicon crystal leaves a hole (a bond missing an electron) that is relatively freeto move around the crystal.

But this is done a number of different ways,depending on the characteristics of the material. For example, amorphous silicon'sunique structure makes an intrinsic layer (or i layer) necessary. Thisundoped layer of amorphous silicon fits between the n-type and p-type layers to form what iscalled a "p-i-n" design. Polycrystalline thin films like copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) show great promise for PV cells. But thesematerials can't be simply doped to form n and p layers. Instead, layers of different materials areused to form these layers. For example, a "window" layer of cadmium sulfide or similarmaterial is used to provide the extra electrons necessary to make it n-type. CuInSe2 canitself be made p-type, whereas CdTe benefits from a p-type layer made from a material like zinctelluride (ZnTe). Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is similarly modified, usuallywith indium, phosphorous, or aluminum, to produce a wide range of n- and p-type materials.

It's very important to "tune" this layer to theproperties of the incoming photons to absorb as many as possible and thereby free as manyelectrons as possible. Another challenge is to keep the electrons from meeting up with holes and"recombining" with them before they can escape the cell. To do this, we design the material sothat the electrons are freed as close to the junction as possible, so that the electric field can helpsend them through the "conduction" layer (the n layer) and out into the electric circuit. Bymaximizing all these characteristics, we improve the conversion efficiencyof the PV cell. To make an efficient solar cell, we try to maximize absorption,minimize reflection and recombination, and thereby maximize conduction.

Single-axis trackers are typically designed to track the sun from east to west on itsdaily route. They are used with flat-plate systems and some concentrator systems. The two-axistype is primarily used for PV concentrator systems. These systems track not only the sun's dailycourse but its seasonal course between the northern and southern hemispheres. Naturally, themore sophisticated the system the more expensive and the more maintenance it may require. Concentrating systems, especially those with high concentration factors, requiremechanisms that track the sun.

When hefound water on his land, the well was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from thepower line. Extending the line to power his pump would have cost$18,000. So, like many people in the area, Romey hauled water tohis cattle in tank trucks each day. After two seasons of haulingwater, he read about solar-powered pumping provided by theNorthwest Rural Public Power District. The Northwest Rural Public Power District, along with manyutilities around the country, offers customers the choice ofrunning new power lines or installing a PV system. PV waterpumping is particularly popular in rural areas because, althoughthe electricity is used as it is generated, the water can bestored in tanks and reservoirs. (Storing water is much cheaperthan storing electricity.) Twenty PV modules generate 1600 watts of dc electricity topower a centrifugal pump at this South Dakota ranch. (Photo: RuralElectric Nebraskan) Now, Romey's PV system pumps water through 5.6 miles (9 km) ofpipeline to four stock tanks that supply over 150 head of cattle.And with the new pipeline, he can graze cattle on two fields thathe could not use before. Are PV pumping systems reliable? Yes! A recent survey of more than 250 PV-powered pumpinginstallations by The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) found PV to be a very reliable source ofpower for pumping systems. In fact, the PV modules are the mostreliable parts of the systems; none of the systems in this studyexperienced module failures. The pumps experienced operationaland maintenance problems common to all pumping systems.

The couple commissioned thedesign of a PV-powered, all-solar home because they wereconcerned about the environment and wanted to be self-reliant.They did not want to maintain a battery bank at their home, andutility power was available, so they specified autility-connected photovoltaic system. This grid-connected, PV-powered home in Massachusetts hasbeen operating without problem since 1980. The owners of thishouse and its 4.5-kW PV array sell enough excess electricity in thesummer to nearly balance the backup energy they buy in the winter.(Photo: Solar Design Associates) The privately financed home, completed in 1980, incorporates manyenergy-conserving features. Built largely of masonry, concrete,and steel with earth berms against the north, east, and westsides, it stays warm in winter and cool in summer. The south wallof the house is nearly all glass to soak up the winter sun andthe overhang of the roof provides shade to the south-facing glassin the summer. The PV system generates most of the electricity the couple needs.The PV modules occupy 430 ft2 (40 m2) of the south-facing roof.The dc electricity from the modules passes through an inverterand is converted to utility-grade ac power. Most of thiselectricity is used in the home, and the excess is sold to theutility. Ever since the installation in 1980, the owners have found thehome to be nearly energy self-sufficient over the calendar year.During the summer months, the PV system generates moreelectricity than the house uses and therefore passes it out intothe grid. In the winter, the house uses more electricity than thePV system produces, so some power flows in from the utility grid.

An approved,utility-grade inverter converts the dc power from PV modules intoac power that exactly matches the voltage and frequency of theelectricity flowing in the utility line, and also meets theutility's safety and power-quality requirements. Safety switchesin the inverter automatically disconnect the PV system from theline if utility power fails. This safety disconnect protectsutility repair personnel from being shocked by electricityflowing from the PV array into what they would expect to be a"dead" utility line. In addition to cooperating under PURPA, utilities areestablishing rate structures that may make PV grid-connectedsystems more economical. (At today's prices, when the cost ofinstalling a utility-connected PV system is divided by the amountof electricity it will produce over 30 years, PV-generatedelectricity is almost always more expensive than power suppliedby the utility.) For example, some utilities charge higher pricesat certain times of the day. In some parts of the country, thehighest charges for electricity under this time-of-day pricingstructure are now nearly equal to the cost of energy from PV. Thebetter the match between the electrical output of the PV modulesand the time of highest prices, the more effective the systemwill be in reducing utility bills.

Under current utilityaccounting, PV-generated electricity still costs considerably morethan electricity generated by conventional plants, and regulatoryagencies require most utilities to supply electricity for thelowest cash cost. Furthermore, photovoltaic systems produce poweronly during daylight hours and their output varies with theweather. Utility planners must therefore treat a PV power plantdifferently than they would treat a conventional plant. More . . .

We then cause it to reform very slowly in contact with a single crystal "seed." The silicon adapts to the pattern of thesingle crystal seed as it cools and solidifies gradually. Not suprisingly, because we start from a "seed," this process is called "growing" a new ingot of single-crystal silicon out of the moltensilicon. Several specific processes can be used to accomplish this. The most established and dependablemeans are the Czochralski method and the floating-zone (FZ) technique. In the Czochralski process, a seed crystal is dipped into a crucible of molten silicon and withdrawnslowly, pulling a cylindrical single crystal as the silicon crystallizes on the seed. The most widely used technique for making single-crystal silicon is the Czochralski process, in whichseed of single-crystal silicon contacts the top of molten silicon. As the seed is slowly raised, atomsof the molten silicon solidify in the pattern of the seed and extend the single-crystal structure. More . . .

The 2.2-kilowatt PV systemprovides more than 10,000 gallons of water per day for the day-use area restroom, showers, andpicnic site. A separate 240-watt system powers the restroom lights, fans, and motion sensors.Because grid power was several miles from the site and a line extension would have to rununderground, PV was the cheapest alternative on a first-cost basis. System installation wasperformed by two Arizona companies, Solar Exchange and Solarjack. The Rattlesnake PV project is one of a dozen pilot projects identified by the U.S. Forest Serviceand Sandia National Laboratories, all of which are designed to be replicable and which wereselected to incorporate diversity in both geographic location and application. These pilotprojects are part of the Renew the Forests partnership of the DOE Photovoltaics Division,Sandia, and the U.S. Forest Service. The Renew the Forests project included a survey in whichseveral hundred existing projects were identified that are currently in need of power and whichcan be best served by PV.

The stateof Quintana Roo and the national government of Mexico paid for the initialcost of the project, and the utility updated and expanded the village wiringsystem to accommodate increased generating capacity. The villagers pay forsystem operation and maintenance. Xcalak's hybrid electric system uses PV, wind turbines, and diesel togenerate power. Batteries store electric energy produced by the PV and windturbines for use 24 hours a day. An inverter converts the dc from thebatteries to the ac provided to village residents. The PV arrays generateelectricity during the day, and the wind turbines charge batteries wheneverthe wind blows. (The winds are usually best at night.) If the batteriesbecome drained after a series of cloudy, windless days, or if the demand forelectricity increases, the diesel generators can meet the demand. In remote villages the world over, providing reliable electric power canimprove the economy and the quality of life for village residents. ForXcalak, adding renewable energy generators to their diesel system loweredoperating costs and increased the reliability of electric service. When thehybrid system went on-line in 1992, it powered 80 homes, four restaurants,and one 20-room hotel. The village tourism industry centers around the hoteland restaurants, and its fishing industry benefits from reliablerefrigeration all without being connected to the central utility grid.

During daylighthours, the PV modules charge the battery. The battery suppliespower to the load whenever needed. A simple electrical devicecalled a charge controller keeps the batteries charged properlyand helps prolong their life by protecting them from overchargingor from being completely drained. Batteries make PV systems useful in more situations, but alsorequire some maintenance. The batteries used in PV systems areoften similar to car batteries, but are built somewhatdifferently to allow more of their stored energy to be used eachday. (They are said to be "deep cycling," like the batteries usedon golf carts.) Batteries designed for PV projects pose the samerisks and demand the same caution in handling and storage asautomotive batteries. The fluid in unsealed batteries should bechecked periodically, and batteries should be protected fromextremely cold weather. A solar generating system with batteries supplies electricitywhen it is needed. How much electricity can be used after sunsetor on cloudy days is determined by the output of the PV modulesand the nature of the battery bank. Including more modules andbatteries increases system cost, so energy usage is carefullystudied to determine optimum system size. A well-designed systembalances cost and convenience to meet the user's needs, and canbe expanded if those needs change.

At Sand Pass in Nevada, 72 PV modules (60 W each), twopropane-powered generators, and a large battery bank operatetogether to improve the economics and reliability of a remotetelephone signal booster station. (Photo: Northern Power Systems) When Sprint Communications built its east-west fiber-optic cableline in the late 1980s, it needed a regenerator station every 22miles (35 km) to boost the signal. These regenerator stations useelectricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to power thetransmission equipment and control shelter temperatures. Utilitypower serves most of the stations, which have 2 hours of backupbattery capacity should the power line go down. But at Sand Pass, Nevada, bringing in utility power wasprohibitively expensive. When Sprint built a regenerator stationthere in 1986, it installed two propane-powered electricgenerators. But to maintain the generators, a mechanic drove outto the pass every month, and to provide fuel, a teamster hauled aheavy propane tank over rough dirt roads to the site every 3months. The solution was to have a PV system installed at the Sand Passstation. The PV array and propane generators at Sand Passcomplement each other. The PV array charges batteries that powerthe dc transmission equipment. The generators run to power the acmotor in the air-conditioning unit only when the shelterthermostat calls for air conditioning. As added backup, thegenerators can charge the batteries, if necessary. Relieving thegenerators of their everyday battery-charging duties has alsoreduced runtime. Thus, the PV system has significantly loweredfuel and maintenance costs for the station.

Engine generators can produce electricity anytime. Thus, they provide an excellent backup for the PV modules, which produce power only during daylight hours, when power is needed at night or on cloudy days. On the other hand, PV operates quietly and inexpensively, and it does not pollute. Using PV and generators together can also reduce the initial cost of the system. If no other form of generation is available, the PV array and the battery storage must be large enough to supply nighttime electrical needs. However, having an engine generator as backup means fewer PV modules and batteries are necessary to supply power whenever it is needed. Including generators makes designing PV systems more complex, but they are still easy to operate. In fact, modern electronic controllersallow such systems to operate automatically. Controllers can be set to automatically switch generators, to supply ac or dc loads, or do some of each. In addition to engine generators, electricity from wind generators, smallhydro plants, and any other source of electrical energy can be added to make a largerhybrid power system.

We are doing this in three primary ways: by making devices moreefficient, by making PV systems less expensive, and by validating the technology throughmeasurements, tests, and prototypes. We accomplish these tasks under the program's three mainelements: Research and Development, Technology Development, and Systems Engineering andApplications. See Implementing the Program for more details about theseelements. Research and Development (R&D) For PV to make a significant contribution to the nation's energy resource mix, thetechnology must be improved and electricity from PV must become more cost-competitive.Therefore, at the most basic level, we study and analyze the very materials used in solar cellsand modules. We work to develop materials, processes, and devices to yield cells and moduleswith higher conversion efficiencies, and we carefully measure, model, and evaluate newconcepts with this same goal. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) Tell me more about this R&D! Technology Development The next step is to translate laboratory innovations into technical improvements for commercialproducts. To this end, we investigate manufacturing technology, module development, andbalance-of-system (BOS) components. Much of this work is performed under the PhotovoltaicManufacturing Technology (PVMaT) initiative, a close collaboration between our nationallaboratories and the U.S. PV industry. In projects like this, industry funds 50% and more of thework. Tell me more about this Technology Development! Systems Engineering and Applications Even after a technology is in commercial production, we are involved in its development andrefinement. At this stage, we help industry improve the performance, reliability, and operationalcharacteristics of its products. Working with the industry partners, we test and evaluate thematerial, mechanical, electrical, and safety characteristics of cells, modules, BOS components,and complete systems.

First, we must ensure that the U.S. PV industry not only grows into a large domestic industry butalso that it remains competitive in the world PV markets. This means we must maintain thetechnical superiority of our products. U.S. industry has been a leader in PV technology thanks tothe ongoing support of the National Photovoltaics Program and the tenacity of the U.S.companies. To maintain this leadership, the program and the companies must continue theirclose collaboration. The potential market for PV is staggering. Since 1988, the worldwide demand for PV has grown from 33 megawatts per year to 84 megawatts peryear, an increase of nearly 255%. During the same period, U.S. PV companies have increasedtheir module shipments by more than 310% and have increased their share of the world PVmarket to 41%. Through close collaboration with industry, we intend to maintain this growth. Second, for PV to be seriously considered as a major energy option, we must expand oldmarkets and enter new ones by making PV competitive in a wider variety of applications andwith more forms of electrical generation. Following its success in space, PV power came down to Earth in the1970s to find other niche markets in the armed forces and a small number of remote-powerapplications. As these markets continued to grow, the 1980s witnessed a proliferation of PV-powered consumer products. In the 1990s, PV systems emerged into municipal applications inthe United States and began to power homes and communities in the developing world. Thedomestic utility market is now gradually opening up, with building-mounted and local gridsupport expected to be well established by the year 2005. Soon after that, PV electricity isexpected to be cost competitive for utility bulk power applications. To accomplish both of these objectives, we must reduce the cost of PV systems while makingthem more reliable, durable, and convenient to use. This has been the constant aim of theNational Photovoltaics Program. Since 1980, we have worked with industry to reduce the costof PV-generated electricity to about 25 cents per kilowatt-hour and increase module lifetimes to20 years. Continuing to do so will make PV systems as attractive to consumers as the next bestalternative for a wide spectrum of electric power applications.

We concentrate on applications ranging from high-value consumer products, international and remote projects, buildings, utility distribution,peaking power, and, finally, bulk power markets. Second, we use a vertically integrated development process to bringtechnologies from the concept stage to commercial readiness. This process has feedback loopsalong the way and includes basic research, applied research, engineering, product development,and manufacturing refinements before it finally results in a new commercial product. Third, all along this development process, we collaborate closely with R&D partners fromgovernment, industry, and universities. This lends stability to the program and leverages theexpertise, funds, and facilities of the partners. Finally, we validate the technology for specific applications by deploying prototype systems anddocumenting their performance. For more about our strategy, see Implementing the Program.

Collaboration between Government, Industry, and Universities To achieve the program's goals, we depend heavily on the expertise and contributions of theprogram's partners in the national laboratories, universities, and PV industry. The national laboratories provide long-term, high-risk, but high-payoffresearch and development (R&D). The laboratories' cutting-edge R&D breakthroughs continueto advance the performance and reliability of PV technologies. Our technology transfer activitiesensure that information reaches the private sector and provides opportunities for industry tocollaborate with laboratory researchers. In collaborative projects, research engineers havedeveloped more-efficient fabrication and manufacturing processes, better encapsulants andmodule packaging, automated manufacturing systems, and refined balance-of-systemscomponents. They have also helped to establish uniform standards and test methods, rigorousprocedures for qualification testing of PV systems, and data bases of environmental, resource,and market information. Through subcontracts, universities that participate in the National Photovoltaics Program play akey supporting role in almost every phase of technology development. Their expertise infundamental science and materials and device research adds immeasurably to the foundations ofscience, the advancement of the technology, and the effectiveness of the program. This student at the Colorado School of Mines is using an electron microscope toperform Auger analyses of PV materials. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography) Through collaborative interactions, industry provides feedback to researchers and engineers on products and processes. Industry gives the program guidance at all points along the development path. As an integral member of our R&D, industry often assumes the lead rolein the engineering and product development phases as a technology develops. Therefore, in1996, industry nearly 80% of program funding in Technology Development andnearly 60% of the funding in Systems Engineering and Applications. After all, in the end, it isindustry that brings the effort of the program to fruition in the form of lower-cost PV products.

A small amount of ozone acts as a powerful biocide thatdecreases or nearly eliminates the need to remove quantities of water from the cooling tower in orderto decrease the concentration of organic and mineral solids in the system. Ozone treatment can alsoreduce the need for chemical additives to the cooling tower water. In a properly installed and operating system, bacterial counts are reduced, with a subsequentminimization of the buildup of biofilm on heat exchanger surfaces. The resulting reduction in energy use,increased cooling tower operating efficiency, and reduced maintenance effort provide cost savings aswell as environmental benefit and regulatory compliance with respect to discharge of wastewater fromblowdown. Cooling towers associated with chillers for air-conditioning are good candidates for ozoneapplication.

The fuel cell is the most efficient device for the conversion of hydrogen fuel to electric power. As such, the fuel cell represents a key element in efforts to demonstrate and implement hydrogen fuel utilization for electric power generation. The project at LANL focuses on a joint effort with a fuel cell stack manufacturer to develop and demonstrate a manufacturable polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) 4-5kW fuel cell stack of high performance and low cost for generation of electric power from hydrogen. Recent Advances: There has been a significant achievement in the development andsuccessful testing of PEM fuel cell stack hardware which requiresno machining and is based on inexpensive stainless steel components. This development has been achieved in the LANL project on "FuelCells for Stationary Power Generation from Hydrogen" supportedby the Hydrogen Program in DOE/OUT. By the end of May, we hadcompleted 1000 hours of continuous testing of a 100 cm2 cell basedon a novel LANL technology. In our approach, we employ stainlesssteel screens as gas flow fields and stainless steel sheets asbipolar plates. The performance of the cell has been highly satisfactory,enabling 60% energy conversion efficiency from hydrogen to electricityat a projected stack power density of about 0.6 kW/liter. Mostsignificant is that there has been no detectable drop in cellperformance after 1000 hours of continuous operation. The perfectperformance stability recorded proves that the simple componentsand the very inexpensive materials employed can be engineeredto maintain performance previously demonstrated only in much morecostly designs. The cell we are testing employed LANL's relativelylow-cost, high-performance membrane/electrode (M&E) assembliesof ultra-low platinum catalyst loadings, developed previouslyin a program supported by DOE/OTT. This ensures that a fuel cellstack built using our approach would minimize costs while providinghigh performance. Earlier tests with 304 stainless steel components resulted inexcessive contact resistances. In contrast, our most recent cellwas built with 316 stainless steel screens and sheets, and theexcellent performance described above confirms much lower contactresistances. The successful 1000 hours' life test strongly suggeststhat 316 stainless steel will satisfy hardware requirements inwell-designed PEM fuel cell stacks without further need for surfacetreatment or precious metal coating. The stack building blockcould serve as a basis for low-cost PEM stack technology withgreat manufacturing advantages. Compared with present-day PEMfuel cell stack technologies based on machined flow fields, themetal screen flow field provides simplicity, off-the-shelf availability,and very low cost. This flow field would cost $1-$2/kW, vs. $100/kWprojected for machined graphite flow fields. This bringsthe total cost of fuel cell materials down to the cost of justthe M&E assembly (which today is about $300/kW at 60% energyconversion efficiency and likely to decrease with substantialdemand creating high-volume production). We would like to achievecomplete demonstration of a stack based on this manufacturable,inexpensive design by the end of 1997. Formal disclosure of this metal screen technology has been madeto a patent lawyer. Our goal will be to transfer the technologyto U.S. industry.WT02-B16-300IA060-000330-B036-134http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hbr.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115051747 text/html 4670HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:17:41 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:24 GMTContent-length: 4496 Hydrogen InfoNet Production of HBr from Bromine and Steam for Off-Peak Electrolytic Hydrogen Generation; Harley Heaton, Principal Investigator, Solar Reactor Technologies,Inc. Solar Reactor Technologies (SRT), Inc., is developing a unique,innovative dual-function system to produce low-cost industrialquantities of hydrogen and oxygen from water using renewable energy. In the first step of the process, concentrated solar radiationis absorbed by bromine vapor in a high-temperature reactor, producingbromine atoms. The bromine atoms then react with water to producehydrogen bromine (HBr) and oxygen. Finally, the stored HBr iselectrolyzed in the reversible electrochemical cell to producehydrogen, and the bromine is recovered. The process can reducethe electrical energy required to split water as much as 70%. In a collaborative effort with the National Renewable EnergyLaboratory, Sandia (CA) National Laboratories, and Florida SolarEnergy Center, a 1-kW solar reactor was designed and constructedduring the first phase of this project. It was used to gatherdata from the reaction between bromine and steam at temperaturesbetween 900 and 1300 K, with and without concentrated solar radiation. We verified the predicted thermochemical behavior and observedHBr conversion rates of 70% of the theoretical maximum. Recent Advances: An improved version of the bromine delivery system for the 1-kWsystem was tested. A Pyrex pipette was glass blown to a 1-cmdiam. frit. Bromine delivery and pressurization tubes were added. A heating tape vaporized bromine after it exited the frit. Thedelivery rate increased with applied pressure. At 0 psi, flowrates of about 0.2 ml Br2/min were attained for a fine porosityfrit; at 6 psi, they were 2.0 ml/min. Tests of the medium-porosityfrit showed that much higher flow rates could be realized: 0.1-5ml/min for 0 psi and 9 ml/min at 2 psi. The Pathfinder bromine and steam delivery systems were installed. On-sun testing with bromine and steam is continuing. A safetyconsultant hired by NREL inspected the system and offered suggestions. Modifications were made to the bromine delivery system. Thebromine day tank was housed in a vented gas cabinet fitted witha fire suppression system. Water, electrical, air, bromine, andventilation lines were installed, and the feed and return linesto the reactor were hooked up. Only steam was passed throughthe reactor in initial tests. The steam delivery system, operatedwell for flow rates between 5 and 15 g/min. Advanced Fuel Research(AFR) set up an FTIR apparatus and measured reactor steam temperaturesbetween 650° and 900°C. These values were significantlydifferent from those recorded by thermocouples inserted in quartzwells in the reactor. Next, the bromine delivery system was tested. Reasonably constant flow rates were achieved between 5 and 15g/min. The day tank load cell was calibrated. When bromine wasintroduced into the reactor, AFR measured a 150°-250°Cincrease in the steam temperature. This was attributed to brominemolecules absorbing a significant amount of the solar flux (ca.20%). Upon photo-dissociating, they impart a significant portionof their kinetic energy to surrounding bromine and water moleculesupon recombination. The highest temperature recorded was 1075°Cwith only 2.5 kW of incident power. Samples were collected underconditions of varying solar power and input bromine mole fraction. This translated into different reactor residence times, localgas temperatures, and bromine conversion efficiencies. At thesame time, AFR measured the instantaneous reactor [Hbr]. Theyshowed that [Hbr] increased with reactor temperature for a fixedinput bromine mole fraction. According to preliminary data analysis,conversion efficiencies up to 20% were attained for a 1-2 secondresidence time. During the last two weeks of testing, a molecularbeam mass spectrometer was calibrated and tested. Initial operationdetected HBr formation in on-sun experiments. H2O, Br, Br2, andO2 were detected as well. Neutralization of bromine and H2O/HBr/Br2 mixtures with sodium thiosulphate and sodium bicarbonate was demonstrated.WT02-B16-301IA060-000330-B028-317http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/sub.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115044122 text/html 649HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 04:41:24 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:27 GMTContent-length: 476 Hydrogen InfoNet SUBAWARDS TO DEBARRED AND SUSPENDED PARTIES Applicants and consortium members must not make any award or permit any award (subcontract) at any tier to any party which is debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal Assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension," or is otherwise ineligible hereunder.WT02-B16-302IA060-000328-B021-23http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/pdf.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115025228 text/html 1619HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 02:52:31 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:26 GMTContent-length: 1445 Download .pdf file PDF files -what are they and how can I view them?

Inthe intermediary regime, ignition is kinetically controlled. Also,it is shown that the concept of volatility in sprays is directlyassociated with the latent heat of the solvent in the dense regimeand with the boiling point of the solute in the dilute regime.

Bellan, J., and Harstad, K. 1995. "Unsteady Injection ofSequences of Drop Clusters in Vortices Depicting Portions of aSpray." Atomization and Sprays, 5(1), 17-44. The shear layer at the edge and the core of a polydisperse sprayis modeled as injected sequences of clusters of drops embeddedinto vortices, each cluster-in-vortex entity having differentinitial characteristics. Thus, the air/fuel mass ratio or thedrop size is varied in the sequence (increasing, decreasing orsinusoidal) to create sprays with different atomization characteristics,and an analysis of the results shows which injection patternsare more beneficial to spray combustion.

U.S. patent No. 4,919,813, issued on Apr. 24, 1990, describes a process using photosynthetic bacteria and low levels of light (e.g., solar) energy, for the rapid converison of organic acids and alchohols into H2 and CO2, the optimal precursor substrates for biogenic methane synthesis. Day/night cycles (or continuous low light) induces both photosynthetic and fermentative metabolisms of photosynthetic bacteria. Light anabolizes the organic acid and alcohol substrates into endogenous sugars, which are then fermented in dark reactions to produce H2 at high rates, but low partial pressures. Weaver, P.F., and Frank, A.J., "Reversibly Immobilized Biological Materials in Monolayer Films on Electrodes." U.S. patent no. 5,208,154 issued on May 4, 1993, describes methods for reversibly adsorbing biological materials, including whole cells, to derivatized, high-surface-area electrodes. Electroactive surface groups produce attractive or repulsive forces, which promote cell binding and release. Applications include use in cell harvesting of photobioreactors or to create regenerable high-density, monolayer films for enhanced water-gas shift activity in trickle-filter bioreactors.

U.S. patent No. 5,250,427, issued Oct.5, 1993, describes a hybrid thermochemical/biological process for the photoconversion of organic materials into a biologically made, biodegradable thermoplastic. Gasification of dry organic materials convrts them into a synthetic gas (primarily CO and H2). Capable photosynthetic bacteria convert the CO into H2, which is then photoassimilated largely into polyhydroxyalkanoate thermoplastics. As the thermoplastics are natural products, they can be completely biodegraded by common aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. The U.S. market for single-use thermoplastics in packaging alone is more than 1010 pounds and dollars per year. Weaver, P.F.; Maness, P.-C.; Martin, S.; Muralidharan, S.; and Frank, A.J.

Bacterial strains evolving H2 from CO (or from synthesis gas generated by thermally gasifying biomass) at rates up to 1.5 mmol-g cdw-1-mi -1 are reported. Oxygen-resistant hydrogenase enzymes from bacterial strains isolated from nature are described. The latter are being examined in anticipation of their genetic transfer to cyanobacterial or algal hosts for the stable photoevolution of H2 from H20.

Research in hydrogen utilization is focused on technologies that will most directly facilitate the progression to a hydrogen energy economy. These include fuel cells, internal combustion engines, and hydrogen burners. Using hydrogen and hydrogen-natural gas mixtures as transportation fuels is a sustainable, environmentally friendly alternative to filling our fuel tanks with imported petroleum. To introduce hydrogen successfully into the transportation fuel market, researchers are developing efficient, reliable transportation systems that run on hydrogen. We begin by developing hydrogen-burning internal combustion engines with high brake thermal efficiencies and low emissions; the development of advanced fuel cells; and by addressing important safety issues.

Staff at LLNL will establish the design guidelines, using vehicle simulation studies to determine the optimal size of the engine, the energy-equivalent mileage, and the required hydrogen storage capacity for a given driving range. The storage requirement, which is the quantity of hydrogen needed per refueling, will be used to establish the size of refueling stations and other equipment and to estimate vehicle operating costs. LLNL staff will also design engine experiments that SNL staff will then perform on research engines to acquire the necessary data. Data on emissions, thermal efficiency, and heat transfer losses from the engine experiments will be modeled by LANL researchers using advanced computer models. The results of these experiments and simulations will be used to determine optimal engine characteristics, such as the dimensions of the combustion chamber, the engine speed, the ignition system, and the fuel delivery system. These guidelines will be given to an industrial partner who will manufacture the engine. This engine development project is unique in the history of computationally assisted engine design because it focuses on optimizing an engine for one operational speed. This allows true optimization for fuel efficiency and low emissions with respect to operating conditions, combustion chamber shape, and intake port geometry. Three subprojects make up the Hydrogen Hybrid Vehicles project.

Ultimately,the fuel octane rating determines the upper limit of the compressionratio at which an automotive engine can operate. Automotive engineknock limits the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine and thusthe fuel economy of the vehicle. This will affect spark ignitionengines using hydrogen as a fuel just as it affects those burningconventional hydrocarbon fuels. Calculations were carried out to assess the octane ratings ofhydrogen, methane, and hydrogen/methane mixtures. A previouslydeveloped correlation for a knock-rating engine was used to obtainthe octane ratings, developed for a CFR engine operated by Dr.William Leppard at General Motors Research Laboratories. Thefuel/air mixtures were stoichiometric mixtures, as required foroctane ratings. Leppard has performed experiments to determinethe critical compression ratio for primary reference fuels andhexanes with measured octane ratings ranging from 0 to 104. Criticalcompression ratio is the compression ratio at which a fuel/airmixture will autoignite as a result of compressional heating withoutusing a spark plug. We have developed the capability to computecritical compression ratios with a chemical kinetic model forthe fuel chemistry and a thermodynamic model for engine compression,expansion, and heat transfer. Recent Advances: Using a previously developed correlation curve and computed criticalcompression ratios for methane, hydrogen and methane/hydrogenmixture, predicted octane ratings were obtained. A predictedresearch octane rating (RON) for methane of 119 compared to anexperimental value of 120. Our predicted RON for hydrogen is111, compared to an experimental value of 100. The predictionsshow the correct experimental trend that hydrogen has a loweroctane number than methane. Under slightly different experimentalconditions, Siebers at Sandia National Laboratories found thathydrogen is slightly easier to ignite than methane, also consistentwith our kinetic modeling predictions. Further study is neededof both the prediction and the experimental uncertainty in theoctane number for hydrogen. A 50:50 mixture of methane and hydrogenapparently has a higher octane rating than either neat methaneor hydrogen.WT02-B16-313IA060-000333-B043-176http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hypremx3.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052307 text/html 4049HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:23:11 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:25 GMTContent-length: 3875 Hydrogen InfoNet Development of a Clean, Premixed Burner forHydrogen Utilization Jay Keller, Principal Investigator, Sandia National Laboratories The objectives for this project are to develop an environmentallybenign and safe burner operating on hydrogen in a lean, fullypremixed mode and to provide a facility in which fundamental investigationscan be performed to support other DOE Hydrogen Utilization programs.Three end-use sectors are addressed by this project: power generationfrom stationary turbines; generation of process heat or steam;and commercial and residential direct-use applications. Eliminating carbon from the fuel will remove carbon-containingspecies from the exhaust. However, NOx-resulting from thermalNO production cannot be ignored. Thermal NO production is minimizedby reducing the peak combustion temperature and the residencetime at the peak temperature. NO can be reduced to extremely lowlevels (on the order of 5 ppm or less) by operating in a lean,fully premixed mode to reduce the peak combustion temperature. In premixed systems, a significant volume is required to ensurethorough mixing of the fuel and oxidizer. However, the dangerassociated with flashback has limited the implementation of premixedsystems. The lean premixed combustion project described here isdesigned to systematically investigate the combustion fluid dynamiccharacteristics necessary to provide a fully premixed system capableof completely oxidizing hydrocarbon/hydrogen fuels in a safe,environmentally benign manner. Systems that exploit the mixingcharacteristics of coherent vortical structures and the associatedlarge strain fields will be investigated. The goal of this workis to develop fluid dynamic mixing technologies so that combustionoccurs in a controlled, safe and fully premixed mode. In this work, we capitalize on the fluid dynamic features necessaryto suppress the reaction (through controlling the fluid dynamicstrain rates); provide a controlled mixing environment to rapidlymix reactants on a macroscopic scale (through controlling large-scalecoherent vortical structures); and provide a controlled mixingenvironment to rapidly and thoroughly mix reactants on a microscopicscale (through controlling the three-dimensional breakdown ofthe large structures, and enhanced fine-scale velocity fluctuationsto promote thorough microscopic mixing). Static and periodic methodsof controlling vorticity deposition rate and subsequent behaviorof the resulting large-scale coherent structure will be investigated.Control over the rate and quality of the three-dimensional breakdownof these coherent structures will be achieved through carefuldeposition of additional components of vorticity, and by promotingthe natural breakdown of these large-scale structures by introducingflow features that promote the natural breakdown phenomenon. Thispremixing technology will eliminate the dangerous volumes of premixedgases associated with typical premixing techniques. Recent Advances: All appropriate laboratory modifications needed to satisfy requiredES&H upgrades and for the insertion of the premixed burnerhave been completed. The initial burner concept consists of co-axialaxi-symmetric annular spaces with a stagnation plate to createKelvin-Helmholtz vortical elements followed by a roll-up toroidalvortex element. This geometry provides control over the Kelvin-Helmholtzvortex strength as well as the ability to control the strengthand subsequent breakdown of the toroidal vortex. This burnerhas been designed, and construction should be completed soon.WT02-B16-314IA060-000333-B043-213http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/swain.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052338 text/html 1332HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:23:26 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:27 GMTContent-length: 1158 Hydrogen InfoNet Frictional Analysis for Hydrogen-Fueled Engines: Michael Swain, Principal Investigator, University of Miami Previous research in the use of hydrogen in internal combusiton engines did not address the reduction of internal engine friction. This project is aimed at reducing the internal engine friction to achieve high brake thermal efficiencies from the high indicated thermal efficiencies produced by hydrogen-fueled engines. Research to date has resulted in the design and testing of a dedicated hydrogen-fueled engine that operates without flashback and without timed injection over the full range of fuel-air ratios. The maimum indicated mean effective pressure during operation was 911 kPa (132 psi). The maximum indicated thermal efficiency was 42.0%. The engine design required the construction of a billet aluminum cylinder head and modified piston. Recent Advances This project has just begun.

Conventional hydrogen gas sensors require electrical wiring and may be too expensive to install in many different places within a vehicle. In this project, we are developing a reversible, thin-film, chemochromic sensor that can be applied to the end of a polymer optical fiber. The presence of hydrogen gas will cause the film to become darker. A light beam transmitted from a central instrument in the vehicle along the sensor fibers will be reflected from the ends of the fiber back to individual light detectors. A decrease in the reflected light signal will indicate the presence and concentration of hydrogen in the vicinity of the fiber sensor. The principal of this detection scheme has already been demonstrated by scientists in Japan. However, our goal is to optimize the basic sensor design to speed up the response time and avoid false readings. Recent Advances: Photocatalytic compounds in particulate form are being employedin a dual-bed configuration to effect the solar-driven decompositionof water to its constituent elements, particularly hydrogen. The system advantages are low manufacturing cost, safe evolutionof H2 and O2 in separate vessels, and more efficient use of thesolar spectrum. Having tested numerous redox couples againstInP and TiO2, we may have found two redox couples that can effectO2-evolution in one system and H2-evolution in the other. Theyare iodide/iodate (T/IO3) and bromide/bromate (Br/BrO3). Theseare intrinsically alkaline systems, since they will conproportionateat neutral pH and below to form the respective halogen gases: XO3 + 5X + 6H+ = 3X2 + 3H2O >X = I, Br The characteristics of these two mediators exemplify what is desiredin a redox mediator. High solubility, rapid charge transfer kinetics,optical transparency for both oxidized and reduced forms, andintermediate redox potential. The oxidized form (Ox) of the mediatorwas run against TiO2, while the reduced form (Red) was run againstInP. Now we are testing a more realistic situation, where H2-evolutionwill need to proceed against some background concentration ofOx, and O2-evolution will need to proceed against some backgroundconcentration of Red. Development is under way of methods formonitoring reaction progress via the mediator instead of H2 orO2 gas evolution.WT02-B16-316IA060-000333-B043-318http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/safeanal.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052531 text/html 3775HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:25:35 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:27 GMTContent-length: 3601 Hydrogen InfoNet Safety Analysis of High-Pressure Gaseous Fuel Container Punctures; Michael Swain, Principal Investigator, University of Miami This is a full-scale study to assess the risk of storing hydrogen, as opposed to natural gas, in compressed form. Risks include both the likelihood and the severity of combustion. Previous work comparing hydrogen and natural gas pipeline leakage showed that hydrogen clouds were smaller and contained less energy than natural gas clouds. The current study simulates tank ruptures. The size of the leaked cloud of hydrogen or natural gas is quantified by testing ignitability at the edge of the cloud. In addition, we measure the overpressure produced by igniting the cloud, because this is an indication of the severity of combustion. We use high-speed photography to document the combustion. Leaking high-pressure hydrogen produced a cone-shaped cloud of ignitable gases with 28 included angle, whereas leaking high-pressure methane produced a cone of ignitable gases with 20 included angle. Ignition of hydrogen also produced greater overpressure than did ignition of the natural gas cloud. The largest hydrogen overpressures were comparable to those produced by inflating an 11-inch child's balloon until it bursts. Our results have several implications for improving the design of hydrogen storage systems in vehicles. Venting upward enables the naturally buoyant hydrogen gas to be carried away from the vehicle in the event of an accident. This reduces the likelihood that gases will be trapped in the vehicle and that they will come into contact with ignition sources. In addition, storing compressed gas in many small containers rather than a few large containers can reduce the amount of gas released if a container is ruptured. Recent Advances: We modeled the vehicle performance of our hydrogen-fueled Toyota Tercel with compressed gas storage at 300 psi, using experimental data. This table allows a comparison of our data with performance data on the original gasoline-powered vehicle: Weight Range Horsepower Equivalent Gasoline Mileage 0-60 MPH Elapsed Time Original gasoline-powered 1992 Toyota Tercel 2055 lb 309 miles 82 HP 26 MPG 11.2 sec 1992 Toyota Tercel converted to hydrogen-fueled operation 2229 lb 150 miles 90 HP 45 MPG 11.2 sec In April, we reviewed the notes from the cataloguing of standards, regulations, and codes. Four areas of concern were delineatedand prepared for presentation at the Annual Hydrogen Program ReviewMeeting. Also, full-scale testing was conducted of a fuel compartmentfor on-vehicle compressed hydrogen storage. Hydrogen was leakedinto the bottom of the final compartment at a flow-rate of 3000standard cubic feet per minute and ignited. The maximum temperaturerise recorded, excluding the inner surface of the fuel compartment,was 68°F. This fuel compartment as tested would require42 pounds of polypropylene-reinforced concrete foam. It is believedthat this can be reduced to 12.6 pounds.

Our models will be validated using data obtained from the hydrogen-fueled engines at SNL. The hydrogen modeling tools will be distributed to key personnel in industry, universities, and national laboratories to aid in the rapid utilization of hydrogen fuels. Because there is an extensive network of industrial and academic contacts and users of the KIVA codes, the modeling tools can be quickly distributed to other research centers, at minimal cost and with immediate application. Recent Advances: A vertical and canted valve model was implemented and validated in KIVA-3 to simulate the inlet flows into the hydrogen combustion engine, as required by the sensitivity of the hydrogen combustion rate on in-cylinder turbulence levels. This new valve capability is viewed by our industrial collaborators as a significant advance in realistic engine modeling and is being evaluated by our R&Dpartners among the three major U.S. diesel manufacturers. The valve model in KIVA was used to simulate the current experimental hydrogen-fueled engine at SNL. The use of this model led to an important advance in our understanding of the flow at the time of combustion. We know that significant tumble in the engine leads to excessive turbulence and unnecessary heat loss during combustion. Consequently, the nature of the turbulence at the time of combustion is a major consideration in future engine designs. Studies of hydrogen combustion identified the deficiencies of current, simplified kinetic approaches for hydrogen and are guiding LLNL's development of the kinetics of hydrogen combustion. Recent industrial and academic outreach activities included presentations of the DOE Hydrogen Program and technical contributions at the 5th International KIVA Users Meeting at the 1995 SAE Congress; the '95 Simulation Conference on High-Performance Computing; the 8th International Symposia on Transport Phenomena on Combustion; the 74th ASME-Internal Combustion Engine Conference; the University of Wisconsin Engine Research Center; and the 1995 Fuel and Lubricants SAE Conference.

Aceves, Principal Investigator, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory We are studying hybrid vehicles that have high power-train efficiencies and optimized hydrogen engines that are projected to have efficiencies of 45% or more with extremely low emissions. The relatively low efficiency of the conventional power train (approximately 18%) and modest efficiency of current gasoline-fueled spark ignition engines (with a peak efficiency of about 32%) opens the door for hydrogen as a realistic near-term transportation fuel. For this to happen, we must develop an automobile that has a comparable fuel cost per mile and lower emissions. We are studying hydrogen hybrid vehicles that meet the goals of the next generation of vehicles (with a fuel efficiency of 80 miles per gallon equivalent and a 380-mile range). Our results indicate that such a vehicle appears feasible with an optimized hydrogen engine. Recent Advances: The experimental engine data obtained at Sandia National Laboratorieshave been analyzed and the results have been used for validatingand adjusting the parameters on the heat transfer correlationused in the simplified, zero-dimensional (lumped) engine model. Good agreement has been obtained between the model and the experimentalresults. The validated engine model has been extended to include a frictionmodel and a supercharger model, so that the engine model can beused in predicting engine brake thermal efficiency (net work output/chemicalenergy input). Supercharging is necessary for increasing thepower output of the engine, which would otherwise be very limiteddue to the low equivalence ratio. The extended model has alsobeen used in generating an engine performance map. It is assumedthat an automotive engine is built with four cylinders like thecylinders of an Onan engine. The engine has almost 2 liters ofdisplacement, and can be used in conventional and hybrid vehicles. A conventional vehicle has only one degree of freedom for controllingthe output torque at any given speed: the inlet manifold pressure. A hydrogen engine has two degrees of freedom, because equivalenceratio can also be varied. Generating an engine map thereforerequires specifying a control strategy that states how to adjustthese two parameters to obtain the desired torque for a givenengine speed. In this analysis, an optimizer is used to determinethe combination of equivalence ratio and inlet manifold pressurethat satisfies the torque requirement while providing the maximumengine brake thermal efficiency. Engine NOx emissions are restrictedto less than 10 ppm under all operating conditions. An enginegenerating 10 ppm of NOx is within the proposed CARB EZEV standardsif it is installed in a vehicle with a fuel economy of 40 mpgor higher. Engine efficiency remains reasonably high as torqueis decreased, because the low power can be obtained by reducingequivalence ratio rather than throttling, reducing the pumpinglosses. The engine can be applied to both a conventional carand a series hybrid car. Either of these vehicles should havea high efficiency and low (well under EZEV) emissions.

Initially, we will use an indicated thermal efficiency to determine our progress. Later, our work will focus on maximizing brake thermal efficiency in collaboration with an industrial partner. To reduce NOx emissions, we are operating at a low equivalence ratio (0.4 or less). To maximize efficiency at these conditions, the cylinder inlet flow conditions and combustion chamber shape will be designed to minimize heat transfer while maintaining robust and rapid combustion. We will also examine the effect of the number of ignition points. Recent Advances: The Perkins engine is producing data. We measured the indicatedthermal efficiency for MBT operation at various speeds with anequivalence ratio of about 0.4. We also compiled data for theOnan engine for similar operating conditions. The results indicatethat the Perkins configuration has improved the indicated efficiency,as expected. Of interest is the fact that the Perkins dependenceon speed is less than that for the Onan. The broad speed rangemay allow operation of the engine at various power levels withlittle efficiency penalty. There may be an advantage, with respectto friction reduction, to a slower turning engine, and there maybe room for improvement in the absolute efficiency by adjustingthe inlet flow generated turbulence. The burn durations of thePerkins data are shorter than those of the Onan, in spite of thelarger displacement and single spark plug. This suggests thatthe swirl level in the Perkins may be higher than optimum The experimental results obtained at Sandia for the Onan enginehave been used to generate an engine performance map. Fuel octaneratings for hydrogen, methane and a mixture of hydrogen/methanehave been predicted using a chemical kinetic model and comparedto experimental data. The Perkins engine is producinghigh-quality data. And the modeling of the turbulent hydrogencombustion is continuing. Results indicate that a modificationof a standard simplified hydrocarbon turbulent combustion modelmay be successful.

The focus is primarily on water splitting, but some non-oxygen-evolving systems will also be considered. Attention will be given to the possibility of combined hydrogen production and waste treatment. Two types of processes will be investigated: photoelectrochemical hydrogen production and photobiological hydrogen production. In addition, efforts will focus on the standardization of methods for measuring calculating, and reporting efficiencies.

Recent Activities: An Experts Meeting was held in conjunction with the Autumn Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 25-26, 1995. The meeting included a discussion of the status and progress of ongoing work since the last meeting and discussions in which participants were asked to review and redefine the task and work plan, including subtask activities, objectives, and results.

The emphasis will be on integrated systems and cover all components, from input energy to end use. Activities will focus on near-term and mid-term applications, with some consideration of the transition to sustainable hydrogen energy systems. For hydrogen to become a competitive energy carrier, experience and operating data need to be generated and collected through demonstration projects. Hydrogen technologies must advance beyond the proof-of-concept stage before people will make significant investment in changing the infrastructure. Using hydrogen for energy and fuel has potential environmental and efficiency advantages over continuing to use conventional fossil fuels. However, technical and cost issues may prevent widespread use unless we construct a framework encompassing scientific principles, technical expertise, and analytical evaluation and assessment. Existing and proposed demonstrations of hydrogen energy systems typically demonstrate technologies at different levels of development. Combining data collection, demonstration case studies, component simulation, and integrated systems modeling can assist us in developing design guidelines for future demonstrations. Countries participating in this effort include Canada, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States (Operating Agent). Recent Activities: Following the Subtask Leaders meeting on July 17-18, 1995, the revised work plan and schedule were distributed to members from the participating countries for review and approval. After all approvals were received, work began in September 1995. Initial data collection is under way, and a survey has been distributed to the participating countries to identify and characterize existing or historic hydrogen demonstration projects.

The lack of convenient, cost-effective storage devices for hydrogen is a major limitation to the wider use of hydrogen energy systems. It has been difficult to develop a storage device that meets all these criteria: it uses a minimal amount of energy, it is compact, and it does not add excessive weight to the vehicle. Metal hydrides are a promising approach to storing hydrogen for both mobile and stationary systems that could satisfy these criteria. This annex includes all aspects of investigating and developing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage and transportation. Collaborative work includes laboratory research to synthesize and characterize new hydride materials and surfaces, evaluation of the manufacturability of such systems, and identification of potential applications. Participating countries include Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States (Operating Agent). Recent Activities: An informal working group meeting was held in conjunction with the Gordon Research Conference on Metal Hydrogen Systems (Henniker, NH) on July 17-18, 1995. The purpose of the meeting was to review the annex work plan and reach general agreement on it. A technical workshop was held in Kjeller, Norway, on September 27-28, 1995. Participants were from Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. The Hydride Properties Database The Hydride Properties Database is now available on the World Wide Web. Funded by theU.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Program in support of the International Energy AgencyAnnex 12 project on metal hydrides, this free database is the first of four databases that willeventually make up Sandia National Laboratories' on-line Hydrogen Information Center. TheHydride Properties Database was created to make basic property data available to those interested in utilizing hydrides or beginning research in this area. Structured to allow on-line searches, the database includes numerous hydriding elements, alloys, and intermetallic compounds. Properties covered include tabulations of basic pressure, composition, and temperature (PCT) data. Values of enthalpy and entropy changes are included, allowing users to calculate PCT thermodynamic conditions. Also included are metallurgy and synthesis, activation, kinetics, cyclic stability, morphology, and gas impurity effects. Commercial suppliers, applications, and references for further reading are also part of the database. The Internet address is http://hydpark.ca.sandia.gov/FMProCGI/data_intro.html.

INTRODUCTION During September 1992 through January 1993, a review team establishedby the Department of Energy conducted an assessment of the U.S.biomass power industry. The review team, led by Michael Reedof the Solar Thermal and Biomass Power Division, and consistingof representatives of the Antares Group, Inc., and Meridian Corporation,visited with more than 50 organizations representing all sectorsof the biomass power industry. These organizations included utilities,independent power producers (IPP), component manufacturers, engineeringand construction contractors, agricultural organizations, industrialusers, and regulatory organizations. 1.1 Assessment Objectives and Approach The "Biopower Tour" served many purposes. First, DOEsolicited industry input for the development of the Biomass PowerDivision's "Five Year Plan," which was issued in May1993. DOE believed there was a critical need to obtain industry'sinsight and working knowledge to develop the near- and long-termplans of the program. At the heart of this objective was thedesire to identify near-term initiatives that the program couldpursue to help accelerate the further development of biomass powerprojects. Second, the tour was conducted to identify key playersof the U.S. biomass power industry and gain a better understandingof its needs and goals. Third, the tour served to inform industryabout the mission and scope of the DOE's Biomass Power Program. Many of the organizations were unaware that a biomass power programexisted within DOE. As such, it was important to discuss withindustry the DOE mission, proposed DOE goals, and DOE willingnessto work with them in the future. As discussed in Section 2, the biomass power industry will probablynever be a vertically integrated special industry (fuel supply,equipment manufacture and installation, through project financingand operation) like other renewable energy industries in wind,photovoltaics, solar, and hydropower. As such, it was crucialto identify the key players in this industry, and work with themin identifying their needs. DOE consulted with industry associationsand consultants to identify organizations that had active biomasspower projects and equipment in operation. While the organizationscontacted cannot be considered all inclusive of the parties withpotential interest in biomass power, DOE obtained a good cross-sectionof the industry. The geographic distribution of companies contactedis shown in Exhibit 1-1. In conducting the assessment, DOE presented a standardpresentation as a frame of reference for the meetings, but allowedthe discussions to focus on the issues and opportunities of mostimportance to the industry representatives. The basic intentwas to be a good listener and to try to identify trends and consensusissues. 1.2 Overview of Assessment Findings Biomass power already supplies 6 GWe of power to the domesticgrid and is the primary baseload technology among the renewables. Biomass power facilities have brought new industrial jobs torural areas of the country and spawned several new regional businessesin biomass fuels procurement and delivery. The basic technologyfor producing power is proven for selected feedstocks in plantsizes ranging from 10 to 50 MWe. However, many plants that havebeen fueled by agricultural byproducts or low-grade wood fuelshave experienced operational problems. Fuel sources are currentlylimited to forest thinning materials, wood and agriculture industrybyproducts, or biomass in urban waste streams. The industry mustgenerally rely on short term contracts or the spot market forfuel purchases. The infrastructure for fuel production, collection,and transport is still in a nascent state. Despite rapid growth in the 1980s, the numbers of active biomasspower projects decreased in the 1990s. There are several reasonsfor the lack of current project activity. Power producers haveoften had to use a good deal of ingenuity in their ability toacquire sufficient fuel feedstocks at reasonable costs. Competitionfor a limited feedstock source can drive up the price of the fuelsubstantially and limits the number of projects within a geographicregion. In addition, use of feedstocks with characteristics thatdiffer substantially from the fuel for which a given boiler wasdesigned affects both unit performance and reliability. The competition from natural gas-fired generators has also dampenedthe market for biomass and many other fossil-fueled projects. End-use natural gas prices peaked in the 1980s and have generallydeclined since then. The magnitude of the change varies by end-usesector, with prices declining most for on-system industrial salesand for electric utilities. The price of power generated by naturalgas combustion turbines has also often been the basis for theprice for avoided costs on which most Independent Power Producers'(IPP) power contracts are based. While production and availabilityof natural gas is expected to be maintained if not expanded throughoutthe 1990s, prices have risen since 1991. Despite the current downturn in the market, members of the IPPindustry believe that if the environmental benefits of biomasspower are fully recognized through externalities and if naturalgas prices once again return to prices consistent with the historyof natural gas as a premium fuel, then the market will rebound. The utility industry, which until now has been a relatively smallplayer in the development of biomass projects, is poised to becomea significant interest through cofiring wood at existing coal-firedboilers. This approach will allow them to reap the significantenvironmental benefits associated with biomass. For the nearterm, the IPP industry will survive by continuing to improve operationsat current plants and exploiting niche markets for greenfieldpower plants. Although most project developers expressed interestin the international markets, where capacity growth projectionsare impressive, there was a practical appreciation of the difficultiesof developing projects based on new technology or new fuel sourcesfor that market. Although many differing views were expressed concerning what needsto be accomplished and what role DOE should take to bring abouta "green revolution" in power production, there wasconsensus on the major issues and opportunities: Information and Education: A high visibility informationdissemination campaign needs to be undertaken to correct the mostcommonly held misconceptions about modern biomass-fired powerfacilities and to provide the public and decision makers witha well-founded understanding of the environmental and economicbenefits of utilizing biomass resources for power generation. Environmental Assessment and Valuation: Biomass couldhave the high tech image of photovoltaic power systems, but itwill never be a zero-emissions-generating technology. Its environmentalcharacteristics (both positive and negative) must be accuratelycharacterized and fairly portrayed to the public. Environmentalcharacterizations should be performed by independent industrysources. The environmental benefits must be valued in decisionmaking with respect to power resource choices. Methods to properlyvalue external benefits are still in a developmental stage. EPACT 1992 Implementation: The incentives providedin Sections 1212 and 1914 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (renewableenergy production incentive and renewable electricity productiontax credit) could be important stimuli to biomass power projectdevelopment, particularly for encouraging consideration of investmentsin sustainable dedicated fuel supply systems. Latitude in qualifyingfacilities for the incentives is needed to ensure transitionaltypes of projects can be undertaken (i.e., cofiring). Developing Cofiring Opportunities: Cofiring biomasswith coal represents the best near-term opportunity to increaseuse of biomass fuels among utilities and quickly bring on linebiomass-fired generation capacity. The merits of this fuel switchoption will have to be demonstrated at utility generating stationsfor several types of boilers to encourage widespread acceptance. Expanding the Resource Base: One general area ofneed and opportunity will be projects and activities that expandthe current resource base available to power producers. Nearlyall of the industry representatives for IPPs and utilities expressedthe desire to be able to use a wider base of fuel resources economically. It was very clear from the meetings that the achieved survivalof a nascent biomass power industry would depend on expandingthe availability of diverse low-cost fuel sources. Develop Repowering Opportunities: Many of the generatingunits built by IPPs were constructed when available resourceswere cheaper and purchased-power agreements were generous. Assuch, combustion efficiency was not considered a major issue atthat time. As power purchase agreements expire and new contractsare negotiated, the ability of many of these facilities to continueto be productive will be in question. Repowering projects couldimprove the efficiency and availability of some of these plantsto extend their useful life until a new generation of conversionsystems becomes commercially available. Repowering aging utility-ownedcoal- and oil-fired plants to efficiently produce power from biomassis also a potential area for project development. Develop Products for International and Modular PrepackagedGeneration Markets: For international markets in areas wherepower is frequently needed in smaller increments and biomass resourcesare plentiful, small-scale packaged biomass generators will bevery attractive. On a larger scale, several companies have targetedthe existing agricultural processing industry as potential powerproducers. To open this market, new U.S. products will have tobe demonstrated to meet performance (including cost), maintainability,and reliability claims of the manufacturers. The power generation industry remains interested in the potentialfor biomass power, but sees fewer opportunities to develop profitablegreenfield projects under current market conditions. However,the experience gained in the 1980s is providing a solid base fordeveloping successful projects in the 1990s for niche markets. Cofiring and repowering projects are expected to provide thebest opportunities for continued near-term growth in the use ofbiomass fuels. As will be reported on the following pages, the current industryfaces many hurdles and obstacles. The problems identified bythe survey team, and the potential role that the DOE Biomass PowerProgram can fill to alleviate these problems, will be outlined. However, it must be remembered that input was received from numerousorganizations representing a diverse range of opinion. As such,this report should be viewed as DOE's analysis of the collectivediscussions held with industry. 2. INDUSTRY STRUCTURE & KEY PLAYERS 2.1 Overview The biomass power industry will probably never be a verticallyintegrated specialty industry, unlike renewable energy industriesin wind, photovoltaics, and low-head hydropower. The IPPs, utilities,and engineering and construction (E&C) firms that implementthe technology are unlikely to dedicate all of their resourcesto a single fuel or technology, although they will often committo a small group of technologies that are competitive in the powermarket. Despite the significant differences that the fuel characteristicsof biomass impose on combustion and conversion technology, boilerand gasifier manufacturers will offer products that span the fuelmarket rather than focus on a dedicated fuel capability. As aresult, biomass power will be a subset of the power industry withconstituents in each of its major segments. On the fuel side,the agricultural interests are likely to present a similar picturewith only a few growers dedicating their total resources to asingle crop. The constituents for biomass power are likely tobe organizations who see a profitable future for this generationresource and who have technology that is adaptable to the resourceor project development experience that could give them a competitiveadvantage. In some cases, individual players may make an exclusivecommitment to the biomass option, but they will probably be theexception rather than the rule. 2.2 Components of the Industry The components of the biomass power industry are depicted in Exhibit 2-1 and include: Regulated Electric Utilities Independent Power Producers (IPPs) Utility/Industrial Component Manufacturers Engineering and Construction (E&C) Contractors Agricultural Organizations Industrial Users/Producers Regulatory Organizations Feedstock/Fuel Brokers Organizations in each of the above groups are likely to play akey role in the success or failure of biomass power both domesticallyand abroad. Shown as a second tier player in the diagram arethe investment institutions/organizations that will be calledupon to finance power projects. The importance of these organizationsto the acceptance and development of biomass as a power resourceis such that they can be considered on a par with the first tierplayers in the decision making for power projects. Included inthat category of interests are the insurance firms that provideefficacy insurance for projects. Without such insurance manyprojects would be too risky for investors to underwrite. Theinterests of these groups in the technology are discussed in thesections that follow (and the following Exhibit 2-2), concluding with an evaluation of the role they are likely to play in the development of the resource and implementationof improved technology in future biomass power stations in theU.S. and abroad. 2.2.1 Electric Utilities A handful of utilities have built biomass power stations. Theseare mostly smaller utilities such as municipalities, and the stationsare more often multi-fueled facilities rather than dedicated units. The utilities are important constituents of the industry becausethey represent mainstream users of the technology for bulk powerproduction at a utility scale. In addition, many utilities haveexperimented or continue to experiment with cofiring wood, municipalsolid waste, and coal. Their primary interests in the U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE) Biomass R&D program will be the improvementof the current technologies or the demonstration of the next generationof technology. Regulated utilities are required to provide customerswith safe, reliable, and economic service while earning an agreedupon return on investment. For biomass power, one of the issuesis the impact on the cost of delivery of economical power froma resource that is often not located near electric load centers. Since wheeling of power through systems at reasonably high efficienciesis an increasingly available option to generators, the concernis more one of access to transmission systems with available capacity. Utilities are more likely to support a biopower demonstrationif either can be accomplished through a relatively low capitalretrofit of existing facilities, providing efficiency and reliabilityimprovements. A major concern for such retrofits will be theeffect on current permits for the facility. A review of currentpermits triggered by a possible demonstration of new technologywould be a significant risk for the plant owners. The utilities are not a homogeneous group, and the subgroups withinthe industry have different needs and resources. The major subgroupsare: Investor Owned Utilities (IOU) Municipal Utilities Rural Electric Cooperatives Federal Power Authorities Among these groups, the most active players in biomass projectsare the municipal utilities. Few of the large investor-ownedutilities (IOUs) yet own biomass-fired facilities, but many arepower purchasers from the IPPs. This may change as the scaleof biomass power projects increases. None of the rural cooperativegenerators or the Federal Power Authorities have built biomasspower stations. The capacity growth needs of the smaller IOUs,the rural electric cooperatives, and the municipal utilities arewell suited to the size of current biomass power facilities. However, when larger plants based on dedicated fuel supply systems(DFSS) and advanced conversion cycles are ready for demonstrationat full scale, the larger IOUs are likely to be the power purchasersand/or project developers. Another possible DOE Biomass Program constituent is the coal-firedutilities for whom biomass cofiring might represent an attractiveClean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) compliance option. The TennesseeValley Authority (TVA) has inaugurated a program of assessmentand evaluation for these purposes in cooperation with DOE andthe Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). In addition, aset of utilities for which biomass cofiring appears to have meritwas identified in a recent report prepared by Scott Piscitelloand Christian Demeter of Antares for National Renewable EnergyLaboratory (NREL) entitled 'Biomass Cofiring Analysis Summary.' In summary, the utilities and their research, development, testing,and evaluation arm, EPRI, are an important constituent of theprogram. The utilities' interest in the program is likely tobe in near-term technical improvements to the technology. Theyoffer the potential for joint venture (cost-shared) retrofit demonstrations. They are also the ultimate customer for biomass power technology. Whether they build and operate their own plants or purchase powerfrom the IPPs, they will be key decision makers with regard totechnology acceptance and implementation. In some ways, theymay be considered to have less at stake than other constituentssince their investment is limited to the facilities they operate. Many of these facilities could be converted to other fuels ifeconomics and other factors indicate it would be prudent to doso. 2.2.2 Independent Power Producers A second key constituent for the biomass power industry is theIPPs. The IPPs are similar to the electric utility in that theywill serve as project developers for the industry. Also, thereare IPPs who already own and operate biomass-fired power plants. Along with cogenerators, the IPPs represent the major portionof today's biomass generation capacity. Included in this categoryare JWP Energy Products, Thermo Electron, HYDRA-CO, and Wheelabrator(Exhibit 2-4). The independent power project developer segmentis the most diversified in terms of the organizations involved,ranging from the specialists-companies created solely to developfor this market-to the many subsidiary companies of the utilities,E&C contractors, and equipment vendors vying for a piece ofthe market. Many of the subsidiaries operate with a large degreeof independence under the parent organization and are subjectto the same market factors and interests driving the specialistsin the industry. Under Title IV of CAAA, independently owned generating plantswith capacities of 25 MW or more will be held to the same sulfurdioxide (SO2) emission limits as electric utility plants. However,emission allowances will not be given to the IPPs (as is the casewith the utilities) and will have to be purchased on the openmarket or at emission allowance auctions. Therefore, IPPs' interestin the virtually sulfur-free biomass resource should increaseas the regulation's deadline nears (January 1, 2000). IPPs are well suited to respond to the utilities' current dispositiontowards smaller capacity additions that require modest capitaloutlays. The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA),which mandates electric utilities to buy power from independentproducers using renewable sources or cogeneration, sets an upperlimit of 80 MW on the producer's capacity. This size fits thecapacity addition range needed by many utilities. This rangealso matches the capacities of installed biomass power facilities. Thus, there often is a match between the size of plants thatwill be constructed by IPPs operating under PURPA, the capacityadditions which the utilities desire, and the size associatedwith current biomass resources. The competitive bid process beingutilized in many states for resource acquisitions is beginningto affect this market to some degree, increasing the size of manyrecent IPP projects. Scale-up of biomass technology will be moreimportant as this trend continues. Biomass can also be used to cogenerate electricity with processheat (steam). This creates opportunities for IPPs to work withindustrial participants (such as the pulp and paper industry orthe wood products industry) who can supply the biomass resourceand also offer a host for the process heat. An interesting marketfor biomass-based cogeneration may be industrial participantswho currently operate natural gas/gas turbine technology. Forexample, the Boise Cascade pulp and paper plant in Fort Francis,Ontario currently operates an 86-MW natural gas-fired combinedcycle unit. Biomass gasifiers could be installed at such locationsand coupled to the existing combustion turbines. Underlying the success of the IPP industry is the advantage ofoperating under less regulatory burden than the electric utilities. Therefore, the IPP is less constrained in their generating technologyoptions and have a greater ability to take risks and earn healthyrates of return. In contrast to regulated utilities, the IPPsare dependent upon the capital investment markets for projectfinancing. More recently, these investors are requiring greaterfinancial exposure of the developers and other participants inthe projects to ensure their interests in protecting the investment. This tends to result in a greater degree of conservatism in site,resource, and technology choices for new projects. This is exemplifiedby the current emphasis on natural gas combustion turbine projects. For the IPPs to be successful, they will need to work with utilitiesto identify locations for projects that can tap into existingtransmission and distribution capabilities and that are near areasof increasing electric power demand. 2.2.3 Utility and Industrial Power Component Manufacturers The traditional suppliers of utility power generation hardwareare large, well-financed, heavy equipment manufacturers. Nearlyall have international operations and compete in a global market. All of these companies also have product lines and services aimedat the industrial power market. In the industrial market, thereare smaller specialty companies who also serve the market. Someof these firms, such as JWP Energy Products, may dedicate theirproduct line to biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW); however,these firms are the exception. Nevertheless, the equipment vendorsare important biomass program constituents because they are themost likely participants in hardware R&D, with a stake inthe advancement of the state of the art. Pictured in Exhibit 2-5 is an Ahlstrom/Pyropower biomass-fired fluidized bed unit. Both bubbling and circulating fluidized bed boilers are representativeof state-of-the-art utility boilers capable of handling a widevariety of biomass fuels. Among the larger vendors, there are sufficient resources to support,through cost-sharing, the DOE R&D program if the corporatecommitment exists. Those companies that have invested in thecoal gasification option may be inclined to make a serious commitmentto the biomass gasification alternative if they see a strong potentialmarket and view the biomass conversion option as a hedge on theirinvestment in developing coal conversion equipment. For thisreason, the companies involved in coal gasification should beviewed as potential partners in the biomass power program. Asimilar argument can be made for the manufacturers of hot gascleanup equipment. In contrast, the gas turbine manufacturers are less likely tocommit resources to develop a new turbine tailored to biomassderived fuels. Manufacturers of turbo-machinery designed forthe low-Btu gases supplied by coal will likely already have aproduct for the biomass gasification process. However, the fuelof choice for the foreseeable future is natural gas, and motivationto invest in alternative fueled turbine development is nil. 2.2.4 Engineering and Construction Contractors Often power equipment manufacturers, such as General Electric,Westinghouse, and ABB Combustion Engineering, take on the roleof E&C contractor. In other situations, companies are dedicatedto E&C and are not involved with component manufacturing (e.g.,Black & Veatch, Stone & Webster). In either circumstance,electric utilities and IPPs rely on E&C contractors for largetasks that may be beyond the responsibilities they wish to bear. For this reason, the E&C firms must be kept abreast of, andinvolved with, the Biomass Power Program. The most importantof these firms' capabilities is turnkey services, in which theyare responsible for coordination of feasibility, design, procurement,construction, start-up, and operation. Some of these firms evenassist in financing. Often the contractor can supply some orall of these individual services in addition to the coordination. Due to the similarities between biomass power technologies andmore traditional technologies (e.g., biomass IGCC/coal IGCC similarities),E&C contractors can easily make the transition to the biomasspower industry. In fact, several manufacturers, including Babcock& Wilcox and Foster Wheeler, have already provided turnkeyservices at biomass-fired facilities, generally for the pulp andpaper and sugar processing industries. 2.2.5 Industrial Users and Cogenerators The wood products industry and pulp and paper mills have usedbiomass fuels on a broad scale for process heat and self generation. PURPA brought in a new set of players building biomass-firedcogeneration systems supplying industry with process steam andelectricity, and also feeding power back to the grid as a qualifyingfacility. However, the primary objective of the mills is to disposeof the unused byproducts; heat and power generation are generallysecondary benefits. With the trend in the industry toward wasteminimization and alternative uses for unused byproducts of highervalue than fuels, the availability of these sources will tendto decrease in the future. For the cogeneration project developers,the number of attractive sites with hosts for process steam havedwindled. Currently the wood products industry is the primary supply sourcefor biomass fuels for power projects. That role is expected tocontinue throughout the 1990s. The importance of this group tothe development of biomass power is probably its knowledge oflarge scale feedstock production, transportation, processing andhandling systems, and its holdings or rights to large areas ofpotential feedstock production, which might give it a competitiveadvantage in entering the production phase of the business. Nearlyall of the major businesses involved in the wood and paper productsindustry have had power generation experience including Georgia-Pacific,Boise-Cascade, and Weyerhaeuser. 2.2.6 Biomass Fuels and Fuel Feedstocks The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has ongoing programsthat are looking at specialty crops for biomass fuel production;for example, rapid growth poplars and switch grass, and has signeda Memorandum of Understanding with DOE to pursue these programsjointly. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a current projectfocused on the development of a biomass fuels model that can projectresource availability based on plant type, soil characteristics,water availability, climate, and other characteristics. However,from a less technical viewpoint, what also needs to be investigatedis to what extent current agricultural subsidies and allowanceswill enhance or slow the transition by the agricultural sectorto biomass fuel crops. It may be appropriate to look in detailat the economics of biomass fuels production to insure the resourceavailability at a cost-competitive price. The analysis shouldconsider the environmental costs as well as the national/regionaleconomic benefit of relying on a domestically produced fuel. These economic benefits would include an increase in jobs, reductionin energy imports, and an increase in federal, state, and localtax revenues. 2.2.7 Regulatory Agencies The decisions of the regulatory agencies affect nearly all aspectsof power production and can be pivotal in the development of thebiomass power industry. A favorable view toward the environmentaland economic benefits of biomass power could lead to changes inthe competitive bidding process and integrated resource planning(IRP) being instituted in most states in the U.S. and potentiallyin foreign jurisdictions as well that might give biomass a competitiveadvantage. Equally, an unfavorable ruling on biomass environmentalimpacts could hurt biomass projects across the board-permitting,competitive bidding, cost of construction and operation, and generationefficiency. Generally, regulatory agencies will not championtechnology or resources, but they certainly have the power toinfluence resource choices by penalizing the perceived negativeimpacts of specific resource and technology choices. From thisstandpoint, DOE cannot afford to ignore the information needsand technical concerns of the regulatory bodies. In effect thismay be an important way in which the Biomass Power Program canassist industry toward near-term implementation of biomass projects. The degree of objectivity shown by DOE in presenting its laband field test findings with respect to biomass power technologywill have a profound affect on their acceptance by the regulators. A number of regulatory agencies at the national (EPA) and local(e.g. South Coast Air Quality Management District, CA) level haveR&D resources for evaluation of environmental characteristicsof new energy technologies and could be contributing partnersin the Biomass Power Program. A number of the PUCs nationwidehave been or are in the process of commissioning analytical studiesof the use of environmental adders (externalities) in the resourceselection process and other important refinements to the IRP process. 3. DYNAMICS OF THE MARKETPLACE The marketplace for biomass power projects is influenced by manyfactors. Some of these factors, such as the low cost of natural gas inthe past several years, make it difficult for the biomass poweroption (and many other conventional or renewable fuels) to competeon a simple production cost bid basis. Other influencing factors,such as negative public perception, can be overcome with increasedinformation dissemination. Meetings with industry representativesfocused on the following issues as being the areas of greatestchallenge. 3.1 Cost of Electricity Biomass power projects are relatively capital intensive (comparableto coal, but less than nuclear) and must generally be operatedas baseload stations to make the investment economic. The busbarcost-of-electricity (COE) is a common figure of merit used tocompare generation alternatives. A high capacity factor reducesthe impact of the capital cost component of the plant COE. Thisincreases the relative importance of fuel and other operatingcosts as components of COE. Once a project is operational, theplant will be dispatched solely on its relative cost to operatecompared to other plants in the system. Thus, for a biomass powerproject to contribute value to the utility system, operating costsmust be competitive with other choices. The primary drivers foroperating costs are station heat rate and fuel cost with low heatrate and fuel cost being the winning combination. (IPPs generallyhave contracts requiring the utilities to buy as much electricityas the IPP can produce, but the price paid for power is fixed. Thus, the IPP has a similar motivation to minimize fuel costsand heat rate, though it is driven more by profitability thandispatchability.) 3.1.1 Low Cost Power Generation Options Natural gas prices have remained relatively low in recent years,while natural gas combined cycle plants have increased the efficiencyof power production dramatically. This price moderation for whatis usually viewed as a premium fuel has allowed electricity generationcosts to approach 4¢/kWh with this fuel source. Althoughmore regional in nature (i.e. in the northwest U.S.), low-headhydropower costs are in this range as well. Relicensing issuessurrounding existing hydro sites are expected to significantlyconstrain the use of this resource. Because the natural gas optionis widely available, it has become the standard for many utilitiesin setting a floor on resource bids. More recently, gas priceshave begun to rebound and will probably escalate at a moderatelevel during the rest of the decade. 3.1.2 Feedstock Availability and Cost Feedstock availability and cost strongly influence the COE associatedwith biomass power facilities. Biomass feedstock collection canbe labor intensive, especially when obtained from the forest floor. Also, because biomass has a higher bulk density per unit heatinput than coal, it has higher associated transportation and handlingcosts. In the northwest, environmental concerns (i.e. spottedowl habitat) have greatly affected the timber industry. Thisdirectly affects the feedstock availability for biomass powerplants in that region. In California, the rapid development ofbiomass power facilities in the 1980s (as a result of PURPA legislation),created a high demand, causing biomass fuel prices to skyrocket. Furthermore, as pulp and paper mill operations become more efficient,there is less byproduct resource available. Competing end-usesfor biomass resources, such as for landscaping mulch, maintaindemand-side pressure. Countering those forces to some degree are trends such as therestrictions on landfilling that may increase the availabilityof process byproduct resources in the market. As electricity pricesincrease, pulp and paper mills will want to become more self-sufficientin power, and repowering with high-efficiency biomass-fueled powersystems will be more desirable. 3.2 Financing/Lending Institutions Another obstacle encountered in the today's markets for new poweris securing financing. Securing financing for biomass projectscan be more difficult than for conventional projects due to higherperceived risks. For all IPP projects, the recent trend of requiringa higher equity stake on the part of the developer is forcingtechnology toward the tried and true. Lending institutions arevery reluctant to finance the construction of biomass power plantswithout an established long-term fuel supply infrastructure. Apower plant will not be financed without a fuel supply infrastructure,and the fuel supply infrastructure will not be created withouta market for the biomass fuel. In addition, despite the needfor the use of higher efficiency conversion systems to make biomasspower fuels competitive, most lenders are uncomfortable with newor unfamiliar power generation technology. Thus, perceived risksin financing can be a significant hurdle to the introduction ofthe technology that is needed to move the industry forward. 3.3 Environmental and Permitting Regulations A recurring concern echoed throughout the industry is dealingwith variable and changing permitting requirements. Federal,state, and local regulations present a veritable maze to the biomassplant developer, Exhibit 3-2. In addition, biomass power is seenas a relatively new technology concept where many regulators areconcerned. Therefore, whenever a developer is applying for permitsfor a biomass plant, he must first educate the appropriate regulatorsconcerning biomass technology. This has the practical effectof sending the permitting process back to square one for everynew biomass plant, where each aspect of the plant must be documentedand/or proven, over and over again. This approach may also beseen as unnecessarily burdensome, given the potentially beneficialenvironmental aspects of biomass power compared to some conventionalplants. It is hoped that once regulators are educated as to thebenefits of biomass power, some of this repetition could certainlybe eliminated (placing biomass on at least an equal footing withconventional power sources), and perhaps even some informal streamliningcould take place. An example presented to the survey team indicatedthat the permitting process for a new plant took three years andcost $3 million. Streamlining the permitting process would bea logical step for organizations hoping to encourage the use ofbiomass power. 3.4 Power Purchase Agreements and Externality Considerations Competitive bidding practices pit IPP generation options againsteach other and utility-financed options. This practice is graduallyreplacing the avoided-cost power contract. On a simple firstcost basis, gas combustion turbines tend to have a clear advantage. However, some jurisdictions are beginning to value externalitiessuch as environmental and economic impacts in the competitivebid process. These factors tend to level the playing field forbiomass power and other alternatives. In bids where these factorshave been given significant weight, biomass power projects haveproven to be competitive. Exhibit 3-3 indicates the potential effect of several externalitiesas they might be applied to a cofiring retrofit project for anexisting coal-fired facility. While the trend is toward givingthese considerations more weight, the process and methods arestill controversial and far from being widely used. One approachfavored by several states has been the use of set-asides of blocksof power for acquisition of renewables. This approach lets renewablescompete among themselves and avoids the use of a complex systemof cost adders in the bid process. In February 1993 the administration proposed a broad-basedenergy tax covering fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and hydroelectricpower. 'Non-conventional' fuels, including biomass,were excluded. The Administration stated the objectives of thetax were to increase energy efficiency, improve the environment,enhance national security, and strengthen domestic economic performance. The tax was to be indexed to the energy content of the fuelsand was proposed at 25.7¢/MMBtu. Although it is unlikelythat the conference committee bill will include the Btu tax inthis form, it is expected that the trend toward valuing externalitiesin tax measures will be an approach given serious considerationby legislators. 3.5 Public Perception It appears that as a whole, the biomass power industry suffersfrom a public relations problem. Much of the general public (andto some extent the regulatory community) views biomass combustionas an old (1930s) style combustion technology or, worse, as acover for waste incineration. Environmental and economic benefitsof the technology are not often taken into account. Public awarenessabout today's biomass power generation, on a national level, isessentially nonexistent. This lack of awareness and/or misconceptionabout biomass power often causes unfounded community concernsregarding the siting of biomass power facilities. Industry perceives a further complication of this problem by thegovernment's failure to take a firm stance with regard to developingbiomass as a national resource for its economic and environmentalbenefits in power generation. Industry lacks the independenceto evaluate and promote these benefits to the public. Thus, theburden of reaching the public on the need for biomass power fallsto DOE which, in conjunction with the USDA and EPA, must presenta united or at least coordinated front on the issues to be resolvedand benefits that can be achieved through promoting biopower. 4. OPPORTUNITIES As a result of the assessment team's discussions,a number of important opportunities for coordinated efforts andpossible joint ventures between DOE and industry were apparent. Each of these areas can produce important near term results thatwill spur the continued development of the biomass resource andgeneration capacity in the 1990s. These opportunities receivedstrong consideration in the development of the DOE Five-Year Plan. 4.1Cofiring Biomass and Coal in Utility Boilers Cofiring alternative fuels, such as biomass and coal (or other fossil fuels), has beenconducted on an experimental basis by utilities without much fanfarethroughout the U.S. (See Exhibit 4-1) Experiencevaried with boiler configuration. In pulverized coal boilers,cofiring has been limited to a few percent of heat input. Incoal stokers, the percentage cofiring has been increased intothe 25% to 50% range, while fluidized bed boilers have been firedwith mixtures that span the full range. Cofiring, as a strategyelement of the Biomass Power Program, provides one of the bestopportunities to quickly bring the utilities into the fold ofbiomass resource users. IPPs that build or own coal-fired stationsmay also be interested. From the utility point of view, cofiringis attractive for several reasons. Cofiring of inexpensive byproductfuels solves two problems. It helps mitigate a waste wood disposalproblem that is becoming increasingly burdensome for industrialcustomers, municipalities, and citizens. As landfill restrictionsare tightened and operating costs spiral upward, the diversionof waste wood from landfills to the power generator as a low/no-costfuel resource can provide direct consumer benefits. Not onlyis landfill space preserved, but consumer waste disposal costsand customer power rates may be lowered. If the byproduct fuelscan be procured at a near zero cost, it may provide the only opportunityto revitalize some smaller capacity coal units that are no longereconomical to dispatch as base or intermediate load plants. Cofiringis also a low-risk, low-capital cost option. This makes it amuch easier sell to both utility management and the Public UtilitiesCommission. Other cogent factors favoring cofiring from the utilityperspective include: Direct environmental benefits of bothreduced air emissions (lower SOx, NOx, and CO2 emissions) andreduced solid waste streams. Thus, biomass provides power whiledemonstrating corporate commitment to a cleaner environment. Possible economic benefits accruing to SO2 allowances and avoidanceof potential carbon taxes. Fewer permitting problems by introducingthis 'new' fuel on a partial basis at existing permittedfacilities. Fuel flexibility providing negotiating advantagesin fuel procurement for coal and biomass. From the DOE perspectiveseveral factors make this strategy attractive: This strategyelement is also a low risk to DOE on both the investment and technicalends. Cofiring offers the best near-term opportunity to bringthe traditional utility companies into the biomass power arenaproviding them with fuel procurement, permitting, and operationalexperience. Environmental regulators and the public are affordedthe opportunity to evaluate the use of biomass fuels in a permittingsetting that is far less threatening. Cofiring is a technologychoice that can deliver its share of the power generation capacitygoal set for the biomass power program in SOLAR 2000. Cofiring can provide the lower risk transition step to DFSS development. Onlytwo utilities have cofired coal and biomass on a continuous basis. These are Tacoma Public Utilities and Northern States Power. Burlington's McNeil plant was designed to operate solely on woodfuel but was later converted to cofire natural gas (at low summerrates) and biomass to improve plant economics and dispatchability. Inthe Southeast and mid-Atlantic region, several utilities haveexperimented with cofiring biomass and coal in existing utilityboilers. Santee Cooper has successfully fired a 5% mix of biomassand coal on a temporary basis. Others, including Delmarva andCarolina Power and Light, have run wood/coal cofiring tests. TVA is undertaking a year long study of retrofit options for itscoal-fired power stations as well as resource assessments. Earlyresults indicate that there are units that could be adapted forpulverized wood firing with minimal impacts on boiler operation. The Southern Company is in the midst of a similar assessmentand is already cofiring wood and paper processing byproducts ona limited basis at several facilities in the system. In fact,the Southern Company affiliated utilities have expressed a desireto implement pilot plant conversions at several smaller stationsin the system. In the Northeast, Niagara Mohawk is investigatingopportunities to cofire a number of alternative fuels in its coal-firedfacilities primarily to take advantage of very low cost byproductfuels to improve the dispatchability of existing coal-fired stationson an economic basis. NYSEG is already cofiring wood chips ona limited basis (less than 1%) and has expressed similar reasonsfor its interest in cofiring. It is important to note that utilitiesdid not feel that SO2 reductions alone will have a significantenough benefit to make cofiring a good investment. It is clearthat other factors will have be present to make a cofiring retrofitworthwhile. In some discussions, previous attempts to cofiremore difficult biomass fuels, such as peat, or cofire by directlymixing minimally processed biomass on the coal pile, led to operationalproblems that has left some plant operators skeptical. A cofiringinitiative on the part of DOE will have to consider these concernsin addition to the other concerns typically raised for use ofbiomass fuels. Several strategy elements and issues are evolvingfrom these and other similar assessments in the region. For interestedutilities, the unknowns and concerns that need to be addressedinclude: Potential boiler operation impacts: efficiency losses,increased slagging potential, boiler capacity derating, fuel feedcontrol and boiler response, downtime for retrofits, combustioninstability, and unknown levels of emissions (NOx, VOCs, CO, SOx,PM10). Fuel delivery, handling and stocking concerns: fueldeliveries (access and congestion), on-site fuel storage arearequired for low density fuel, fuel pile emissions, fire hazardsand decomposition, separate on-site fuel processing equipmentneeds, fuel feed and boiler interconnections, fuel processingand handling safety, system flexibility for coal/biomass interchangeand systems reliability. Fuel procurement: availability,price and its impact on plant dispatchability, fuel contract administration,fuel quality assurance and variability. Impacts on environmentalcontrols: ESP, baghouse or scrubber performance impacts and theirconsequences for permit compliance or review. Impacts on plantstaffing. In addition, plant managers will want to know if thepositive benefits of cofiring outweigh the possible problems ofplant and operational modifications to accommodate the use ofthe fuel. To convince system and plant managers to pursue cofiringprojects, joint venture activities must address the issues inthree ways. First and foremost, there is a desire to see thatretrofits can be made with minimal impacts on plant capacity,operations, and dispatchability. Second, the benefits of cofiringmust translate into meaningful incentives. This could include: achieving NOx or SOx compliance through cofiring withoutfurther modifications increased run-time (capacity factor)due to reduced operating costs and/or environmental dispatch incentives,such as carbon dioxide caps on generation reductions in loadingsof local municipal landfills from industrial sources due to diversionto cofiring facilities Third, the fuel procurement systems mustbe demonstrated to assure plant managers that a sufficient long-termsource of known quality fuel will be available to the plant. Thetypes of projects that are required include generic design studiesfor each of the major boiler configurations, demonstration projectsdesigned to address all aspects of the retrofit and cofiring operations. Specific joint venture hardware tests might include: evaluationof preprocessing equipment capability to meet desired fuel specificationsthat minimize boiler modifications (fuel dryers, and mills); evaluations of alternative boiler retrofit options to optimizecombustion stability, completeness, and minimize regulated emissions; evaluations of boiler and fuel feed equipment configurationsthat permit a high degree of flexibility with respect to fuelmix and boiler response to load changes; on the institutionalside, initiatives that address possible evaluation of changesin dispatch rules and system operations and accounting that provideincentives based on the demonstrated benefits of cofiring. 4.2 Expanded Resource Availability One general area of need andopportunity will be projects and activities that expand the currentresource base available to power producers. As can be seen inExhibit 4-2, byproducts such as agricultural residues represent the upperend of the current supply curve in California. The possibilitiesraised span the potential market from wood and paper byproductstreams to energy crops as a supplemental source. Nearly allthe IPP and utility representatives expressed the desire to beable to use a wider base of fuel resources economically. It wasvery clear from the meetings that the continued survival of thenascent biomass power industry would depend on the expansion ofavailability of diverse, low-cost fuel sources. Each potentialresource has a specific set of issues to be addressed althoughenvironmental, collection and permitting issues pervade them all. Many of the potential feedstock sources are byproducts of industrialor agricultural operations. It will be more efficient for theBiomass Power Program to work jointly with DOE Industrial EnergyR&D Programs and USDA Product Development Programs to developthese resources. Efficient collection of agricultural residues. Orchard prunings, and wheat and rice straw are a few of the sourcesthat the IPPs and utilities expressed interest in utilizing asa fuel source. However, these residues can be costly to collectand their availability is seasonal. The further tightening ofopen field burning restrictions could prove to be a strong motivatingfactor for these efforts. Estimates of the farmer's cost to collectand bail wheat materials range from $17 to $30 per ton. Furthermore,the resource is low density, on the order of 1 to 3 tons per acreper year. The desirable solution appears to be the developmentof collection processes that are integrated with harvesting. By densifying and collecting the material as a part of the harvestingprocess, these fuels could be affordably collected. Collectionmust then be augmented by an efficient delivery system to transportfuels to the plant. Increasing the availability of residuesfrom improved forest management practices. In Californiaand the Pacific Northwest, concerns for habitat protection continueto be strongly supported. However, the economic downturn coupledwith recent experiences with forest fires and the desire to useforest resources to benefit economic growth have spurred effortsto institute forest management practices that consider the benefitsof removing salvageable materials that would otherwise be tinderfor forest fires. The industry that must operate in this regiongenerally feels that the level of emotion that pervades the forumon the use of forest lands is hamstringing productive and environmentallysound uses of the resource. The initiative that the industryis seeking here is to involve DOE and the Forest Service in effortsthat would gain acceptance for good management practices thatprovide for the health of forests while permitting economic useof the available resources. Opportunities to demonstrate thesepractices are being developed by the owners of Biomass One ineastern Oregon at a 5-MWe site. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)has indicated its willingness to offer a renewable generationrate for such projects and the Bonneville Power Administration(BPA) could also be a player in this process. The situation inVermont is similar, but the driving force for access to forestresources has been towards management programs designed to cullthe low-value species that predominate in Vermont woods to allowhigh-value species to make a comeback. Burlington Electric considersits fuel harvest management approach to be a model for the industry. Burlington suggested that one area where federal support couldbe of direct assistance would be in providing resources to thestate forestry and agriculture programs to underwrite the costsof surveying forest resources, developing harvest management plans,and providing manpower for inspection to assure compliance withauthorized harvest plans. This would directly reduce costs bornsolely by the utility that increase fuel procurement costs. Tapping treated mill byproduct materials. In additionto untreated wood byproducts, the industry would like to accessother mill byproduct streams such as pulping process byproductsor treated wood byproducts (fiberboard, plywood). The abilityto economically process these byproducts into transportable fuelforms and burn them without environmental permitting repercussionsis the primary issue. JWP Energy Products, Inc., is concludinga project in Virginia that burns paper mill sludges at a rateof 32 DTPD. Wheelabrator expressed interest in processes thatwould pelletize pulp and paper sludges for fuel. These fuelsare potentially of most value to the mills for cogeneration. Tapping low-value paper byproduct streams. Treatedpaper products such as newsprint, colored or finished paper andchemically impregnated cardboard byproducts are difficult to recycleinto new paper products. Rather than landfill these materials,recycling them as fuels would be desirable. One of the industrycontacts pointed out that the recycling of low-value paper sourcesto produce paper often generates more mill sludge than paper. For these materials, fuel uses may be the higher value use withthe least environmental impact. JWP Energy Products, Inc., isparticularly interested in developing a multi-fueled energy projectin northern Idaho to demonstrate low emissions from today's fluidizedbed combustion technology. Tapping urban wood materialsfrom the solid waste stream. Several efforts are being pursuedthat tap into the urban wood materials supply, thus divertingit from the solid waste stream. Burlington is accepting yardand tree trimmings at the McNeil station. Wheelabrator is inthe process of building a 39-MWe energy facility in Polk County,Florida, that will burn a combination of yard and tree trimmings,used tires, and landfill gas. Thermo Energy has three operatingfacilities and is completing a fourth that use urban wood as afuel source. Use of urban wood has been extensively evaluatedby New York State and others as an important source of fuel forpower production. Use of urban wood directly reduces landfillloading and provides low-cost fuel for power production. Theprimary issue has been concern with air emissions from the useof treated wood products. The NYSERDA work generally indicatesthat with the exception of CCA-treated wood, the exposure risksof combusting most treated wood are very slight or insignificantand meet state guidelines. NYSEG is particularly interested inspecialized used wood streams and is evaluating fuels such asrailroad ties and telephone poles. Forced recycling goals forCalifornia and other jurisdictions may make these fuel sourcesmore accessible. Early development of dedicated feedstocksupply system (DFSS) projects to supplement other fuel sources. Possible use of DFSS as a source of fuel is being consideredfor projects in Alabama, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin, New York,the Tennessee Valley, and California. EPRI is very supportiveof this approach for two reasons: long term supply assurance anddisassociation of biomass from the potential environmental problemsof misusing forest resources, and limitations of byproduct orwaste fuels. Two things appear to be necessary for the DFSS conceptto be accepted as economic for current industry projects-assurancesthat the EPACT 92 production tax credits can be used by the projectand the ability to serve several markets with the biomass products(eg. white wood going to paper production, bark and lesser gradesof wood harvested going to fuel uses). In New York, NYSEG, NiagaraMohawk, and SUNY (Syracuse) are pursuing a trial DFSS projectbased on hybrid willow clones. The fuel produced would be testco-fired in utility coal-fired boilers. In Virginia, poplarsgrown on existing farm acreage are being considered as a potentialfuel supplement option for obtaining a secure long-term fuel supplyrequired by lenders for a wood-fired IPP project. In California,the DFSS option is being given consideration as a supplementalfuel source to provide an alternative to current sources thatare in high demand by competing uses. Ag West Resources has proposeda DFSS project to support the Thermo Energy project at Woodland,California. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)is working with the University of California-Davis to identifythe four most productive DFSS species for the Sacramento valley. With passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)pending, California is very concerned about the decline in stateagriculture with the opening of markets to products produced inMexico. In the Tennessee Valley, DFSS projects offer the abilityto expand the use of biomass fuel sources needed to implementTVA's coal- and wood-cofiring strategy without recourse to harvestsfrom environmentally sensitive resources. Another interestingconcept put forth is the dual purpose use of energy crops as erosioncontrol and ground water filtering systems. This increases thevalue of the DFSS as a dual-purpose system. In the San JoaquinValley, 600,000 eucalyptus and casuarina trees (some poplars alsotested) have been planted to control erosion and absorb seleniumsalts from irrigation runoff.1 4.3 Repowering Existing SteamTurbine Stations Many of the generating units built by IPPswere constructed when available biomass resources were inexpensiveand purchased power agreements were generous. As such, combustionefficiency was not considered a major issue at that time. Aspower purchase agreements expire and new contracts are negotiated,the ability of many of these facilities to continue to be economicallyproductive will be in question. In addition to tougher powercontracts, stricter environmental regulations and a tighter woodsupply situation are threatening the economic health of the industry. In California, IPP and QF biomass power stations now accountfor approximately 4% of total generation for PG&E. Repoweringprojects can improve the efficiency and availability of some ofthese plants to extend their useful life until a new generationof conversion systems becomes commercially available. This isalso true for two other classes of power facilities: wood-firedunits operated by the pulp and paper industry, and aging coal-firedplants operated by the utilities or industry. The pulp and paperindustry would benefit from a greater degree of self sufficiencywhile the utilities could upgrade and extend the life of olderunits. Options include: Gasification of agricultural biomassfuels to fire boilers previously plagued by slagging problems. Low-temperature gasification can produce a fuel gas that willbe free of slagging materials and can be fired in existing boilersat relatively high efficiency and with increased plant availability. There are a number of plants that have plentiful resources ofagricultural byproducts but cannot keep the boiler in operationdue to severe slagging problems. Gasification could provide thesolution to reintroduce the agricultural byproduct fuels intothe operation. Gasification combined cycle retrofits to increaseefficiency and reduce operating costs. Repowering existing boilerswith a gasification combined cycle offers the potential to salvageprojects where fuel costs have made biomass operations uneconomic(See Exhibit 4-3). Green Mountain Power, with assistancefrom EPRI, is giving this option consideration. Burlington Electric'sMcNeil Station is currently dispatched on an economic basis ata low capacity factor and is a possible candidate for repowering. Approximately 40% of generated power is currently produced usinggas available during the summer at very low cost. Gasificationcombined cycle would reduce fuel operating costs by as much as25%. Paper and wood products industries such as Weyerhaeuserhave expressed interest in the gasification combined cycle withthe intent of being even more self sufficient in terms of self-producingpower for plant operations. 4.4 Modular Scale Prepackaged GeneratingSystems and Custom Built Agripower Systems for International Markets Forinternational markets in areas where power is frequently neededin smaller increments and biomass resources are plentiful, smallscale packaged biomass generators will be very attractive. Severalcompanies are evaluating the market and the technology that wouldbest serve the market. One company, Energeo, is committed todevelopment of those markets with the intent to offer a line ofprepackaged indirect-fired gas turbine generators sized from 200kW up to several Megawatts (See Exhibit 4-4). PGI is also developing a product (direct-fired small gas turbines)well suited to this market. The opportunity exists for smallscale, modular biomass systems to compete in the internationalmarketplace with diesel-powered generators. By using an inexpensiveindigenous resource, biomass power systems reduce dependence onhigh-cost, imported fossil fuels. Other companies have indicatedinterest in offering prepackaged systems for biomass fuels basedon more conventional conversion equipment. On a larger scale,Agrilectric, JWP Electric, and other companies have targeted theexisting agricultural processing industry as potential power producers. The sector that has attracted the most initial interest is thesugar industry, which typically uses its byproducts to produceprocess heat. By converting to higher efficiency cogenerationequipment at these facilities, the industry and local economystand to benefit by the additional income generated by power sales. Both JWP and Agrilectric offer products that are suited to thecombustion of agricultural fuels. Industries actively pursuinginternational markets are aware of the programs sponsored by USAIDand Winrock and in several instances are already benefiting fromthese 'technical assistance missions' to developingnations. The industry generally felt that these programs werehelpful and should not be duplicated by DOE. One element theseprograms do not address is the need to demonstrate performance,maintainability, and reliability claims of the manufacturers. The need to see, first hand, a system operating on local feedstocksfor an extended period of time (up to one year) and to realizethe projected cost savings for replacing aging diesel equipment,is commonly expressed by the purchasing agents of the governmentsof developing nations. An opportunity exists for DOE to pursuejoint venture projects in strategic locations worldwide that makeit easy for representatives of developing nations to see U.S.-builtsystems in operation. A second issue that is clearly of concernto U.S. firms is the protection of the company's technology rights. Reverse engineering of the patented portions of U.S. equipmentis commonplace. Once a product is available from in-country orregional sources, there is little market left for the U.S. productunless the company licenses the technology to in-country manufacturingconcerns and competes with local manufacturing labor. 4.5 DevelopingMarkets for Biomass Power Byproducts Potential productive usesof biomass ash include: liming agents and nutrients for agriculture,landfill caps, sewage sludge stabilization, and structural fill. The issues for application of biomass ash are regulatory. Inthe state of Washington, wood ash is classified as a hazardouswaste based on pH>12. This restricts both the handling andapplication of the ash for agricultural uses. A far more difficultproblem has arisen in California where rice straw ash has beendeclared hazardous due to its high silica content. One projecthas been stockpiling the ash on site with the potential of becominga hazardous waste clean-up site unless appropriate disposal arrangementsare made. For urban wood materials, the presence of heavy metalsand other contaminants from chemical treatment pose a problemfor ash disposal. The approach recommended by industry to overcomesome of these regional restrictions is to develop environmentalconsensus standards for biomass ash based on the real risks posedfor transport, application, and use. Coproduction of chemicalsand power make it possible to operate plants at full capacityto generate two product streams. For gasification, methanol productionis a logical coproduct. Methanol can be used as a turbine fuel,a transportation fuel, or a chemical feedstock for other processes. Development of coproduction facilities was discussed only asa future option. 4.6 Capturing Legislative and Regulatory Incentives The cofiring and niche opportunities described above may beenhanced considerably by legislative and regulatory incentivesthat encourage the use of renewable resources and resources thathave positive environmental attributes unlike conventional fuels. The picture for the biomass power industry is still somewhatunclear, however. For example, industry is generally aware ofthe nature of the incentives provided under the recently-passedEnergy Policy Act of 1992, but is unsure of the direction of implementation. Thus, the influence of these factors can be potentially positivefor development of biopower projects, but may also lead to a 'waitand see' approach that would postpone projects until a cleardirection for implementation is assured. In addition, a numberof state organizations and utilities have instituted programsthat provide incentives for renewable technologies, and the CleanAir Act Amendments also may provide for improved opportunities. EnergyPolicy Act of 1992 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 includes severalincentives for renewable energy power production, including arenewable power production incentive (section 1212), a tax creditfor renewable energy electricity production (Section 1914), andjoint venture funds for renewable projects (Section 1201). Therenewable energy production incentive provides for a payment fromDOE of 1.5 cents per kWh produced. The coverage for this incentive,however, is limited to plants with ownership by a governmentalentity (such as a state, political subdivision of a state, oran instrumentality of a state) or a nonprofit electrical cooperative. The tax credit is to be part of the General Business Credit,and applies only to qualified closed-loop biomass (and wind) plants,and is set at a maximum of 1.5 cents per kWh. A closed-loopbiomass plant is defined as utilizing crops specifically grownfor fuel for an electricity plant. The amount of the credit isreduced if the average power purchase rates for biomass powerfacilities exceed 8 cents per kWh or if there is federal or othergovernment cost sharing (grants, subsidies, etc.). Both incentives(sections 1212 and 1914) cover the first 10 years of the plant'soperation and are indexed for inflation. A 1.5 cent per kWh productionincentive is equivalent to a $.90 - $1.25 /MMBTU subsidy for thebiomass fuel at a plant with heat rates ranging from 16,000 to12,000 Btu/kWh. This incentive could make a difference for marginalprojects. The industry could easily see the benefits for projectdevelopment but seemed skeptical about being able to realize thepotential benefits. Issues raised by the industry include: The law specifies that the credit applies to 'new facilities'built after 1992. Many of the real opportunities are repoweringor cofiring retrofit projects, which are, by definition, upgradesto existing facilities. As such, the law bypasses some of themost realistic near-term opportunities available for biopowerdevelopment. Early DFSS projects are likely to serve two marketssimultaneously: fiber and fuel. Extension of the definition ofDFSS to cover these projects will increase the chances that DFSSwill be considered by plant developers. The renewable energy jointventures program seems particularly attractive to utilities orproject developers who are considering use of DFSS as a supplementalfuel supply. There is also interest in the use of joint venturefunds for both cofiring and gasification demonstrations. ExternalityValuation and Regulations Many jurisdictions of the U.S. aregiving consideration to the recognition of externalities in theutility resource planning process. The impetus for this considerationcomes from many sources, including implementation of the CleanAir Act Amendments of 1990, state and local legislation/regulations,and a number of other sources. In addition, this recognitioncomes in many forms, but there is no consensus concerning methodologyor the degree to which externalities should impact decision making. In its broadest sense, any credit or debit based on social orenvironmental interests that is used to alter decisions that wouldnormally be based on a purely economic and technical risk assessmentserves as an externality. An immediate example is the proposedBTU tax, which provides a favorable treatment for biomass fuelsfor power generation by exempting them from the tax. The biomassIPP industry generally favors the use of externalities becausethey believe that they will tend to favor renewable energy projectsand, more specifically, biomass fuels. The utilities, on theother hand, generally favor the traditional economic assessmentapproach with qualitative consideration given to other factors. While some utilities are adamantly opposed to the quantitativeuse of externalities, others have developed and used them in theirresource planning process. Some examples include: Vermonthas issued an executive order for 20% CO2 reduction for energyuses and has instituted a renewable power purchase program. Puget Power provides a 10% credit for renewable regenerationsources in bidding. Idaho offers 6.5 cents per kWh for renewablegenerators less than 10 Mwe. The CAAA have instituted allowancetrading for SO2 emissions. The low sulfur content of biomassfuels permits utilities to earn allowances when they substitutebiomass for coal fuels. The California Assembly directed thestate PUC to set aside 50% of future generating capacity for renewables. New York established a program to procure 300 MW of new renewablecapacity by January 1, 1994, if it could be procured at an acceptableprice premium. Iowa established a statewide renewable capacityprocurement of 105 MW at a contract rate of approximately 6 centsper kWh. Wisconsin's PSC approved an investment/purchaseincentive of 0.25 cents per kWh for biomass-generated electricityfor up to 20 years if projects are on-line by December 1998. Atthe level of current externality valuations, most in the industryfelt that the gap between biopower projects and gas turbine projectscould not be made up. There is, however, a good deal of concernabout the possible imposition of carbon taxes or carbon limits. Most of the industry seemed to feel that this could make thedifference as long as the 'no net CO2' principle forbiomass is accepted. Until the rules for valuing reduced CO2emissions are in place, the industry has suggested that a systematicapproach for 'banking' credits for reductions wouldprovide some initial incentive for companies considering biomasscofiring or repowering projects. These early reductions wouldbe credited to the utilities' CO2 accounts pending the impositionof caps and allowance trading. Without such a system there willbe some inertia against reducing what may become the baselineemissions under future regulation. 5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOEAND INDUSTRY JOINT ACTION From the DOE perspective the industrymeetings provide the best avenue for direct input from industryto the DOE blueprint for action-the National Biomass Power ProgramFive-Year Plan. The following recommendations present specificalternative courses of action designed to capture the opportunitiesdiscussed in the foregoing section. Each course of action isa distillation of the industries comment, while specific actionsare generally representative of the many suggested approachesto program follow-up. 5.1 Implement an Information DisseminationCampaign Key players - Regional Biomass Programs, IndustryAssociations. One page summaries on key topics disseminatedto key decision makers, industry, and other interested parties.(What is biomass power?, environmental benefits and issues, cofiringoptions). Biomass power report providing the latest informationon the biopower market and technology via fax. Commercialquality video production highlighting the operations of modernbiomass facilities and key aspects of the future role for biopoweras envisioned by the biomass program strategy. Continue effortsto cosponsor several national conferences and forums on biomasspower. 5.2 Support Implementation of EPACT and other LegislativeIncentives Key players - DOE/HQ, industry associations,key industries. Provide technical input to rulemaking forEPACT production incentives, especially definition of qualifyingfacilities and feedstocks. Channel information on status ofcredits and incentives to industry through the associations. Encourage and develop mechanism for the implementation of CO2credit banking. 5.3 Assist Utilities and IPPs to Implement Cofiringof Biomass and Fossil Fuels Key Players - Utilities,IPPs, NREL, regional programs. Sponsor prefeasibility studiesfor cofiring retrofits. Cosponsor test burns and cofiringdemonstrations for major classes of utility boilers. 5.4 SupportIndustry Efforts to Expand the Base of Fuel Sources KeyPlayers - Industry, NREL, ORNL, regional programs. Cosponsorlimited scope feasibility studies of new feedstock sources includinggradual introduction of energy crops. Support limited R&Don feedstock collection and processing methods that improve feedstockcombustion characteristics and/or lower costs. Support R&Dfor safe byproduct uses of wood ash, and wood-coal mixed ash. 5.5 Support Industry Efforts to Demonstrate Advanced Biomass ConversionSystems Key Players - Industry, NREL Co-sponsor feasibilitystudies and demonstrations of repowering existing power stationswith high efficiency biomass conversion systems. Co-fund feasibilitystudies and selected demonstrations of commercial scale powerprojects that integrate sustainable, dedicated fuel supply systemswith high efficiency power generation systems. 5.6 SupportIndustry Efforts to Demonstrate New Modular Generation Technology Key Players - Industry, NREL, USAID, Winrock. Cosponsordemonstrations of new U.S. modular generation systems fueled bybiomass niche domestic and international markets. Under the currentbudget scenario for biomass power, it is unlikely that all ofthese recommendations can be implemented. As such, a continuingdialogue between industry and DOE will be an important programbuilding block. As the program moves forward, there will be roomfor course corrections and review of priorities in light of changingmarket and regulatory conditions. 1Biomass yields can be up to 5 tons per acre.

The division is responsible for ensuring that program activities are consistent with national energy policy, priorities, and directives. DOE�s field offices and national laboratories implement program activities, including subcontracts with utilities, industry, and academia. The agreements with utilities and industry are designed to foster the development of new wind energy technologies and accelerate their commercialization. University subcontracts help build the wind energy technology base. The FY 1994 Wind Energy Program budget was $30.3 million. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, located in Golden, Colorado, is the world�s largest scientific institution dedicated to developing renewable energy technologies. As DOE�s lead laboratory in wind technology development , NREL operates the National Wind Technology Center. NREL manages DOE�s cooperative government/industry programs, including wind turbine development, utility programs, and industry programs. NREL also manages international and applied research programs, conducting research in structures and fatigue testing, wind characterization, aerodynamics, advanced components and systems, and wind resource assessments. Sandia National Laboratories, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Livermore, California, has been involved in renewable energy technologies, including wind, for more than 20 years. Sandia�s wind program focuses on both industry/utility issues and applied research. As part of the industry-driven Wind Turbine Development Program Sandia is leading an Advanced Manufacturing initiative to reduce turbine costs through innovative component manufacturing. Applied research activities emphasize the development, validation, and transfer to industry of analytical and experimental tools in the areas of aerodynamics, structural dynamics, fatigue, reliability, materials, and controls.

Hydrogen Programs within OUT - Karl R�bago Mr. R�bago acknowledged the significant progress the Hydrogen Program has made in realizing a hydrogen future. Activities of the program have included the solicitation which is now being reviewed and the notice of interest which will lead to a solicitation in 1996. Dr. Takahashi met with and presented the Green Hydrogen Report to Charles Curtis, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, and Christine Ervin, the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Mr. Curtis demonstrated a good understanding of the program and shared the same goal of using hydrogen as a dominant fuel of the future. The Office of Utility Technologies remains committed to a solid hydrogen program. Legislative Update - Mason Wiggins Speaking on behalf of Congressman Walker, Chairman of the House Science Committee, Mr.Wiggins reported on legislative activities noting that the Hydrogen Future Act passed through the House and Senator Harkin s bill was introduced in the Senate co-sponsored by Senator Kyl of Arizona. The House bill states that non-federal funding requirements may be reduced by the Secretary if deemed necessary and appropriate. Mr. Walker agrees, if the Secretary finds the research basic or fundamental in nature. He will also try to make sure that at least 5 percent of basic research funding will be used on alternative energy technologies. Senator Burns has introduced the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Commercialization Act (S1155) to set aside money for a specific program at a specific place. Mr. Walker is opposed to this proposal because he feels that it would interfere with the competition which has started for hydrogen research and development. His main concern is that money on the hydrogen program is spent on hydrogen basic research. He would like a competitiveprocess for hydrogen projects and would support any ideas that HTAP would have to streamline such a process. He believes that the federal government can fund basic and fundamental research, development and demonstration to the stage of finding out whether a concept works but not to the point of whether a concept works on a commercial basis. His hope is to see the commercial sectoreventually take over the research projects and bring the technologies into commercialization. Report from USDOE - Russell Eaton Dr. Eaton presented an overview of the DOE Hydrogen Program beginning with recommendationsthat were made at the last HTAP meeting. These included integration of government research andbusiness interests and the competitive initiation of research projects. National labs will continue tobe a source of expertise and an important part of the program. With respect to the Hydrogen FutureAct, the HTAP will submit to Congress recommendations on the effectiveness of the program andrelated points. Achievements in the program include industry/government cost sharing in the formof cooperative agreements. Florida Solar Energy Center received a patent on SPE materials forelectrolysis and four other patents have been disclosed or applied for. Among the many technicalaccomplishments were the biological production of hydrogen using a single light reaction, 7 percentconversion of solar to hydrogen at the University of Hawaii, 70% conversion efficiencies from SolarReactor Technologies, and the development of magnesium based alloy with increased storageperformance. Working groups for production, storage, utilization and systems integration have beenestablished to foster technical interchange among industry and laboratory researchers. A strategicplanning group has been formed to give recommendations on the direction and conduct of theprogram. Public outreach projects include a CD ROM showing the benefits of hydrogen and adocumentary film. An industry outreach workshop was held in June that resulted in recommendationson various hydrogen issues including the federal role, the transition strategy, infrastructuredevelopment and technology demonstrations. Dr. Linden raised the issue of a lack of strategic thrust in the current program. In terms of strategicalliance, he feels it s more important to work with other sources of funding for hydrogendemonstration projects. Because of the hydrogen program has limited money, there should be arigorous and more selective process. He is very critical of the use of reformation of natural gas. Zero emission mass transit ought to be given the highest priority because of its high visibility andpromising application. Report on Hydrogen Program - Neil Rossmeissl In a presentation on programmatic aspects, Mr. Rossmeissl described the annual peer reviewprocess and the collaboration between different offices of DOE. The review panel is selectedthrough recommendation. It consists of people with the broadest knowledge of projects and alsospecialists. One recommendation that has been incorporated into the program is technical andeconomic analysis. A solicitation was send out to the national labs for R&D activity. 116 proposalswere received and reviewed. The ranking of projects were prioritized based on those reviews. Thefunding for the program will be split with the national labs receiving 50% and universities and industryreceiving the balance. Based on a recommendation by HTAP, a Notice of Interest (NOI) wasreleased in April. The NOI was send out as a way of trying to get a handle on what types of projectsindustry is interested in and how these fit into the program. An outreach program has beendeveloped for industry and for the general public. A comprehensive plan is being developed that willbe used as a point of measure for the program. International activities include the collaborationbetween the Japanese and the US for the care of Mitsui-McKinley marine collection. The US waselected as chairman of the International Energy Agency Hydrogen Implementation Agreement. Oneof the goals of the IEA is to begin cost shared research projects with different countries. Report on NREL Hydrogen Program - Catherine Gregoire Padr� The Notice of Interest (NOI) was send out to make a preliminary determination of the interest of stateagencies, universities, commercial organizations in forming collaborations to participate in researchand cost sharing. There were 55 responses from 31 different states with 83 ideas. The next stepwill be to look at cofunding of the development of business plans for those technology demonstrationand development projects. On the advisement of HTAP, four working groups in production, storage, utilization and systemintegration have started. These groups have been established to increase the industry participationand interaction with the researchers and also to increase communications among the researchersthemselves. The researchers will be presenting their activities to the rest of the group anddiscussing project direction. It was suggested that reports of these meetings be made available toHTAP and to have a representative from HTAP on each of the groups.Other activities include industry information exchange and transfer with NHA and the development a hydrogen home page on the Internet. The page will be connected to the DOE page and possiblyto universities and other national labs. Strategic Planning & Analysis - James Ohi A strategic planning group has been developed to address the issue of programmatic pathways;long-term goals; and ways to meet these goals. The group will consist of analysts who will reportto HTAP with recommendations on strategic issues that identify and coordinate programmaticanalysis needs. The group members are Carol Bailey of HTAP and Enron, consultants RobertaNichols, David Crain, and Pat Grimes, Michael Koleda of Council on Alternate Fuels, Bob Moore ofChevron Research & Technology, Michael Quah of Nafion DuPont and Shellandra K. Suman ofNorthern States Power Company. One particular function of the group is portfolio analysis todetermine what kind of measures or criteria should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of theprogram (a cost benefit analysis). They would also like to look at what determines technology riskin relation to development programs. HTAP agreed that a strategic planning function needs to befilled and the recommendation was made to make this group a subcommittee of HTAP and chargeit with addressing strategic issues. International Activities - Neil Rossmeissl Kings College has been voted in as the representative for England for the International EnergyAgency (IEA). IEA Annex 10 which covers photoproduction of hydrogen has been approved. Bulkstorage has been recommended but not approved. The U.S. will operate Annex 11 which will lookat analysis of demonstration projects. The executive committee has tasked the European Union todraft a report on incorporating hydrogen into a commercial transportation vehicle. Report on Fuel Cells - Alan Lloyd/Pandit Patil Dr. Lloyd gave a presentation on fuel cells in southern California noting that air quality and theCalifornia zero emission vehicle standards are significant drivers. Southern California Air QualityManagement District has supported DOE with the phosphoric acid fuel cell bus program and hasworked with the Ballard bus program and UC Riverside with some of their hydrogen programs. Theycreated a renewable energy fuel cell implementation task force to try to accelerate the use of thetechnology on both the transportation and stationary side. The primary goal of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) Initiative with DOEis to develop within a decade a car that gets eighty miles to the gallon with the same performance,size, utility, and at a price that people are willing to pay. The car must have fuel efficiencies up tothree times today s comparable vehicles. A national fuel cell alliance has been established withDOE, USCAR, GM, Chrysler and Ford. A phosphoric acid fuel cell urban transit bus prototype isunder operational testing. The barrier is the high cost of the fuel cells. The focus of fuel cell R&Dis on performance, packaging and cost. Progress has been achieved in all areas with PEM fuel celllight duty vehicles and the advanced reformer for fuel cell vehicles. Global competition in fuel cellR&D is accelerating. Industry Outreach - David Nahmias/Jon Hurwitch Twenty stakeholders meetings were held with twenty-six organizations to identify opportunities forcompanies to increase industry participation in the Hydrogen Program. A workshop was held in Juneentitled Implementing Hydrogen Energy Systems; Industry and Government Partnerships with 110participants. The workshop increased industry s awareness of the Hydrogen Program and increasedthe program s awareness to industry s interest and needs relative to the program. It promotedparticipation in the program by some companies that were not previously involved. New areas ofmutual technology were identified. One of the findings was that the petroleum industry is the largestsingle user of hydrogen today. They view hydrogen as a utility rather than a fuel and their onlyinterest is that improved technologies could lower the cost of hydrogen and lower their productioncosts. There is very strong fuel cell interest on the part of several companies. The auto companiestend to be skeptical about near to mid-term prospects for hydrogen vehicles, although the mostpromising early market opportunity may be urban bus fleets.There is a realization that if hydrogen energy markets are going to be achieved, it is going a take amajor effort by both the government and private sector. There are near-term business opportunitiesfor companies to pursue. The private sector needs incentives to participate and lead the effort toget the products to the marketplace. This can be done through funding R&D, zero emission vehiclemandates, and tax incentives. The objectives of the outreach program are to promote opportunityfor industrial participation and issue clear focused communications from the Hydrogen Program;create forums for technical interchange between government and industry; coordinate with regulatoryauthorities to allow for safely operated hydrogen applications; and improve public perception ofhydrogen as a clean, safe form of energy. Communications with stakeholders would be increasedwith follow-on meetings and the initiation of trade publications. Market transformation is underwaywith the creation of technical working groups, specific partnership models, and assistance withcodes and standards. A hydrogen trade show exhibit would be created for use at professional andcivic meetings. Public Outreach - Amy Baker/Rajat Sen The initial focus of this project will be primarily students and secondly the public at large. Thestrategy is to first determine the age group and type of technical information to be presented. Educational consultants would help to develop a curriculum and framework. Once the materials aredeveloped, a series of field tests would be conducted. Information would be presented to studentsin a standard curriculum format with teachers manuals, workbooks, CD ROM and videos. Threetreatments for a hydrogen documentary targeted at the nine to fourteen year old group have beendeveloped and are being reviewed by DOE. Other proposed activities include the creation of aconsortium of education and industry participants to support and guide public outreach and help withcost sharing. Trade shows, municipal and national meetings could be accessed by developing amodular traveling exhibit with display materials, hydrogen energy system models, an interactivemulti-media center, and some video capability. It is recommended that all of the public outreach thatis being done in the hydrogen community be coordinated. HTAP will be asked to review theprototypes for all of the projects as they come along. Mr. R�bago commented that the cost involvedin producing a stand-alone CD would be extremely high and felt the public outreach activities shouldbe focused on a reasonable level of information with a reasonable and integrated level of effort. Demonstration Committee - Alan Lloyd The committee decided that a demonstration of the hydrogen fuel cell was deemed appropriatebecause both the cost and size are coming down. The cost aspect and difficulty of getting fullhydrogen infrastructure would allow for the use of hydrogen from fossil fuels. The transit sector maybe a good starting point. Aircraft should continue to be encouraged. The possibility of lawn andgarden equipment was considered with batteries, fuel cells or hybrids. Integrated demonstrationswould provide technology enhancement and assessment, technology transfer, infrastructure supportand development. The hydrogen corridor concept integrates southern California demonstrations ofproduction, storage, transport and utilization with stationary and mobile application and near to longterm technologies. Dr. Linden suggested that the committee concentrate on demonstrations wherehydrogen is visible. Dr. Birk suggested integrating the stationary with the mobile with electrolysis. Technology Advancement - Mounir Kamal The objective of this committee was to develop a set of requirements based on market and customerexpectations for transportation vehicles and assess current hydrogen technology in vehicleapplications with conventional and alternative propulsion vehicles. It was concluded that hydrogenvehicles cannot compete with conventional vehicles with current technology. The focus of theHydrogen Program should be on niche market applications such as government and utility companyfleets. Hydrogen vehicles must compete with electric and CNG vehicles. R&D and demonstrationsprograms should focus on the hydrogen vehicle operating affordability, the driving range, and therefueling infrastructure. Safety is not an attribute to be considered because it cannot becompromised; it is an absolute requirement. Sustainable Energy R&D Centers - David Nahmias Senator Harkin was approached with the idea of putting the issue of sustainable energy centers intothe Hydrogen Future Act; he declined to do so. He felt that the bill had an upward fight to beapproved and that another requirement could lessen the changes of its success. A center initiativeis taking place at Savannah River with an emphasis on market needs and commercialization. Rocketdyne Energy Technology and Engineering Center is advertising testing services for hydrogendevices. The hydrogen corridor in southern California is a continuing effort that supportsdemonstrations over a long period of time. A city of the future is being proposed in Canada wherehydrogen applications would be demonstrated. The recommendations are that HTAP does not haveto take a lead in forming centers and that the centers can be both for basic R&D and fordemonstrations leading to commercialization. If there is DOE funding for these centers, publicawareness should be an added requirement. Friday, September 22, 1995 Transition - Patrick Takahashi In order to make the transition for the election of the next HTAP chairman smoother, Dr. Takahashi recommended that a vice chairman be selected with the idea that the vice chair is in line to be thenext chair. Dr. Lloyd was nominated and elected as vice chairman. Dr. Takahashi suggested that HTAP hold a meeting in Stuttgart in conjunction with the WorldHydrogen Energy Conference. There may be a problem with having a public hearing where theAmerican public could have difficulty attending, but the matter will be discussed with DOE. The nextHTAP meeting will be held in Alexandria, VA at the Radisson Hotel in April. Round Table Discussion Dr. Takahashi reported that the Green Hydrogen Report was well received by Christine Ervin andCharles Curtis. Mr. R�bago told the panel that although DOE did not delegate its policy formulationsbased on the report, they do endorse and agree with the vision of HTAP and look to HTAP forguidance on the structure of the hydrogen program for long term goals and steps to get there. Dr.Takahashi has plans to also meet with staff members or members of key committees in the Houseto pass on the Green Hydrogen Report, discuss issues and establish a communications bond. Alist of people to potentially meet with on the Senate side has been drawn up. It was suggested thatthe report be personally delivered or distributed to renewable energy industry groups, state energyoffices, the National Academy of Engineering, the Environmental Protection Agency and otherappropriate parties.The ISO Working Group 3 is preparing a hydrogen fuel specification. Working Groups 1 & 2 arelooking at container specifications and they are going to address compressed hydrogen storage aswell. NHA held a codes and standards workshop. Given the focus on liquid hydrogen by ISO, theemphasis on a codes and standards effort to support hydrogen might best be on gaseous storage. It was determined that the best way to start is by building on the natural gas codes and standardsthat exit today. Public Comments Dr. Larry Berg and Bob Fleming presented an overview of Ballard projects. The Ballard hydrogenbus was completed in 1992 and brought to Los Angeles in 1994 where it ran at the Los AngelesInternational Airport from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 for a week. There was no negative feedback fromthe public in riding a hydrogen powered vehicle; the reaction was enthusiastic. Phase 2 bus was justcompleted and shown in Chicago. This is a forty foot bus with 250 kilowatt and 275 horsepower fuelcell. The hydrogen is stored on the top as in a natural gas vehicle. The fuel cell can be removedin approximately fifteen minutes, which the transit district mechanics found to be attractive. Thefirst test fleet will be three buses, possibly five. The commercial production bus is scheduled for1998. Ballard and Diamond Vans will unveil a utility van with a hydrogen powered fuel cell in January1996. The work with Diamond is implemented by the partnership that Ballard has with GeneralMotors under the DOE Fuel Cell Program. Ballard has activities involving ships with a strategicpartnership with HFW in Germany and is looking at a submarine program in North America. Theyalso are in equity partnership with Johnson Mabley. Ballard is in the process of setting up a facilityin southern California. There are a variety of requirements related to the use and storage ofhydrogen in the area with which they are being forced to deal. The bus projects are used for publicawareness and Dr. Berg believes that the public does not really care what fuel is used. They areconcerned with cost, performance, and availability and that is the way that hydrogen should be soldto the public. William Summers of the Westinghouse Savannah River Technology Center discussed the hydrogenbus project being developed with a number of regional partners including the City of Atlanta, GeorgiaPower Company, Georgia Technical Research Institute and the Bluebird Bus Company. It will bea 33 foot, 32 passenger hybrid bus with an electric drive system, onboard metal hydride storage andan IC engine generator set. It will have a 60 kilowatt output from the generator set and a 230horsepower electric motor. They are projecting performance equal to a diesel bus, equivalent milesper gallon of two times the diesel bus, and near zero emissions. Design range is 150 miles; thetypical city bus operating range is 120 miles per day. A refueling station based on the use of off-peak electrolysis will be built. Metal hydride storage will be used and the hydrogen will be transferredfrom the stationary metal hydride beds to the on-board beds. Savannah River considers this bus tobe a systems integration, technology validation project as well as a public awareness tool. It willoperate in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and for at least a year in normalcity bus service in Atlanta. Gary Noland of G & A Associates discussed fuel cells for the Olympics, an activity that has beenformed by Bob Rose to use the Olympics to showcase U.S. technologies in fuel cells and in storageand the use of hydrogen as a clean fuel. The proposal is to provide electrical power to thewhitewater kayaking event in the hills of Tennessee. The primary user of the power will be theOlympic Broadcasting Group who is responsible for all transmission of event coverage. TheSouthface Energy Institute, Energy and Environmental Resources Center will construct a 6200square feet structure to showcase environmentally sound technologies. There are opportunities forindustry, particularly the hydrogen production industry to participate in these endeavors. Atlantawants to become a showplace for solar energy and this would be the opportunity to demonstrate theadvantage of using hydrogen as a storage medium for the solar energy that is produced. Thebiggest obstacle is funding the siting operation with fuel cells. Dr. Zweig of the South Coast Air Quality Management District discussed the serious pollutionproblems of the district, which consists of four counties in southern California. The pollutant levelsof ozone have decreased by about 50 percent from 1976 to 1994 in the area but the levels stillexceed the federal standards for ozone. A more serious health hazard is PM 10s or particulatematter in the Riverside area. This has caused higher incidences of cancer, chronic pulmonarydisease and increased deaths according to an American Cancer Society study. People are sufferingfrom fossil fuel combustion health problems that cannot be remedied without the escalation of theimplementation of hydrogen. Some projects have been started including the Hydrogen Corridor under way in El Segundo. A manual has been produced and is available that covers all of theobstacles and hurdles that were overcome to get the Hydrogen Corridor started. There is anongoing project with UCR to make hydrogen from a small solar hydrogen plant. Palm Desert will beconverting golf carts to fuel cells and using photovoltaics and wind for producing hydrogen. Dr.Zweig thanked the panel and everyone involved with hydrogen for all the progress that has beenmade and encouraged everyone to make more and do it faster. Closing Remarks In closing comments, Mr. Hainsselin encouraged a strong bond between OTT and OUT to developsome kind of blueprint for hydrogen-fueled vehicles as a next step. Dr. Birk recommended that the strategic plan enhance the technoeconomic and environmental motivations for moving towardhydrogen; to state the goal clearly and not to consider the limitation of money but rather see whatthe plan is, figure what out it costs, and then propose that. Mr. Rossmeissl tasked the panel to look at some of the bigger issues and decide how to address them as a panel and providerecommendations to DOE. Dr. Kamal would like to see a little more balance in the agenda betweeninformation presentation and decision making discussions, with more time devoted to discussion. Dr. Linden expressed concern in reforming diesel fuel and liquid hydrocarbons and hoped thatprogress will be made in on-board hydrogen storage. Mr. Nahmias called for participation in theindustry outreach plan and ideas with regard to hydrogen energy centers. Dr. Takahashi thanked all of the participants and adjourned the proceedings at 11:40 a.m.WT02-B16-335IA060-000330-B028-371http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/eval.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115044151 text/html 1765HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 04:41:57 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:21 GMTContent-length: 1591 Hydrogen InfoNet EVALUATION OF APPLICATIONS Initial Screening After receiving the application, a preliminary review will be performed by DOE to check for completeness.

The technology, especially developed for air-conditioning and refrigerationcompressors, forms a boundary film on metal parts and provides lubrication while protecting partsfrom friction degradation. It forms a microscopic chemical layer, without the introduction of solidarticles. The two most important benefits of polarized refrigerant oil additives are improved heat transfer in theevaporator and condensing coils and increased lubricity of the refrigerant oil. There are several sidebenefits that can extend equipment life. Although it is difficult to estimate energy savings from a specificapplication, field reports are generally positive, and ongoing independent laboratory and field testingshould yield improved data. For detailed info on this technology, see Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Federal Technology Alert on PolarizedRefrigerant Oil Additives. Two manufacturers are licensed to produce the patented active polar molecule refrigerant oil additive:Ken Tyler, Micro Shield Corporation, 54 Carlton Street, East Orange, NJ, 07017, (800) 550-1517;and Charles Wilkins, Wilkins Manufacturing, Inc., P.O.

Currently, Birk is manager of the Renewables and Hydro Business Unit at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California. His organization's work resulted in commercial production, with KENETECH Windpower, of a new generation of wind turbines that provide electricity at a cost of less than $0.05 a kilowatt-hour. He has also provided technical guides to hydro plant owners that have helped them to reduce costs and enhance environmental performance Before joining EPRI in 1973, Birk worked for Rockwell International Corporation's Atomics International Division, developing such technologies as clean-coal combustion, stack-gas emissions controls, and advanced batteries. He also worked on developing advanced batteries at Argonne National Laboratory while on loan from Rockwell. In addition to HTAP, Birk has served on several other technical review panels for both DOE and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, including the latter's Science and Industry Advisory Board. He earned a B.S. in chemistry from Iowa State University and a Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from Purdue.WT02-B16-340IA060-000326-B043-243http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/wind/utility.html 205.168.79.27 19970115015512 text/html 7058HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 01:55:16 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 19 Sep 1996 15:39:29 GMTContent-length: 6884 Technology Development Wind Turbine Applications: Utility Programs From DOE Wind Program Overview 3/95 DOE is working with utilities to introduce advanced wind turbine technologyto the utility planners and engineers who will integrate tomorrow'shigh-tech wind power plants into the utility grid. The U.S. utility industry is exploring wind as a new generation source. Dozens of electric utilities in 15 states are in the process of acquiring hands-on experience with wind power generation. This unprecedented involvement with wind energy is a necessary precursor to thewidespread integration of wind into the U.S. utility grid. Since 1990, DOE has worked with utilities and the wind industry to build a bridge between research and development (R&D) programs and the commercial use of utility-scale wind turbines. During FY 1994, utility plans for new wind projects more than doubled as a result of increased interest in renewable energy systems on the part of utility regulators and utilities. To further encourage utilities to evaluate wind energy systems, DOE launched two multimillion-dollar deployment assistance programs. DOE announced plans in 1994 for a new Wind Turbine Deployment Project designed to help the United States meet national economic and environmental objectives. DOE expects the initiative to result in commercial partnerships among U.S. utilities, independent power producers, and wind turbine manufacturers that will enhance the U.S. competitive position in domestic and international energy markets. Under the cost-sharing initiative, DOE will contribute as much as 20% of the total cost for constructing a new 25-MW wind power plant, distributed wind system, or wind-diesel hybrid system. (Utilities with a peak capacity of less than 100 MW will be allowed to propose smaller power plants under this initiative.) DOE expects the enterprise to facilitate the introduction of new wind generation and help utilities reduce the perceived risk of introducing a new and unfamiliar technology. DOE plans to collaborate in the development of as much as 500 MW of new wind generation in the United States and its territories by 2000. NREL will issue a solicitation early in FY 1995 for developing the first power plants under this initiative. In a related endeavor to further wind energy development, NREL launched wind energy deployment, NREL launched the Sustainable Technology Energy Partnerships program in FY 1994. Under this initiative, NREL will work with state energy offices throughout the nation to create partnerships with private industry, academia, and utilities for conducting pilot projects including wind technology deployment, resource assessment, and bird population studies. The Utility Wind Turbine Performance Verification Program is another major component of DOE 's efforts to demonstrate the value of wind energy to utilities. The 5-year program is a joint effort between DOE and EPRI designed to reduce the risk of bringing advanced wind turbine technology into a utility setting for testing and evaluation. Participating utilities will build and operate a wind power plant of at least 6 MW that uses the latest technology. They will select the wind power plant site, solicit bids from U.S. vendors, and purchase the turbines. They will also be responsible for power plant design, construction, start-up, and 3 years of testing, evaluation, and documentation. Such experience will allow utilities to make informed decisions when considering wind energy for replacing an outdated power plant or adding new capacity. Vermont's Green Mountain Power Corporation and Central and South West Services, Inc., were awarded $3.5 million and $2 million, respectively, during FY 1993 to participate in the program. During that year, both utilities began the process of siting their facilities and applying for necessary permits. During FY 1994, Central and South West Services selected a power-plant site in southwest Texas near Fort Davis and initiated a study to monitor birds passing through the project area. Central and South West Services also selected an advanced wind turbine for the power plant, the Z-40. The Z-40, developed under the auspices of DOE's Wind Turbine Development Program, is a 500-kW machine manufactured by Zond Systems, Inc. Central and South West will use 12 of the new machines in the demonstration power plant, scheduled to come on-line during FY 1995. Green Mountain Power continued its efforts to secure permits from the U.S. Forest Service for a ridge-top east of Bennington, Vermont, during FY 1994. Green Mountain Power plans to conduct interviews with potential turbine vendors in FY 1995. In late 1994, DOE and EPRI awarded Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation $1.5 million to participate in the Turbine Verification Program. Niagara Mohawk plans to build a 6-MW wind power plant by 1996 at a location not yet specified in New York. Niagara Mohawk, which has announced plans to become the lead utility for wind in New York State, will receive an additional $1.5 million for the wind project from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. During FY 1994, DOE also supported the National Wind Coordinating Committee in initiating a cost-shared Utility Wind Resource Assessment Program. The program will provide assistance to utilities in conducting their detailed wind resource measurements in their service territories or in other locations under consideration for siting a wind power plant to help launch the program, a meteorologist supported by the Edison Electric Institute and NREL developed specifications for standard instruments and procedures for evaluating wind resources. The wind monitoring standards will ensure that uniform data is collected by participating utilities. About 10 utilities are expected to participate in the resource assessment program, which will be managed by the Utility Wind Interest Group.

Solar Water Heating Well-Proven Technology Pays Off in Several Situations Abstract Solar water heating is a renewable energy technologythat is well proven and readily available and has considerablepotential for application at federal facilities. Solar water-heatingsystems can be used effectively throughout the country and mostfacilities will have an appropriate near-south-facing roof ornearby unshaded grounds for installation of a collector. A varietyof types of systems are available and suitable for many applications.For example, low-temperature unglazed systems can heat swimmingpools and associated hot tubs or spas, saving money on conventionalheating or extending the swimming season. In mild climates, passivesystems without pumps or electronic controllers can provide low-maintenancehot water for facilities with limited or expensive utility service.High-temperature parabolic-trough systems can economically providehot water to jails, hospitals, and other facilities in areas withgood solar resources that consistently use large volumes of hotwater. And active flat-plate systems can service any facilityin any area with electric or otherwise expensive conventionalwater heating. This Federal Technology Alert (FTA) of the NewTechnology Demonstration Program, one of a series of guides torenewable energy and new energy-efficient technologies, is designedto give federal facility managers the information they need todecide whether they should pursue solar water heating for theirfacility and to know how to go about doing so. Software availablefrom FEMP's Federal Renewables Program at the National RenewableEnergy Laboratory (303-384-7509) gives a preliminary analysisof whether solar water heating would be cost effective for yoursituation on the basis of a minimal number of data. This FTA describesthe main types of solar water-heating systems available and discussessome of the factors that make the various types more or less appropriatefor particular situations. It also points out the types of situationswhere solar water heating is most likely to be cost effectiveand gives examples for each of those situations. In addition,this FTA outlines the basics of selecting, evaluating, procuring,funding and maintaining a solar water-heating system. Sidebarshighlight indicators that a system will be effective, tips forensuring successful operation, and pointers for determining systemdata. A case study for a National Park Service facility includeseconomic evaluation data and bid specifications. References includesolar water-heating collector manufacturers and system distributorsand contacts for federal facilities that are using solar waterheating. About the Technology | Federal SectorPotential |Application Technology Performance | Case Study | The Technology in Perspective Suppliers | Who is Using the Technology For Further Information |Appendixes About the Technology An estimated one million residentialand 200,000 commercial solar water-heating systems have been installedin the United States. Although there are a large number of differenttypes of solar water-heating systems, the basic technology isvery simple. Sunlight strikes and heats an "absorber"surface within a "solar collector" or an actual storagetank. Either a heat-transfer fluid or the actual potable waterto be used flows through tubes attached to the absorber and picksup the heat from it. (Systems with a separate heat-transfer-fluidloop include a heat exchanger that then heats the potable water.)The heated water is stored in a separate preheat tank or a conventionalwater heater tank until needed. If additional heat is needed,it is provided by electricity or fossil-fuel energy by the conventionalwater-heating system. By reducing the amount of heat that mustbe provided by conventional water-heating, solar water-heatingsystems directly substitute renewable energy for conventionalenergy, reducing the use of electricity or fossil fuels by asmuch as 80%. Today's solar water-heating systems are well provenand reliable when correctly matched to climate and load. Thecurrent market consists of a relatively small number of manufacturersand installers that provide reliable equipment and quality systemdesign. A quality assurance and performance rating program forsolar water-heating systems, instituted by a voluntary associationof the solar industry and various consumer groups, makes it easierto select reliable equipment with confidence. After taking advantageof possible use-reduction measures (see the First Things First sidebar below), federalfacility managers should investigate installing solar water-heatingsystems. First Things FirstAs a rule, conservation is the most cost-effective way to reducewater-heating bills. For example, a low-flow showerhead costing $9 saves $22for 275 kWh of energy per year for a five-month payback. Other examplesof hot-water saving measures include faucet aerators, timed oroptical-sensor faucets, water-saving clothes washers, dishwashers or other appliances,water heater insulation, lower-setting or timed water heaters,and swimming pool covers. These energy efficiency measures are allcompatible with solar water heating, and often reduce the size of the systemsneeded. Reducing hot-water use saves on water and sewage as wellas energy. For more information, ask the FEMP Help Line (800-DOE-EREC)about the Water Conservation Program. Application Domain Water heating accounts for a substantialportion of energy use at many federal facilities. Nationwide,approximately 18% of energy use in residential buildings and 4%in commercial buildings is for water heating. Federal facilitieswith large laundries, kitchens, showers, or swimming pools willlikely devote even more energy to water heating. Solar water heatingsystems can efficiently provide up to 80% of the hot-water needsof many federal buildings—without fuel cost or pollution and withminimal operation and maintenance expense. Solar water-heatingsystems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities withwater-heating systems that are expensive to operate or with operationssuch as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities ofhot water. A need for hot water that is relatively constant throughoutthe week and throughout the year, or that is higher in the summer,is also helpful for solar water-heating economics. On the otherhand, hard water is a negative factor, particularly for certaintypes of solar water-heating systems, because it can increasemaintenance costs and cause those systems to wear out prematurely. Solar water heating can be used effectively throughout the country.The dominant factor in determining effectiveness for solar waterheating is the available solar resource (see Figure 1 and Figure 2),but do not dismiss the possibility of using solar water heatingbecause the facility is in a cloudy area. Other factors are alsoquite important and solar water heating works better than mightbe expected in areas with lesser solar resources. Cold water supplytemperatures (see Figure 3 and Appendix A) increase system efficiencybecause until the fluid being heated reaches higher temperatures,it loses less heat to the surroundings. Cold air temperatureshurt solar water-heating performance by increasing loss of heatfrom the collectors to the air. Figure 4 shows the performancethat can be expected by average and good solar collectors, respectively,in various parts of the country. Benefits By tapping available renewableenergy, solar water heating reduces consumption of conventionalenergy that would otherwise be used. Each unit of energy deliveredto heat water with a solar heating system yields an even greaterreduction in use of fossil fuels. Water heating by natural gas,propane, or fuel oil is only about 60% efficient and althoughelectric water heating is about 90% efficient, the productionof electricity from fossil fuels is generally only 30% or 40%efficient. Reducing fossil fuel use for water heating not onlysaves stocks of the fossil fuels, but eliminates the air pollutionand climate change gas emission associated with burning thosefuels. Recent Track Record Excellent The majority of existing solar water-heating systems were installedin the 1980s when private parties were eligible for a 40% federalresidential energy tax credit or a 15% business energy tax creditincentive. (There is currently only a 10% business energy taxcredit.) Although solar water heating had certainly already been aroundfor a while, there was not yet a mature industry prepared to handlelarge-volume sales and installation. In the rush to take advantage of salesspurred by the tax incentives, many systems were poorly designed or installedor inadequately maintained. This earned solar water heating abad reputation that is not deserved by today's industry. Solar water-heatingsystems are now well proven, installers are highly professional,and the industry has demonstrated an excellent track record in recentyears. (See "Suppliers" for a list of manufacturersof collectors and distributors of systems.) With careful selectionof the right system for a particular situation, today's solarwater-heating installations are largely free of problems. Although some solar water-heating systems from the 1980s werenot as well designed or installed as they should have been, the majorityare still delivering energy with little or no maintenance. A 1992survey of 185 residential systems in Colorado, for example, foundthat 65% of the systems were functioning properly and that halfof those with problems could be repaired for less than $150. The1980s was also the most active period at federal facilities with 718systems installed during or shortly after 1981 through the Solar in FederalBuildings Program. If you have an older existing system—functioningor non-functioning—it would be well worthwhile to have it examinedfor possible improvements or reactivation. Energy-Saving Mechanism Although solar water-heating systemsall use the same basic method for capturing and transferring solarenergy, they do so with such a wide variety of specific technologiesthat one almost needs to learn a whole language of terms for distinguishingdifferent collectors and systems. The distinctions are importantthough, because various water-heating needs in various locationsare best served by certain types of collectors and systems. Systemscan be either active or passive, direct or indirect, pressurizedor nonpressurized. (Note: the terms open-loop and closed-loopare frequently used to distinguish between direct and indirectsystems, but technically their meaning is more equivalent to nonpressurizedand pressurized. To avoid confusion, we will not use them here.) Types of Systems The most frequently used systems for large facilities,antifreeze systems, are active, indirect systems. Active solarwater-heating systems use pumps to circulate a heat-transfer fluidbetween the collector and the storage tank. Indirect active systemsuse a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the circulating fluidto the potable water. Antifreeze systems circulate a non-toxicfluid, usually propylene glycol, through the collector. See Figure5 or Appendix H. Even in freezing climates, however, water is oftenthe heat-transfer fluid of choice. This is because water has excellentheat-transfer properties, it is noncorrosive and highly stable,and it is less expensive. The need to prevent the system fromfreezing is, of course, the trade-off for using water as the heat-transferfluid. The drain-back system does this by totally draining theheat-transfer fluid out of the collector loop whenever the pumpis off, which is whenever the water in the collector is not hotenough to heat the potable water, and therefore also wheneverthere is any freeze danger. See Figure 6 or Appendix I. In contrastto most indirect systems, which are pressurized, many drain-backsystems use a nonpressurized heat-transfer-fluid loop. Nonpressurizedsystems may use plastic or site-built tanks that are less expensiveand more durable than pressurized metal tanks. Evaporated watermust be replaced and being open to the air poses greater corrosionpotential, but for a large system there may be significant savingswith a nonpressurized tank. Direct active systems run the potablewater to be consumed directly through the collector. Because theydo not require a heat exchanger, they average 5%-10% greater efficiency,but they must, in turn, activate special mechanisms to preventthe system from freezing. When control systems sense potentialfreeze conditions, valves on drain-down systems shut the servicewater off from the collector loop water and allow the collectorloop water to drain out into a sump or down a drain. Recirculatingsystems respond to freeze danger by pumping heated water throughthe collection loop. Although freezing problems have been documentedwith both of these direct systems in the past, a newly designedvalve for the former and careful choice of the right situationsto use the latter may prevent those problems. Hard water is particularlytroublesome for direct systems, because scale deposits that formin the collectors can reduce efficiency, increase the likelihoodof freeze damage by restricting flow, and eventually shut downa system. For smaller systems in mild climates with modest freezethreat, passive systems are also a viable option. Passive systemsdo not require pumps or electronic controls, greatly simplifyingoperation and maintenance, making passive systems very attractivefor certain situations. These are, in fact, the most commonlyused system types in climates with modest freeze threat. However,because they usually store water outside at or near the collector,these systems are subject to greater heat loss. In cold climatesparticularly, this heat loss reduces the efficiency of the systemin terms of the percentage of the solar energy originally absorbedthat is eventually used. Of the two main types of passive systems,integrated collector systems (ICS) store the heated water insidethe collector itself. Thermosiphon systems have a separate storagetank directly above the collector. In direct thermosiphon systems,the heated water rises from the collector to the tank and coolwater from the tank sinks back into the collector. In indirectthermosiphon systems, heated antifreeze rises from the collectorto an outer tank that surrounds the potable water storage tankand acts as a heat exchanger (be sure meets any code stipulationsabout double-wall heat exchangers for separation from potablewater). See Figure 7 or Appendix J. In both ICS and thermosiphonsystems, good insulation of the collector or tank helps preventfreezing and heat loss at night. The critical links, however,are the pipes connecting the collector or tank to the servicewater inside the house. Depending on pipe size and insulation,they can withstand temperatures that are only so far below freezingfor only so long, so the geographic areas where these passivesystems may be safely used must be carefully calculated. Hardwater is again a concern. Also, most roofs will support the substantialweight of the water storage, but this consideration cannot beignored in adding a system to an existing structure or in designinga new facility. Types of Collectors The principal component of asolar water-heating system—the collector—can be low-temperature,mid-temperature, or high-temperature. The glazed, flat-plate collectorsmost commonly used for commercial or residential domestic hotwater are classified as "mid-temperature" collectors,generally increasing water temperature to as much as 160°F(71°C). As shown in Figure 8, flat-plate collectors consistof an insulated, weather-tight housing or box, a clear glass orplastic cover glazing, a black absorber plate, and a system ofpassages for the heat-transfer fluid to pass through the collector.Special coatings on the absorber maximize absorption of sunlightand minimize re-radiation of heat. Gaskets and seals at the connectionsbetween the piping and the collector and around the glazing ensurea water-tight system. "Low-temperature" collectors, whichgenerally increase water temperature to as much as 90°F (32°C),are less expensive because they consist simply of an absorberwith flow passages and have no covering glass (glazing), insulation,or expensive materials such as aluminum or copper. These collectorsare less efficient in retaining solar energy when outdoor temperaturesare low, but are quite efficient when outside air temperaturesare close to the temperature to which the water is being heated.They are highly suitable for swimming pool heating and other usesthat require only a moderate increase in temperature and are mostcommonly used in warmer areas. For the last several years, theyhave been the most frequently installed collectors. In warm climates,low-temperature collectors are sometimes used in hybrid systemsthat heat a pool in the winter and supplement domestic water-heatingin the summer, when pool heating is not needed. Large federal facilitiesor ones with quasi-industrial operations such as laundries maybe able to efficiently use more sophisticated high-temperaturecollectors. Although they are also used in mid-temperature systems,evacuated-tube collectors can be designed to increase water/steamtemperatures to as much as 350°F (177°C). They may usea variety of configurations, but generally encase both the absorbersurface and the tubes of working fluid in a tubular glass vacuumfor highly efficient insulation. See Figure 9. Evacuated-tubecollectors are the most efficient collector type for cold climateswith low-level diffuse sunlight. They can be mounted either ona roof or on the ground, but they need to be protected from vandalismand can be damaged by hail or hurricanes. Parabolic-trough collectorsuse curved mirrors to focus the sunlight on a receiver tube (sometimesencased in an evacuated tube) running through the focal pointof the mirrors and can heat their transfer fluid to as much as570°F (299°C). See Figure 10. Because they use onlydirect-beam sunlight, parabolic-trough systems require trackingsystems to keep them focused toward the sun and are best suitedto areas with high direct solar radiation. See Figure 2. Becausethey are particularly susceptible to transmitting structural stressfrom wind loading and require large areas for installation, parabolic-troughcollectors are usually ground mounted. For electrical generationor industrial uses that require very high temperatures (greaterthan 392°F [200°C]), a heat-transfer fluid such as anoil is used, but depending on the degree of danger of freezing,antifreeze or water is used in the heat-transfer loop for domesticwater-heating systems. Parabolic-trough collectors generally requiregreater maintenance and supervision and particularly benefit fromeconomies of scale, so are generally used for larger systems. System Design System design for solar water-heating systems seeks to effectivelycombine solar water-heating with conventional water-heating. Ratherthan trying to store enough hot water to last through a long periodof cloudy weather, solar water-heating systems generally haveconventional water-heating systems as backup. Exceptions, suchas the Chickasaw National Recreation Area systems cited lateras a case study, are situations in which a lack of hot water fora few days is acceptable and the expense of conventional backupis not justified. Typically, a conventional hot-water heater drawspreheated water from the solar water-heating system storage tank.If that preheated water is not hot enough, the conventional waterheater operates as it would if it were starting with cold waterand further heats the water until it reaches its set deliverytemperature. Occasionally, the solar-heated water (up to 180°F[82°C]) is too hot for safe use, so it is mixed with coldwater in a tempering valve. As shown in Figure 5, a typical active,indirect solar water-heating system consists of one or more parallel-connectedglazed flat-plate collectors, a storage tank, a heat exchanger,piping and valves for the heat-transfer fluid and for the potablewater, pumps, and controls. Whenever the temperature of the waterin the collector exceeds that of the stored water by more thana certain amount (usually about 12°F [6°C]), the "controller"(a) turns on both pumps (b and c). The heat-transfer-fluid systempump (b) circulates heated antifreeze from the collectors to theheat exchanger (where it transfers heat to the potable water)and back to the collectors. The potable water system pump (c)circulates cool water from the bottom of the storage tank to theheat exchanger for heating and then back to the top of the storagetank. (Instead of having a separate heat exchanger unit, the heat-transferfluid may "wrap around" the potable water storage tankeither with piping or with a surrounding outer tank.) As wateris used from the conventional hot-water tank, it is replaced bysolar-heated water from the top of the storage tank. Inlet waterfrom the domestic supply system flows into the bottom of the storagetank to keep the system full. Alternatively, a single storage tankmay be used. A common single-tank design disconnects the heatingelement(s) from the lower portion of a conventional electric waterheater. When the solar water-heating system is operating, it drawscold water from the bottom of the tank and returns the heatedwater to the top. If the solar heating does not have the waterhot enough, the conventional heating elements in the top of thetank bring the water up to the desired temperature. Although notused much in this country, another single-tank design uses a rapidbooster or "tankless" heater in the water line as itleaves the tank to provide additional heating upon demand, ifneeded. This option avoids maintaining the whole tank at the desiredtemperature as most conventional water heaters do, minimizingstandby losses. Some two-tank systems add a second direct pipeconnection with appropriate check valves between the two tanksto increase heat flow from the solar storage tank to the conventionaltank. If the solar storage tank is hotter than the conventionalwater service tank, hot water flows by convection into the servicetank, even when there is no draw on the system. The most cost-effectivesize for a solar water-heating system will often be one that isjust sufficient to meet the full summer demand and that meetsapproximately two-thirds of the year-round demand. Including enoughcapacity to meet more of the winter demand reduces cost-effectivenessboth because excess capacity is wasted in the summer and becauseit is increasingly difficult to serve each additional portionof the winter demand with the reduced solar resource. The mostcost-effective size can vary widely with specific circumstances,however, and for commercial building systems especially, it issometimes best to plan to supply considerably less than two-thirdsof hot-water use. The key factors in determining the most cost-effectivesize for a system are the type and cost of conventional fuel andthe cost of the solar water-heating system to be installed. A Few Prescriptions for a Successful Solar Water-Heating System Size the system conservatively, probably to meet at most two-thirds of total hot-water use Pay careful attention to freeze and corrosion protection Use professional advice and prepare the bid package carefully, using an engineering or design firmor contractor that has experience in designing solar water-heating systems Ensure that you will have a facility manager committed to renewable energy and the project Commit to doing simple system checks a couple times per year and doing all necessary maintenance Goodrecords of past hot-water use help greatly to plan an effectivesolar water-heating system, and it is easy to install a watermeter on the incoming line to a hot-water heater. Water use canvary quite substantially, but for new construction, or if youruses of hot water are relatively "standard," there are"rules of thumb" to estimate hot-water requirementsfor various building uses. The handbook guideline for residentialuse, for example, is 20 to 30 gallons per person or 65 gallonsper household per day. (Note, however, that some more recent studieshave found average use as low as 25-35 gallons per household perday.) For office buildings, you can expect hot-water use of 0.5gallon per person per day. (The standard reference for projectinghot-water use is the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating,and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. [ASHRAE] Applications Handbook,Chapter 44.) The circumstances for specific large facilities mayvary considerably, but for small systems, a general rule of thumbis to have storage roughly equal to one day's hot-water use. Ina location with average available solar energy, you will needapproximately 0.5 to 1.0 square feet of flat-plate collector pergallon of storage tank. The daily pattern and consistency of hot-waterconsumption is also an important consideration for determiningthe size of collector and storage area needed. Uses that demandhot water mostly during the day (laundries, lunch service, orcar washes, for example) will require relatively less storagethan uses such as showers for which the heaviest demand occursat night or early in the morning. Installation Solar collectorscan be mounted on the roof of a building or on nearby grounds.For year-round uses, the most efficient orientation for the collectoris facing south, tilted at an angle about equal to the latitudeof the site. (The latitude plus 15° maximizes wintertimeheat collection and latitude minus 15° maximizes summertimeheat collection.) Collectors can be tilted to the proper orientationwith mounting racks. For cost savings and aesthetic reasons, however,they are increasingly being laid flat against pitched roofs. Ifthe orientation is at all close to optimal, the sacrifice in availableenergy is usually quite modest. For Denver, Colorado, for example,with a tilt of latitude minus 15°, mounting the collectorsas much as 45° off of southern orientation loses at most10% of available solar energy. Similarly, with a true southernorientation, you can mount collectors at up to 25° off latitudetilt with only 10% loss. Solar resource information for Boulder,Colorado, is presented in Appendix B as an example of availabledata. Factors Contributing to the Cost-Effectiveness of Solar Water Heating Each factor helpful, but not necessary to have all of them. High-cost conventional water-heatingsystem (more than about $15 to $20 per million Btu) High daily volume of very-hot-wateruse (such as for laundries or industrial processes) Steady demand throughout the week andyear, or highest need in the summer Relatively greater hot-water use duringthe day Unshaded, south-facing roof space orsunny, nearby grounds Good solar resource (see Figure 1,Figure 2, Figure 4 and Figure 5) Cold-water supply (see Figure 3 andAppendix A) Soft water Incorporating solar water-heating systems in new constructionhas the advantages of ensuring that there is an appropriate rooffor collector placement, allowing for aesthetic design, and reducinginstallation costs. If the builder, architect, or engineer isused to working with solar water-heating, it can also save ondesign cost. But, almost any building can incorporate a solarcollector retrofit. It is relatively easy to add a solar water-heatingsystem to an existing facility and the economics will be nearlyas good. There are generally relatively few special regulationsto consider in installing solar water-heating systems, but thereare pertinent building, mechanical, and plumbing codes. Areaswith special building regulations because of earthquake or hurricanedanger, might have structural requirements limiting the weightor type of equipment that can be placed on a roof. Some localcodes for residential or commercial areas regulate the attachmentof collectors to roofs or walls. A few jurisdictions require rigorousseparation between the heat-transfer fluid and the potable waterin closed-loop systems that could rule out single-wall heat exchangers.Besides regulations such as these, systems need only comply withstandard plumbing and local building codes. Numerous manufacturersmake quality solar collectors and solar water-heating systems.In addition to checking out the various manufacturers, one wayto ensure that your system meets generally applied standards isto install an Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC)-certifiedsystem. An independent, nonprofitorganization created by organizations representing solar equipmentmanufacturers, state governments, and consumers, the SRCC has instituted a qualityassurance and performance rating program. As of December 1995,the SRCC had certified three unglazed collectors and 60 glazed flat-platecollectors made by a total of 12 different manufacturers, plus78 total solar water-heating systems made by 12 different manufacturers.The SRCC certification process also ensures that health and safetyissues have been addressed, that typical code provisions are compliedwith, and that durability and reliability standards have beenmet and are correctly portrayed. There, of course, may be collectorsand systems of acceptable quality that have not been rated bySRCC. A complete list of all solar collector and water-heatingsystem manufacturers was not available, but "Suppliers"lists the manufacturers of the SRCC-certified collectorsand systems plus manufacturers who belong to the Solar EnergyIndustries Association. You can also check the Thomas Registerof American Manufacturers. The Energy Information Agency's annualsurvey, reported in the Renewable Energy Annual, reports 41 activesolar collector manufacturing companies shipping 7.6 million squarefeet of collectors in 1994. Information on SRCC-certified systemsis contained in the Directory of SRCC Certified Solar Collectorand Water Heating System Ratings. Appendix G, Appendix H, Appendix I, and Appendix J illustrateSRCC collector and system rating information. (The Florida SolarEnergy Center also rates solar water-heating systems.) Federal-Sector Potential Technology Screening Process The FederalTechnology Alert (FTA) series targets technologies that appearto have significant untapped federal-sector potential and forwhich some federal installation experience exists. Many of thealerts are about new technologies identified through advertisementsfor technology suggestions in the Commerce Business Daily andtrade journals, and through direct correspondence in responseto an open technology solicitation. Those technologies are thenevaluated in terms of potential energy, cost, and environmentalbenefits to the federal sector. Solar water heating is a renewableenergy technology with clearly known energy, cost, and environmentalbenefits, and a large number of manufacturers of a variety ofproducts—but still with substantial untapped potential for thefederal sector. Solar water heating was selected for the New TechnologyDemonstration Program through response to the open technologysolicitation. Estimated Market Potential The Office of TechnologyAssessment reported in 1991 that the U.S. Government owns or leasesapproximately 500,000 buildings, owns an additional 422,000 housingunits for military families, and subsidizes utility bills fornine million private households. If the objective were to reducefossil fuel energy use and associated pollution, regardless ofcost-effectiveness, the potential application of solar water heatingwould clearly be immense. Even limiting application to cost-effectivesituations, opportunities for solar water heating may still bequite substantial. Combining the large number of military andother housing units with the fact that 18% of residential energyuse is for water heating and an Energy Information Administrationstatement that 38% of U.S. residential water heating is electric,points to a very large potential application for small systemswhere economics are likely to be attractive. Federal prisons,hospitals, and barracks are ideal situations for large, high-temperaturesystems to prove cost effective. An estimate of the number ofswimming pools at federal facilities is not available, but thereare certainly a significant number and the likelihood of solarpool heating being cost effective is quite good. Application The cost of operating conventional or backupwater-heating systems is the single most important factor in determiningeconomic feasibility for solar water-heating systems, but a varietyof other factors are also important. Solar water-heating projectsfor federal facilities are most likely to be cost effective inthree situations: Small, "residential-size" facilitiessuch as visitor centers, campground showers, or staff housing,which would otherwise be dependent upon high-cost energy sources Largefacilities that require large volumes of hot water (more thana thousand gallons per day) or have operations that use high-temperaturehot water Swimming pools. Small System ExamplesSome examples of recently installedor planned small solar water-heating systems for federal facilitiesinclude a system for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)headquarters offices in Washington, D.C., three systems for anenvironmental education center in the Phoenix, Arizona, area,and three systems for a National Park Service national recreationarea in Oklahoma. The 480 square foot active, indirect system recentlyinstalled to serve the privately owned building housing the EPAheadquarters will provide 71% of the demand for hot water (approximately1150 gallons/day), saving $2,656 annually in electricity. Systemcosts were shared by EPA and the DOE Solar Process Heat Program.With a 10% federal tax credit to the building owner, plus a rebatefrom the local electric utility because the system reduces peakdemand, the system will pay for itself (simple payback) in 6 to7 years. Three small drainback systems will be part of new Bureauof Reclamation facilities in Lake Pleasant, Arizona. The Bureauis building a classroom building and two dormitories, which itwill lease to the Maricopa County Outdoor Education Center (OEC).The classroom building includes a cafeteria and the dormitorieswill house 50 students each. The Bureau plans to use solar waterheatingsystems for each of the three buildings at this remote site, notonly to reduce the cost of water heating but also to serve asan educational tool for students. The OEC will be an all-electricfacility except for propane for auxiliary water heating. The systemfor the classroom building has 70 square feet of collector and120 gallons of water storage and will meet 64% of the waterheatingload. It will save 17,800 kBtu/yr. The systems for each dormitoryhave 145 square feet of collectors and 240 gallons of water storage.The dormitory systems will meet 45% of the annual load and eachsave 34,300 kBtu/yr. A third example is currently being designedby the National Park Service for the Chickasaw National RecreationArea in Oklahoma. Three solar water-heating systems are expectedto cost $35,000 and have a simple payback of 9 years. The systemswill have no backup system, must be designed to shut down forwinter and quickly start up in the spring, and must have veryhigh reliability because of the remote location and the lack ofoperation and maintenance staff. See "Case Study—Chickasaw National Recreation Area" for a complete description and "Who Is Using the Technology" for contacts regarding particular projects. Where to Apply—Small Facilities For smallfederal facility projects, the cost of conventional water-heatingsystems dominates the economic feasibility of solar water-heatingsystems. As can be seen from Table1, the cost of conventionalenergy varies greatly. Note that these figures are national averagesand utility rates vary greatly by region and individual facilitycontract. There may be regions in which the relative effectiveenergy cost of the various energy supplies differs from that below.Table 2 shows averageutility rates by region. Water heater efficienciesalso vary significantly, particularly for larger heaters, from77% to 97% for electric and from 43% to 86% for gas. You shouldtherefore also investigate the cost effectiveness of buying amore efficient water heater either on its own or in conjunctionwith installation of a solar water-heating system. The cost ofsolar water-heating systems can vary widely depending upon thecircumstances for a specific installation, region of the country,and other factors and are not generally available as publishednumbers. To get a ballpark idea, however, we can look at fourresidential-size systems approved by the Sacramento MunicipalUtility District for its electrical-demand-reduction incentiveprogram. The four systems are a 42-square-foot indirect thermosiphonsystem, an evacuated-tube integrated collector system, a 64-square-footantifreeze system, and a 40-square-foot antifreeze system thatuses a "wraparound" heat exchanger so it needs onlyone pump instead of two. The systems vary in cost from $2,860to $3,180 and from meeting 61% to 74% of an assumed 57-gallon-per-daydemand (averages 8.8 MBtu per year delivered energy). If we assume20-year continuous operation and 0.5% per year operation and maintenancecost for the two passive systems and 2% per year for the two activesystems, the levelized cost for the systems falls in the $20 to$23 per MBtu range. Looking at Table1 and Table 2,we can see thatthis is less than the average cost of electricity for federalfacilities, nationally and for several of the regions, but thereis little chance of competing with other types of water heating. Asit happens, many smaller federal facilities or elements of federalfacilities are located in relatively remote areas where conventionalwater-heating utility costs are particularly high. Three-quartersof the projects built in the 1980s under the Solar in FederalBuildings Program were small systems (less than 100 square feetof collector) for facilities in the National Park System. Anyof the mid-temperature technologies will work well for small facilities.Solar water-heating works well for general domestic needs andfor isolated facilities such as laundries, showers, visitor centers,ranger stations, and staff housing. "Off-the-shelf" packagesare often quite appropriate for small or remote facilities suchas these, and a variety of SRCC-certified systems are available,so engineering design work is not necessary. If the potentialsystem involves more than two or three collectors or will be connectedto unusual plumbing, electrical, or structural systems, a bidpackage will likely be needed for a specific design. But in mostcases, you will still be able to use off-the-shelf componentsand the ASHRAE Active Solar Heating Systems Design Manual. In warmclimates with limited freeze danger, the low-maintenance natureof passive systems is an attractive feature for isolated locations.Solar electric cells can provide power to operate solar water-heatingsystems if electric utility connections are unavailable. Evenif grid electricity is available, solar cells are an excellentmatch for solar water-heating pumps and often are used as themain operation control for the system. When there is enough sunlightfor the hot-water system to be operating and power is needed torun the pumps, the solar cells are also producing power. Large System ExamplesThe Federal Bureau of Prisons recentlyawarded a contract to build a solar thermal system at its correctionalinstitution in Phoenix. Similar to installations at state andlocal prisons, the system of parabolic-trough collectors and athermal energy storage tank will provide hot water for inmates,laundry facilities, and kitchens. Another example of a large solarwater-heating system for a federal facility is a hybrid chillerheat recovery/solar water-heating system for the Prince Kuhio FederalBuilding in Honolulu, Hawaii. This building has 1,083,300 squarefeet of floor space and houses a number of federal agencies. Theplanned hybrid system combines a chiller heat recovery systemwith a direct solar heating system. It provides 3000 gallons ofhot water per day and includes 1300 gallons of preheat water storage. The chiller heat recovery component of the system uses a compactbrazed heat exchanger with a heat-transfer area of 14 square feet.The optimized solar heating component of the system has a solararray with 1361 square feet of collector area on the roof. Thehybrid system allows the solar component to be about two-thirdsthe size it would have been without inclusion of the chiller heatrecovery. Because of the Hawaiian climate, freeze protection isnot needed and the solar portion of the system circulates thepotable water directly through the solar collectors without aheat exchanger. The solar component of the system provides 55%of the buildings water-heating needs, with the total system providing82% of annual demand. The system meets approximately 75% of thewater-heating load in the winter and 90% in the summer. The estimatedinstalled cost for the system is $58,389. The system offsetsthe need for synthetic natural gas at a cost of $1.22/therm. Theproject has a simple payback period of 9 years and an adjustedinternal rate of return of 6.75%. Where to Apply—Large Systems Although the cost of conventional energyis still the most critical factor for the economics of solar water-heatingsystems, for large federal facilities, it is less likely to bethe factor that makes solar water-heating cost effective. Becauseof their size and because they are less likely to be in remotelocations, most large facilities will have moderate or low-costenergy available. The cost-effectiveness of solar water-heatingsystems for large facilities may, however, be improved significantlyby economies of scale in building a large system. While smallsystems with less than 100 square feet of collector generallycost between $50 and $90 per square foot of collector aperture,that figure can drop to $40 or $45 per square foot for flat-platecollector systems with more than 1000 square feet of collector,$30 per square foot for systems with more than 10,000 square feetof collector, or even $25 per square foot for parabolic-troughsystems with more than 20,000 square feet of collector. As canbe seen from Table 3,that reduction in cost can make all thedifference in whether a project will beat out the conventionalenergy costs cited above. The table divides total system cost(including 2% per year operation and maintenance) by the amountof energy the system would produce over a 20-year lifetime.These costs do not include government acquisition costs, whichtend to be relatively constant regardless of project size, givingfurther advantage to larger projects. As can be seen by comparing Table1 and Table 3,none of our six sample cities can compete withconventional water heating paying the effective national-averagecost for electricity of $23.13/MBtu with small solar water-heatingsystems costing $75 to $90 per square foot of collector and onlytwo at $60 per square foot. But with a larger system costing $40or $50 per square foot, solar water-heating is quite competitive.These numbers are, of course, ballpark figures that do not takeinto account the specifics of particular situations, but theydo illustrate the importance of either competing against expensiveconventional water-heating or having a large water-heating loadthat allows building a large enough solar water-heating systemto bring costs down. If hot water use is more than 1000 gallonsper day or conventional energy cost is more than $15 to $20 permillion Btu, prospects are good for a large solar water-heatingsystem to prove cost effective. At more than 10,000 gallons perday, parabolic-trough systems should be considered. Nearly allprisons, hospitals, and military bases, and many other federalfacilities with kitchens, laundries, or showers, use large quantitiesof hot water. Many of these facilities also have populations thatare constant throughout the week and throughout the year and thereforehave consistent water use. These factors make it worthwhile toconsider a solar water-heating system—particularly ifconventionalenergy costs are relatively high. As indicated by the case studybelow, additional savings are often possible during the summerby recovering heat from chiller systems. It is occasionally possibleto take further advantage of economies of scale by also providinghot water for space heating or cooling or other purposes. Currentthinking, however, is to look first at providing just for directhot water use, because adding heating or cooling makes systemsmore complex and may adversely affect economics by increasingthe variation in demand throughout the year. Active indirect systemswith flat-plate collectors work well for meeting large water-heatingdemands, but larger water volumes and need for high-temperaturewater also make high-temperature parabolic-trough or evacuated-tubesystems attractive, depending on the climate. While flat-platecollector systems typically provide enough heat to efficientlyraise heat transfer fluid temperatures to as much as 160°F(70°C), the high-temperature collectors operate moreefficientlywhen generating water or steam at much higher temperatures—upto 350°F (175°C) for evacuated-tube collectorsand upto 570°F (300°C) for parabolic-trough collectors.Sothese systems are particularly good for facilities with high-temperaturewater needs such as laundries, which typically use water as hotas 180°F (82°C); kitchens, which typically usewatertemperatures from 140°F to 195°F (60°Cto 91°C)for dishwashing; or industrial processes. Swimming Pool ExamplesSandia National Laboratories hashelped Camp Pendleton in Southern California refurbish an inactivesolar pool heating system at one of the Camp's recreational swimmingpools. The refurbishment was completed in the summer of 1995 for$10,000. The collector array has 2,560 square feet of unglazedcollectors using copper pipes. If the pool was used yearround,it would save $8,000 per year in natural gas. This pool is usedonly 3-4 months per year but was chosen as a pilot project forCamp Pendleton. The Marine Corps has six more pools with non-operatingsolar water-heating systems at the Camp, and these are each usedyear-round. Now that the pilot has been completed, the Marinesare looking into refurbishing the other six systems as well. TheBarnes Field House on the Fort Huachuca Army Base in Fort Huachuca,Arizona, uses a 2,000-square-foot solar system for pool heating,see Figure 11. The system was installed in June 1980, andsupplies heat for a 3,500-square-foot indoor pool. The system meets49% of the annual load and offsets the need for 835 MBtu of naturalgas per year. A noteworthy example of local government use of solarwater heating is the city of Santa Clara, California, solar poolheating program. Since 1975, the city's municipal utility has beenproviding for the design, installation, and ongoing maintenanceof solar pool heating systems. The pool owner pays an initialinstallation fee to cover the value of the labor and permanentmaterials required to install a solar heating system. The recoverablecomponents, including the panels and automatic controls, are rented;the monthly fees are set by the city council as a "Solar UtilityRate." Each user and the city enter into a contract that definesthe responsibilities of each party and sets the monthly utilityfee proportional to the size of the solar energy system. Feesare designed to repay installation costs as though repaying anamortized loan for a term equal to the expected life of the equipment.To date, more than 300 of the 800 pools in the city are heatedby the city's solar program. Where to Apply—Swimming Pools One of the most consistently cost-effective uses for solarwater-heating systems is for heating swimming pools. Low-temperaturecollectors—most of which are for swimming pools—haveaccountedfor the majority of solar water-heating systems sold since 1991(more than 85% on a square-foot basis in 1993). Many militarybases and other federal facilities have swimming pools, so theremay be many cost-effective opportunities for installation of solarswimming pool heaters. If you have a pool and it is now heated,you may reap great savings, because solar pool-heating systemsfrequently pay for themselves within 2 to 4 years—evenwhenreplacing natural gas heat. If your pool is not now heated, youmay be able to extend your season by several months. If you arefaced with budget cuts, energy savings may allow you to keep apool open. The pool's filter system pumps the water through thecollector and the heat storage is in the pool itself. Becauseonly a modest temperature increase is needed, most systems useinexpensive, unglazed low-temperature collectors, which are oftenessentially systems of water tubes built into dark plastic. "Offthe shelf" packages are generally appropriate and maintenanceis minimal. Some smaller systems are operated manually or withtimers, but larger systems are operated by electronic sensorsand controls. When the collector temperature is sufficiently greaterthan the pool temperature, a diverting valve—the onlymoving part—divertswater from the filter system through the collector loop. As withother hot-water uses, conservation of generated heat is generallythe most cost-effective investment and swimming pool covers shouldbe considered at the same time as a solar water-heating system. Brochureson covers and solar water-heating systems for swimming pools anda software package that can evaluate the economic feasibilityfor your pool are available from the Energy Efficiency and RenewableEnergy Clearinghouse. Call 1-800-DOE-EREC and ask for the "EnergySmart Pools" package. The Right Collector for the Right UseSolar collectorefficiency is a function of optical gain1 minus heat loss2. Collectorsfor low-temperature applications (like swimming pools) have highoptical gains (no cover glass and high surface absorptivity) butthey also have high heat loss because they are uninsulated. Mid-temperaturecollectors, for domestic water heating, have cover glass and insulationto reduce heat loss, but the cover glass results in slightly loweroptical gains due to reflection of sunlight off the glass. High-temperaturecollectors such as evacuated tubes and focusing parabolic troughsalso have optical losses from cover glass and focusing reflectors,but they retain heat at very high temperatures, making them idealfor high-temperature applications like absorption cooling and powergeneration. The type of collector best suited to a particularapplication depends both on the temperature above ambient to whichthe water is to be heated and on collector cost. The followingtable of energy generation per area of collector (based on selectedcollectors from the SRCC Directory) shows that low-temperaturecollectors are indeed the most effective for low-temperature applications;mid-temperature collectors are the best for medium-temperature applications;and high-temperature collectors are the best for high-temperatureapplications. For low-temperature applications the more expensiveinsulated collectors offer no advantage, but at high temperaturesthey are essential to collect solar heat. Unglazed Pool Heater (low) Glazed Collector (mid) Evacuated-Tube Collector (high) Optical Gain Coefficient1 .87 .74 .50 Heat Loss Coefficient2 21.3 W/M2°C (3.7 Btu/hr ft2°F) 4.9 W/M2°C (.9 Btu/hr ft2°F) 21.3 W/M2°C (3.7 Btu/hr ft2°F) Amount Temperature of Water Entering the Collector Exceeds Ambient Clear Day (6.4 kWh/m2day-2000 Btu/ft2day) Heat Delivery 5°C (9°F) (low) 4.1 kWh/m2day (1300 Btu/ft2day) 4.0 kWh/m2day (1250 Btu/ft2day) 3.0 kWh/m2day (1000 Btu/ft2day) 20°C (36°F) (medium) 1.5 kWh/m2day (470 Btu/ft2day) 3.2 kWh/m2day (1000 Btu/ft2day) 2.8 kWh/m2day (900 Btu/ft2day) 50°C (90°F) (high) 0 kWh/m2day (0 Btu/ft2day) 2.0 kWh/m2day (640 Btu/ft2day) 2.4 kWh/m2day (770 Btu/ft2day) 1fraction of sunlight captured as heat 2mulitiplier for the amount that the temperature of the return water that enters the collector exceeds outside air temperature, to determine heat loss from the collector. For example, the heat collected by a glazed collector heating waterfrom 60°C when it is 0°C outside and the sun is shiningat 1000 W/m2, would be: .74 (1000 W/m2) - 4.9 W/m2°C (60°C - 0°C) = 446 W/m2. Application Screening The first steptoward installing a solar water-heating system is to assess yourhot-water needs. How much hot water at what temperature do yourvarious facilities use (or are new facilities expected to use),on what kind of schedule? How much do you pay for the energy toheat that water? Can you save money with a more efficient conventionalwater heater? What options do you have for reducing hot-wateruse or lowering the temperature of water provided? The next stepis to obtain a preliminary estimate of whether solar water-heatingwill be cost effective. The FEMP Federal Renewables Program atthe National Renewable Energy Laboratory has developed a computerprogram known as Federal Renewable Energy Screening Assistant(FREScA) that can make such a preliminary assessment for you.See "How Do You Figure"for alist of the necessary information. (For swimming pools, you canuse "Energy Smart Pools" software instead of FREScA.) For smaller projects, a clearly positive FREScA calculation willoften be sufficient to proceed to system purchase. For large systems,a positive FREScA assessment should be followed up with a formalfeasibility study (see "Economic Criteria"). Largerprojects will likely require a private engineer at some point,but the FEMP Federal Renewables Program staff can provide fairlyextensive assistance. A general rule of thumb for federal facilitiesis that a renewable energy installation should pay for itselfwithin about 10 to 15 years. Because the lifetime of a systemcan be as much as 30 years, that means you can look forward toas much as 20 years of "free energy." System Selection and Procurement As a general rule, the optimal type of solar water-heatingsystem depends on the increase in water temperature that the systemwill be used for. Low-temperature systems—with no coverglazingor insulation—absorb a high percentage of the availablesolarheat but also lose sizable amounts of energy. They are thereforebest for uses such as swimming pools that only require a modestincrease in water temperature. Adding glazing and insulation cutsdown on heat absorption but greatly increases heat retention,so the added cost of mid-temperature systems is cost effectivefor most applications requiring greater increases in water temperature.High-temperature systems, such as evacuated tubes with their veryhigh insulation and parabolic troughs with their concentrationof the sunlight, are most effective when used to provide eithervery large amounts of hot water or high temperature uses suchas kitchens, laundries, or industrial uses. (See "TheRight Collector for the Right Use" for detailed discussion.)Table 4 summarizescharacteristicsthat may make certain system types particularly suitable or inappropriatefor your facility. Having found that a solar water-heating systemis likely to be cost effective for your facility, chosen one ortwo appropriate system types, and determined the approximate sizeof the system, you can now probably pick out the most appropriateproducts from the SRCC Directory (for smallersystems) and proceedtoward purchase in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations.For most agencies this means small purchase agreements based ona request for quotes for projects costing less than $25,000, requestsfor quotes including notice in the Commerce BusinessDaily forprojects costing from $25,000 to $50,000, and going out for bidsfor anything more than $50,000. (A new electronic mail advertisingsystem in the works will allow requests for quotes to be usedfor anything up to $100,000.) For smaller systems, specifics onyour hot-water usage pattern, water supply temperature, and detailedutility rate schedule will probably be sufficient additional datafor potential vendors to supply the cost, performance, and otherinformation you need to select a system and to decide whetherto proceed. It is not quite like going to the discount store fora conventional home water heater, but complete off-the-shelf systemsare available. FEMP is working on getting solar water-heatingsystems on the GSA purchase schedule (perhaps by 1997, check withthe FEMP Help Line), which will make it easier to obtain specificmodels at fixed prices. They are also developing product recommendationsfor solar water-heating systems. In the meantime, certified systemsfrom the SRCC Directory are a place to start, and there may bemany other good systems to choose from. For larger systems, youwill need engineering help to select an optimum system and doa detailed economic assessment for that system (see "EconomicCriteria"). You may have to go out for bids tohirean engineer to design the system, but can probably do so witha sole-source contract for professional services. The designercannot then be a vendor for the system but can write the specificationsfor the bid request and either install or supervise the system'sinstallation. Appendix Eis an example of specifications usedfor the Chickasaw National Recreation Area case study. Check withthe FEMP Federal Renewables Program (303-384-7509) for other previouslyprepared specifications that may be more similar to your plannedsystem. How Do You Figure?To obtain a preliminary analysis ofwhether solar water-heating would be cost effective for your situation,use the Federal Renewable Energy Screening Assistant (FREScA)software package, available from the Federal Renewables Programat the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL): 303-384-7531.Federal Renewables Program staff can also do the analysis foryou, if you provide the following data: Hot water use in gallons per day Fuel type and cost Zip code Incoming cold-water temperature Outgoing hot-water-supply temperature Area of southern exposure roof or nearby grounds available for system Tilt and direction of roof area. To obtain comprehensive solar resource data (the FREScA system doesinclude solar resource data based on your zip code), request theNREL Solar Radiation Data Manual for Flat-Plate and ConcentratingCollectors (see Appendix B) or the CD-ROM of the National SolarRadiation Data Base. To estimate hot-water use, check your hot-wateruse records; install a meter and track usage; or project demandbased on average use for various facilities as found in the AmericanSociety of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers'Handbook of Applications. Typical usage per day per occupant ingallons is 20-30 for housing, 30 for hospitals, 5 for dining facilities,and 3 for other uses. To determine incoming water temperature (mayvary considerably with season), call your water utility, checkthe supply with a thermometer, or refer to Figure 3 and Appendix A. In some instances, the average annual air temperature alsoserves as a rough indication of water supply temperature. To calculate system output information more rigorously than the preliminaryanalysis provided by FREScA, use a computer tool such as F-chart,or consult with Federal Renewables Program staff or a solar water-heatingsystem supplier. The optimum size for collector and storage willdepend upon fuel cost, your hot water use pattern, and the costof the system being considered, but expect storage to roughlymatch one day's use and collector size to be approximately 1.0square feet per gallon of storage. (The resulting system shouldmeet as much as about two-thirds of annual demand.) Precise optimizationof system size will require both a calculation of output and anevaluation of the economics of contemplated systems. To evaluate the economics of a contemplated system in detail, use the FEMPLife-Cycle Costing Handbook and associated BLCC software (callthe FEMP Help Line at 800-DOE-EREC), or consult with the FEMP FederalRenewables Program or a private engineer. To evaluate the economicfeasibility of covers and solar water-heating systems for yourswimming pool, use Energy Smart Pools software, also availablefrom the FEMP Help Line. Economic Criteria The policy for evaluating whether solarwater-heating or other renewable energy projects are cost effectiveand therefore appropriate for federal facilities is containedin 10 CFR Part 436A of the Code of Federal Regulations.The principalcriterion of these regulations is that the life-cycle cost (valuein base-year dollars of all costs for the full analysis period)for the project must be less than any alternatives, includingprojected utility payments with the existing water-heating system.(Three similar criteria may be used instead for retrofit projects,and projects with "insignificant" cost are presumedcost effective.) Executive Order 12902 goes beyond the cost-effectivenessregulations to stipulate that if a project will pay for itself(simple payback period time for savings to return the cost ofthe investment) in less than 10 years, it shall be built (Sections103 and 303). For most situations the 10-year payback criterionwill be more rigorous than the life-cycle-cost criterion. Manyprojects will meet the life-cycle-cost criterion even though theirsimple payback is somewhat longer than 10 years. Agencies mustbuild projects with a simple payback of less than 10 years, butmay also build any project that meets the life-cycle-cost criterion. Life-cycle-costanalysis calculates the sum during the life of the project ofthe present value of investment costs, operation and maintenance,replacement costs, and energy costs, minus salvage value of replacedparts. A manual for life-cycle costing (National Institute ofStandards and Technology [NIST] Handbook 135), an annual set ofprescribed energy prices and discount rates (NISTIR 85-3273),and Building Life-Cycle Cost (BLCC) software (NIST 4481) are allavailable by calling the FEMP Help Line at 800-DOE-EREC. (Someagencies allow simpler life-cycle calculations, but the BLCC isrequired if FEMP funding is involved. You may also need Mean'sMechanical Cost Data [available from 800-448-8182] forestimatingsystem component costs.) In addition to determining whether aproject is cost effective, economic analysis helps to determinethe size of the solar water-heating project that will minimizecosts during the life of the project. The cost of conventionalwater-heating options will usually be the biggest factor in determiningoptimal project size. The higher the conventional water-heatingcost, the larger portion of the load you are likely to be ableto meet effectively with a solar water-heating system. Calculatingthe resulting savings in conventional water-heating (subtractingany operation and maintenance cost for the system) and using anappropriate discount rate or interest factor to compare presentsystem cost to future savings determines whether the system isa worthwhile investment. The prescribed discount rate for evaluatingrenewable energy projects for federal facilities for 1995 is 3%.A low discount rate such as this favors future savings over initialinvestment—and thus encourages renewable energy projectssuchas solar water-heating systems. Although standard life-cycle-costanalysis does not include a way to take credit for environmentalexternalities such as benefits of reducing fossil fuel consumption,these may be an important consideration if the economic efficiencycalculation is close. The National Park Service has developedguidelines for calculating and including avoided air emissionsresulting from reduced electrical power production in their internaleconomic evaluation of large energy efficiency and renewable energyprojects (Doug DeNio, 303-969-2162). Some agencies have chosento relax the economic evaluation criteria somewhat for showcasebuildings in new facilities or demonstration projects at existingfacilities. Projects must be basically cost effective, however,or else they do not make good demonstrations. Funding Sources Thefirst place to look for funding is regular internal agency funding:local purchasing authority for very small projects; Congressionallyapproved line items for very large projects; and regular agencyfunding. Special agency-specific funds, such as the Defense Department'sEnergy Conservation Investment Program, may be available for energyefficiency and renewable energy projects. Although there is notexpected to be any funding available for fiscal year 1996, theFederal Energy Efficiency Fund of the U.S. Department of Energy(DOE) and other programs have provided funding assistance forrenewable energy projects at federal facilities in the past. Callthe FEMP Federal Renewables Program (303-384-7509) for the currentstatus of any available funding. An important new financing optionavailable to federal facilities is energy savings performancecontracting (ESPC). A private energy services contractor designsand installs the system, paying the full cost of parts and labor,or the project can be financed by a third party. The federal facilitypays nothing up front beyond initial feasibility studies. Thecontractor is responsible for operating and maintaining the systemand training facility personnel in its use. The facility thenpays the contractor for the energy received as a discounted percentage(usually about 15% less) of what it would have cost from the utility.The facility pays these "utility savings" bills fora specified contract period (up to 25 years) from its utilityor operation and maintenance budget, after which the facilityretains the savings and equipment. Thus, the contractor and thefacility share the savings in utility costs. (There are now quitea few companies set up to do energy service contracts; an associationis listed on page 24.) The facility must announce intent to considerESPC proposals in the Commerce Business Daily,but may acceptunsolicited proposals. The DOE has a list of prequalified energyservice companies and model procurement documents, as well asa manual on the ESPC program (for copies, call the FEMP Help Lineat 800-DOE-EREC). Through 1995, 17 performance contracts at a totalcost of approximately $30 million have been awarded under theESPC program (mostly energy efficiency so far, but solar water-heatingis clearly eligible). Both the contractors and FEMP are developinga track record and experience base that will help make projectsgo more smoothly. FEMP is currently working on setting up indefinitequantity contracts to allow qualified contractors to serve anyeligible federal facility project within a region. The obviousadvantages of performance contracting are limited initial investment,no capital investment, no operation and maintenance responsibility,and no technical or financial risk for the success of the project.ESPC contracting is especially attractive for very large projectsthat require substantial capital outlay or extensive operationand maintenance. However, if funds can be obtained to build aproject, straight agency funding brings the full cost savingsback to the facility for the life of the project. Also, even withprequalified contractors, the paperwork necessary for performancecontracting is significant enough to make it unattractive forsmaller projects for which construction can be more easily funded. Morethan half the states and many local governments do provide incentivesfor solar thermal collector or solar cell system purchases. Theseprograms are not generally directly applicable to federal facilities,but may be helpful in certain situations. Utility company incentivesfor demand reduction and load management are currently an importantnonfederal source of financial assistance for solar water-heatingsystems. Demand-side-management activities, such as promotingsolar water-heating systems, can save a utility from investingin system expansions or help them comply with air quality programs.Among the utilities that have been actively providing rebatesor other financial incentives for new solar water-heating systemsare the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Florida Power andLight, and the Eugene Water and Electric Board. Wisconsin PublicService and the Hawaiian Electric Company are developing programs. Although most programs such as these were designed for residentialcustomers, they also generally apply to commercial facilitiesincluding federal buildings. Federal facilities may be able tonegotiate specific incentives for larger projects beyond the scopeof standard programs or where standard programs do not exist.On the one hand, anticipated utility industry restructuring maycut back on demand-side-management programs, but on the other,it may encourage utilities to spin off energy service companiesspecifically set up to design and install energy efficiency andrenewable energy projects. Technology Performance An estimated one million residentialand 200,000 commercial solar water-heating systems have been installedin the United States. Seven hundred and eighteen systems were installed at federal facilitiesduring or shortly after 1981 through the Solar in Federal BuildingsProgram. For discussion of experiences with recent installations,see "Small System Examples", "Large System Examples", "Swimming Pool Examples", and "Who Is Using theTechnology". The technology is well developedand today's solar water-heating systems are well proven and reliablewhen correctly matched to climate and load. The current marketconsists of a relatively small number of manufacturers and installersthat provide reliable equipment and quality system design. A qualityassurance and performance rating program, instituted by a voluntaryassociation of the solar industry and various consumer groups,makes it easier to select reliable equipment with confidence. Solarwater-heating is a renewable energy technology that saves nearlyas much (there is usually some excess capacity) conventional energyuse as it produces. Water heating accounts for about 18% of energyuse in residential and 4% of energy use in commercial buildings.Solar water-heating can be used to replace much of that electricaland fossil fuel energy consumption, wherever it is found costeffective. Cost-effective system design often matches hot-wateruse in the summer and partially meets the demand in winter fora net production of about two-thirds of total hot-water use. System Maintenance Solar water-heating systems are long-lived and requirerelatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system,some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system functioningsmoothly. All solar water-heating systems should be checked outat least twice per year. Proper operation of sensors and controllersshould be tested for active systems. A primary cause of problemsis calcium carbonate deposits (scaling) from hard water. Othermajor maintenance concerns are pumps failing and tanks developingleaks. As with conventional water heaters, pressurized hot-watertanks will have about a 15-year lifetime. Ten-year warrantieson collectors are the industry standard. Integrated collectorand thermosiphon systems need little maintenance. Relief valves($10) will require replacement approximately every 15 years, aswith any hot-water system. Unless you have hard water, the systemsshould not require flushing and should last 20 to 30 years. Directthermosiphon systems are not recommended for facilities with hardwater. For integrated collector and indirect thermosiphon systems,very hard water necessitates additional maintenance and your contractormay suggest flushing or other measures. The antifreeze in indirectthermosiphon systems should be replaced every 5-10 years. Directactive systems such as drain-down and recirculating systems arealso strongly affected by scaling and are not generally recommendedwhere water is hard. One way to combat scaling problems is toinstall an extra anode rod in the water heater. (All conventionalwater heaters have anodes and replacing them could extend servicelife, but they are often hard to get at.) In addition, controllersand valves of direct active systems must be very carefully maintainedto prevent freezing problems. Because drain-back systems are indirectand can use demineralized water for the heat-transfer loop, scalingfrom hard water is not as serious. Only the potable-water sideof the heat exchanger requires cleaning. (It should be checkedevery year or so until you have a sense of the scaling problemfor your water supply.) If the system is not pressurized, it mayrequire regular replacement of evaporated water or checking thevalve that does that. Sensors, controllers, and pumps should bechecked regularly. Pumps ($50 to $200) can be expected to wearout after 10 to 20 years, as in any hot-water system. Modern controllers($100 to $200) have a mean lifetime of at least 20 years. As withdrain-back systems, antifreeze systems are subject to scalingonly on the potable-water side, but require maintenance and occasionalreplacement of tanks, pumps, and electronics. Antifreeze systemsalso require replacement of the propylene glycol (because of breakdownof corrosion inhibitors) every 5 to 10 years or more often ifthe system has excess capacity and frequently maintains a hightemperature. Unglazed, low-temperature systems must be drainedwhen the pool is closed for the winter and when freezing temperaturesare expected. The collectors should last from 15-20 years. Vacuumrelief valves and pressure relief valves ($10 each) will requirereplacement every 5-15 and 10-20 years, respectively. Because parabolic-troughsystems involve very-high-temperature and -pressure fluid, theyshould be closely monitored. Operation and maintenance is generallyincluded as part of the contract for design and installation ofparabolic-trough systems. The mirror surfaces should be washedevery few months and will require replacement after about 15 years.Seals on the pumps should be replaced every 10 years or so andthe controls for the tracking equipment may need replacing afteranywhere from 10 to 30 years. But the large pumps used for troughsystems and the tracking equipment should last for the life ofthe project. Case Study—Chickasaw National Recreation Area The ChickasawNational Recreation Area is located approximately 100 miles southof Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The National Park Service is planningsolar water-heating for one large and two small comfort stations.They anticipate primarily summer use for all three buildings withvery little winter use. For the months of April through October,the average hot-water load for each of the small comfort stationsis projected to be 660 gallons per day at a minimum temperatureof 95°F (35°C); for the large comfort station it isprojected to be 1500 gallons per day at a minimum of 105°F(41°C). There will be no back-up water-heating, so an importantsystem design criterion was how many hours during the use seasonthe system would not be able to meet these minimum temperatures. The solar water-heating systems for each of the small comfortstations will consist of 194 square feet of collector area onthe roof and 500 gallons of preheat water storage in the mechanicalroom. Each of these systems is expected to provide 32 MBtu (9394kWh) of heat energy annually—the total hot-water supply. Hourlysimulations estimate that the delivered water temperature willbe less than the desired temperature of 95°F for 345 hoursduring the use season. The efficiency of the system in convertingsolar radiation to heated water is estimated at 45% averaged overthe use season. Figure 12 shows solar energy incident on the array,energy collected by the array, and annual total hot-water loadfor all 12 months for a small comfort station. The estimated installedcost for each system is $7,804. A cost breakdown is included inTable 5. The calculated rate of return is 6.2% and the simplepayback period is 9 years. The life-cycle-cost estimate for theproject developed using the BLCC software is shown in AppendixD. The solar water-heating system for the large comfort stationwill consist of 482 square feet of collector area on the roofand 1000 gallons of preheat water storage in the mechanical room.The estimated installed cost for the system is $16,100. This systemmeets the use season load with the exception of 579 hours. Therate of return is 5.9% and the simple payback period is 9 years.A summary of the characteristics of both systems is shown in Table5. A drain-back system is recommended for this application. Othersystem types were considered but rejected for this particularapplication for the following reasons: The high stagnation temperaturesanticipated in wintertime would be damaging to the fluids in anantifreeze system. Drain-down systems and recirculation systemsboth circulate potable water through the collectors. The hardwell water used at this site would contribute to early obstructionof the small collector flow passages with mineral deposits. Directthermosiphon systems offer no freeze protection and indirect thermosiphonsystems offer no stagnation protection. Site considerations ruleout ground-mounted tracking parabolic-trough systems. Aestheticsof the site are a primary consideration. Thus, only the south-slopingroofs of the buildings were considered for siting solar arrays.The shading effects of surrounding hills, trees, and buildingsare not of great concern because the solar heating system collectsenergy mostly in the middle of the day and in summer, when thesun is overhead. The Technology in Perspective Despite problems with some1980s installations, solar water-heating is a proven technologythat can play a significant role in reducing conventional energyuse at federal facilities throughout the country. There are avariety of different types of solar water-heating systems availableto match the needs of different situations. Facilities dependenton high-cost water heating are quite likely to find solar water-heatingsystems economically attractive. Use for swimming pool heatingis generally economical regardless of conventional water-heatingcost. Many facilities with large, constant water use loads (prisons,hospitals and military barracks are frequently good candidates)will find that large solar water-heating systems can be designedto economically meet their needs. Even where the economic payoffis small, such projects are of great value because of the addedbenefits of reducing pollution and climate-change emissions byreducing fossil-fuel combustion. (Federal facilities also needto comply with Executive Order 12902 and can play a valuable roleby setting good renewable energy use examples.) The FEMP FederalRenewables Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratorycan quickly assess whether solar water-heating is likely to beeconomically attractive for a federal facility with a minimalamount of information. Financial assistance beyond regular agencyfunding will likely be very limited at least for the near future,but through the Energy Savings Performance Contracting programof the Federal Energy Management Program, agencies have the optionof avoiding all installation costs and paying for solar water-heatingsystems via utility savings bills. The outlook for solar water-heatingat federal facilities is excellent from standpoints of technologicalfeasibility, compatibility with existing facilities, conventionalenergy use reduction, and pollution and climate-change gas emissionreduction. Solar water heating can be effectively used at anyfacility that wants to make a commitment to using it. For swimmingpool heating, when competing against expensive water heating,and where hot-water use is very large and consistent, there isa good possibility of solar water heating being found economicallyattractive. Technological breakthroughs to dramatically reducecosts and make solar water heating economically attractive forother situations do not appear imminent. Nonetheless, the situationswhere solar water heating has good likelihood of being cost effectiveare substantial enough that the as-yet-untapped potential forapplication at federal facilities is still quite significant.
