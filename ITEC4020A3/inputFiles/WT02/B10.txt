A: Read all the information concerning clinical trials.Contact DAHI personnel at 1-(800) 520-2120 or (913) 338-2120. Ifyou wish to discuss a particular patient for potentialenrollment, please have the patient file available at the time ofthe call. Q: What is the authorization for this study? A: DAHI has been granted an INAD (Investigational NewAnimal Drug) exemption #8008 by the FDA's Center for VeterinaryMedicine (CVM) to conduct clinical trials with l-deprenyl indogs. These studies will be conducted in accord with allapplicable regulations and guidelines. Data will be submitted tothe FDA in support of an application for approval to marketl-deprenyl for use in dogs. The drug has been approved for marketin Canada by the Canadian Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, for adistinct use, treatment of canine pituitary dependenthyperadrenocorticism (PDH, Cushing's disease). Q: What is known about the safety of l-deprenyl in general,and specifically in dogs? A: As is true of all drugs not yet FDA-approved for usein the United States, by definition l-deprenyl's "safety andefficacy have not been established." This is precisely thepurpose of our clinical trials. As noted above, l-deprenyl hasbeen approved for use in dogs by Canadian authorities. The safetyof l-deprenyl in dogs has been addressed in laboratory dogs inseveral safety studies conducted by independent contractlaboratories, and in each case the conclusion was that l-deprenylwas safe. More than two hundred pet dogs with either senility(cognitive dysfunction) or pituitary dependenthyperadrenocorticism (PDH, Cushing's disease) received l-deprenylat doses equal to or greater than those to be used in this trial,and were monitored for periods from a few days to more than 3years. No serious adverse events thought to be l-deprenyl relatedwere reported. There are occasional reports of dogs exhibitingvomiting, diarrhea, increased activity, or repetitive behaviors,which generally were mild and resolved with dose adjustment ordiscontinuation. Q: How might my clients and their pets benefit byparticipating in a clinical trial? A: First, l-deprenyl may help their pet, although wecannot and do not make guarantees to any pet owner. Second, thepet may benefit as a result of the additional examinations andlaboratory evaluations which it receives. Third, society ingeneral may benefit from the knowledge we gain by conducting thestudy. Q: How might I benefit from participating as aninvestigator in a clinical trial? A: First, personal satisfaction. Second, intellectualstimulation. Third, reimbursement for your services, according toa pre-agreed arrangement. Numerous veterinarians who haveparticipated as clinical trial investigators have stated theyfound it a rewarding experience which nevertheless was associatedwith a considerable amount of time and effort, primarily withrespect to completing the paperwork and complying with thevarious FDA stipulations. DAHI will work closely with you tomaximize efficiency and minimize effort. Q: Who pays for what? A: There are no costs during pre-enrollment.Once you have discussed the potential candidate with DAHIpersonnel and approval has been obtained for the enrollmentwork-up, DAHI will pay for the enrollment examination and re-examinations ,the drug, and laboratory tests directly associated withmonitoring response to treatment. DAHI is NOT responsible fordiagnosis or treatment of concurrent conditions or problems notrelated to l-deprenyl therapy; these responsibilities will beassumed by the owner. Back to Top L-Deprenyl Study on CanineCognitive Dysfunction in Aged Dogs Information for Potential Investigators Trial CD/HT Patient Requirements*: Ten years of age or older Must show signs of cognitive dysfunction, examples include: gets lost in house/yard, wanders, goes to wrong door, acts confused and has loss of memory. They also must exhibit 2 or more of the following: activity/sleep changes, inappropriate elimination, decrease in social interaction, and decrease in quality of life. Current vaccination status for parainfluenza, infectious canine hepatitis, canine distemper, parvovirus and rabies. Absence of other concurrent systemic debilitating disease. Patient must have had a physical exam within the last six months. *NOTE: Specific inclusion/exclusion criteria will be discussedwith you by DAHI personnel. General Trial Information: Once the dog has completed the screening process, the period of treatment is three months. As the Veterinary Investigator you should be available to perform all three required examinations (enrollment exam, month 1 and month 3 re-exams). This is a placebo controlled double-blinded trial. The dogs will receive either placebo or l-deprenyl for the first month of the trial. All dogs that complete the first month, in compliance with the protocol, will receive l-deprenyl at the standard dose for the second and third months of the trial. DAHI will pay for all requested exams, procedures and laboratory tests associated with the trial. All work must be PRE-APPROVED by DAHI personnel. Case completion fees will be paid upon completion of the trial. Owners should be able to: present dog at each of the three exams, complete an Owner Daily Observation Form (daily log) throughout the trial, administer tablets to the dog on a daily basis in the morning, refrain from making changes to the dog's environment during the trial DAHI CD/HT 10/31/95 Back to Top Background Informationand Trial Purpose Trial - CD/HT Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CD) is a syndrome encountered inpet dogs which is recognized by many veterinarians and pet ownersand has been reported in dogs in a number of veterinary andresearch journals*. The syndrome or its clinical signs have beenalluded to under a variety of terms. Owners of affected dogsoften describe these signs as "old age" or"senility", but it is quite likely that in dogs, as inpeople, these problems result form brain pathology*. Canine CD ischaracterized by one or more clinical signs such as;inappropriate urine elimination, confusion, disorientation,decreased activity, changes in the wake/sleep cycle or signswhich suggest a decrease in the dog's interest in, or ability tointeract with, its environment. The etiology of canine CD has not been identified. However, inpeople with Cognitive Dysfunction there is usually an associatedneuronal degenerative process present such as Alzheimer'sdisease, neuronal degeneration secondary to hypoxia(multi-infarct dementia) or toxicity (ethanol, MPTP).Inappropriate urine elimination (IUE) is one of the clinicaldisorders in people suffering from dementia (e.g., severecognitive dysfunction) and is often referred to by physicians as"central incontinence" to denote that the problem isone of cognition and to distinguish it from pathology in lowerneural centers and/or the urinary tract. Several reports haveidentified neurodegenerative lesions in the brains of aged dogssimilar to those present in human Alzheimer's patients. Therehave been several articles in the medical literature, some ofthem reports of placebo controlled blinded studies which documentthat Alzheimer's patients improve when given l-deprenyl. Inlaboratory experiments, elderly rats perform more poorly oncognitive tests than young rats and l-deprenyl helps to normalizethe performance of these older rats. A small placebo controlledstudy of elderly laboratory dogs showed that the dogs with thepoorest baseline performance in cognitive testing benefited themost from l-deprenyl treatment. A second study also foundl-deprenyl helpful for laboratory dogs with poor baselinecognitive performance. Our current trial, CD/HT, is a 2 phase randomized placebocontrolled, double-blinded pivotal clinical trial. The purpose ofthis trial is to evaluate the response of affected dogs tol-deprenyl therapy using several parameters, and to assess theefficacy and safety of l-deprenyl for treatment of acquiredcognitive dysfunction in dogs. In the first treatment phase (weeks 1-4), each qualified dogwill be randomly assigned to an experimental group and treatedwith either l-deprenyl or placebo for 4 weeks in a double-blinded(masked) fashion and monitored for response. All eligible dogsthat complete the first phase will then be enrolled in the secondtreatment phase (weeks 5-12). In the second phase all dogs willbe treated with a standard dose of l-deprenyl for 8 weeks in anopen label fashion and monitored for response. During a previous CD pilot trial owners of enrolled dogsreported improvement in all 15 parameters monitored, withstatistical significance attained in 13 of the 15. Theimprovement was sustained in most dogs for at least 3 months, andin some dogs for as long as they have been monitored (9 months). The primary goal of this trial will be to evaluate the safetyand efficacy of l-deprenyl for the treatment of canine CD. * references available on request DAHI CD/HT 10/31/95 Back to Top [ DAHI HomePage | Veterinarians| Pet Owners | Investors ] [ About DAHI | Contents | Contacts | Links| Press Releases | Requestfor Information ] Send comments to DAHI webmaster: dahimaster@deprenyl.com Copyright © 1996 Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc.

Enhancing the Quality of Life For Older Dogs Q-What is canine Cushing's disease? A-Cushing's disease is a disorder of the pituitary gland and hypothalamic regulatory center of the brain. This disease is commonly encountered in middle aged and older pet dogs, and results in excessive blood cortisol. Excessive cortisol is associated with most of the clinical signs typical of the disease. Q-What are the clinical signs? A-The onset of Cushing's in most dogs is quite slow and the clinical signs are often thought by owners to be simple aging. Some of the more common clinical signs are increased water consumption and increased urination, changes in appetite, muscle weakness, lethargy, "pot bellied" appearance, hair loss, decreased activity, excessive panting and changes in the sleep patterns of your pet. Q-How is Cushing's disease diagnosed? A-Cushing's disease is diagnosed by your veterinarian based on your dog's clinical signs, and results of laboratory tests, including special hormone tests. Q-When Cushing's disease is diagnosed, what are our options? A-There is no cure for Cushing's disease, and until the recent approval of Anipryl® there were no approved drugs to help dogs with this disorder. Without treatment, the disease will be progressive and ultimately may be fatal. Q-How does Anipryl® work? A-Anipryl® helps restore the natural balance of important brain chemicals, especially dopamine, which in turn helps alleviate the clinical signs of Cushing's disease. Anipryl® also helps decrease toxic compounds (free radicals) in the brain. Q-Is Anipryl® safe? A-Anipryl® has been shown to be safe when used as directed. In clinical trials, no adverse interactions were found when Anipryl® was used with other common veterinary drugs. Q-How effective is Anipryl®? A-In several clinical trials conducted at veterinary colleges and private veterinary clinics throughout North America, more than 70% of treated pet dogs responded favorably, demonstrated by amelioration of clinical signs and improvement in cortisol regulation. Q-How soon can I expect to see the results of Anipryl® treatment? A-Many dogs treated with Anipryl® show positive response within 2 to 4 weeks. Some dogs require more time to respond. Q- How long must my dog continue on Anipryl® therapy? A- There is no cure for Cushing's disease. However, clinical trials demonstrated the positive results of long term Anipryl® therapy. Your pet will likely require treatment with Anipryl® daily, and your dog should be evaluated regularly by your veterinarian. Q-How is Anipryl® provided and administered? A-Anipryl® is available from your veterinarian as easy to administer tablets. Most dogs receive one tablet each day, usually in the morning. Your veterinarian will provide individualized instructions for your pet. Anipryl® is a prescriptionpharmaceutical available only through veterinarians in Canada.Full disclosure is available on product labeling.

KFB, Kommunikations- forskningsberedningen, har hittills behandlat över 80 EU-framställningar i två ansökningsomgångar. De flesta har rört transportprogrammet. Den tredje och sista omgången genomförs 17 december 1996 - 17 mars 1997. EU sätter upp mål för den internationella forskningen genom att välja ut ett antal forskningsuppgifter (”research tasks”) där det behövs forskningsinsatser. Information om dessa får du under länken Cordis. (Community R&D Information Service) KFB, har som uppgift att bl a internationalisera svensk kommunikationsforskning och ge finansiellt stöd till forskare och andra som har projektidéer inom de av EU utsedda programområdena. KFB ger tre typer av stöd: utvecklingsbidrag, förhandlingsbidrag och kompletteringsfinansiering. Vi lever i ett dynamisk värld där storstäderna växer och arbetskraften blir rörligare. Människor reser alltmer, transporterna ökar och informationsteknologin spränger gränser. Detta ställer stora krav på samhälls- och trafikplanering, miljö- och resursutnyttjande. KFB har därför fått i uppdrag av riksdag och regering att genom såväl direkta som indirekta insatser stödja kommunikationsforskningen i Sverige samt att medverka till ett internationellt samarbete. Sveriges medverkan i internationell forskning kommer sannolikt att öka i framtiden. Detta beroende på flera faktorer. Inte minst vårt medlemskap i EU. Själva målet för den europeiska gemenskapen - att överbrygga avstånd - ökar intresset för kommunikationsfrågorna. Det skapas en större inre marknad för forskning där en anpassning till den allt mer internationaliserade marknaden kan leda till bättre effektivitet och större mångfald.De gemensamma forskningsresurserna ökar genom att svenska forskare har möjlighet att få bidrag ur EU:s forskningsbudget.

Finns det överhuvudtaget några skillnader? Har kvinnor och män olika attityder till resandet i sig? Det är några av de frågeställningar författarna bakom KFB-rapporten ”Kvinnligt och manligt i kollektivtrafiken” ställer sig. Under senare tid har den kvinnliga kompetensen hamnat allt mer i fokus i utformningen av kollektivtrafiken. Tidigare studier har visat att det är en majoritet kvinnor som reser kollektivt. Samtidigt är det nästan uteslutande män som sitter i beslutande ställning i landets länstrafikföretag. Är det möjligen så att om man tar tillvara den kvinnliga kompetensen � som tydligen i hög grad saknas i länstrafikföretagen idag � i utformningen av kollektivtrafiken så får vi en trafik som är bättre anpassad till alla dess brukare? Detta är en hypotes som nätverket och projektet Kvinnor � Kompetens � Kollektivtrafik (3K) arbetar utifrån. 3K-projektet startades under Svenska Lokaltrafikföreningens Persontrafikdagar i Karlstad i fjol och ska pågå till Persontrafikdagarna i september 1997 i Blekinge. För finansieringen står Svenska Lokaltrafikföreningen, Svenska Kommunförbundet och Landstingsförbundet. TFK � Institutet för transportforskning ansvarar för projektledningen. En viktig del i 3K:s arbete är att kartlägga och beskriva kvinnliga och manliga aspekter på resandet i kollektivtrafiken och initiera till forskning. I samverkan med 3K-projektet har TFK � Institutet för transportforskning på uppdrag åt KFB gjort en kunskapssammanställning över tidigare undersökningar på området. Sammanställningen behandlar skillnader mellan kvinnor och män när det gäller aktivitetsmönster, resvanor attityder till resandet. Resultaten som ställts samman kommer bland annat från den pågående Riksresvaneundersökningen, resvaneundersökningar i Stockholms län och i Göteborgs lokaltrafikområde. En del i arbetet har varit att undersöka vad länstrafikföretagen i landet gjort angående kvinnliga och manliga resvanor och attityder. Detta visade sig dock inte vara alltför omfattande. Viktig forskning på området har bland annat Transportøkonomisk institutt (tøi) i Oslo utfört, vars resultat också finns med i kartläggningen. Sammanställningen bekräftar att det finns skillnader mellan kvinnor och män: Män gör något fler resor, många fler tjänsteresor, gör längre resor och är oftare bilförare. Kvinnor åker mer kollektivt och är oftare bilpassagerare. Kvinnors huvudresor består av fler delresor. Kvinnor står för större delen av inköpsresorna. Kvinnor är mer positivt inställda till kollektivtrafiken. Kvinnor prioriterar personlig trygghet och miljö högre. Rapporten visar också att området kvinnor och kollektivtrafik är förhållandevis outforskat och att mer kunskap efterfrågas. Nu återstår för en KFB-finansierad arbetsgrupp bestående av experter inom olika områden att prioritera angelägna forskningsbehov mot bakgrund av de kunskapsluckor som identifierats i rapporten.

Through these pages, we present a general overview of our assignment, our current activities and monthly updated (minimum) report on the status of the different project fleets. KFB is responsible for a national program (SEK 120 Million, USD 17 Million total ) for research, development and demonstration of electric and hybrid vehicles. The program will continue until the end of 1999. The main goals are to assess the possibility and environmental potential for a large scale introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles, and to take the first steps towards emission-free motoring. Focusing on demonstration, between 200 and 400 vehicles, including passenger cars, buses and light and heavy trucks run or will run in city project fleets within the program. Others are included for evaluation through linked projects. All demonstration activities will be evaluated regarding vehicle proficiency, user acceptance, and economy, including a systems analysis and a concluding systems study to assess decisive areas. Program manager is Mr. Hans G Pettersson, M.Sc. Eng. David Bauner is responsible for evaluation. KFB, the Swedish Transport and Communications Research Board, is a government authority with planning, initiating,coordinating and supporting functions in Swedish transport and communications research. KFB`s activities encompass transportation, traffic, postal services and telecommunications,as well as the impact of tranports and communications on the environment, traffic safety and regional development. KFB is also responsible for information and documentation wthin its areas of responsibility. Up!

For various reasons, customers and manufacturers look to alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel cars, trucks and buses. Principles of vehicle propulsion Electric and hybrid vehicles differ from conventional vehicles by the means of propulsion. In a conventional vehicle, a gasoline or diesel engine turn the wheels through a transmission including a clutch and a gearbox. An advanced EV or hybrid needs none of this. Some cars, especially heavier vehicles, use electric motors with only one moving part: the wheel itself. The dominating solution, though, is to have a front-mounted electric motor turning the wheels through a reduction gearbox and a simple driveshaft. This means a drastic reduction in the number of moving parts compared to a gasoline powered vehicle. Electric vehicles ("EVs") are radically different from today's gasoline powered vehicle in several ways. Instead of storing gasoline, the EV stores electric energy in a large, rechargeable battery. A vehicle system controller sends this power to the electric drive motor whenever the driver pushes down on the accelerator pedal. EV engine configuration Most modern EVs also have a feature called "regenerative" brakes. Apart from generating friction heat when braking (like the disc or drum brakes of gasoline vehicles), an EV can also use the EV motor to help brake the vehicle, thereby generating electricity which charges the battery. Regenerating brakes also reduces the wear on the mechanic brakes. EV unique features: Clean EVs have no tailpipe emissions. Such emissions, if any, are generated and controlled at theelectric powerplant. In Sweden, electricity is produced from about equal shares of hydropower and nuclear energy. A few percent is produced by burning fossil fuels, predominantly wintertime. Quiet The more advanced EV motors emit almost no sound. Unlike gasoline vehicles, there isno "combustion" requiring a muffler. In fact, the EV is so quiet that the EVdevelopment teams have to work harder to "silence" other noisy components (like airconditioning and power steering) which become audible without the gasoline enginenoise. Smooth Electric motor vehicles require no clutch or gearshift. Most advanced EVs use single-speed AC motors with no transmission. Acceleration is smooth and seamless, smoother than the best transmission on today's luxury cars.Home Recharging The EV can be recharged at home. Most of the vehicle users mainly recharge their vehicle at night. This is especially convenient for those who don't like to refuel at gasoline stations. The downside is it can take up to seven hours to recharge an "empty" battery. Limited Range Today's EV either uses the less expensive lead acid batteries or more advanced batteries like nickel metal hydride or nickel cadmium. Vehicle range depends largely on the type of battery used, but also, vehicle weight, driving style and other components such as charger and traction motor affects the range. Equipped with lead-acid batteries, the typical Lead acid powered EVs only have about 50 miles range between charges but are the least expensive. Advanced batteries have about 100 miles range between charges but are very expensive. Hybrid vehicles Hybrid passenger vehicles are usually configured as an EV with an additional primary power source such as a small gasoline, or, preferably, a biofuels engine. The engine propels a generator, which charges the batteries and provides energy to the tractionary engine. In general, hybrid vehicle development is in an earlier stage than that of the EV. Hybrid vehicle drivetrains The hybrid concept signify a number of options: � Unlimited mileage � Exhaust free operation � Engine optimization � AC Power production � Detachable APU Up!

However, they require large infrastructure investments and cannot cater for the needs of sprawling cities. For battery-powered vehicles, chargers can be included in the vehicle and only require an ordinary outlet in the garage or at work. A discussion whether roadside charging should be the concern of city administrations or be left to commercial actors will be an important topic of the initial years. Battery exchange systems To avoid the problem of limited range, systems allowing the empty battery to be replaced by a charged battery can be a solution. Primary batteries, e.g. the Zn-Air battery, can not be recharged and must be replaced with a new battery once it is emptied. This creates the need for replacement systems and exchange logistics for primary batteries. Secondary (rechargeable) batteries must also be completed wth a local battery exchange system. An example of this is the stockholm battery echange project. Service networks The need to provide a national wide supply of spareparts and knowledgeable EV mechanics is a major challenge to the introduction of new EV makes and models. Electricity grid loads Loads from electric vehicle charging are manageable within the foreseeable future. As an example a population of 10 000 EVs in Göteborg would need less than 1 % of the electric energy used in the city. A greater problem may be fast charging during the day, when loads in general are higher. Up!

In Sweden, transportation accounts for 22% of the total energy consumed. The sector’s use of energy is principally by fossil-based fuels. Electric vehicles and energy production Battery-powered vehicles produce no local emissions. Its consumption of primary energy is also less than a conventional ICE (internal combustion engine, for example using petrol or diesel fuel). A smaller EV consumes about 10 kWh/100 km of electric energy from the grid. Larger passenger vehicles double or triple this amount. An ICE vehicle consuming 7 liters of gasoline per 100 km equals, for comparison, a consumption of 62 kW, production and transportation of the fuel excluded. However, the environment is affected in different ways depending on how the electricity is produced. Each country has a very distinct profile on what primary sources are used. Electricity production in Sweden In Sweden, nuclear and water power each account for about half of the electric energy produced. A few percent is produced by fossil fuels at demand peaks, predominantly during wintertime. Life cycle environmental impact Replacing conventional drive trains with hybrids can be a tool to diminish several of the problems connected with road traffic. One of the principal shortcomings of the ICE (internal combustion engine) is the technical challenge to optimize the system for the whole range of power output required in daily traffic. By using a hybrid system, the ICE can be optimized to provide only the mean required power. For a regular passenger vehicle, this means only 15-20 kW. Both primary and secondary (rechargeable) batteries must be recycled. For the SAFT NiCd battery, a complete recycling facility is in operation outside Oskarshamn in Southern Sweden. For longer term, hydrogen produced without net CO2 may be used for fuel cell hybrids Up!

One is that electric cars are inherently low performing in actual traffic. This view is however related to the earlier commercially available technologies, that to a large degree came from the area of vehicles and devices of material handlingwithin industry. As a contrast, the dedicated electric car technologies developed in the 1990s are very different from the earlier developments with respect of overall performance, battery life, power-to-weight ratios, and peak range capability. Good electric cars (i.e. semi-conversions or purpose-built) have the potential to fulfil the needs of many fleet operators even with the commercially available battery technologies of today (lead-acid and Nickel-Cadmium), and with the technologies on the verge of commercialisation (e.g. Nickel-Metal Hydride and Lithium-ion), these cars will be attractive even for private car ownership. With batterytechnologies presently in the "laboratories'" (e.g. Lithium-Solid-Polymer), range will no longer be a problem. Cost issues still have to be resolved, though, but as in many cases of technological change, we can never in advance know how far costs can be cut by actors on a real market. A hybrid vehicle can be tailored to imitate or exceed the range, torque etc. of a conventional car. An EV should rather be viewed in its own light. The battery is the most decisive factor for EV performance. Operational functionality In the Swedish city projects, EVs have operated since 1993, reaching as much as 37 000 km in two and a half years of circulation for some vehicles. For heavy vehicles and cargo transport, hybrid systems offer the highest potential due to the energy needed for a full working day. Regarding bus operation, passenger opinions and factors like the ”environmental appeal” of new vehicle technology are important to fleet operators apart from hard facts on emissions and life cycle improvements. In the present project running at KFB regarding electric and hybrid buses, several bus types are evaluated from different angels. As bus buyers are fewer, buy vehicles by the dozen rather than single and see vehicle cost as a smaller portion of total expenses, there is an openness towards environmentally sound propulsion technology, manifested for example in the ethanol and natural gas buses becoming increasingly popular by public transport authorities. Traffic performance and safety EVs and hybrids must be granted performance to comply with city traffic tempo. This is achieved for the various demonstration vehicles, receiving positive remarks on acceleration and handling from vehicle drivers. Dealing with the negative aspects of EV soundlessness, no accidents or even close encounters have been reported. Part of the explanation may be that everywhere EVs operate, virtually soundless bicycles may also appear, forcing pedestrians to turn their heads regardless of traffic noise. When this is written, only regular steel-bodied EVs with proven crash safety features run in KFB supported projects. However, there is a clear indication that EVs and hybrids may profit from lighter bodies, mostly due to the potential in extending range through weight reduction. Light vehicle structures is traditionally viewed as less safe by customers and national vehicle certification agencies, and the challenge to produce and market safe, light vehicles remains. In all cases all vehicles running on swedish roads must conform to applicable safety certifications. The EV Database has updated information on vehicles running in the program. Up!

In relation to gasoline cars, as being the 'main-stream' car propulsion technology, the alternatives are inherently hampered by not having the same long history of technical development, established market, and support by vested interests. Therefor, managing an early market of electric and hybrid electric cars involve both private and public interests in order to decrease some of the uncertainty that follows any new technology. One must however also be aware of the strength of the technological 'paradigm' to strike back when threatened. Rapid developments of sail-boats and of gas-lightning occurred when faced with competition from steam-boats and electric-lightning, respectively. By the same token, gasoline cartechnology will probably be much further developed in areas of emissions and energy consumption when confronted by a competing alternative that perform well in those areas, as the electric car do. As a secondary effect, the development of alternative fuels and vehicles is often perceived as to increase the market push for cleaner conventional vehicles. In a short term perspective, this is the most obvious result of the evolving presence of alternative fuels on the automotive industry agenda. The question, whether or not gasoline cars will stay on top for another century, or if electric propulsion will rapidly or slowly take over, still resides within the future. What we do know, however, is that electric cars today gather more support by industry and government than ever before andthat electric cars have been developed that gives sports car performance and more than 400 km range from one charge. This means that the technological development of electric cars in recent years have taken a big step forward, with a consequent shift in focus from vehicle related issues to issues of early market and infrastructure - a shift that in itself is an indication of the promise of electric propulsion. According to researchers studying technical changes in society, bigger changes in market demand must follow the ”closing in” of technology, that is when vehicle manufacturers and customers agree on general product specifications. For newer types of propulsion technologies and fuels like electric vehicles, this closing of technology is not carried through. To do this, an iteration of evaluation reports and vehicle upgrading must occur in established partnerships. Specifications are needed � to set a long term goal � to relate car to legislation � to create a coherent market � to ensure a good and safe design � to simplify certification Specifications characteristics � must not stall development � must allow for market differencies � must be ”global” � must be strict but flexible � must be long term valid The Swedish car market represents a very small portion of world sales. It is decentralised and is constituted of relatively wealthy but demanding customers. The climate is varied fom north to south and changes with the season. This makes Sweden a tough market, suitable as a test site for new vehicle technology So far, most of the passenger vehicles in the projects supported by KFB were made by the French manufacturer Renault. It is probable that backing from at least one large auto manufacturer is indispensable to sustain vehicle deliveries and service levels while running a growing number of new-tech as well as high-tech vehicles under commercial cinditions. On the other hand, studying market response to developimg competiton is vital. Hence, it is the intention of the program to broaden competition. To fulfil individual transportation needs there are other ways than just owning a car , paying mortgages, insurance and repairs. Simply renting a car, subscribing to different kinds of public service car-sharing or sharing a fleet of cars with a few friends or neighbours, may all be ways to cope with rising operating costs. In France, for example, several research projects aim to develop ways to offer attractive vehicles with high availability to the city public. Up!

El- och hybridfordon KFB driver på uppdrag från riksdag och regering ett program för forskning, utveckling och demonstration av el-och hybridfordon. Programmets syfte är: € att utröna möjligheterna att introducera och använda el- och hybridfordon i ett kortare och ett längre perspektiv € att utröna effekterna i olika hänseenden av en introduktion av el- och hybridfordon € att främja introduktionen av el- och hybridfordon i samband med programmets genomförande. Programmet fokuserar på praktiska demonstrationer av lätta och tunga el- och hybridfordon. I Sverige sker försök, med stöd från KFB, på flera platser. Bilarna används dels för persontransporter, dels för lättare godsdistribution. KFB har också stött utvecklingen av konceptfordonen Volvo ECB och ECT. Fordon som kan körs både på bensin eller biobaserade bränslen och el, sk elhybrider kommer troligtvis vara det mest realistiska alternativet till dagens fordon. Detta p.g.a svårigheterna at ta fram små lätta och miljövänliga batterier. Vill du veta mera om hur elbilarna används kan du besöka vår Elbilsdatabas i Lund. Vill du veta mer?

An electric vehicle has very few moving parts in comparison to an ICE-powered vehicle, implying low maintenance costs when technology is settled. Life cycle cost includes the cost for exploitation of virgin resources, production costs, fuel, service and spare costs and the cost for recycling discarded vehicle components. Only some of these costs, however, are transparent to the user. Microeconomic issues or ”User life cycle costs” includes sticker price plus interest or leasing fee, energy cost, service fees and costs deriving from downtime or spares. What is the value of an vehicle limited to 100 km range to dynamic company activities? On the other hand, what is the value of a implemented, environmentally oriented transport policy to a market desperately looking for unique selling points? Finding answers to these questions will help to indicate the role of EVs and hybrids in a corporate environment. To private owners, other questions may dominate. Buying an electric vehicle, for example, the owner will have to change the battery pack over periods ranging from one to seven years depending on battery type. What kind of leasing or insurance systems will emerge? Will this field evolve to a separate market with fierce competition and excellent customer value, or pose the greatest threat to large scale market shift? Will the foreseeable battery development make the battery management systems of last year’s model obsolete, or will development stall for the sake of large scale production? Up!

PUBLICERINGSDATUM/DATE OF PUBLISHING April 1995 UTGIVARE/PUBLISHER KFBs DNR 93-224-23 KFB - Kommunikationsforskningsberedningen, Stockholm REFERAT (Syfte, Metod, Resultat) Syfte: Projektets syfte är att utveckla en metod för ekonomisk värdering av lokala skadeeffekter, särskilt hälsoeffekter, av bilavgaser i tätortsmiljöer. Värdet uttrycks i kronor per kg avgaskomponent och beror av utsläppets läge, tidpunkt, av vädersituationen etc. Metod: Hela kedjan från emission till skadevärdering ingår: Emission-spridning-exponering-dos-ekomisk värdering. Vid dosberäkning har den lokala spridningsmodellen för Göteborgsregionen tillämpats. Beräknade halter har kopplats till befolkningsdata för att skatta stadsdosen. Hänsyn har även tagits till lokala haltförhöjningar i gatumiljön (ger gaturumsdosen). De ekonomiska värderingarna av sänkta luftföroreningshalter utgår från betalningsviljor som framkommit i andra sammanhang. Resultat: Ett ekonomiskt värde har åsatts varje inandat mg av de olika bilavgaskomponenterna : kväveoxider, kolväten (VOC) och partiklar. Denna dosvärdering skall kunna användas i alla svenska tätorter. I en storstad visar sig ett genomsnittligt utsläpp leda till en inandad dos som till 2/3 är ”stadsdos” och till 1/3 är ”gaturumsdos”. I mindre städer står gaturumsdosen för en lägre andel. Ett utsläpp i centrala Göteborg leder till en tiopotens högre dos än genomsnittsutsläppet i staden. Förslag ges dessutom till en separat ekonomisk värdering av utsläppen med hänsyn till naturskadorna (40-45 kr/kg kväveoxider och ca 20 kr/kg VOC oberoende av exakt läge av utsläppet). ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aim of the project is to develop a method for monetary valuation of local health effects of exhaust emissions in urban areas. The value will be expressed in SEK per kg of emission component. It is dependent on the location and time of the emission, the weather conditions etc. Method: The following chain has been studied: emission-dispersion-exposure-dose-economic valuation. For the dose calculations was used the local dispersion model that has been developed for Gothenburg. The calculated concentrations were coupled to population density data to get the ”urban dose”. Local excess concentrations in the streets have also been considered and will give the ”street dose”. The valuations of health effects have used already available WTP data (”willingness to pay”). Results: A monetary value has been given to each inhaled mg of different exhaust emission components: nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons (VOC) and particulate matter. The derived dose valuation can be used in all Swedish towns and cities. It is shown that an average car emission in a Swedish big city will lead to a total inhaled dose that is composed of urban dose (2/3) and street dose (1/3). In a smaller town the street dose amounts to a smaller share of the total dose. An emission in central Gothenburg will lead to an approx ten times higher dose than the average car emission in Gothenburg. Moreover, the report suggests a separate monetary value of the emissions with respect to effects on nature (on forests, lakes etc): 40-45 SEK per kg of nitrogen oxides and approx. 20 SEK per kg of VOC.

Reduktionen av CO2 -emissioner per hektar jord- och skogsmark utnyttjad för biomasseproduktion (kg CO2 /ha, år) samt kostnad för CO2 -reduktion (SEK/kg CO2) beräknas för ersättning av bensin och diesel med rapsmetylester, biogas från lusern, etanol från vete samt etanol, metanol, vätgas och elektricitet producerad från Salix och avverkningsrester. Av studerade drivmedel ger de som baseras på Salix störst CO2-reduktion per hektar. Användning av metanol från Salix och avverkningsrester tycks på medellång sikt ge lägst kostnader för CO2-reduktion. Användning av bränslecellsfordon, i vilka metanol eller vätgas utnyttjas som energibärare, kan på längre sikt komma att möjliggöra ett mer energieffektivt utnyttjande av biomassa än dagens fordon med förbränningsmotorer. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The purpose of the report is to study the technical and economic prerequisites to attain reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through the use of biomass-based energy carriers in the transportation sector, and to study other environmental impacts resulting from an increased use of biomass-based energy carriers. CO2 emission reduction per unit arable and forest land used for biomass production (kg CO2/ha, year), and costs for CO2 emission reduction (SEK/kg CO2) are estimated for the substitution of petrol and diesel with rape methyl ester, biogas from lucern , ethanol from wheat and ethanol, methanol, hydrogen and electricity from Salix and logging residues. Of the studied energy carriers, those based on Salix provide the largest CO2 emission reduction. In a medium�longperspective, the costs for CO2 emission reduction seem to be lowest for methanol from Salix and logging residues. The use of fuel-cell vehicles, using methanol or hydrogen as energy carriers, can in a longer perspective provide more energy efficient utilization of biomass for transportation than the use of internal combustion engine vehicles.

A Critical Inquiry PUBLICERINGSDATUM/DATE OF PUBLISHING August 1995 UTGIVARE/PUBLISHER KFBs DNR 93-84-63 KFB � Kommunikationsforsknings-beredningen, Stockholm ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aim of the inquiry is to study the current responses in Europe to the problems of road transport, particularly the problems of increasing car use. The basic point of departure is the new Common Transport Policy (CTP) of the EU as of December 1992. The catchword of this document, ”sustainable mobility”, has also inspired the title of the report. Methods: Relevant actors, that is, organizations of various types and at all levels wich play a role in influencing the transport policy in Europe, are identified. Written documents containing strategies for the transformation of existing transport systems are interpreted and subjected to critical analysis focusing on the future role of the automobile in the transport systems. The findings may be summarized in the folloving way: The present situation of road transport in Europe is a result of interaction failure rather than of market failure or government failure. The reason for this is lack of agreement in the perceptions of problems, goals, measures and their implementation. A way out of this dilemma is indicated; intensified controversies about the preceptions could create opportunities for new forms of interaction.

Metod: Intervjuer och litteraturstudie. Resultat: Elbilen har idag blivit det hetaste alternativet till bensinbilen. Reformulerad bensin, etanol, metanol, naturgas och biogas verkar endast partiellt eller kortsiktigt kunna lösa den globala energiförsörjningen och de globala miljö-problemen. Den s k "technology forcing"-strategin fungerade väl när man införde katalysatortekniken på 70-talet, och samma strategi har hittills fungerat väl när man försöker utveckla elbilsteknologin. Det viktigaste är att "technology forcing"-strategin och andra strategier, t ex ekonomiska styrmedel, tillämpas samtidigt. Abstract (aim, method, results) The aim of this report is to describe and compare those two environmentally motivated technical changes that have been and may continue to be of great importance for development of the automotive technology, namely the introduction of catalytic converter technology, and the breakthrough of electric-vehicle technology. Methods: Interviews and textual studies. Results: The electric vehicle has become the most exiting alternative to the gasoline car. Reformulated gasoline, ethanol, methanol, natural gas, and biogas seem to be able to offer only partial or short-sighted solutions to global energy-supply problem and environmental problems. The so called "technology forcing" strategy functioned well when catalytic converter technology was introduced, and the same strategy has hitherto functioned well during the state of California's attempt to force the development of electric vehicle technology. The most important thing is, however, to apply the technology forcing strategy and other strategies such as the use of economic instruments simultaneously.

I etanolbränsle A tillsattes Beraid® och i etanolbränsle B tillsattes Avocet®. Emissionerna från etanolbränsle A och B har jämförts med analys av reglerade och icke-reglerade avgaskomponenter. Receptoraffinitets- och mutagenicitetstest har tillämpats på partikelbundna och semivolatila föreningar i emissionerna. Vidare har en riskuppskattning av carcinogena avgaskomponenter utförts. Resultat: Emissionen av kolmonoxid, partiklar, eten och partikelbundna polycykliska aromatiska kolväten (PAH) var lägre från bränsle B jämfört med bränsle A, däremot var emissionen av butadien högre från bränsle B. Emissionen av de övriga avgaskomponenterna var ungefär likvärdig från de båda bränslena. I stort sett var också den uppmätta biologiska effekten likvärdig mellan de båda bränslena, möjligen gav bränsle B något lägre indirekt mutagenicitet. Ur cancerrisksynpunkt var de båda bränslena approximativt likvärdiga, den något högre (ej signifikant) emissionen av butadien från bränsle B uppvägs av en lägre partikel- och etenemission. ABSTRACT This report describes the results of an investigaton on the potential environmental and health impacts of exhaust emissions from ethanol fuel containing two different diesel ignition improvers (DI), Avocet® and Beraid®. Avocet® was used in fuel B and Beraid® in fuel A. Emissions from these two ethanol fuels were compared with respect to there contents of regulated and unregulated exhaust components, affinity of binding to the dioxin receptor and mutagenicity of compounds associated with particles and the semivolatile phase. Risk estimates of exhaust components judged to be carcinogenic. Emissions from fuel B, contain smaller amounts of CO, particles, ethene and total particle-associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), but higher amounts of butadiene than did emissions from fuel A with respect to the other components measured, these two fuels were approximately the same. In general the two fuelemissions give similar responses in the biological tests, perhaps with a tendency to lower values of S9 - dependent mutagenicity in the case of fuel B. From the point of view of cancer risk, these two ignition improvers are, within the limits of uncertainty, approximately equivalent. In this case the somewhat (not significantly) higher emission of butadiene from fuel B may balance for the lower amounts of particles and ethene emitted from this fuel.

Den årliga svenska biobränsleanvändningen skulle kunna öka med ca 125 TWh jämfört med 1994. Denna mängd skulle vara tillräcklig för att täcka dagens behov av drivmedel liksom uppskattat drivmedelsbehov kring år 2015. Även om biobränslena i första hand används för värme- och elproduktion, vilket tycks vara ett mer effektivt sätt att erhålla koldioxidreduktion än att använda biobränslena för drivmedelsproduktion, kommer det att kunna finnas en betydande mängd biobränslen kvar för produktion av drivmedel om andra icke-fossila energikällor används för elproduktion och/eller betydande energieffektiviseringar genomförs. Att exportera biobränslen för att ersätta fossila bränslen för el- och värmeproduktion i andra länder kan visa sig vara ett mer eller lika kostnadseffektivt sätt att minska koldioxidutsläppen som att utnyttja de svenska biobränsleresurserna för inhemsk drivmedelsproduktion. Uppskattningarna är emellertid behäftade med stora osäkerheter och till stor del beroende av lokaliseringen av biobränsleresurserna och de potentiella användarna.

Rapporten ger ett underlag för bedömning av hur vidare satsningar inom området bör ske och redovisar några av de möjligheter och komplikationer som kan förknippas med en sådan satsning. I rapporten konstateras att biogas kan bli ett intressant drivmedelsalternativ, eftersom teknik med goda miljöprestanda finns utvecklad och de ekonomiska förutsättningarna i många fall är rimliga i förhållande till andra alternativ. Vid utnyttjande av biogas från slam och avfall begränsas potentialen till biogasdrift av lokala bussflottor och renhållningsfordon i städer med mer än 20 000 invånare. Genom utnyttjande av jordbruksgrödor och gödsel som råvara för gasproduktionen kan potentialen ökas kraftigt men till större kostnader. För att introducera biogas för fordonsdrift i Sverige är det viktigt att uppföra anläggningar där hela systemet från gasproduktion till gasutnyttjande demonstreras. Det är också viktigt att skapa en för bränsletypen gynnsam och stabil skattesituation.ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results)The aim of this study is to describe the possibilities for extended use of biogas as an automotive fuel in Sweden. The report gives information that could be used in the development process and points out the major advantages and problems that could be forecasted. One conclusion from this study is that biogas could be an interesting alternative automotive fuel as a technology with good technical and environmental prestanda are available on the market and that the system economics seems to be acceptable. With the usage of sewage sludge and municipal organic waste for biogas production it will be possible to supply city buses and a vehicle fleet for refuse collection in cities with over 20 000 inhabitants. The potential could be larger if, for example, manure and crops grown for this purpose are used as feed stock for gas production but this is less cost effective. One important step for the introduction of biogas as an automotive fuel i Sweden would be the construction of a demonstration plant where know-how could be extracted from the operation of a complete system. Another important factor is that the tax situation for biogas fuel is favourable and stable in the future.

Fem bussar utrustades med gasmotorer som konverterats från dieselmotorer. Bussarna har körts i ordinarie trafik i Linköping. Gasen kommer från kommunens avloppsreningsverk och renas från koldioxid innan bussarna tankas. Projektet har visat att det är tekniskt möjligt att använda gasen för fordonsdrift, att förutsättningarna att uppnå låga emissionsnivåer är goda och att större fordonsflottor kan drivas till rimliga kostnader. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aim of the project was to identify the difference in operation, costs, level of emissions and production of biogas for biogas propelled buses compared to ordinary dieselbus operation. Five buses have been equipped with gas engines which have been converted from diesel engines. The buses have been operated in ordinary traffic in the city of Linköping. The gas was delivered from the waste water treatment plant and was separated from carbondioxid before the buses were fuelled. The project has shown that it is technically possible to use biogas as fuel for buses, that the possibilities to reach low level of emissions are good and that bigger fleets of biogas propelled buses can be operated at reasonable costs.

Syftet var att pröva en rad, för postområdet delvis nya teoretiska och metodiska perspektiv för att se vilka insikter de olika infallsvinklarna kan ge upphov till och för att ge underlag för fortsatt forskning. Studiens vetenskapliga fokus är posthanteringens villkor i det moderna samhället. Med posthantering avser vi främst förmedlingen av brev, paket och ekonomiska transaktioner. Förstudien organiserades som sju olika delstudier i syfte att täcka några centrala frågeställningar: “Posten och stora tekniska system“, “Posten och den ojämna produktivitetsutvecklingen (det ´post-industriella´dilemmat)“, “Utbud och efterfrågan på posttjänster: Ett transport- och kommunikationsekonomiskt problemområde“, “Posten och tekniken i historisk belysning“, “Förutsättningarna för postverksamhet i ett modernst samhälle - Postens egen syn“, “Postens gränsyta“ och “Informationsvanor - och ny teknik“. Samtliga delstudier pekar på fortsatta forskningsbehov. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The underlying objective was to study the conditions for postal services in a modern society and thereby test a series of theoretical and methodical perspectives (some not previously applied to the postal services) in order to see what insight the various approaches could give, and lay the foundations for continued research. The scientific focus lies on the conditions governing postal services in modern society. By postal services we mean the conveyance of letters, parcels and bank transactions. The preliminary study was organised into seven separate but related sub studies which were to cover some key issues: “The postal service and large technical systems“, “The postal service and unbalanced productivity development (the ´post-industrial´ dilemma)“, “The supply and demand of postal services: A problem area relating to the economics governing transport and communications“, “The postal service and technology from an historic perspective“, "The conditions for postal services in a modern society - The Post Office´s own view“, “The postal service´s interface“ and “Information habits and new technology“. All studies conducted as part of the report indicate a need for continued research.

Transportation Industry Market Structure in Sweden and its Implications for Pricing and Costing PUBLICERINGSDATUM/DATE OF PUBLISHING January 1995 UTGIVARE/PUBLISHER KFBs DNR 92-126-43 KFB - Kommunikationsforskningsberedningen, Stockholm REFERAT (Syfte, Metod, Resultat) Syftena med föreliggande studie är dels att (1) analysera strukturen på den svenska transport- marknaden och dess konsekvenser för prissättning och kalkylering, dels att (2) analysera olika problem vid kalkylering av transporter och utveckla lämpliga principer för kalkylering. Modellerna som utvecklas i part IV visar olika förflyttningar av transporter och bygger på sambanden mellan (i) olika kostnader för transport av godset (ii) kostnader för att hantera godset på terminal och (iii) allokering av gemensamma kostnader. Det grundläggande angreppssättet bygger på analys av vilka olika produktionsresurser som är nödvändiga för olika steg. Det kan konstateras att aktivitetsbaserad kalkylering inte är lämplig för beslutssituationer som präglas av kapacitetsöverväganden och alternativkostnads- resonemang. ABC är däremot lämplig som kalkylmetod vid terminaler där kapacitetsöverväganden är av mindre betydelse och där aktiviteterna är samma över tiden. Mikroekonomisk analys används för att studera marknadsstrukturen. I Sverige är koncentrationen av utbudssidan mycket kraftig och vi har nästan en marknad som utmärks av duopol. Det existerar en sorts priskartell, där det första steget mot en kartellbindning är höga priser och kraftiga prissänkningar, s k kvasipermanenta priser. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aims of this study were (1) to analyse the Swedish transportation industry market structure and explain its consequences to transport carrier costing and pricing and (2) to analyse the transportation costing problem area and develop appropriate costing principles. The models developed in part IV represent the operation of transportation movements by a carrier, (ii) terminal handling costs of the goods and (iii) allocation of the overhead costs. The basic approach is the analysis of a task in terms of the production resources necessary for each stage. Fullcosting methods as activity-based costing is not appropriate for capacity considerations and considerations about opportunity costs is missing. ABC is on the contrary appropriate for cost allocation at the terminals because there is usually no capacity problems and the activities are the same over the time. Microeconomic analysis is used for explicitly consider market structure effects. In Sweden there is a very strong concentration of supply and we nearly have a dupoly-case. In this country exists a sort of price-fixing (a pricing-cartel) agreement. The first step toward the establishment of a cartel and to inefficiency are higher prices and large price reductions, i e quasipermanent prices.

På kontinenten har länderna Holland, Italien, Tyskland och Polen analyserats då de utgör viktiga handelspartner för Sverige samt driver delvis olika terminal-strategier. Den existerande situationen och aktuella utvecklingsplaner har undersökts med en koncentration på viktiga marknadsaktörer, terminal-ägar-struktur och de förändringar som kan förväntas inom den närmaste framtiden. Studien visar att utvecklingen av intermodala terminaler är en nationell fråga vilken ofta drivs av de nationella järn-vägarna. Nätverket av intermodala terminaler är generellt sett bra utvecklat i de undersökta länderna (utom för Polen där en utbyggnad planeras), men kapacitets- och effektivitetsproblem finns. Vad gäller utvecklingen av integrerade godstransportcenter så pågår en dynamisk utveckling i både Tyskland och i Italien vilken ofta drivs av lokala/regionala intressegrupper och järnvägarna. I Sverige och i Holland återfinns terminalstrukturer/områden (liknande IFC) av samma typ vilka inte har utvecklats enligt en medveten terminalstrategi. Ansvariga för planering är lokala och regionala myndigheter. I Polen börjar olika aktörer att intressera sig för en möjlig utveckling av godstransportcenter. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The purpose of the study is to analyze the Combi-terminal and Intermodal Freight Centre development (IFC) on the continent and it’s possible influence on the development in Sweden. On the continent four countries, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland, have been investigated because they all are important trade partners to Sweden and pursue some-what different terminal strategies. For these countries the present situation and existing deve-lopment plans have been analysed with a focus on the important market actors, the structure of the terminal ownership and the changes which can be expected during the next years. The study shows that the development of intermodal terminals is a national question which is usually driven by the national railways. The network of intermodal terminals is in general well developed in the five contries (except for Poland were an extension is planned), but capacity and efficiency problems exist. For the development of Intermodal Freight Centres (IFC) a pronounced development takes place in Italy and Germany which is driven by local/regional interest groups and by the railways. In Sweden and the Netherlands similar structures/areas (like IFC) can be found, but have not been developed specifically. Responsible for the planning are local and regional authorities. In Poland first thoughts are put to the development of Intermodal Freight Centres (IFC).

För vissa typer av rationaliseringar och samarbete har jämförelser gjorts för hela landet. Erfarenheten är att den effektivaste lösningen för samhällsbetalda transporter är samverkan mellan kommuner och landsting av både upphandling och resor genom en beställnings-central. Samordningen skall ske genom att resenärerna förbeställer resan (20 - 60 min) och att beställningscentralen har rätt att justera avresetiden (10-30 min). Transportörer skall ersättas enligt en taxa som medger att beställningscentralen kan beräkna ersättningen i förväg. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aim of the project is to compile experiences of different ways to organize coordination measurements for personal transports paid by local authorities and county councils. The most efficient organization is a cooperation between local authorities and county councils concerning purchasing and coordination of trips in a booking office. The coordination will be more effective if the trips are booked 20-60 min in advance and if the booking office is allowed to change the time of departure 10-30 min. The control of charges and the administration of invoices can be reduced if the compensation to transport operators are calculated in advance instead of calculated by taximeter.

Provet med två äldre Volvobussar i trafik i Sundsvall, gjordes med syftet att prova om avgasutsläppen gick att sänka dramatiskt och om tillgängligheten kunde hållas uppe med nyutvecklad teknik. Motorgas är lätt till-gänglig i Sundsvall och proven skulle utföras med motorerna optimerade för mager resp idealisk bränsle-luftblandning. Värmeutvecklingen gjorde dock att båda motorerna an-passades enligt magerbränsleprincipen. Resultatet blev att NOX-, HC- och CO-utsläppen reducerades mer än väntat. Koldioxidutsläppen (CO2) sänktes med 8 % jämfört med motsvarande dieseldrift. Värmeutvecklingen orsakade skador i motorerna och motorhaverier även i magerbränsleutförandet. Allt eftersom erfarenheterna har kommit, har dock denna svårighet kunnat minskas. Bussen med den nyare motorn kördes utan störningar under de sista 12 av de 18 månadernas provdrift. Vid projektets genomförande var denna buss sannolikt den renaste bussen i drift i världen enligt ECE R49 mätmetod. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) Trying LPG in heavy duty buses has been done before. This test, with two Volvo buses in operation in the city of Sundsvall, Sweden, had the objective to show how low the exhaust emissions and how high accessibility could be with engines optimised for LPG-operation. LPG is also readily available in the Sundsvall area. Lean Burn and stoichiometric optimi-sation was tested, but the stoichiometric technique had to be eliminated due to a heat release that was too high. Both buses thereby became Lean Burn operated. The results shoved that the NOX, HC and CO exhausts volumes were more reduced than anticipated. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) exhaust was also reduced by over all 8 % compared with diesel operation under identical conditions. Heat release has been a concern and a source of trouble, both engines have suffered break downs. As time went by and experiences accumulated, the issue became of less significance. The newer of the two buses operated without interruption for the last 12 months of the project. At the time for the project, this newer bus was maybe the cleanest operating bus in the world, according to the ECE R49 test method.

ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aim of this project is to describe the situation concerning the development of Light Rail systems. A number of studies has been done on Light Rail systems in Sweden. In Europe there are a lot of new ideas in Light Rail transit which can be of great interest for planners in Sweden. The project is realized as a literature study and interviews with key persons in the Swedish Light Rail studies. This report is an examination of Light Rail systems and its development during the last 15 years. In the report, existing and planned Swedish systems are described. Comparisons have been made between cities in Europe and USA. Only systems of interest for Swedish conditions are discussed. Light Rail is also compared with other modes of transport such as buses, people movers and underground systems. Different forms of financing Light Rail in Sweden, Germany, France and the United States are described.

Significance of the various links in the transportation chain PUBLICERINGSDATUM/DATE PUBLISHED Maj 1996 UTGIVARE/PUBLISHER KFB - Kommunikationsforskningsberedningen KFBs DNR 88-251-731 REFERAT (Syfte, Metod, Resultat) Syftet med projektet var att utvärdera effekterna (rörlighet, säkerhet, livskvalitet) bland de äldre i två olika bostadsområden i Borås. Likvärdiga åtgärder genomfördes i den fysiska miljön. I ett av områdena infördes Servicelinjetrafik, i det andra genomfördes smärre åtgärder på befintliga 12-meters bussar. Äldres attityder till och värderingar av olika åtgärder studerades. Ett flertal studier genomfördes; postenkät (före-efterstudie) till samtliga personer över 65 år i de båda områdena, intervjuer med fotgängare och bussresenärer, räkningar av fotgängare och busspassagerare, färdtjänstmätningar, intervjuer med personer med synnedsättningar samt en särskild stated-preference studie. De sammanfattande resultaten av projektet är att antalet resenärer i kollektivtrafiken ökar i båda områdena men ökningen är betydligt större i det område där Servicelinjetrafik introducerats. Antalet fotgängare i bostadsområdena ökar. Attityderna är positivare till förändringarna i kollektivtrafiken än till förändringar i den fysiska miljön. De boende i området där Servicelinjetrafik introducerats är emellertid mer positiva till åtgärderna i den fysiska miljön än de boende i området där åtgärder inom den traditionella kollektivtrafiken genomförts. Effekterna och attityderna är mest positiva bland de äldsta (75+) och bland de mer funktionsnedsatta. Slutsatserna av projektet är att det är möjligt att attrahera nya äldre resenärer till kollektivtrafiken och att öka resandet bland tidigare resenärer genom att öka kvaliteten i kollektivresan. Detta har i sin tur positiva effekter på färdtjänstresandet. Åtgärderna i den fysiska miljön har även positiv effekt på resandet, särskilt i de områden som erbjuder högst kvalitet i kollektivresan, d v s där Servicelinjetrafik införts. ABSTRACT (Aim, Method, Results) The aim of the project was to evaluate the overall benefit (mobility, safety, quality of life etc) for the elderly population in two different residential areas in Borås. In both areas similar measures were undertaken in the physical environment. In the public transport system, a service route was introduced in one of the areas, and measures on the buses were undertaken in the other area. The elderly’s attitudes towards and values of different measures were studied. Many studies were undertaken; a questionnaire (before-after-study) to all people over the age of 65 in both the residential areas, interviews with pedestrians and bus-passengers, counting of passengers on the buses and pedestrians in the areas, counting of passengers in the special transport system (STS), interviews with a group of vision impaired people and a special stated preference study. The summarized resut of the project is that the number of passengers in the public transport system increases in both area but the increase is bigger where the service route traffic were introduced; more pedestrians is out in both neighborhoods; measures in both the public transport system and the physical environment are appreciated by the elderly; there is a more positive attitude to the changes in the public transport system than in the physical environment; the residents in the area where the service route was introduced value however the measures in the physical environment higher than do the residents where changes on the buses in the mainstream service were made. Furthermore the effect and the attitudes are more positive among the oldest (75+) and the group of people reporting more severe impairments. The conclusion of the project is that it is possible to attract new passengers and to increase the use of the public transport system by offering a better quality and a higher adaptation level in the system. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the use of STS. The effect of measures in the physical environment is also positive, but such measures are likely to be more appreciated when the public transport system also offers a higher adaptation level (i.e. service routes).

Vilka nätverk finns och vad kan man göra för att skapa nya nätverk? Detta är några av de mest centrala frågorna i KFB:s arbete. KFB betonar såväl i sin verksamhetsidé som i sin inriktningsplan vikten av att bygga upp internationella nätverk. Nätverken underlättar för forskningsverksamma att hålla sig à jour med vad som händer inom olika områden samt att samarbeta i viktiga frågor. De flesta forskare tillhör redan nätverk, ofta ämnesorienterade sådana. Men det finns även uppgiftsorienterade nätverk (t ex. inom trafiksäkerhetsforskning) samt konsortier som samarbetar inom EU-projekt. Forskarna är ofta nöjda med den samarbetsnivå som de uppnått men för KFB, och resultatanvändarna, är detta ibland otillräckligt. KFB arbetar för att föra ihop olika kompetenser, att koppla samman forskare och användare och att skapa nätverk inom områden där detta saknas. INSATSER -kartläggning av internationella forskningsmiljöer och redan existerande nätverk -genomförande av internationella konferenser -stimulerar forskare att jobba med kollegor i andra länder (utbytestjänstgöring) - ökar antalet stipendiater -inrättande av gästprofessurer Nätverkens existens och kvalitet varierar mellan olika forskningsområden och olika länder. Ur kartläggningarna väljs angelägna ämnesområden som saknar fungerande nätverk. Konferenser eller seminarier kring dessa ämnen blir frön ur vilket det växer nya nätverk. Svenska och utländska forskare kan få stipendier respektive projektmedel för att öka sin kompetens utomlands, t ex genom studier eller deltagande i projekt. Inom EU:s fjärde ramprogram finns en särskild aktivitet (Stimulation of the Training and Mobility of Researchers) som finansiellt stöder nätverksbildning och forskarutbyte. Den sammanlagda budgeten är 7 miljarder kronor. KFB verkar för att detta program utnyttjas inom kommunikationsforskningen. Ansvarig myndighet i Sverige för nämnda program är Naturvetenskapliga forskningsrådet (NFR). För en effektiv internationalisering är det nödvändigt för KFB att veta vilka som har ansvar för forskning om transporter och telematik i viktigare länder samt hur administrationen är uppbyggd och fungerar. KFB själv deltar därför i såväl nationella som internationella nätverk. I samarbete med sina motsvarigheter i grannländerna har KFB inrättat Nordisk Transportforskning (NTF). NTF:s verksamhet finansieras med gemensamma medel. Den huvudsakliga aktiviteten består i att anordna konferenser kring ämnen som har gemensamt intresse samt att stödja varandra i EU:s forskninigsarbete. Det är likaså viktigt att ha en god inblick i organisation och funktion av EU-kommissionens forskningsarbete. Att delta i styr- och arbetsgrupper är ett effektivt sätt att uppnå detta mål.

Det är viktigt att Sverige tar tillvara de möjligheter till ökat forskningssamarbete som medlemskapet i EU ger. KFB har som målsättning att snabbt och effektivt öka den nationella kunskapen och kompetensen inom aktuella områden. Detta genom samarbete med internationellt framstående forskare och ledande forskningsmiljöer. KFB har utformat en strategi för hur forskningen på kommunikationsområdet ska internationaliseras: Man bevakar den internationella forskningen och bedömer inom vilka forskningsområden Sverige har nytta av att hämta in utländska forskningsresultat. Man söker också områden där svensk kompetens kan tillföra den internationella forskningen något unikt. KFB arbetar för att svenska forskare ska delta aktivt och ha en ledande roll i internationella projekt. INSATSER -kartläggning av internationellt viktiga frågor och deras utveckling -stöder svenskt deltagande inom övrig FUD (forskning, utveckling, demonstration) Det är EU som avgör vilka forskningsuppgifter (research tasks) som bör prioriteras och för vilka forskningsbidrag bör utgå. KFB ger tre typer av finansiella bidrag: utvecklingsbidrag - för projekt som befinner sig i uppbyggnadsskedet förhandlingsbidrag - för projekt som godkänts och som kommer att få EU-medel kompletteringsfinansiering - för slutförande av projekt. KFB har redan från starten av EU:s fjärde ramprogram satsat hårt på att svenska representanter ska kunna vara med i forskningsverksamheten. Några av uppgifterna har varit att påverka utformning och innehåll av särprogrammen Transport och Telematik i en för Sverige positiv riktning, att sprida information och kunskap om programmen, att ha inflytande vid utvärderingen av inlämnade projektförslag samt att sprida kunskap om svensk forskning.

När och hur ska Sverige vara med och påverka? Och hur mycket medel ska avsättas för internationella forskningsprojekt? De strategiska frågorna är viktiga. I dag är det bara en dryg tiondel av de offentliga forsknings- och utvecklingsresurserna i Europa som disponeras på ett samordnat sätt. Målet är att öka samarbetet och förbättra samordningen för att uppnå ökad effektivitet. Inom ramprogrammets samtliga särprogram - varav ett är Transportprogrammet - arbetar man för att samordna nationell forskning och forskning som bedrivs inom EU. Samordningen kan ske på olika sätt:Genom nätverk, informella ministermöten och en gemensam informationsbas redan på den politiska nivån (där målen sätts för FoU-verksamheten) hoppas man kunna lägga en bra grund. Samordning kan också ske vid genomförandet av forskningsprogram och över huvud taget när det gäller internationellt FoU-samarbete. Exempelvis genom att utbyta information om pågående nationella program och genom systematiskt samråd inför möten med internationella organ. INSATSER -går igenom aktuella forskningsplaner och tydliggör kopplingen mellan nationell och internationell FUD -verkar för att öka antalet svenska handläggare och experter i EU-kommisssionens forskningsavdelningar KFB har undersökt vilka frågor man i olika länder bedömer som mest intressanta under perioden fram till sekelskiftet. Man har också frågat kommunikationsdepartementets myndigheter och statliga företag vilka forskningsområden de önskar ska ingå i kommande ramprogram inom EU. Underlaget ska ligga till grund för det svenska ställningstagandet när det femte ramprogrammets innehåll utformas. EU-kommissionen anlitar nationella experter när olika frågor ska beredas. En viktig uppgift är utvärderingen av inlämnade projektförslag. Här arbetar KFB för att öka antalet svenska representanter. En annan viktig del av KFB:s arbete består i att hjälpa projektdeltagarna att få en snabb spridning av de resultat som uppnåtts. Hittills har exploateringen av FUD-resultat varit dålig. KFB:s vetenskapliga råd bistår ledningen med råd och synpunkter. Rådet har bland annat till uppgift att ”att ta in impulser utifrån och stämma av de svenska FoU-satsningarna på kommunikationsområdet med vad som händer vid den internationella forskningsfronten” och ger också stöd vid uppläggningen av hur kunskap ska spridas om svensk forsknings starka sidor.

Förhandlingsskedet - projekten utformas definitivt, Tekniska Annex tas fram och genom förhandling med kommissionen beslutar man om kontrakt. Kompletteringsfinansieringsskedet - nationell kompletteringsfinansiering klaras ut. UTVECKLINGSBIDRAG Syfte Att stimulera svenska forskare att delta i bra EU-projekt inom transportprogrammet. Finansiering Bidraget är högst 25 000 kronor. Den som är samordnare inom konsortiet kan eventuellt få högre bidrag. Ansökan Ansökan (1-2 A4-sidor) ska redovisa projektidén och till vilken frågeställning (research task) den är knuten. Här ska också framgå vilken vana du som sökande har av forskningsområdet i fråga och av internationell forskning över huvud taget. Du ska också ange till vad bidraget ska användas (resor, arbetskostnader etcetera) samt kostnader för detta. Posta ansökan till KFB, Box 5706, 114 87 Stockholm. Beslut Besluts-PM skrivs och beslut tas av KFB:s enhetschef. Kontrakt Beslutsbrev utformas. Utbetalning Bidraget utbetalas efter rekvisition då ansökningsomgången är slut. I rekvisitionen ska de kostnader man haft redovisas. Kopia på ansökan bifogas. Om ansökan inte har lämnats till EU ska detta motiveras. FÖRHANDLINGSBIDRAG Syfte Att öka sannolikheten för att svenska forskare får lämpliga arbetsuppgifter till skälig ersättning.Det är i det här skedet som KFB också tar ställning till om KFB kommer att kunna ställa upp som kompletteringsfinansiär. Finansiering Projektet har nu godkänts för att få delfinansiering från EU-budgeten. Konsortiet ska, genom interna förhandlingar, komma fram till hur projektet ska genomföras, vem som gör vad och till vilken ersättning. Bidraget uppgår till högst 25 000 kronor för den som ingår som partner i konsortiet. Koordinator kan få högst 100 000 kronor. Ansökan Ansökan (1-2 A4-sidor) ska klargöra vad medlen ska användas till. När det gäller begäran om kompletteringsfinansiering behövs en detaljerad beskrivning av projektet så att KFB kan bedöma om det ska prioriteras i den fortsatta hanteringen. Här kan den ansökan som lämnats in till kommissionen användas. Det behövs också en uppskattning av hur stort belopp som kan krävas för kompletteringen. Posta ansökan till KFB, Box 5706, 114 87 Stockholm. Beslut Besluts-PM skrivs och beslut tas av generaldirektören. Beslutet anger hur stort bidrag som har beviljats och klargör också om KFB är beredd att stödja projektet framöver. Kontrakt Beslutsbrev utformas. Utbetalning Bidraget utbetalas efter rekvisition då kontraktsförhandlingen är avslutad. I rekvisitionen redovisas de kostnader som man haft. KOMPLETTERINGSFINANSIERINGSyfte Att göra det möjligt för den svenska forskaren att genomföra projektet. Finansiering I de flesta fall har KFB redan klargjort om man kommer att lämna kompletteringsbidrag eller inte. Hälften av det totala finansieringsbidraget betalas av EU. Den andra halvan står KFB för genom kompletteringsbidraget. I detta skede söker KFB aktivt efter samfinansiärer som t ex Vägverket och Nutek. Ansökan Ansökan görs på KFB:s ordinarie ansökningsblankett. Detta oberoende av om man gjort en framställning i samband med ansökan om förhandlingsbidrag. Beslut Besluts-PM skrivs och beslut tas av generaldirektören. I beslutet framgår vilka motprestationer KFB förväntar sig t ex vad gäller informationsspridning.Kontrakt utarbetas. Kontrakt I kontraktet läggs stor vikt vid betalningsplanen. Den bör vara samordnad med kommissionens betalningsplan. Detta för att undvika ekonomiska problem för de svenska deltagarna och för att underlätta KFB:s uppföljning av projektet. Här fastställs också de krav som KFB har på inlämnande av rapporter (progress-, midterm- och final assessment report) samt hanteringen av resultat, rapporter och informationsspridning. Utbetalning Utbetalningarna följer den plan som gjorts upp i kontraktet. Generellt gäller att KFB betalar ut efter rekvisition. Det görs ingen förskottsbetalning. KFB:s betalning är preliminär tills kommissionen har godkänt inlämnade rapporter och kostnadsredovisningar. Om projekten inte godkänns kan pengarna återkrävas.

Already in September 1991, an introduction programme for EVs in Göteborg, initiated by local politicians and elaborated by community officials, was approved by the Göteborg Municipal Council. The first target of this programme was 1000 electric cars in the Göteborg area by the mid 1990s, provided that acceptable external financing were obtained. Due to a number of factors, the time schedule has been revised, leaving goals unaltered except with respect to delay. ”Electric Vehicles in Göteborg” is managed in co-operation between The City of Göteborg, Göteborg Energi, Vattenfall, Volvo and KFB.

I programmet preciserades syftet: att utveckla, prova och utvärdera teknik och system för användning av motoralkoholer, att stimulera större producenter och användare till ett aktivt deltagande i utvecklings- och demonstrationsprojekt, att öka kunskapen om motoralkoholernas långsiktiga användbarhet, miljöpotential och kostnadsbild, att klarlägga om och under vilka förutsättningar motoralkoholer är mogna för en introduktion i större skala. Programmet fokuserar på tre olika inriktningar. Renalkoholer, vilka har den största potentialen för hälso och miljöförbättring, men kräver helt nya motorer. Blandbränslen som kan man använda i dagens motorer. Här gäller det att ta fram blandbränslen som knavändas av så många som mäjligt av dagens och morgondagens fordon. Samt biogas, dvs metangas från biobaserade råvaror. KFBs program har sin tyngdpunkt i tunga fordon eftersom miljöpotentialen bedöms vara störst inom detta fordonssegment. Det är också en central uppgift för KFB att på olika sätt stödja utvecklingen av en väl fungerande och miljöanpassad kollektivtrafik. Utveckling av olika busskoncept är därför viktigt i programmet.Samarbete och samfinansiering med andra myndigheter, forskare, producenter och användare av fordon och drivmedel är en förutsättning för programmets genomförande. En del projekt startades med anslag från annat håll före det egentliga biodrivmedelsprogrammet, men ger resultat som kan användas i utvärderingen av biodrivmedelsprogrammet. Handläggare för området Biobaserade drivmedel är Sören Bucksch. Tommy Månsson arbetar med systemstudien och utvärdering av programmet.

Hittills har det främst gällt tunga fordon - bussar och lastbilar - men även utveckling och test av personbilar ingår i programmet. Såväl fordon för alkoholdrift - ren etanol och blandbränslen - som för biogas ingår. Det har visat sig att drivmedlens sammansättning har stor betydelse för att förbättra emissionerna, både för diesel- och bensinmotorer. Visst utvecklingsarbete genomförs och möjligheterna till ytterligare förbättringar kommer att bedömas. KFBs anslag är dock inte avsett att användas för att utveckla själva produktionen av drivmedel. Väl fungerande system för distribution, lagring och hantering är en förutsättning för en storskalig introduktion av biobaserade bränslen. Den teknik som kommer att användas vid demonstrationsprojekten blir delvis provisorier. KFB kommer dock att undersöka vilka långsiktiga och storskaliga problem som finns och bedöma behoven av ytterligare utveckling. Prov med biodrivmedel pågår på många ställen i landet. Kartan nedan visar på prov på motoralkoholer och biogas. Projekt som ingår i programmet Biobaserade drivmedel dokumenteras oftast i form av KFB-skrifter men ibland också av projektdeltagarna.

Ett 50-tal bilar ingår i det projekt som KFB stödjer. Om motoralkoholer skulle ersätta bensin och diesel skulle trafikens skadliga inverkan på miljön drastiskt sjunka. Detta skulle vara ett faktum även om alkoholen kom från naturgas. I långa loppet är det dock nödvändigt att producera alkoholen från förnybara källor. I Sverige kan vi t.ex. använda överskott från jordbruk och träindustri. I Brasilien, som är det enda landet i världen med ett fungerande tankningssystem för motoralkoholer, använder man sockerrör till att producera alkoholen. 4,5 miljon fordon kör idag på etanol i Brasilien. Alla övriga fordon med konventionella Otto-motorer körs på bensin med 22% inblandning av etanol. I Kalifornien fanns det 1993 8.000 fordon som körde på alkohol. De tre största biltillverkarna i USA har också certifierat motorer för flexibel bränsledrift. Motorerna kan köras på alkohol eller bensin eller en blandning av dom två. Det mest omfattande projektet i västeuropa har genomförts av Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), med 32 st bussar försedda med Scania motorer för etanoldrift. Experimentet utföll så lyckat att SL beslutat att köpa in ytterligare etanolbussar. En rapport om projektet "Flottförsök med 32 etanolbussar vid AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik" (KFB-rapport 1994:2) finns att beställa. En sammanfattande bearbetning finns också.

Blandbränslen, dvs alkohol i någon form inblandad i bensin eller dieselolja, som kan användas i dagens motorer, är intressanta under en övergångstid tills motorer och fordon för renalkoholdrift har introducerats i tillräcklig omfattning på marknaden. Det finns dessutom möjligheter att uppnå miljöförbättringar, t.ex. i form av minskade utsläpp av partiklar och koldioxid. De hittils vunna erfarenheterna pekar mot en inblandning med upp till 15% etanol i diesel kan göras utan omställning på befintliga motorer. Körbarheten påverkas som regel inte. S.k. gasohol (10%-ig inblandning av etanol i bensin) har använts i USA sedan mitten av 80-talet. 3 miljoner kubikmeter etanol har avsatts på detta sätt varje år. Nya regler som främjer inblandningen av etanol eller eter i bensinen gör att konsumtionen av etanol antagligen kommer att öka till 5 miljoner kubikmeter per år. Inblandning av eter i bensinen ökar kraftigt i västeuropa till följd av att blyet i bensinen har tagits bort. Eter tros bli allt mer vanlig även i nordamerika och Japan. Dieselolja kan tillföras etanol tillsammans med ett emulgeringsmedel och fungera som drivmedel. Vid ett försök i Stockholm har man som blandning använt 15 % etanol och ca 0,5 % emulgeringsmedel i Miljö Klass 1 diesel. Inblandning av etanol i diesel gör det även möjligt att använda katalysatorrening. Liknande försök har även gjorts i Australien, Argentina och Tyskland. Med lyckade resultat. Planer finns på att utöka projektet i Stockholm.

Gasen innehåller den brännbara gasen metan (CH4), koldioxid (CO2) och vatten (H2O) samt mindre mängder av andra komponenter. Biogas bildas spontant i naturen och processen fortgår i syrefattiga miljöer där organiskt material finns tillgängligt, exempelvis i mossar och sjöbottnar samt i vommen hos idisslare. Biogas har hittills främst utvunnits ur slam från reningsverk, rötgas. Biogas från avfallsupplag (soptippar) brukar kallas deponigas. När koldioxiden är avskild och metanhalten uppgår till minst 95% talar man om biometan. Det är biometan som är aktuellt som drivmedel i fordon. Låga emissioner av miljöförstörande ämnen är en av gasdriftens stora fördelar. Biogasens väg från produktion till konsumtion. Produktion av biogas Det finns flera tekniska lösningar för utvinning av biogas från organiska restprodukter, avloppsvatten och odlad biomassa. gemensamt för teknikerna är att man använder en lufttät tank för att skapa en miljö liknande den som finns när biogas bildas spontant i naturen. Tanken brukar kallas biogasreaktor, fermentor eller rötkammare. När det gäller deponeringar skapas den nödvändiga lufttäta miljön i själva avfallsupplaget. Tankning av biogas Tankning av gas görs i helt slutet system och kan ske enligt 2 principer. -Snabbtankning och Långsamtankning Snabbtankning fungerar ungefär på samma sätt som bensin- eller dieseltankning. En buss tankas på mellan 10 och 15 minuter, ett lätt fordon på 3 till 4 minuter. Långsamtankning tar ett par timmar och är lämplig för företag med stora fordonsflottor. Utrustningen för en tankstation finns att köpa i fabriksfördiga moduler.Gasmotorn Biogas kan användas i en vanlig s.k. Otto-motor anpassad för gasdrift. Metangas har dessutom ett relativt högt oktantal vilket medger högt kompressionsförhållande och hög verkningsgrad. Kompressionen är dock lägre än för dieselmotorer. En gasbuss. En jämförelse mellan gasdrivna ottomotorer och dieselmotorer visar att gasmotorn har: -lägre verkningsgrad -lägre moment vid höga varv -högre moment vid låga varv -lägre toppeffekt -lägre bullernivå -lägre avgasemissioner [Kontakta oss gärna][Up!] WT02-B10-78IA018-000200-B015-150http://www.kfb.se:80/bioprogs/resultat.html 194.198.183.242 19970106205309 text/html 5916HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 06 Jan 1997 20:48:16 GMTServer: Microsoft-Internet-Information-Server/1.0Content-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 09:15:04 GMTContent-Length: 5716 KFB-Biobaserade drivmedel/utvärderingar och resultat Avsevärda resurser avsätts till utvärderingar som framför allt avser hälsa, miljö, teknik och ekonomi. Man mäter och analyserar emissionerna och deras lokala, regionala och globala miljö- och hälsoeffekter. Alkohol- och biogasteknikens tillförlitlighet och utvecklingspotential bedöms. Ekonomiska utvärderingar görs både inom de olika projekten och på övergripande programnivå. På programnivån bedömer man också potentialen för produktion och användning av de olika drivmedlen; för olika källor, typer av fordon och trafiktillämpning. Även effekterna av en storskalig introduktion kommer att bedömas. Utvärdering av de olika projekten sker kontinuerligt enligt en särskild utvärderingsplan. Autoemission K-B E Consultant ansvarar för de delar som avser emissionsmätningar samt bedömningar avseende hälsa och miljö. Även frågor om teknik och ekonomi ingår i planen. Som ett resultat av utvärderingen har KFB påbörjat en systemstudie för att ta fram ekonomiska utvärderingar samt bedömningar av potentialen för produktion och användning av olika drivmedel. Systemstudien beskrivs närmare i nästa avsnitt.På uppdrag av Riksrevisionsverket granskade IM-gruppen vintern 95/96 biodrivmedelsprogrammet. IM-gruppen sammanfattar sina synpunkter i bl a följande: ”Det är uppenbart att beslutet 1991 om de 120 miljonerna satte igång många aktiviteter i nätverket. Det är också uppenbart att vi idag, jämfört med 1991, har ett betydande antal företag/institutioner i samarbete i vad vi skulle kunna kalla ett motoralkoholnätverk.---- Kunskapsläget är nu (februari 1996) att man med ganska stor säkerhet kan säga att renetanoldrift i vart fall vad gäller tunga fordon fungerar tekniskt väl under svenska förhållanden och att miljöfördelarna blir betydande. FFV-motorer i lätta fordon är etablerad teknik. Vad gäller blandbränsle etanol-diesel i vanliga tunga fordon kvarstår ännu frågan om bränslet är ofarligt för motorerna på många års sikt. Mycket stora värden står här på spel. Allmänt gäller emellertid att teknikfrågorna, såväl vad gäller tunga som lätta fordon, inte är mer komplicerade än att motorindustrin löser dem på några års sikt. ---- En av de viktigaste konsekvenserna av programmet är att kunnandet kring etanol och motorer nu är vitt spritt i många kommuner över landet. detta innebör sannolikt att en betydande startströcka undviks, om/när beslut fattas att skattesubventionera alkoholbränsle. samtidigt är det tänkbart att det spridda kunnandet och intresset som programmet stimulerat i sig innebär en politisk faktor som verkar för ett sådant beslut" [Kontakta oss gärna][Up!] WT02-B10-79IA018-000200-B015-161http://www.kfb.se:80/bioprogs/miljo.html 194.198.183.242 19970106205318 text/html 6689HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 06 Jan 1997 20:48:28 GMTServer: Microsoft-Internet-Information-Server/1.0Content-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 09:14:52 GMTContent-Length: 6489 KFB-Biobaserde drivmedel/miljö och hälsa Vid all förbränning bildas avfallsprodukter, som i många fall är skadliga för miljö och hälsa. Koloxid, koldioxid, kolväten och kväveoxider är några exempel på oönskade ämnen som i stora mängder bildas vid förbränning i bil-, buss- och lastbilsmotorer. Så länge vi använder fossila drivmedel i våra fordon får vi hela tiden ett tillskott av koldioxid vilket starkt bidrar till växthuseffekten. Lösningen på detta kan vara biobaserade drivmedel som framställs ur förnybara råvaror, t ex skog och spannmål. Här stannar koldioxiden i ett slutet kretslopp. Lika mycket koldioxid som frigörs vid förbränningen, lika mycket tar växterna upp för sin tillväxt.

Data för kolvöten avser summan av både metankolväte och övriga kolväten. Testmetod ECE R49. Gasdrivna fordon har stora möjligheter till goda emissionsprestanda. Biometan har en mycket enhetlig kolvätesammansättning, normalt saknas tyngre kolväten helt, vilket är en fördel gentemot naturgas, som i och för sig har mycket goda emissionsdata. Utsläppen av framför allt NOx och partiklar vid naturgasdrift är låga. Utsläppen av kolväten från naturgasfordon består framfär allt av metan, som är en växthusgas. Metan har dock ingen inverkan på den lokala miljön. Emissioner från dieseldrivna fordon innehåller mer av oreglerade skadliga ämnen som bensen och polyaromatiska kolväten (PAC). Drift av fordon med biometan i stället för exempelvis dieselolja ger bl a följande miljöfördelar: Betydligt lägre utsläpp av: -kväveoxider -partiklar -kolväten (exkl metan) -vissa icke-reglerade ämnen, t.ex. bensen, PAC Figurerna nedan illustrerar vägtrafikens utsläpp. Införande av nya alternativ (t ex biobaserade bränslen och el-/hybridfordon) kan kanske vända kurvan för koldioxiden. (källa Vägverkets Miljörapport 1993). Kväveoxider och Kolväten. Svaveloxid. Ton/år Koldioxid. Ton/år Övergång från diesel till biodrivmedel har förutsättningar att ge renare fordon. Genom övergång till alkoholer förbättras motorns energiverkningsgrad. Detta innebär minskade emissioner av olika slag. Enligt en livscykelanalys som utförts av Ecotraffic så kan man minska utsläppen av klimatgaser med i storleksordningen 65-80% jämfört med diesel och bensin. Om denna miljöpotential verkligen kommer att utnyttjas fullt ut sammanhänger dock med en rad faktorer, där bl a teknikval kan komma att få en avgörande betydelse.

Dawnbreaker measures its success by the success of our clients in obtaining private sector funding directly related to the tools and skills developed in our programs. The result: Fifty percent of the companies we have assisted during the last four programs received private sector investments within 18 months. The cumulative value of these contracts is in excess of $52 million. Increased sales during the 18-month period following program completion exceeded $30 million. While other sources collect long-term follow up data, we measure only near-term financial impact (18 months) that can be directly traced back to the effective use of the business plans developed via this program and the principals' increased business acumen resulting from Dawnbreaker's mentoring process. This near-term focus increases the likelihood that participating companies will successfully cross the "valley of death," and attain their commercialization objectives. A sample of client success stories are highlighted under each program heading. General descriptions of the three programs also follow.

(microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)) Commercialization Assistance Program This program is designed for groups of up to 100 companies and is typically sponsored by an organization, such as a federal agency, with a vested interest in the success of the companies. The purpose of the CAP is to speed up the rate of successful commercialization of R&D. This is accomplished via a process which contains the following components: (1) comprehensive business research and strategic planning, (2) development of a business plan, a stand-alone executive summary, and presentation materials, (3) targeted outreach to potential strategic allies and investors, and (4) a Commercialization Opportunity Forum which brings together well-prepared technology entrepreneurs with prequalified investors and teaming partners. The success of this program is measured by the success of our clients. Specifically, we look at how many finalists receive private sector financing within 18 months of the Forum, the dollar value of those signed agreements, the dollar value of increased sales, and the increase in the number of jobs. The program is designed for use with geographically dispersed or remote clients and consists of guided mentoring, the use of local resources, and three events spaced over a 6-9 month period. Strategic Planning Program The Strategic Planning Program was conducted in 1995 as a pilot for companies which had received awards from the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). Success for this program is measured by: Private sector investment Increased sales Indicators of Commercial Potential This program is an outgrowth of a pilot program that Dawnbreaker conducted for the Department of Defense in 1994 and 1995.

Billerica, MA 1993 CAP participant SBIR:DE-AC01-85-ER80308 Success criteria: increased sales licensing Aerodyne Research, Inc. has provided research and development services to clients working to solve national and international problems since 1970. We contribute understanding of and solutions to critical issues such as global and regional environmental quality and the development of clean, efficient energy and propulsion sources. We design improved remote sensing, surveillance, image processing, tracking and assessment systems for the national defense. We also develop advanced materials and devises for electronic, electro-optical, environmental and energy applications. The Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Change group at Aerodyne performs laboratory and field experiments, designs and uses mathematical models, and develops and utilizes advanced field measurement techniques to understand the sources, environmental transformations and environmental fate of pollutants and biospheric emissions. Our DOE SBIR grant for the development of an Ozone Flux Meter has contributed to the development of technologies with applications in: measurement of sources of radiatively important trace species (RITS), acid gas depositions, air pollution characterization; remote monitoring of gas phase pollutants over highways, landfills, and hazardous waste disposal sites; as well as wide area surveys from airborne and/or van mounted platforms. Aerodyne Research follows two-pronged approach to developing its technology-based product business. We produce and market the highly complex, low volume products ourselves and arrange with other well-positioned firms to produce and market our less complex, high volume products. Our DOE SBIR lead, in part, to the development of our atmospheric trace gas detector systems and our astigmatic multi-pass absorption cell. The full diode laser trace gas detector system can instantaneously detect part-per-billion concentrations of many trace gases in the atmosphere. We have sold several of these systems to western European research institutions. We have also provided a trace gas detector for our own use in NASA-sponsored studies of the environmental impact of aircraft exhaust. An innovative optical component developed under the SBIR program is our astigmatic multi-pass absorption cell ("AMAC"). We have been issues an United States Patent (number 5,291,265) covering the AMAC technology. We fully developed two versions of the AMAC into standard products. After producing and selling several AMAC units ourselves, we established a licensing arrangement with NEW FOCUS, Inc., a major optical supply house, under which they produce, market, and distribute the AMAC units. NEW FOCUS, Inc. placed the AMAC in its winter 1995 catalog and has been experiencing increasing sales. Our DOE Ozone Flux Meter SBIR has led to the development of a series of trace gas detectors, and has led to the following accomplishments: Patent Award: "Off Axis Cavity Absorption Cell", #5,291,265, P.L.

Research Triangle Park, NC 1991 CAP participant Success criteria: private sector developmental funding private placement marketing partnership AndCare is a diagnostic-device company based in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. The company focuses on the research, development, and commercialization of medical and environmental diagnostic devices. AndCare's core sensor technology includes a sensor containing immobilized enzymes, antibodies or other reagents on a disposable plastic strip and a portable electronic monitor, about the size of a paperback novel, to display the readout of the reaction signal. The company's sensor technology works as follows: a small sample is combined with a premeasured amount of chemical reagent. The disposable sensor is inserted into the portable monitor, and the sample is placed on the sensor. After electrochemical stripping analysis, the concentration of the substance being tested for is displayed on the monitor in minutes. AndCare's technology offers several advantages over other testing methods: The sample is confined to the disposable sensor and never touches the monitor, increasing safety and decreasing the risk of sample contamination. The system is cost-effective, with increased convenience and rapid test results. The patented, easy-to-use sensor and monitor system requires minimal training for healthcare or environmental workers. AndCare's patented sensor technology has been demonstrated in the company's LeadCareTM System, a point-of-care diagnostic device for measuring the level of lead in a patient's blood. LeadCare employs an electrochemical stripping sensor containing electrodes coated with colloidal-sized gold particles on a disposable plastic strip. The LeadCare System also includes a portable electronic monitor about the size of a paperback novel, to display the readout of the reaction signal and store data from testing for further analysis. With LeadCare, a small amount of whole blood or other sample from the patient is combined with a pre-measured amount of chemical reagent. The system's disposable sensor strip is inserted into the portable monitor and the treated sample is placed on the sensor. In less than five minutes, a measurement of the lead concentration in the sample is displayed on the monitor. "The use of colloidal gold in the sensor is one of the many unique features of the AndCare lead-testing technology recognized in this patent," said Robert Henkens, Ph.D., and AndCare's chairman and chief scientific officer. "AndCare's lead-detection system meets the analytical challenge of producing a practical device that can accurately and precisely screen young children for blood lead, a need recognized by the Centers for Disease Control." Lead, a toxic metal, is prevalent in today's industrialized society. Exposure to even minute amounts of lead, which was used until the late 1970's in residential paints and until the 1980's in gasoline, has been shown to cause several medical problems including developmental and learning disabilities in children. Clinical trials for the LeadCare System are currently underway at Boston Children's Hospital and elsewhere. Initial feedback has been very positive. The launch of the LeadCare System is currently scheduled for fourth quarter, 1996 For more information on AndCare Inc., please contact: Dr. Steven Wegner President & CEO (919) 544-8220 - phone (919) 544-9808 - fax Back to SuccessWT02-B10-87IA073-000479-B023-258http://www.dawnbreaker.com:80/Aqua.html 204.249.112.36 19970208232916 text/html 4706HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 08 Feb 1997 23:30:28 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4535Last-modified: Thu, 05 Dec 1996 08:52:37 GMT Aquatech's Success Aquatech Services, Inc. Fair Oaks, CA 1995 CAP participant SBIR:DE-FG03-91ER810105 Success criteria: strategic alliance investors Aquatech, a U.S.-based environmental technology development firm, has developed and successfully demonstrated a proprietary process for treating saline waste water from the oil, gas, and coal mining operations. The process enables mine operators to achieve compliance with environmental regulations and to recover clean water for use in agricultural or industrial processes. Waste water from energy resource production operations is highly saline and contaminated with other environmentally regulated compounds. Its discharge into streams, rivers, and other natural bodies of water results in severe water quality degradation and ecosystem destruction, including death of vegetation and fish. Energy and mineral producers are under increasing pressure to treat and dispose of these effluents to comply with national and international environmental mandates and to reduce their pollution liability exposure. This is especially true in areas of Central Europe where environmental degradation has reached unsustainable levels. To date, private investors and the U.S. Department of Energy have invested more than $3 million in the development and commercial demonstration of the Aquatech process. Aquatech is under contract to deliver equipment and technical services for a long-term demonstration of the process at Morcinek Mines, Silesia, Poland. This is part of a research and demonstration program funded jointly by Aquatech, the U.S. Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, the Polish Ecofund and the Polish National Fund for the Environment. The demonstration project, as well as the further application of the process to mines throughout Poland and other parts of Central Europe, uses coalbed methane that is currently vented into the atmosphere, to fuel the process. This use of coalbed methane is not only cost-effective, but also reduces greenhouse gas emission, thereby helping to fulfill the goals of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, ratified by the U.S. and more than 100 other countries. Aquatech's proprietary process offers the following direct benefits to the user: Elimination of pollution liabilities resulting from new and additional contamination of water resources by saline discharges from mining operations. Reclamation of a substantial portion of the effluent stream as fresh water for agricultural or industrial uses. Environmental, water resource and fishery benefits resulting from the prevention of damage from saline discharge that destroys water resources and ecosystems. Compliance with national environmental regulations designed to eliminate waste water discharges and pollution fines. Support of international treaty obligations regarding water pollution and global climate change. Aquatech has focused its initial commercial efforts on the multi-billion dollar emerging market in Poland and neighboring countries in Central Europe. Poland has recently committed to a $9 billion program to improve its environmental infrastructure. Water discharges from mining activities constitute the single largest source of water pollution in Poland. The extension of the Polish mine project beyond the demonstration phase has the support of the Polish government, the Polish Ecofund and the Polish National Fund for the Environment and the World Business Counsel for Sustainable Development.

They participated in the SBIR program so that they could develop a tension leg platform concept for use in developing oil and gas reserves in deep water. A cooperative effort between Atlantia Corporation and the British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate, P.L.C. subsidiary, British-Petroleum Inc. has resulted in the commercial development of the SeaStar, a low cost production system for deepwater marginal fields. The companies have now signed an agreement to formalize the basis for their future activities in relation to utilization of SeaStar in the Gulf of Mexico. Atlantia's SeaStar production system is a single column tension leg platform developed for offshore oil and gas of up to 50,000 boe (barrels of oil equivalent) per day, in water depths ranging from 600 to over 6,000 feet. Intended for use on deepwater fields with recoverable reserves from 10 to 100 million boe in size, the SeaStar family includes 40 proprietary hull shapes which can be constructed and installed in less than two years. (1) During 1995, British-Borneo and Atlantia worked together developing a site-specific SeaStar design. The joint design was created for use on British-Borneo's recently acquired “Morpeth” field in the Gulf of Mexico. Water depth at the field is approximately 1,630-ft. Reserves at "Morpeth" are estimated at 50 million barrels of oil and 50 Bef of natural gas. Regarding the strategic alliance with Atlantia, Alan Gaylor, CEO of British-Borneo said that “Atlantia is one of the most innovative designers of low cost production facilities in the world. The SeaStar will be a state-of-the-art production facility that substantially reduces cost structures for smaller oil and gas field developments in deep water, leading to a commercial advantage for both companies.

Omniview (R) is so revolutionary that it is closer to a human eye than to existing video systems. It pans, tilts, magnifies, and rotates a video image with no pointing mechanism. Omniview was developed to eliminate the camera pointing mechanism in remote viewing applications where size, weight, reliability, response or covertness are considerations. (1) In order to leverage development of Omniview, TRI has entered into several strategic partnerships with other high tech companies. In fact, TRI received a big boost earlier this year when Motorola took a minority equity stake in the company. "Motorola invests in companies with leveragable technology that may hold out a promise of spawning new applications and new businesses," says Robert Burton, vice president and general manager of New Enterprises at Motorola. "Omniview is a perfect fit with what Motorola is doing and where it is heading." While TRI intends to handle R&D, prototype development and after-market servicing for Omniview, the company has teamed up with Siemens Industrial Automation, Inc. for actual product manufacturing. TRI will be the first U.S. company not owned by Siemens to have products made at the company's high tech manufacturing facility in Johnson City, Tenn. TRI is a perfect fit with Siemens says Michael E. Washington, manager of business development for Siemens Industrial Automation. Omniview has a chance to revolutionize the image, communications, and broadcasting business, says Masamura Yamaji, CEO of Omniview Systems, Inc., a Japanese licensee. "With existing systems the picture taking side of the camera controls the image. But with Omniview, the viewer can control the image." In 1993, Benthos, Inc. teamed up with TRI, Inc. to develop underwater uses for TRI's Omniview imaging system. "It gives us an add-on capability to our standard video inspection system," says Roger Whyte imaging product line manager at Benthos Inc. In exchange for funding R&D efforts, Benthos received exclusive rights for the manufacturing and use of Omniview for underwater applications.

R&D to date has emphasized waste vitrification, waste recycling, glass melting and refining, high temperature heat recovery, furnace development, and advanced power cycle assessment.Vortec is now at a stage where its patented technologies are ready to meet market demands and opportunities. (1) Vortec Corporation of Collegeville, PA has been awarded an $11.6 million prime contract by the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center to construct a transportable vitrification process to demonstrate the remediation of hazardous and radioactive soils. The contract is sponsored by the DOE Office of Technology Development (EM-50) and is headed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Dr. Clyde Frank. The U.S. Department of Energy has selected the gaseous diffusion plant located in Paducah, Kentucky as the commercial demonstration site for the Vortec Corporation advanced vitrification process. (2) The waste remediation plant will incorporate the use of the Vortec patented glass melting system known as the CMS (TM)for the vitrification process unit. Vitrification is being used for the processing of radioactive solid waste at the site because it produces a glass product which is chemically stable for thousands of years. The Vortec CMS (TM) is unique in that it allows for the simultaneous processing of organic, heavy metal, and radionuclide containing waste materials. (1) Ormet Primary Aluminum Corporation of Wheeling, WV has entered into a licensing agreement with Vortec Corporation to purchase Vortec's patented Cyclone Melting System (CMSTM) for the recycling of spent aluminum pot liners (SPL). Disposal of SPL, a cyanide and fluoride containing waste (KO88), is a problem that has been plaguing the aluminum industry for years. The predicament is being brought to a head due to the EPA land ban scheduled to be enacted in 1996. The Vortec CMS (TM) vitrification process purchased by Ormet not only meets EPA requirements, but also recycles the waste into value-added glass and ceramic products - thus eliminating the long term liability of landfilling wastes. (1) WELKO Industriale s.p.a. (ITALY) a major supplier of ceramic tile manufacturing equipment and Vortec Corporation (USA) are introducing a new ceramic tile which incorporates recycled industrial waste into the tile product. This new product is called �EKOTILE� because it is ecologically and environmentally sound approach for solving industrial waste disposal problems. The strategic alliance between Vortec and Welko combines the necessary engineering and technical capability for building turn-key ceramic tile manufacturing lines using the new technology.

Boulder, CO 1995 Strategic Planning participant Advanced Technology Program Success criteria: private placement Displaytech is a privately held company in Boulder, Colorado developing miniature liquid crystal displays. The company also develops and manufactures electro-optic component products used in industrial inspection and measurement, medical imaging, and research. All of the company's products are based on its proprietary surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal technology. (1) In May Displaytech announced initiation of the ChronoColor Miniature Display Developers Program. Through this program selected manufacturers of end user display products will be able to receive the company's electronic miniature displays for new product development. Small, light weight high resolution miniature displays that have low power requirements and can be magnified into high screen quality images bring together the thus far opposing trends of large viewing screens and portability. "Miniature displays have the capability to change the way people view and retrieve information," said president Mark Handschy. "An entire range of new products are possible with this technology: products such as telefax pagers, videoconferencing cellular phones, information appliances, workstation quality computer displays mounted in eyeglass frames... the list is limited only by one's imagination." Miniature displays, which generally measure less than an inch diagonally, produce images on a very small surface that can be magnified or projected for viewing. Displaytech's ChronoColor Miniature Display is built on a silicon chip that measures about 1/2 inch diagonally. The 1280 x 1024 ChronoColor Miniature Display is expected to measure 8 millimeters by 6 millimeters. The ChronoColor Display is based on the company's proprietary liquid crystal technology (fast switching ferroelectric liquid crystals) and the standard technologies of CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) memory and LED's (light emitting diodes). The ChronoColor Miniature Display will be equipped with interfaces that make it compatible with VGA systems. The Developers' Program is targeted to experienced manufacturers of display products who are committed to developing miniature display technology. Under the Developers' Program, manufacturers will be able to evaluate the ChronoColor Display for their particular products. As end user display product manufacturers develop products, Displaytech will ramp up its scalable manufacturing process. "We have been investing in product manufacturing for the last years and a half. At the end of 1996, we will have facilities in place to produce commercial quantities of the ChronoColor Miniature Display," said Haviland Wright, CEO. Dislaytech is currently developing miniature displays with 256 x 256 resolution, and 640 x 480 through 1280 x 1024 resolutions. The company will distribute 640 x 480 displays through the Developers' Program. Developers will receive their first displays in early 1997. (2) ChronoColor is a registered trademark.

The Light Shaping Diffuser controls the light energy distribution within a desired elliptical or circular solid angle, providing at least one order of magnitude better display brightness as compared to currently used Lambertian diffusers. POC's potential diffuser applications include: (1) consumer TV projection screens, high contrast screens for use in LCDs, and projection screens for overhead and slide projectors; (ii) beam homogenizers for OEM systems such as spectrometers, blood analyzers, and endoscopes; and (iii) beam shapers for lighting products such as flashlights, automotive interior lighting, bar code scanners, lighted signs, 3-D displays, and cockpit displays. For the next five years, display devices are projected to experience "meteoric growth" (Electronic News, 1994). POC is confident that its Light Shaping Diffusers will become an integral part of these display devices. POC has a strong patent position in diffuser products and is pursuing joint ventures and licensing agreements to address those opportunities that are beyond the companies corporate capabilities. POC participated in the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) which helped POC to optimize the Light Shaping Diffuser fabrication process, develop the diffuser pattern replication methodology and optimize perfomance of the LCD. As a result, POC was able to increase its market share both in the U.S. and abroad. Since the completion of the ATP, we have further enhanced the performance, yield and manufacturing proceess to address specific customer requirements for LCD display, projection displays, directional displays, HDTV screen and cockpit displays. The technical advances achieved during the course of the ATP have improved diffuser performance in many systems, such as "remote source lighting". This has enabled POC to spin-off a subsidiary, "FarLight".

Beavercreek, OH 1995 DoD Indicators participant Success criteria: Phase II award from Air Force AdTech Systems Research, Inc.provides research & development, engineering, and technical services to various government agencies and prime contractors. AdTech's expertise is in two interrelated areas: (1) analytical/computer modeling for analysis of materials and structures; and (2) experimental mechanical testing of metals, non-metals, and their composites. In 1996 AdTech received a Phase II award from the Air Force to continue its work with advanced composite joints. The Air Force and the aerospace industry have identified advanced composites as candidate material systems for a variety of aero propulsion, aero structure, space structure, and airframe components. A number of these applications involve joints, between similar and dissimilar material systems. Some of these are mechanical joints such as bolted and riveted connections. Others are fabricated by welding, brazing, hot isostatic pressing (HIPing), cold isostatic pressing and by a variety of other methods. Often, structural integrity and service life of components containing such joints is limited by the integrity of the joints. Therefore, for design improvement as well as for component life prediction goals, methods are needed which can predict load carrying capacity and life of components containing joints. Under this Phase II SBIR, AdTech is developing a product in the form of a user friendly, interactive, intelligent, computer software package which can be readily used by aerospace engineers to improve the design and evaluation of advanced material joints. The direct benefit of the Phase II will be a comprehensive design tool for evaluating conceptual designs and optimizing existing designs to maximize the advantages of using composite materials. Industries which could benefit from this advance include aircraft/aerospace; automotive; and power generation.

One such discipline, coatings of materials, has emerged as one of AS&M's leading research areas. This can be attributed to industry�s demand for corrosion protection coupled with AS&M's strong background in materials science. Primary focus has been on sol-gel coatings which can be used for forming oxide coatings on a variety of substrates. One coating which has developed at AS&M while working on the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program is a two-phase glass (TPG) coating. This coating was designed in cooperation with NASA-Langely Research Center, to protect titanium alloys from oxidation and hot corrosion at high temperatures (750-1200C). Success in this program has lead to further development for other applications, particularly in the aerospace and power generation industry. Currently, further development is being funded through a Phase II contract with the Navy at Cherry Point, NC. The objective is to help increase the service life of a jet engine by protecting its turbine blades from oxidation and hot corrosion. Ultimately, this will save a considerable amount of maintenance costs that are incurred from costly repairs. In addition to the turbine blade industry, this coating has also shown great promise in applications with similar environmental conditions. Thermocouples, automobile engine valves, and high-speed missile surfaces are areas that can use the protective nature of this coating. AS&M plan s to market this coating to the commercial turbine engine, automobile, and defense industry.

The technology which serves as the basis for the new business is under development by ARCOVA and involves the spray deposition of low loss ferrites that serve as cores for magnetic components. The increased performance efficiency, higher power density, and improved transient characteristics afforded by integrated planar magnetic circuitry are important in the development of very high speed integrated circuits. The technology will provide benefits to U.S. Agencies that employ high efficiency power converters in aeronautical, aerospace, and electronic warfare applications. Commercial uses include aircraft, computers, automotive electrical systems, hybrid/electric vehicles, medical diagnostics, communication systems and consumer electronics. The military market is highly specialized and is less sensitive to price than to size, weight, and performance. The availability of monolithic magnetic devices will provide the Department of Defense and its contractors with the ability to produce power converters and power supplies operational at megahertz frequencies, that can be miniaturized for use in electronic packages for spaceborne, airborne, and critical defense missions. Civilian markets are more easily delineated. Price is a more sensitive factor, but high performance planar power converter units offer many advantages that favor their introduction in a wide range of applications. Commercial applications include communication and aeronautical equipment, medical devices, consumer electronics, power electronic systems, personal computer power supplies, automotive power electronics, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, power generation and electric motor drive systems.

Atlanta, GA 1994 DoD Indicators participant Success criteria: awarded a Phase II from NSF The company goal is to develop and exploit a wide offering of products and engineering services related to structural strain measurement. SMS products will allow inexpensive, reliable, and timely prediction of structural failures to an extent not possible under competing technologies. The patented SMS Intelli Sense (TM) technology involves so-called "smart" materials, in particular Peak Strain Indicating (PSI) steel alloys capable of "remembering" peak strains placed upon them. These alloys are engineered into sensor systems that allow, for example, a bridge toe to be structurally interrogated remotely by phone. The systems allow bridges and airplanes to proactively announce their pending structural failure in time for remedies. For the first time the user can know accurately and immediately how close to failure a structural element has come. Furthermore, that information can be captured with no external support systems. It does not matter whether the damage arose from instantaneous strain, corrosion, or fatigue. The strain instrument "remembers" the maximum strain/deformation it has experienced so that the information may be monitored in real time or at some later time. The SMS IntelliSense technology is equally useful in military and civilian planes, equipment, bridges, and buildings. The significant maintenance savings and safety enhancements offered by the SMS technology are valuable in both environments. Potential customers include all government agencies responsible for bridge maintenance and safety; as well as manufacturers and operators of stressed structures, including airplanes, pipelines, and pressure vessels. The technology is of particular value in earthquake prone areas and can be used to monitor bridges, pipelines, tunnels, viaducts, runways, and buildings. Other applications include fasteners and other mechanical applications.

The Phase II SBIR project is concerned with developing a high efficiency DC to DC power converter based on a micromechanical switch technology. This is in contrast to current switching power supplies in which the switching function is accomplished with transistors. High efficiency switching power supplies have applications in virtually all portable, battery operated electronic instruments, including laptop computers and cellular phones. The military has specific interest in this technology for communications terminals. A very small, high efficiency power converter could also find application in distributed power supply systems, including board level power converters. Commercialization Strategy: Toward the end of the Phase II project, TMS will likely seek to partner with an established power supply manufacturer to move this technology into full commercial production Source: Correspondence from Gregory J.

Developing effective business plans for advanced technology firms by Dr. Jenny Servo This article was written for the National Science Foundation. It describes the steps which advanced technology firms should follow to develop winning business plans. Index Introduction Know your Audience Obstacles to Business Planning Business Planning as Theory Construction Business Planning - the Process Generic Business Plan Outline Formatting your Business Plan Using your Business Plan Profound Simplicity A. Introduction Most companies avoid writing a business plan until they are in dire need of money. Propelled forward by the need to finance business growth, the technology entrepreneur begins this unique form of communication with the intent of convincing potential investors that they can make a good return on their investment (ROI) if they finance their firm. When developed for this purpose, the business plan has an external focus and must thoroughly address issues of importance to private investors. More experienced entrepreneurs also recognize that a business plan has great internal value, serving as a guide to help the company chart a course towards successful Phase III commercialization. 'Commercialization' as used here refers to (a) the sale of product or technology to private sector or military customers, and/or (b) the investment of developmental funds by the private sector in the company or a specific technology. Irrespective of the reasons for writing a business plan, the time invested can be far more fruitful if the entrepreneur views business planning as a transformational process for his or her management team. In making this statement, it is recognized that often the management team may consist of one person - the founder/technology entrepreneur. The end product of well-conceived planning is not only an excellent selling document, but increased business acumen which enables the technology entrepreneur to effectively use this tool to raise capital. The purpose of this chapter is to (1) describe the requirements of the audience for a company's business plan (i.e. potential investors), (2) provide a generic business plan outline, (3) examine methods for conducting the research required for business plan development, and (4) provide suggestions for appropriate use of business plans in seeking external funds. If you do not require external financing, your company in essence is the investor in itself. You should proceed to develop a business plan in the identical fashion suggested and then step back to examine the business opportunity from an investor's perspective. This vantage point will assist you in determining if you have charted the appropriate course of action. B. Know your Audience Your business plan is a communication tool. Therefore, in order to develop an effective selling document, the technology entrepreneur must first begin with a solid understanding of the audience. The audience for a business plan is not the same as the audience for a grant proposal. When you develop a Phase I or Phase II SBIR proposal, your task is to communicate effectively with other technologists. You, therefore, emphasize the significance of the problem, your methods for solving the problem, your qualifications, and the innovativeness/originality of the proposed work. However, as you enter Phase III and seek private sector investment, the technology entrepreneur communicates with a different group - with investors whose mission is to create value. Understanding the investor's perspective is often difficult for scientists. Scientists and investors move in different circles - circles that rarely intersect except when the agenda is money. It's money that brings scientists and investors together. Investors wish to create wealth and need a vehicle for doing so. Scientists seek financial resources to continue nurturing their dream. In essence, the investor sees money as the end and the scientists sees money as the means. What unlikely bedfellows! Investors carry the weight of fiduciary responsibility and manage other people's money. Creativity in the realm of finance can result in a prison sentence and heavy fines. Thus, individuals trained in finance are taught many procedures to appropriately track the movement of money and to predict investments which will result in the creation of additional wealth for their clients. The phrase that most befits investors is "I'm from Missouri, Prove it to me!" Give me data. Give me procedures. Minimize my risk. In the relationship between investors and scientists, scientists are the suitors. This is an unfamiliar position for new technology entrepreneurs. It is important to keep in mind that when seeking private sector financing, the technology entrepreneur is asking the investor to part with that which is at the core of their professional life - financial resources. The technology entrepreneur must therefore act as a visitor in the investor's world and learn to speak the language of business. The entrepreneur must de-emphasize discussions of technology and instead emphasize information regarding customers, markets, distribution channels, intellectual property, sales plans, engineering and manufacturing plans, human resource and financial requirements. These are the parameters that determine if your business opportunity will create value for potential investors. These are the variables of greatest interest to your audience - the investor. C. Obstacles to Business Planning Without a doubt, good business planning takes time! Unfortunately, many technology entrepreneurs begin the business planning process too late - waiting until they are in urgent need of financial resources before they begin. Due to lack of time and lack of familiarity with the process, they approach business planning at a superficial level - quickly finding answers to generic questions that must be addressed in business planning. However, good planning cannot be approached superficially. A rushed attempt at business planning will often fail in obtaining the desired funds. As a result, the new technology entrepreneur might falsely conclude that business concepts are unimportant, simple, and little more than conjecture - thus, distancing himself further from the benefits of good business planning. Another obstacle that prevents technology entrepreneurs from developing a business plan is the belief that they already have one. It's the plan in the entrepreneur's head. The entrepreneur believes that he has all the pertinent information. He simply hasn't had time to write it down yet. However, what the entrepreneur believes to be a business plan is nothing more than a "Mind Map", or a set of untested hypotheses and assumptions about the business environment in which the entrepreneur operates. This is the Pre-condition in Figure 1. The Mind Map is expressed simply, it also lacks depth of understanding. Just as it is insufficient for a scientist to base predictions strictly on hypotheses and assumptions, it is equally inappropriate for entrepreneurs to base their decisions on untested hypotheses. In business, as in science, conjecture must gradually be replaced by certitude! FIGURE 1(Insert Figure 1 about here) D. Business Planning as Theory Construction In the practice of science, a scientist strives to observe, explain, predict, and control the phenomenon of interest. A technology entrepreneur must aspire to no less in the business planning process. The scientist, as business planner, must observe the world in which the business opportunity exists. The most important variables to which he or she must attend are the customers, competitors, market size, financial resources, risks, human resources, and technology/product. (Technology is listed last intentionally, as the potential investor usually assumes the viability of the technology at the outset and validates this later.) The entrepreneur must gather sufficient information to explain the behavior of these variables so that adequate predictions can be made regarding their probable interaction. Strategies then need to be developed to maximize the likelihood that the course of development can be controlled in the desired fashion - which is, in the creation of a commercially viable business. Business planning then is like "theory construction" or "model building." At the outset, a scientist's view of his business contains numerous assumptions and hypotheses. However, through the application of a systematic approach these assumptions may be tested and even discarded if necessary. A business plan is nothing more than the business counterpart of scientific theory and embodies the scientist's understanding of the business world in which the technology exists and can be commercialized. E. Business Planning - the Process The most important aspect of business planning is the process itself. This process contains a number of discrete steps: clarification of the company vision and mission,information gathering (customers, market, competitors, distribution channels, costs associated with R&D, engineering, manufacturing and financing options), review of information - synthesis, inferences and deductions,decision makingre-evaluation of mind map,number crunchingstrategizing, andwriting The business planning process is iterative and not linear in nature. As the entrepreneur gathers more information, the vantage point and positions taken will shift. During this process, the technology entrepreneur must be willing to part with perspectives that upon examination fail to coincide with the evidence at hand. In most cases, the outcome of good strategic business planning is change... a modification in the technology, the product, the team, the direction, or the assessment of the opportunity itself. This is where the transformational value of business planning becomes evident. Business planning is always added to a very busy schedule and, therefore, requires a firm commitment at the outset. It is recommended that the technology entrepreneur anticipate that approximately 300 person-hours will be required for the business planning process over a three month period. Once the entrepreneur has made a commitment to proceed, a project manager should be selected and a schedule established for completion of the process. The project manager should either be the company President or someone else within the management team. It is important that the technology entrepreneur include other people from the management team in this process. This will assure that their perspectives also shift in light of new data gleaned as the work progresses. Tasks such as secondary data gathering, number crunching, and editing can be undertaken by others on behalf of the team. Thus, by outsourcing some tasks, the management team can reduce demands on its time. Don't overlook the services of the NASA Regional Technology Transfer Centers, graduate students, and accountants with regard to these activities. However, all other tasks should be undertaken by the management team. The technology entrepreneur's team will miss the opportunity for growth if data synthesis, decision-making, and strategizing are allocated to others. This will compromise the ability of the team to interface effectively with potential investors. This business plan must be yours! Ownership must be felt by the team! F. Generic Business Plan Outline When you actually begin to write the business plan, you should expect that the process will be similar to writing a technical paper. First a draft is produced (referred to in Figure 1 as the Business/Operational Plan) and then a briefer, more polished final draft will follow (Business Plan). The latter is what you will share with potential investors. As this is a different style of writing, expect that the actual preparation of the business plan will take more time than that required to write a technical paper. Business Plan Outline Executive Summary Company & Technology Description Customers Market Industry Analysis Competitors Marketing/Sales Plan R&D Plan Manufacturing/Engineering Plan Human Resource Plan Contingencies Financials (Cash Flow, Profit & Loss Statement, Balance Sheet) Appendices References The overall objective of a business plan is to present a compelling argument for investment. The document begins with a presentation of background information regarding the company, the technology, the industry, the market, the competitors and then concludes with the presentation of a detailed plan for capturing a piece of that market and creating value for both the investor and the firm. The information presented in the plan is clustered into various sections, all of which are fairly generic (See Table 1). Don't get hung up on the actual Chapter headings used in the table of contents. These may vary somewhat from one outline to another. The variation is irrelevant. What is important is the level of detail and specificity. Specificity is what differentiates excellent from poor business plans. Again, remember that your audience consists of risk averse investors who wish to create value. They are not enamored with technology, but with the possibility that your technology presents for developing wealth. The more facts that you can provide, the better. Fill your business plan with certitude! Reduce conjecture! When developing models for emerging markets, base the model on a number of well established data points and benchmarks. Cite your sources, just as you do when preparing a technical paper. Define your market segments with specificity, rather than presenting data at the industry level. For example, if you have produced a high-efficiency heater that could be used in the high-end market - size that niche, rather than representing your market as the total HVAC market. G. Formatting your Business Plan Potential investors are presented with thousands of business plans each year. They quickly scan the Executive Summary, look at the financials and then decide if they will read any further. Your Executive Summary is, therefore, very important. It must sizzle! Don't write it when you are tired - it needs to be exciting for an investor. Don't make it sound academic - brag a bit! Talk about your accomplishments - specifically those that have relevance for value creation. Don't make it sound as if your focus is merely to obtain funds for R&D. Talk about and represent a genuine desire for a partnership with the investor. Make it apparent that there will be an opportunity for significant return on investment. However, do not spell out the terms of a potential agreement as this needs to be negotiated. Be brief - but not so short that the excitement is lost. The visual appearance of a business plan is quite different than that of a grant proposal. Your objective when formatting the business plan is to make it distinctive. You want to make it stand out from the rest. It should be accessible and easy to read. This is done via the use of graphics, color, spacing, and type font. I am not suggesting that form is more important than content. Good content must be there - but then, go that extra mile. In the business world, a book is judged by its cover. Appearance is taken as a reflection of the professionalism of your firm. There are common errors made in formatting business plans which are deadly. Before you present a copy of your business plan to an investor, check it thoroughly. Make sure that: It has a Table of Contents; it has page numbers; it is double spaced; it uses a type face that is easy to read - such as 12 point Times Roman; it is bound. H. Using your Business Plan An excellent business plan contains detailed, proprietary information about your firm's strategy for developing a place in the market. This is not the kind of information that you will want anyone, but a serious investor to have. Therefore, be cautious in the distribution of your business plan and pre qualify potential investors before providing them with a copy to review. How do you meet investors? The most common way to meet investors is through third party introductions. A lawyer, an accountant, another technologist, a consultant, or a friend may make the introduction for you. After the introduction, call to set up an appointment to meet with the potential investor. At a meeting, present salient information regarding your business opportunity to the potential investor. Always bear in mind the motivation of the investor and address business issues rather than focusing on the technology. This first meeting should be on a non-confidential basis. Spend time during this meeting getting to know each other. Ask questions to determine if the potential investor is a good match for you. Typical questions include: What kind of experience have they had with helping companies at this stage of development? What is the typical return on investment that they look for? What is their experience in this industry or marketplace? Do they have established relationships with company X, Y, Z - potential good strategic partners for you? Are they currently investing in a competitor? In this meeting it is important to get a feeling for the person with whom you are dealing. Develop an understanding of how they work and what else the investor brings to the table besides money. Ultimately, any potential business relationship depends on trust. This is what each of you must assess during your first meeting. In closing, leave a copy of your Executive Summary with the potential investor and establish a time and a reason for the next interaction. Always keep in mind that you are the suitor in this relationship and be sure to initiate the scheduled follow-up activities. If you decide to proceed, the next typical step is to ask the potential investor to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. Some investors will sign a Confidentiality Agreement, others will not. Therefore, at this point the technology entrepreneur must make a decision as to whether he wishes to share the business plan with a potential investor on a non-confidential basis. When confronted with this situation, some entrepreneurs decide to remove sections of the plan that they consider particularly sensitive and share an edited version on a non-confidential basis.

Dawnbreaker has conducted this program on 5 ocassions for the U.S. Department of Energy. Participating companies are those which have received Phase II R&D funding through the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR). The purpose of the CAP is to speed up the rate of successful commercialization of R&D. This is accomplished via a process which contains the following components: comprehensive business research and strategic planning, developing a business plan, a stand-alone Executive Summary, and presentation materials, targeted outreach to potential strategic allies and investors, and a Commercialization Opportunity Forum which brings together well-prepared technology entrepreneurs with prequalified investors and teaming partners. The success of this program is measured by the success of our clients. Specifically, we look at: how many finalists receive private sector financing within 18 months of the Forum, the dollar value of those signed agreements the dollar value of increased sales, and the increase in the number of jobs. The program is designed for use with geographically dispersed or remote clients. The program consists of guided mentoring and 3 events spaced over a 6-9 month period.

Planning is everything! -- Dwight D. Eisenhower So we many companies approach business plan development as something they must do when in dire need of money. They approach business planning as a writing exercise; as something that can be accomplished by shutting yourself away for a week-end and writing down everything you know. Nothing could be further from the truth! Business planning is a transformational process and a comprehensive activity which involves strategic planning, market research, competitor analysis, development of operational plans, financial forecasts and analysis of value. Once one has completed the process of conducting this business research and planning phase, the information is then packaged as a business plan. Most often the purpose of such a plan is to serve as a compelling and logical case for investment by internal or external investors and/or teaming partners. As there are so many different formats for business plans, we have included the outline of the one we have developed over time. Our purpose in including this is to show you what a comprehensive business plan should contain. However, remember that a business plan is only as good as the planning and research which has preceeds it. You wouldn't write a technical paper without conducting your experimental research first; neither should you draft a business plan until you have conducted appropriate business planning and research. Our book entitled "Business Planning for Scientist and Engineers" provides a good conceptual framework for accomplishing the research. Dawnbreaker can assist individual companies with business plan development and/or critique business plans. See a related article.

This technique utilizes several potencies of the same homeopathic substance in a single tablet, pillule or liquid preparation. Although the principle behind Poten-C-cords was first described during the early decades of the twentieth century, it was not until the 1970's that the application of preparations based on this principle became well known. Clinical utilization of this practice then became widespread with the use of multiple potencies for both single substances and combinations of several substances. Poten-C-cords are administered with the objective of obtaining more intensive results by utilizing a spectrum of potencies to augment the overall therapeutic effect. The purpose of mixed potencies is to avail patients of the advantages of providing both "high" and "low" attenuations at the same time. History Dr. Manfred Vosgerau documents in Bases and Results of Therapy with Balanced Potencies, that when potencies are combined as harmonizing potencies, the individual degrees of potency maintain their independent action, so that there is no immediate averaging effect on the different potencies. In 1911, Cahis of Barcelona was the first to prepare medicinal agents based on the principle of potency chords. He likened such preparations to musical melodies or chords and theorized the sum total therapeutic effect to be quite different from the individual potencies themselves. Cahis found that his multiple potency chords did, in fact, enhance therapeutic effects. He discovered that multiple attenuations initiated primary healing responses which were less uncomfortable for the patient than with one attenuation level, i.e. they reduced or eliminated the healing crisis or symptom aggravation. Dr. Kroner investigated the action of potency chords by first prescribing and serially administering the different individual attenuations on separate occasions, and in later tests, mixed the different attenuations for administration in one single multi-attenuation dosage. Kroner's results paralleled those of Cahis, finding that the action of potency chords was, in fact, different from and superior to the result achieved when the patient took the same, separate, unmixed attenuations in consecutive sequence. Dr. Herman Junker published a study in 1982 entitled "On the Effects of Extremely Potentized Substances on Paramecia". He potentized substances 1X to 27X, and his data quite clearly shows that some potencies inhibit while other potencies stimulate. This effect is sinusoidal with stimulatory maxima and minima occuring at different potencies. Potency Relationships It is important to recognize the various relationships between Individual potencies, the body, and disease states. Lower potency levels have direct relationships with normal physiological concentrations in the body. This is a meaningful first step in the selection of a potency for a patient and his symptoms. Many enzymes in the body have cellular concentrations of 1X10-4M to 1X10-6M. These levels correspond to potencies in the ranges of 3X to 6X (2C - 3C). Regulatory enzymes and transfer or communicative molecules, such as Acetyl CoA have been measured at cellular levels of 1X10-9M - 1X10-10M corresponding to potencies of 9X - 12X (6C). Hormone levels are measured or estimated to be present at physiological concentrations of 1X10-9M - 1X10-22M representing potencies of 9X to 22X (6C - 12C). These concentration levels within the cells, tissues, blood and fluids illustrate the potential relationships between homeopathic potencies and physiological activities. There also exists a meaningful relationship between potency and the progress of an illness. The resonant potency for an individual changes during the course of the disease. Initially, at the onset of the illness, higher potencies are resonant with the disease state. As symptoms worsen, the resonant potency decreases to lower potency levels, and as healing and recovery occurs, the resonant potency increases again. Van Benochoten has also demonstrated that potencies have harmonic relationships with each other. His work demonstrates a harmonic relationship between the 3X potencies and 6X, 12X, 30X, and 200X potencies. Another harmonic relationship exists between 6X and 1M, and another between 12X and 10M, 50M and CM potencies. The unique harmonic relationships of the low and medium potencies provides the basis for the use of resonant, harmonizing, or multiple potencies. Potency Influences: Potency Ranges: organs and tissues low 1x, 3x, 6x, 9x (3c) hormonal regulation of organs, tissues and cellular function intermediary regulation of intercellular metabolic systems and enzymes medium 12x, 30x (6C, 12C) functional regulation at the level of gene expression miasms and constitional expression medium high 60x, 100x, 200x (30C, 60C) energetic influences high 1000x, 1M CM, LM Potency Selection This scientific data leads to the conclusion that administration of a single potency may not have the desired effect. Favorable, clinical results are based on the characteristic inhibitory or stimulatory action of the substance and the need for the administered potency to be in harmony with the body's current demands. This sinusoidal activity seems to be more critical at lower potencies of 3C to 30C, than at higher potencies which have other than gross physiological activity. To optimize the body's response it is beneficial to use a Poten-C-cord to ensure maximum initial physiological action, and to provide additional potencies for use as the patient's disease progresses and is in need of a higher potency. Using a Poten-C-cord takes the guess work out of selecting a potency as all acute level potencies are provided - 6C, 12C, 30C, and 60C. The Poten-C-cord may also be used as a single dose in constitutional prescribing replacing or preceding the application of a higher potency. Clinical evidence indicates that patients exhibit fewer aggravations as the body utilizes the potency that it resonates with. The same Poten-C-cord can be used on day two, three, etc., as the body's need for different potencies is satisfied. Poten-C-cords are both physiologically balanced and practical because they: Effect the biology at multiple maxima and minima, thus ensuring a resonant response. Make changing potencies as the disease progresses unnecessary Produce fewer patient aggravations as the patient's resonance is always matched Improve patient compliance and reduce practitioner interventions Decrease the necessity of keeping an extensive inventory of "single potency" remedies CompliMed™ offers a wide selection of Poten-C-cords for health care professionals. There are times when the use of more than one potency at a time of a given remedy is beneficial. For example, when both an acute symptomatic episode and a constitutional predisposition need to be addressed. CompliMed™ has utilized these valuable research findings to construct formulations which are both contemporary and unique. The Poten-C-cords include the most frequently used remedies and polycrests providing an efficacious group of homeopathic formulations designed specifically for today's patient and physician needs.

The practice of Homeopathy was considered a fringe or alternative and obscure philosophy and practice of medicine. It has, however, found its way onto center stage, if not completely into the mainstream of progressive and integrated medical practice. In 1990, it was estimated that 1 in 3 Americans used alternative therapies and most did not tell their conventional physician. In 1993, Dr. Eisenberg & colleagues published a survey in Journal of Family Practice estimating that patients made 425 million visits to providers of alternative therapies (compared with 388 million visits to primary care physicians) and spent $13.7 billion dollars, $10.3 billion of which was out of pocket. This growth in homeopathy has been paralleled by an equally impressive increase in homeopathic research. Homeopathic research now appears in prominent, pier-reviewed scientific and medical journals. Most prominent among these have been the articles by Dr. Jennifer Jacobs appearing in Pediatrics on the homeopathic treatment of diarrhea in children, and Dr. David Taylor Reilly's report on reproducible outcomes in homeopathy appearing in the Lancet. Both of these double blind placebo controlled studies meet the most stringent criteria for medical methodology and support positive homeopathic treatment outcomes. Additionally, in response to the demand for more research into alternative therapies, last October the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) funded eight Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Centers to evaluate various complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) therapies through high quality research. These centers are expected to focus the scope of their activities on the areas of rehabilitation, women's health, pain, pain management, aging, cancer prevention and treatment, allergy treatment, and the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of CAM therapies for common, chronic medical conditions. The acceptance of alternative therapies in conventional medical practices is growing. Many major medical schools and universities are responding to the requests for more research and education, and have added to their curriculum Complimentary Medical courses that include classes on Homeopathy. These universities include the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, Harvard Medical School, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Georgetown University Medical School and the University of Arizona, just to name a few. In the state of Washington, Blue Cross offered a 1-year pilot program in which the response was so "overwhelming" that is has added a plan, called AlternaPath, that will provide coverage for those services traditionally disallowed by most health insurance plans. Approved medications under this plan include herbal and homeopathic remedies, and vitamins. General References Blumberg, D L, MD, et al.

Primary areas offocus include both insurance defense and plaintiff's personal injury, as well as professionalnegligence. Hal is an aggressive litigator with a calm and professional style. A graduate of OhioState University (1970) and Georgetown University Law School (1974), Hal is a member of theWashington State Trial Lawyers Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, and theWashington Defense Trial Lawyers. He has taught litigation skills to other lawyers at theNational Institute of Trial Advocacy. Hal has been successful in scores of jury trials and arbitrations throughout NorthwesternWashington. He has tried cases in Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, King, Island and San JuanCounties, plus the Federal District Court. In a prior incarnation he tried medical malpracticecases in Washington, D.C. The subject matter of Hal's cases is equally varied. He was the lead attorney representing a group of dairy farmers in a 6.5 week trial that resultedin a $2.9 million verdict. Recently he successfully defended a consortium of municipalities who were sued for theirsewage disposal practices. Their dismissal was affirmed in the appellate court. Zander v.Whatcom County, 128 Wn.2d 1015, 911 P.2d 1343 (1996). Representing the defense in a one car automobile accident case in which his client (the driver)had been killed, Hal persuaded a jury that the plaintiff/passenger who was either asleep or passedout at the time of the accident was 70% at fault for his own injuries, and therefore was entitled torecover nothing. The Court of Appeals reversed, but the Supreme Court reinstated the defenseverdict. Geschwind v. Flanagan, 121 Wn.2d 833, 854 P.2d 1061 (1993). Hal has frequently litigated insurance coverage issues. Stoughton v. Mutual of Enumclaw, 61Wn. App. 365, 810 P.2d 80 (1991), established that the "business pursuits" exclusion found in ahomeowner's policy excludes coverage for casual daylabor, reversing an earlier summary judgment against the insurer. Several significant medical malpractice suits have been tried or settled for claimants,sometimes before suit has been filed. Boundary law suits have been tried in several differentcounties. Both claimants and manufacturers have employed Hal in products liability suits. email hthurston@simonlaw.com Home Page |Our Firm |Our Practice |Clients Robert A. Carmichael |Steven J.

Its history is one of significant accomplishments. Among the mostillustrious are the establishment of the relationship between paresis andthe spirochete responsible for syphilis, the creation of the keyexperimental animal model for the study of epilepsy, the first psychiatricresearch program in genetics in the country, the introduction to the U.S.of lithium carbonate, which has been the most successful treatment ofmanic-depression, and the completion of DSM-III, the official diagnosticmanual of the American Psychiatric Association. Renowned for its past achievements, it continues to make contributions tothe understanding of mental disorders, to the care of people with mentaldisabilities, and to the prevention of mental disease.

Department of Psychiatry Faculty Profiles Psychiatry News If you have any questions or comments please E-mail us at: webgroup@rf1.cpmc.columbia.edu RESEARCH More than three hundred biological, behavioral, and social reseachstudies are being conducted at Psychiatric Institute. A view of the Institute at any given time will reveal laboratorytechnicians in the neuroscience laboratories examining the serotoninprotein, which facilitates communication between neurons in the brain. Afew floors below, clinical histories are being recorded in the DepressionEvaluation Service to determine whether a patient suffers from chronicendogenous depression, atypical depression where some capacity forpleasure remains, or from another variant of depressive disorder.Clinical psychopharmacologists, just down the hall, discuss with cautiousoptimism the efficacy of a drug which seems to curb the craving forcigarette smoking, while their neighbors weigh the advantages of usingantidepressant medication in the treatment of bulimia. Not far away, in the Anxiety Disorders CLinic, patients who have foryears been virtually housebound because of the fear of public places(agoraphobia) are discovering that within a few months of combinedtreatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and psychotherapy they canresume normal activities. In the developmental psychobiology laboratories of the Lawrence C. KolbResearch Laboratory Building, the 14 story annex of PsychiatricInstitute, scientists are observing the behavior of infant rats separatedfrom their mothers. They have concluded that premature maternaldeprivation produces a collection of adverse physiological and behavioralresponses whose long-term effects may include vulnerability to disease. In the Howard Hughes Institute in Molecular Neurobiology and Behavior,established at P.I. because of the widely recognized scientific strengthsof its researchers in neuroscience, the simple nervous cell structure ofthe marine snail, Aplysia, serves as the basis for extensive andinnovative investigations of the mechanisms of learning and memory. Some researchers in Child Psychiatry are investigating the use of drugs in treating hyperactive children; others are trying to make sense out of the rash of teen-age suicides that have plagued many communities recently. And, with the city as a laboratory, epidemiologists are examining data on the characteristics of the homeless population using New York City shelters; others are doing longitudinal studies of the course of mental illness in children. Sponsored research projects at P.I. totaling over twelve million dollars annually, are administered through the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene. Results from some of these projects will eventually produce breakthroughs as remarkable as those for which the Institute is already famous. EDUCATION and TRAINING The Institute provides psychiatric training for medical students from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and residency training for psychiatrists, including programs at the Creedmoor and Middletown Psychiatric Centers. A post-residency fellowship in public psychiatry trains psychiatrists who plan to pursue careers as leaders in public sector mental health. A fellowship program in Child Psychiatry and research fellowships in specialized areas are also offered here and at other state facitlities. Other training includes programs in psychology, social work, and nursing. CLINICAL SERVICES Committed to the community in which it is located, P.I.'s Washington Heights Community Service treats a total of 700 people a year at its outpatient and full-care inpatient units. Inpatient clinical services are also available to people participating in research programs. Special purpose outpatient clinics, combining research and treatment, serve close to 4,000 people annually from the entire metropolitan area. These range from a depression and attempted suicide clinic for children and adolescents to a sexual agression clinic engaged in reversing the aberrant habits of sexual offenders. The multi-disciplinary nature of Psychiatric Institute provides its scientists with the ideal environment for both independent and collaborative research and its students with ample opportunity to acquire the most sophisticated knowledge in the field.WT02-B10-155IA093-000995-B028-459http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/SEARCH.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072229 text/html 836HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:26:34 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 707 NYSPI - SEARCH ENGINE NYSPI - Search Engine Text to Search For: Boolean: ANDOR Case InsensitiveSensitive WT02-B10-156IA093-000995-B028-258http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/sitelist.txt 156.111.80.30 19970121072015 text/html 218HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:24:21 1997Content-Type: text/html Error 404 Unable to open the specified file httpd-info@glaci.comWT02-B10-157IA093-000995-B028-411http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PI_RSCH.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072201 text/html 11648HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:26:07 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 11517 Special Activities and Awards Special Activities and Awards New York State Office of Mental Health Seventh Annual Research Conference The lights may have gone out for several hours at the Desmond Hotel, where the Seventh Annual New York State Office of Mental Health Research Conference was taking place, but there was no blackout of information transfer! With only flashlights and candles to help them refer to their notes, presenters went right on with their talks and audiences stayed right in their seats. This was a group, stalwart and true to the service of research, who didn't disappoint Dr. John Oldham, Chief Medical Officer of the OMH, Director of Psychiatric Institute, and primary organizer of the Conference. The subject of violence took a large share of the spotlight at this conference, reflecting the concerns of American society today. In the first plenary session, Dr. Paul Fink, former President of the American Psychiatric Association, who heads the Albert Einstein Center for the Study of Violence, provided a sociological overview of violent behavior. He hardly needed to cite the grim statistics of the ever increasing numbers of assaultive crimes or of the huge amount of violence in what is considered entertainment. With little guidance from home, how are young people to resist the power and the glamour, false though they may be, of violent behavior as depicted by the media? He offered several strategies, ranging from gun control, environmental modifications, and demand for ethical standards in television, to a plea for every person in the audience to become an "enlightened witness," i.e., to take responsibility for just one child who may be suffering from abuse and, by so doing, validate that child's very existence. In a special presentation on the last day of the conference, Dr. John Mann, Psychiatric Institute's new Director of Neuroscience, citing many of the same statistics as Dr. Fink had, approached the issue of violence from a neurobiological point of view. Neurochemists from his and other laboratories have demonstrated that reduced levels of serotonergic activity are associated with aggressive and suicidal behavior. They are now exploring ways in which this information may help them in recognizing and treating high risk patients. Anatomists in his group see that lesions in the orbital prefrontal cortex seem to be involved in disinhibition and may lower the threshold for suicidal or aggressive behavior. The researchers are even looking at how cholesterol may play a role in regulating the serotonergic system. Even in the individual paper sessions, researchers concerned themselves with aspects of the problem of violence in society. For example, Dr. Gail Wasserman reported on the first year of her study of the younger brothers of teen-aged adjudicated delinquents, a study designed to determine what the predictors are for similar antisocial behavior in these children. Dr. Rene Hen, speaking from a basic science vantage point, described his work with gene-altered mice in which he studies the function of 5-HT1B in regulating aggressive behavior. The conference offers an enormous amount of information meant to enhance the knowledge and skills of mental health professionals from all over New York State. In addition to dozens of paper sessions and poster sessions, this year given by a considerable number of people from psychiatric centers in other parts of the United States as well as by researchers from throughout New York State, there were other venues for the exchange of information. There were open forums both for clinicians and researchers and for patients, families, patient advocates, and researchers. In fact, the Office of Mental Health has made a concerted effort to involve consumers of mental health services in the workings of the conference by inviting several of them to participate in the paper sessions, both as discussants and presenters. Still another feature of the conference which has helped to gain it national attention and importance is the broadcast via satellite television of a two-hour symposium wherein researchers describe aspects of their work and Dr. Oldham, as moderator, takes questions from listeners from as far away as Texas or as close as persons in the first row of the audience. This year, the speakers were Dr. Herbert Pardes, Dean of Columbia's medical school, Dr. Arnold Friedhof from the New York University medical school, Dr. Myrna Weissman, Psychiatric Institute's Director of Clinical Epidemiology, and Dr. Donald Klein, Director of Therapeutics at PI, who replaced Cornell's Dr. Jack Barchas, unable to come because of illness. All this does not convey the camaraderie and conviviality of the conference. Dr. Robert Cancro, Director of the Nathan Kline Psychiatric Institute, gave public credit to Dr. Oldham for this feeling at the Research Awards dinner the second evening. This year's honorees were Dr. Marvin Herz from the University of Rochester, Dr. Alexander Glassman from Psychiatric Institute, and Dr. Abel Lajtha from Nathan Kline's Center for Neurochemistry.

Kline Institute Psychiatric InstituteAnnual Scientific Conference In the last decade of the 20th century, it is not in the arts that we find the most innovative or imaginative work taking place, observed Dr. Eric Kandel at Psychiatric Institute's Annual Scientific Conference at Arden House in November, but in the sciences, particularly in neurobiology. Dr. Kandel, Director of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, was the after-dinner speaker at the conference and he once again dazzled the audience with his approach to what he called "the central unsolved issue in biology: the problem of the mind." Describing two forms of learning, the explicit and the implicit, he explained some of the brain mechanisms which transform short-term memory into long-term memory. Elegant reasoning and an imaginative leap into the future brought him to predict a "little red pill" which will enhance memory. The real revolution in the field of psychiatry, he stressed, is the merger between cognitive psychology and neuroscience which is invigorating scientists to explore cognition and emotion from the point of view of molecular biology, as exemplified by his laboratories. In fact, a talk given the following morning by a member of Psychiatric Institute's Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, Dr. Rene Hen, provided a glimpse of the "gene knock-out" strategy researchers are using in mice to chart specific changes in behavior that mimic human behavior. Dr. Hen's presentation followed an overview of studies from the neuroscience laboratories of Dr. John Mann. Dr. Mann and his colleagues are looking at aggression and suicide from a biological vantage point: on the one hand, they use imaging technology to localize impaired circuitry in the brain, and, on the other, they utilize chemical probes to explore such areas as the relationship of serotonin to high cholesterol. The Arden House Conference traditionally gives Institute researchers an opportunity to hear about the wide variety of studies being conducted by their colleagues. It opened this year with presentations covering some long-term studies. Dr. Rachel Klein, talking about anxiety and learning disorders in children, confirmed that childhood separation anxiety can result in panic disorder in adults, but learning disorders, often considered a risk factor for future psychopathology, do not necessarily result in psychiatric disorders in adults. Dr. Salvatore Mannuzza pointed out that children with Attention Deficit Disorder were more likely than controls to exhibit antisocial behavior, abuse alcohol and drugs, attain a lower level of academic success, and suffer affective disorders in adulthood. Dr. Susan Wolk, describing a longitudinal study of childhood depression, concluded that it is "recurrent and disabling over time." Reporting on new research, Dr. Jonathan Javitch spoke of the molecular level investigations of the binding sites of different antipsychotic drugs. Other reports of new research included a study by Dr. Sharon Schwartz which found no evidence of higher rates of disorder among the children of Holocaust survivors, and a Washington Heights study by Dr. Ann Stueve which found that stressful life events do not necessarily make depression worse unless they take place within three months before the onset of the disorder. Dr. Mitchell Nobler reported that ECT acutely decreases regional cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate, while Dr. Xavier Amador made the connection between schizophrenic patients' low insight into their illness and treatment non-compliance. As has been customary, the conference included a choice of six workshops during the afternoon session. And for the second year, posters provided additional information about other research projects currently underway at the Institute. The presentations with which the two-day meetings ended concerned the difficult-to-treat patient. As Dr. Zafar Sharif pointed out in the first talk on schizophrenia, the clinician must take the following steps in dealing with the refractory patient: carefully reconsider the diagnosis, ascertain whether medication dosage is adequate, assess compliance, and consider side effects. Dr. Steven Roose, talking about depression, added a consideration of the duration of treatment and the possible augmentation of standard treatment with other strategies. Once again, the success of the conference was in large part due to the work of the program committee, Drs. Stanley Bone, Francine Cournos, David Kahn, Judith Rabkin, and Stephen Rayport, and to the administrative coordinator, Ms. Myra Stewart. Departmental Awards The Tenth Edward J.

Stein, M.A., M.B., B.Ch., Chief of Psychiatric Research Jennie Kline, Ph.D., Research Scientist VI Maureen Durkin, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Bruce Levin, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Richard Neugebauer, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Ruth Ottman, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Research by Jennie Kline, Ph.D. on the causes of abnormal prenatal development through the study of spontaneous abortions of known karyotype and morphology has proceeded. The research has yielded a number of insights on determinants for spontaneous abortions of different karyotypes. During the past year, results for oral contraceptives were published, those for smoking are in press, and those for IUD use are in preparation. With funding from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Drs. Kline, Levin, Stein, Susser, Warburton, and Ms. Kinney are examining whether age at menopause varies with prior reproductive history. The study tests hypotheses regarding the role of accelerated reproductive aging in the occurrence of spontaneous abortions of different karyotypes and the timing of menopause. The fieldwork, now ongoing, draws on 625 women who enrolled in the previous case-control of karyotyped spontaneous abortions in 1974-1986. Concurrent with this study, Dr. Kline, together with Drs. Reuss, Levin, and Timor, carried out a pilot study to assess whether the numbers of growing ovarian follicles, as visualized by ultrasound, provide an indicator of reproductive age. This study, now complete, shows the numbers of antral follicles decline with age. Drawing on this result, Dr. Kline is planning a new study to test whether ovarian age, estimated from antral follicle counts, is related to selected reproductive outcomes. Dr. Kline, with Dr. Ng, has also been examining data from their study "Cocaine Abuse: Effect on Pregnancy and Newborn." Drawing on a data from nearly 400 pregnant women who provided hair samples for analysis for cocaine, they have recently shown that hair testing is far more sensitive in detecting cocaine exposure in the preceding six months than either report or urine testing. Analysis of associations with intrauterine growth retardation will begin shortly. The fieldwork for a subsequent study, "Neurodevelopment of Children Exposed to Cocaine In Utero," is drawing to a close. The study sought to follow-up 568 children, born in 1985-6 to cocaine exposed and unexposed mothers. Location of the infants has proven formidable; analyses will draw on about 190 children who were located and tested for neuropsychologic function. Dr. Ottman is continuing her investigation of genetic contributions to seizure disorders by studying families containing >3 persons with epilepsy, selected from her original database of 1,957 families of probands with epilepsy. Her research team is extending the 40 families into larger pedigrees by collecting additional information about seizure disorders in branches of the families that were not originally included in the study. The results of these investigations indicate that in a small proportion of families, the distribution of epilepsy appears consistent with an autosomal dominant genetic susceptibility. Dr. Ottman is pursuing this finding by undertaking genetic linkage analysis in these families, in order to identify and chromosomally localize genes that have a major effect on susceptibility. Dr. Ottman's research team is also continuing with analyses of the full dataset of 1,957 families, in order to unravel other features of the genetic epidemiology of seizure disorders. Recent studies with Dr. Nicole Schupf indicate reduced rates of reproduction in persons with epilepsy. Much of this reduction appears to be explained by reduced marriage rates, but even within marriage, live birth rates appear to be decreased after onset of epilepsy in affected women. Another set of studies is aimed at identifying clinically defined subgroups of epilepsy with high genetic risk. The results indicate significant heterogeneity in familial risks of epilepsy, and suggest that the influences on risk in offspring may differ from those in parents and siblings. Thus, risks were higher in relatives of probands whose epilepsy was idiopathic/cryptogenic or associated with neurodeficit than in relatives of probands with other etiologies. Among relatives of probands with symptomatic epilepsy (excluding neurodeficit), risks were not significantly higher than in general population. Parents and siblings, but not offspring, of probands with generalized onset seizures had higher risks than those of probands with partial seizures. Offspring, but not parents or siblings, of probands with onset prior to age 10 had higher risks than those of probands with later onset. Dr. Ottman has also recently undertaken research on the comorbidity of epilepsy and migraine headache. Her findings indicate that migraine and epilepsy are strongly associated: risk of migraine was 25% in persons with epilepsy, compared with only 12% in their relatives without epilepsy. This finding suggests that clinicians treating patients with either epilepsy or migraine should be sensitive to symptoms, and familiar with diagnostic and treatment principles of both disorders. The reasons for the association between the two disorders are unclear. The comorbidity does not appear to be explained by shared environmental risk factors, or a direct causal effect of one disorder on the other. Dr. Ottman is currently investigating the possible role of a shared genetic susceptibility to migraine and epilepsy. Dr. Neugebauer continued with analyses of data collected in the Miscarriage and Depression Study, with particular attention to the role of stressful events as a risk factor for chromosomally normal spontaneous abortion. He also completed analyses in a study examining the possible association between maternal and perinatal complications and suicide risk in offspring through linkage of New York City birth and death certificate data. Research by Dr. Neugebauer in two new areas was also commenced. He collaborated with researchers in the Department of Therapeutics' Biological Studies Unit in a series of investigations of the effect of prenatal exposure to famine and risk of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Second, Dr. Neugebauer, together with Drs. Wasserman and Bird in the Department of Child Psychiatry, is developing a study plan to integrate an epidemiologic investigation of the psychiatric consequences of urban children's exposure to violence and a treatment program to be offered in the school setting for symptomatic children. In this regard, Dr. Neugebauer has developed a measure of children's exposure to violence, as witnesses or victims, and a measure of post traumatic stress disorder suitable for children as young as eight. The latter measure uses cartoon figures and an accompanying caption to assess relevant areas of psychopathology. These two measures are being piloted in a study based at Harlem Hospital which focuses on eight- and nine-year-olds with prenatal exposure to cocaine. Dr. Bruce Levin has a long-standing interest in the intersection of statistical inference for discrete data and computational methods in statistics. This interest has resulted in the development of analytic methods for a variety of problems from a unified viewpoint (that of finite and infinite dimensional linear exponential families). A product of this work is the computing program for conditional maximum likelihood analysis of polychotomous outcome data. Dr. Levin also devotes time to the problem of applying general empirical Bayes methods to test homogeneity hypotheses in large sparse data sets. He works with Dr. Kline on a project to elucidate maternal age associations with trisomy, to define procedures for determining onset of peri-menopausal symptoms, and to study the natural changes in oöcyte pools. Dr. Levin is co-principal investigator in the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core of the HIV Center and, in this capacity, chairs a weekly consultation for the Center. Dr. Levin is Deputy Head of the Division of Biostatistics at the Columbia University School of Public Health. He is also Consulting Editor in Statistics for the American Journal of Public Health. Dr. Maureen Durkin's research included epidemiologic studies of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, epidemiology and prevention of pediatric injuries in northern Manhattan, and classification and frequency of disabilities resulting from severe injuries to children in central Harlem. Zena Stein, M.D. continued her research interests in studies of HIV infection, especially those relating to women and children, and in the epidemiology of mental retardation. In mental retardation, she participated in studies of the exposures to lead of women and children in Yugoslavia, led by Dr. Graziano. She also advised on a projected study of HIV infection in China, and consulted with the AIDS program at the Department of Health in Barcelona, Spain. Dr. Stein attended a meeting in Chicago as a consultant to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Oversight Committee on Project Begin. In addition to these activities, Dr. Stein continues as Co-Director of the HIV Center. Here her principal research efforts have been to study the epidemiology of perinatal HIV infection, including risks for maternal-infant transmission, factors involved in survival, and neuro- developmental effects on infected infants. With colleagues in the New York City Department of Health, she has clarified the protective role of uncomplicated Cesarean section in the transmission of HIV infection from mother to infants. In Durban, South Africa, she initiated a controlled trial of Vitamin A supplementation to HIV-infected infants; the result was fewer severe episodes of gastroenteritis in affected infants. One of her main activities is to explore preventive approaches to HIV infection in women, in particular the acceptability and effectiveness of the newly available woman's condom, and of the longer-established chemical barriers, mainly spermicides. A CDC-funded activity in Philadelphia, based on the sexually-transmitted disease clinics, will test the acceptability and the effects on recurrent infections of making a range of these options available to women. In 1994, Dr. Stein received the Physicians and Surgeons Distinguished Service Award from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She was invited to give a plenary session lecture on Methods Women Can Use at the Tenth International AIDS Conference in Yokohama, Japan. International activities have continued to play a major role among Dr. Stein's concerns. Dr. Stein continues to be the principal investigator in the Fogarty International Center-funded International Training Grant on Epidemiology Related to AIDS. Since 1993, several fellows have joined the Columbia programs for varying durations of time, both for the purpose of formal studies, and for designing epidemiological studies of HIV/AIDS in their home countries.

Klein, M.D., Director Michael R. Liebowitz, M.D., Director, Anxiety Disorders Clinic Abby J. Fyer, M.D., Co-Director, Anxiety Disorders Clinic Laszlo Papp, M.D., Director, Biological Studies Unit Frederic M. Quitkin, M.D., Director, Depression Evaluation Service The Department of Therapeutics is composed of four interactive divisions that have continued in their endeavors to evaluate, define and treat mood, anxiety and related disorders. As director of the department, Dr. Donald Klein provides scientific and administrative guidance on methodology, critical evaluation, and future directions of research. A mutual exchange of ideas and techniques among the researchers has provided for growth within each division as well as for collaborations within the department and with other departments in the Institute. Below, each clinic describes its research projects of the past year. Anxiety Disorders Clinic The Anxiety Disorders Clinic has continued its work to advance an understanding of the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Efforts have been particularly concentrated on panic disorder and agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety, hypochondriasis, post-traumatic stress disorder, and new areas of research activity involving the neuropsychiatric sequelae of Lyme disease, mixed anxiety and depression, and cross-cultural studies. The Hispanic Anxiety Disorders Clinic, which provides services to monolingual Spanish-speaking patients, was first opened for services in August 1990 as part of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. In September 1991, we received NIMH funding in the form of an administrative supplement to a Program Project Grant (PPG). The Hispanic Clinic has now become one of the components of the PPG, and has received funding to study the phenomena of ataques de nervios in our Hispanic population. Pilot studies of ataque de nervios completed in our clinic in this area have revealed unique findings. Our satellite clinic established for research and clinical activities in Staten Island continues to complement Freedom From Fear's presence in Staten Island. In July 1993, Dr. Brian Fallon added to our family of satellites by opening a clinic, in collaboration with the Family Medicine Center of the St. Joseph Medical Center, located in Stamford, Connecticut. A number of specific areas of study within the Anxiety Disorders CIinic have been quite active. Panic Disorder An open trial of the 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron was completed in the earlier part of the year, under the direction of Dr. Michael Liebowitz. Results from this pilot were so favorable that a multi-center, industry supported, double-blind efficacy trial was initiated, which confirmed our findings. A full Phase-III development program is now under way in which we are participating. Ondansetron may work faster and be better tolerated than existing anti-panic medication treatments. A multi-center trial of sertraline in panic disorder has also begun in our clinic. Dr. Franklin Schneier is directing an NIMH-funded study of the efficacy of another serotonergic medication, fluoxetine, in the treatment of panic disorder. This study, which compares fluoxetine to placebo and a standard medication, imipramine, is now in progress. Fluoxetine has become a commonly used medication for panic disorder even though controlled data are lacking. Related studies are examining the effects of long-term treatment and discontinuation of treatment. We have also completed a study of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in panic disorder. The study was designed to test the CO2 hypersensitivity model of panic disorder by chemically raising brain CO2 to see if patients accommodate over time with decreased panic attacks. Preliminary results with acetazolamide appear to be modest. Social Phobia Dr. Franklin Schneier completed an NIMH-funded double-blind study of moclobemide in social phobia. Moclobemide is an investigational MAO-A selective reversible MAO inhibitor which can be taken without dietary restrictions and has fewer adverse effects than standard MAOIs. However, in contrast to earlier findings, moclobemide in our study did not show potent effects in social phobia. A multi-center industry supported placebo-controlled trial also found results similar to ours. We and other investigators have already shown that the nonselective MAOI phenelzine is effective in social phobia. We are now testing the efficacy of the selective MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl in social phobia. Efficacy in the MAO-B selective range would support dopaminergic involvement in social phobia. To follow-up on their collaboration which demonstrated the efficacy of both phenelzine and cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) in social phobia, Dr. Liebowitz and Dr. Richard Heimberg of SUNY at Albany were recently funded to study the acute efficacy of combined phenelzine and CBGT in comparison to single component treatments and placebo. In the earlier study, phenelzine had a faster rate of onset and somewhat greater acute efficacy than CBGT, while CBGT effect appeared more durable following treatment discontinuation. It is hoped that the combined treatment would maximize the benefits of both individual therapies. Dr. Schneier is continuing to study the effect of anxiety disorders on functioning and the impact of treatment, important clinical issues with implications for third party reimbursement. We also have pioneered the study of social phobia in subjects whose symptoms are secondary to medical disabilities such as familial intention tremor, stuttering, etc. A diagnostic classification and assessment study of secondary social phobia is now being developed. A recent study of social phobia symptoms among stutterers suggests that social phobia is a problem for a sizeable subgroup and that much of the functional impairment experienced by stutterers may be attributable to the severity of social phobia symptoms. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Dr. Randall D. Marshall is currently conducting an open trial of paroxetine for post-traumatic stress disorder. He is developing a psychotherapy research program for PTSD, and is also collaborating on a feasibility study of long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at Columbia. He is also investigating the incidence and relevance of childhood trauma in persons with anxiety disorder, a study which was made possible through a grant from the Sara Chait Foundation. Additionally, Dr. Marshall has received funding, in the form of a Basic Science Research Grant (BRSG) to assess the therapeutic alliance and personality in panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder in patients receiving medication and psychotherapy treatments. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) In collaboration with Dr. Edna Foa of the Medical College of Pennsylvania, we are nearing completion of an NIMH-supported double-blind, placebo-controlled study of clomipramine and behavioral therapy, a very important study for the field as a whole. Dr. Fallon and Dr. Liebowitz completed their double-blind, placebo-controlled study of intravenous clomipramine (CMI) for patients with refractory OCD. The data indicate that the administration of CMI intravenously is safe and significantly more effective than IV placebo in these oral CMI refractory OCD patients. The improvement increased during the four-week non-blind evaluation period after the last infusion. These data suggest that IV CMI is an effective treatment for oral CMI refractory patients. Dr. Liebowitz and colleagues in adult and child psychiatry have received funding from the Eli Lilly Company to complete an NIMH-funded comparison of fluoxetine and placebo in child and adolescent OCD. Somatoform Disorders Dr. Fallon, Director of the Somatic Disorders Program, continues to conduct a placebo-controlled study of fluoxetine for patients with hypochondriasis. Redefined as having "Heightened Illness Concern," hypochondriacs are being recruited in New York, Staten Island, and at the St. Joseph Hospital Family Medicine Center. Dr. Fallon also received a grant to expand his somatoform studies to include a study of subthreshold somatization disorder, using hypnotic suggestion and imipramine vs. placebo. These somatoform studies are supported by grants to Dr. Fallon from the NIMH and a Psychiatric Institute Research Scientist Grant (PIRSG). Lyme Disease Studies of the neuropsychiatric aspects of Lyme disease have continued under the direction of Dr. Fallon. In collaboration with the Department of Child Psychiatry, studies are being conducted assessing psychopathology among children with neurologic late Lyme disease. Studies of psychopathology among adults with Lyme are also in progress. In collaboration with Dr. Prohovnik and Dr. Mann of the Department of Neuroscience, studies of adults with Lyme encephalopathy are being conducted with neuropsychological assessments and brain imaging both before and after repeated antibiotic treatment. The results from these studies will have a significant impact upon the treatment of this illness. These studies are supported by grants to Dr. Fallon from the Lyme Research Foundation, the Marvel Platoff Foundation, the American Suicide Foundation, and a PIRSG. Ataque de Nervios We have completed several studies of ataque de nervios, a label applied by Hispanics to a variety of emotional states involving loss of emotional control. We have found that in a clinical sample with anxiety and depression, ataque de nervios is often applied to what we would diagnose as panic attacks. CO2 challenge studies are planned to verify this. In addition, ataque symptoms seem to differ in patients with different psychiatric comorbidity, suggesting that ataque self-labeling may reflect features of coexisting psychiatric illness. Staten Island Research Clinic The Staten Island Research Clinic located at Freedom From Fear in Staten Island continues to conduct research in the areas of depression, anxiety, and child psychiatric disorder. Sharon Davies, R.N. is our on-site clinic coordinator. St. Joseph Medical Center In July 1993, Dr. Fallon established a collaboration with the Family Medicine Center of the St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Connecticut. Dr. Robert Feinstein, director of the Behavioral Medicine Program there, and Dr. Joseph Connelly, director of the Family Medicine Center, consider this collaboration an opportunity to conduct state-of-the-art research on hypochondriasis and somatization in the primary care setting. Donna Vermes, R.N. is our on-site clinic coordinator. Depression Evaluation Service The Depression Evaluation Service (DES) is a research clinic whose major goal is the identification of different subtypes of depressive disorders and of specific psychopharmacological treatment for these subtypes. We continue to study "atypical" depression, further refining the criteria. We are continuing the study comparing fluoxetine, imipramine, and placebo in atypical depressives. We anticipate that SSRIs will be as effective in this disorder as MAOIs. We have studied 120 patients and are at the halfway mark of this study. During 1994, the DES completed a study of alcoholics with primary depression who were randomized to either imipramine or placebo treatment. The results are being prepared for publication and show that depression in alcoholics is treatable and when it responds, it is associated with decreases in drinking behavior. We then began a follow-up study with a similar design using fluoxetine (Prozac). Twenty patients have completed the study so far and Prozac is showing evidence of good safety and tolerability. The number of patients studied is too small to draw any conclusions about benefits as yet. This study is funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). A pilot study was conducted randomly assigning non-depressed alcoholics to naltrexone (Trexan) or placebo. Nineteen patients have completed this study which shows excellent benefits for the active drug. This confirms two control studies in the literature in other populations of alcoholic patients. A pilot study of measurement of receptors on platelet membranes in depressed patients was also begun. Preliminary data have been collected on a sample of normal control subjects as well as a sample of patients entering depression studies. The hope of this study is to confirm previous observations that platelet markers are abnormal in depressed patients and to explore whether this abnormality predicts treatment outcome. If this proves to be predictive, this would be the basis for submitting a grant application. In the past year, we have received NIH funding to assess the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy in HIV+ men with late stage illness. The clinical syndrome included loss of sexual desire with or without sexual dysfunction, often accompanied by low mood, low energy, low appetite, weight loss, and sometimes wasting. The study consists of 12 weeks of open treatment followed by a six-week double blind placebo controlled discontinuation trial. To date, of the first 81 men whose data have been analyzed, 85% of study completers were clear-cut responders in terms of androgenic effect. Of the 44 study completers who had mood problems at baseline, 64% were rated as much improved. Another study, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Lange's Virology Lab at Roosevelt/ St. Luke's Hospital, is assessing the in vitro effects of testosterone cypionate on viral activity. This study is ongoing, and some pilot work is planned regarding possible extension to women with AIDS and clinical symptomatology. We are in the third year of a five-year study of the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in treatment of Axis I depressive disorders in HIV+ men and women. To date, we are getting an excellent response to both active and placebo medication. We completed studies of the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in methadone maintenance patients in collaboration with two community methadone clinics, Bridge Plaza Treatment Center (Ronald Brady, Clinic Director and Co-Investigator, and Long Island Jewish/Hillside Hospital). Activities of 1994 include the following accomplishments: * Detailed data analysis on the imipramine versus placebo trial in depressed methadone patients, completed in the previous year, shows a robust antidepressant effect on mood outcome, and more modest effects on drug use. * A study of the power of the locally developed SCID-Substance Abuse Comorbidity version to predict remission of depression during methadone induction was completed and data analysis is underway. * The NIDA awarded funding on an RO1 for four years for a placebo-controlled trial of sertraline in depressed methadone patients (Dr. Nunes, Principal Investigator). * The NIDA awarded funding on a Center grant for medications development (Dr. Herbert Kleber, Principal Investigator) on which Dr. Nunes is Principal Investigator of Project 3, which involves a series of pharmacotherapy clinical trials for cocaine abuse. Biological Studies Unit The Biological Studies Unit (BSU) serves as a centralized research laboratory at Psychiatric Institute. The BSU provides well-maintained, state-of-the-art equipment and highly skilled technicians to investigators throughout the Institute and the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Since 1984, the BSU has also been part of the Mental Health Clinical Research Center (MHCRC). In addition to providing facilities, equipment, and staff to investigators funded by federal and private agencies, the BSU, as one of the arms of the MHCRC, runs its own research program with the main focus on the psychobiology of anxiety disorders. The BSU maintains a sophisticated pulmonary laboratory capable of recording and analyzing on-line respiratory rate, tidal volume, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, oxygen consumption CO2 production on a breath-by-breath basis. Monitoring of respiration in ambulatory patients is also available. Aided by several ongoing RO1 grants, a series of respiratory challenges such as CO2 inhalation, hyperventilation, and breathing against increased airway resistance have been developed and perfected over the past several years. Respiratory challenges have also been conducted under "tryptophan depletion" condition and during varying "cognitive" environment. These methodologies led to an increasingly accurate description of the prominent respiratory abnormalities seen in panic disorder patients. As one of the four sites for the largest NIMH-sponsored treatment study of panic disorder, the BSU has made it possible to monitor the respiratory status of hundreds of panic disorder patients before and after medication and psychotherapy. Preliminary results indicate significant medication but not psychotherapy effects. The respiratory laboratory has also been utilized to assess the pulmonary physiology of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and depression. The established safety of these respiratory procedures prompted investigators to test children and adolescents with anxiety disorders as well. The inclusion of the elderly with anxiety disorders is the subject of a recently submitted RO1 grant from the BSU. The longitudinal approach of examining the physiology of anxiety disorders through the lifespan is a major strength of this program. In addition to conducting studies in anxiety disorders, the BSU continues to accommodate research in depression, seasonal affective disorder, schizophrenia, HIV neuropsychiatry, drug abuse, and eating disorders. Newly proposed projects are reviewed for scientific merit and approved protocols are done. One of the greatest strengths of the BSU is that it allows investigators to conduct projects without having to invest in expensive technologies or in training new technical staff. In 1994, after 10 years of directing the BSU, Dr. Jack Gorman became Deputy Director of Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Laszlo Papp, formerly Assistant Director of the BSU, was promoted to Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Director. Dr. Jeremy Coplan was named Assistant Director. Drs. Papp and Coplan are both supported by Scientist Development Awards from NIMH.

Mellman, M.D., Associate Director, Residency Training Jules Ranz, M.D., Director, Public Psychiatry Fellowship James Ryan, M.D. and Stephen Hyler, M.D., Educational Research Laboratory Mark Sorenson, M.D., Director, Columbia University Program for Creedmoor Residency Training Educational Programs at Columbia University The Department of Postgraduate Psychiatric Education directs residency training in the core program at Psychiatric Institute (PI) and Presbyterian Hospital (PH), training for affiliated residency programs at Creedmoor and Middletown, research training in clinical research, and the Fellowship in Public Psychiatry. It also directs the weekly Grand Rounds at Psychiatric Institute, and oversees the use of the audio-visual resources of the Educational Research Laboratory. Reports from the component sections of the department follow. Medical Student Education Residency Training-the Core Program There are now 49 psychiatric residents in the adult psychiatry program. Eleven PGY I's, 14 PGY II's, 13 PGY III's, and 11 PGY IV's. Two adult psychiatry residents entered the Child Psychiatry Fellowship upon completing their PGY III year, one resident as part of the five- year Child and Adult Psychiatry Program, and the other as a Child Psychiatry Fellow. In June 1993, 14 psychiatric residents graduated from the Adult Psychiatry Program. Ten graduates remain affiliated with the department in some capacity. Their careers continue to reflect the diversity of departmental activities and of the educational program: two entered research fellowships at PI, two entered Public Psychiatry Fellowships at PI, two continued in the joint Child and Adult Psychiatry Program at PI, one entered the Consultation-Liaison Fellowship at PH, and three took clinical positions-one at PI and two at PH. Two of the above graduates also became candidates at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. Four residents left the Institute: one for a clinical/research position at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, one for a research position at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, one for a clinical position at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, and one for a child psychiatry fellowship at Brown University. Although recruitment into psychiatry has fallen, the residency continues to attract the highest quality medical students. With more than ten times the number of applicants than available positions, the department has been able to be very selective in its recruitment process. The residents who began their PGY I year in July 1994 continue to represent a cross-section of interests and achievement from research to clinical perspectives and reflect an increase in the recruitment of Asian residents. The credit for this success in attracting excellent applicants goes to the faculty, the educational program, and the exceptional reputation of the department. The residents who began the five-year Child and Adult Psychiatry Program in 1991 entered the child psychiatry portion as PGY IV's in July 1994. Two PGY III's, one PGY II, and two PGY I's are in this track. The participants in this combined track continue to be enthusiastic. Beginning in July 1994, a new research track was offered to four residents. This track includes a PGY I rotation at the Creedmoor Schizophrenia Research Unit, a PGY II rotation on the PI 7 clinical research unit, and devoted time for research in the PGY III and IV years. This track was highly successful in recruiting excellent residents interested in research beginning in 1994. Even more applicants applied for this track in 1994 to begin training in 1995. Program in Clinical Research Training Four fellows completed training in clinical research in June 1994. Two have remained at Columbia, the other two at Cornell. In July, 13 fellows began or continued in programs supported by this department. The eight in the NIMH Fellowship in Affective, Anxiety, and Related Disorders were distributed as follows: one in anxiety disorders and seven in affective disorders. Five are pursuing schizophrenia research training. Even with the many positions available for research training, other excellent applicants are turned away. The department received an excellent score on its application for continued NIMH support of both the Fellowship in Affective, Anxiety, and Related Disorders and the Fellowship in Schizophrenia Research. Fellowship Program in Public Psychiatry The Public Psychiatry Fellowship Training Program continues to attract an increasing quality of Fellows. The program is now acknowledged to be the premier fellowship of its type in the country, receiving applicants in the past few years from Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and New Mexico. The 1994-95 class consists of nine fellows, including one Mead-Johnson Fellow, four chief residents, and two residents each from Psychiatric Institute and Payne Whitney. This year three Fellows are working in non-traditional community service agencies-Housing Works, the Association to Benefit Children, and Hamilton-Madison House. Two Fellows are involved in supportive residential services at St. Luke's/Roosevelt and Middletown Psychiatric Center. One Fellow is at the Washington Heights Community Service, and one is at St. Vincent's Hospital. Of special interest is a collaboration with the Bisexual, Lesbian, and Gay Fellowship at Bellevue Hospital, involving two Fellows, one as coordinator of that program. The most recent survey of alumni (June 1994) confirms continued success in placing and retaining graduates in key roles in the public sector. Ninety-two percent are working actively in publicly-funded services, and over 55% have management positions. As evidence of the high academic standing of our graduates, 83% hold academic appointments. The Public Psychiatry Fellowship is completing the final year of a three-year SAMHSA training grant paying partial support for one Fellow each year. Dr. Ranz, Director of the Public Psychiatry Fellowship Program, is President (1995-96) of the New York Regional Chapter of the American Association of Psychiatric Administrators. The most important event for the Fellowship this year was the recruitment of Dr. Sara Kellermann as a member of the Fellowship faculty. Dr. Kellermann's special perspective, gained from her experience as New York City Department of Mental Health Commissioner from 1980-90, has added greatly to the quality of seminar discussions. Other additions to the voluntary faculty include Drs. Lew Opler, Paula Panzer, and Ruth Graver. The latter two are the first graduates of the program to become members of the Fellowship faculty. Creedmoor and Middletown Residency Programs The Columbia-Creedmoor Residency Training Program continued to expand it's programs. Currently there are 17 psychiatric residents in the program: three PGY-I's, four PGY-II's, five PGY-III's, four PGY-IV's, and one PGY-V chief resident. The Columbia portion of the curriculum provides comprehensive training in psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. There are also extensive clinical rotations at CPMC. The continued development of the Schizophrenia Research Unit Staff at Creedmoor has also benefitted the residency program. These changes have had clear effects on residents' performance and recruitment. For four years, Creedmoor has been a site for third-year Columbia medical student rotations in psychiatry. The development of the rotation is further evidence of Columbia's confidence in the level of training and clinical experience available at Creedmoor. In addition, Presbyterian Hospital has over recent years hired several Creedmoor residency graduates. Currently 20 Creedmoor staff hold Columbia faculty positions. The Columbia-Middletown Residency Training Program provides approximately 200 classroom hours for an average of seven Middletown Hospital residents and ancillary personnel. The curriculum is varied and utilizes the efforts of 40 different faculty members. The staff provides broad exposure to the biological and clinical sciences. The students have been dedicated, reliable, and highly complimentary about the program. Educational Research Laboratory The Education Research Audio-Visual Lab provides ongoing recording, playback, and editing services to all educational departments in Psychiatric Institute. The Friday Departmental Grand Rounds are being videotaped and are available for viewing, or borrowing, from the PI Library.

Marcus, M.D., Director, Undergraduate Psychiatric Education Janis Cutler, M.D., Associate Director The Department of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry at the New York State Psychiatric Institute is responsible for approximately 500 medical students in six affiliated hospitals including New York State Psychiatric Institute and Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Harlem Hospital Center, and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. We supervise a teaching curriculum at the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons that extends throughout the four years of medical school on a year round basis. The department is also responsible for helping to develop the whole medical school curriculum. We also are generating research in medical education-organization, curriculum, and the developmental processes of medical students in their training. The division is administered by Dr. Eric R. Marcus, Director, Dr. Janis Cutler, Associate Director, and Ms. Edith White, Administrator. Program development and the organization of teaching and research are done by the central staff. The teaching is done by the full-time and voluntary faculty of the Department of Psychiatry. Because we are one of the largest teaching departments of psychiatry in the world, we are able to offer teaching programs of a wide range and considerable depth. Undergraduate Psychiatry Curriculum The first-year course in psychiatry at the medical school begins with psychopathology. Although this is heuristically illogical, the research in our division has shown that medical students' identification with physicians starts very early in their training and is the major motivating factor for their learning. Therefore, clinical psychiatrists teach this course, the students see patients immediately, and the focus is on illness. The course thereby provides students with one of their first introductions to patient care and to the general principles of interviewing. This course was rated outstanding for the fourth year in a row and in the past few years has been one of the highest rated courses in the first year of medical school. The second-year course continues the teaching of psychopathology, adds a developmental context and, in addition, provides an introduction to different types of therapy. Students continue to see patients. Small group discussion follows every lecture. This year, the end of the course coincided with Department of Medicine courses on medical interviewing and physical examination. The students therefore received a combined psychiatric-medicine experience integrating information in techniques in the two fields. The student ratings for this course continue to be higher than ever before. Our third-year psychiatry clerkship, five weeks in length, remains our most intensively supervised course and is the most demanding of faculty time. Student ratings consistently place it among the highest of the clinical clerkships at the medical school. Because of changes in hospital services, this course has required continued administrative attention to keep the quality of the experience high. This year, Dr. Joel Solomon revamped third-year teaching at St. Luke's-Roosevelt and Henry McCurtis made changes at Harlem Hospital. These changes were enthusiastically received by the students and faculty. Affiliated hospital teaching sites have struggled to do their best amidst the health care funding crisis. A major part of our job this year has been to rally enthusiastic support among full-time and voluntary faculty so that teaching remains a high priority. Our fourth-year electives continue to provide the broadest range of experience in clinical and research psychiatry. The electives attract top Columbia students as well as students from other medical schools around the country and the world. The College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, having successfully won a large Robert Wood Johnson Medical Education grant, has entirely reshaped the first two years of the medical school curriculum providing a model for American medical education in the 21st century. The new curriculum involves broadening the base of medical education from the basic medical sciences to include epidemiological sciences and the human behavioral sciences. The new curriculum attempts to integrate all three sciences with clinical work beginning in the first year. The Department of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry has played a major role in providing relevant pedagogical theory, in organizing subsections of teaching, and in implementing the teaching program of this demonstration project. This new curriculum is now in its second year and has been greeted with great excitement by the faculty and students. As part of that new effort, we participated in the development of a new clerkship in family practice which started this year most successfully. In addition, a mentoring program was started to provide on-going support to students during their medical school years. Research Projects Research focusing on the emotional process of becoming a doctor continued with application to the curriculum of knowledge about student identification processes. We are using this research information to plan course content, sequence, and pedagogical style. Research was also begun in exploring the reasons for and against career choice in psychiatry by medical students. Research was also begun on substance abuse epidemiology among medical, dental, and nursing students. Awards Dr. Cutler won an award as outstanding woman doctor of the year from the American Medical Women's Association branch at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also won the American Psychiatric Association's Roeske Certificate of Excellence in medical student education. Outcome measures of the education program remain high with students performing above average on national board exams, with student reviews of courses in psychiatry in the excellent to outstanding range.

Cooper, M.A., Chief of Psychiatric Research Amiram I. Barkai, Ph.D., Research Scientist VI Basalingappa L. Hungund, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Ee-sing Lo, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Raymond F. Suckow, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV The Department continues its involvement in all clinical psychopharmacological research protocols involving drug, drug metabolites, and endogenous compounds of current interest in biological psychiatric research. The laboratory is currently the core laboratory for two NIMH center grants (Drs. Klein and Mann) and one NIDA center grant (Dr. Kleber). Analytical development work during the past year has involved assay of neurotransmitters and metabolites in urine, plasma, and spinal fluid in studies of aggression and stress in adolescents and adults. Neuroendocrine response studies to challenge medication e.g. fenfluramine, mCPP, methylphenidate, pindolol, etc. have been evaluated as probes into serotonergic and other neurotransmitter responsivity. Studies involve assays of drugs and metabolites, melatonin, growth hormone, cortisol, prolactin, dexamethasone, catecholamine, indolamines, platelet binding analysis of drugs have been completed. This aspect of the workload is the responsibility of Ms. Novacenko, Ms. Fein, Ms. Huttinot, and Mr. Green. Dr. Raymond Suckow has received a second grant-in-aid from Ciba-Geigy Corp. to begin another phase of a pharmacokinetic study of reserpine comparing two formulations at a reduced dose. The application of a highly sensitive HPLC method previously developed in this laboratory and further modified to enhance the sensitivity (femtomole) permitted the monitoring of the elimination of reserpine in human subjects for several days following a single dose. Studies involving the isolation, identification, and quantitation of the major metabolite of bupropion were performed using a highly specialized semi-preparative chiral column. Both isomers were isolated and the optical rotation of each was determined. A purity >97% was achieved which will permit future in vitro and in vivo biological testing. This work was supported in part by a Psychiatric Institute Research Support Grant. New analytical procedures and modifications of existing methods were applied to the quantitation of risperidone and the 9-hydroxy metabolite, and paroxetine in anticipation of future clinical studies and grant applications. Other drug assays performed on a routine schedule included, but were not limited to, fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, as well as the tricyclic antidepressants and their respective active metabolites. Dr. Hungund continues his NIMH-supported research in attempting to understand the biochemical mechanisms of alcohol tolerance and dependence. We have extended these studies to examine the possibility of the existence of multiple forms of phospholipase PLA2 specific for selected phospholipids in the plasma membrane. Based on these ongoing studies, we believe this key enzyme may play an important role in adaptation mechanism to various amounts of alcohol consumption. Similarly acyltransferases responsible for the incorporation of acyl groups into lysopholipids generated by activation of PLA2s appear to be involved in repair mechanism. Our results so far indicate that both substrate specific PLA2s and acyltransferases exist in CNS membrane and that both enzymes are affected differentially in response to various doses of alcohol exposure in adult mice. The results of studies on the mechanism of fetal alcohol affects (FAE) are very encouraging. We have shown an aberrant ganglioside profile in the fetal brain that was exposed to alcohol in utero on GD7 and 8. We have also shown that similar alcohol exposure led to accumulation of FAEEs, nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol, in various fetal organs. FAEEs are implicated in organ injury in chronic alcoholics. It is also interesting to note that treatment of pregnant rats prior to alcohol exposure prevented/reduced both aberrant ganglioside composition and FAEE accumulation. Thus GM1 may have a therapeutic value in prevention of fetal alcohol effects. In a collaborative study with Dr. Patrick McGrath, a marker for chronic alcohol abuse has been developed. Preliminary studies suggest that polyunsaturated FAEEs accumulate in significant amounts in the blood of alcohol abusers. Similar accumulation of FAEEs but of saturated origin are reported to be found in the blood of acutely intoxicated human subjects. Thus, these markers may serve as an useful tool in diagnosing chronic vs. social drinkers and also in monitoring patients undergoing detoxification since no FAEEs are formed in the absence of alcohol in the system. Dr. Barkai has continued his studies on the effects of haloperidol on calcium binding in localized areas of the rat brain. The results indicate that pretreatment of rats with this psychoactive drug enhanced calcium binding in several limbic structures, particularly in the hippocampus. These effects appear to be due to an increase in binding affinity involving cooperativity to calcium binding. Dr. Barkai is currently engaged in a study of the effects of several antidepressants on the dynamics of local cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the rat following electrically-induced cerebral activation. These studies are designed to test the hypothesis that continuous treatment with antidepressants would cause differential alterations in rCBF responses to activating stimuli. Preliminary results indicate that the magnitude of rCBF responses to a single electroshock treatment and their return to 'baseline' values, varied in different brain regions. In some regions, the rate of decay of rCBF increments was significantly slower in rats treated with antidepressants. Such a slower decay in rCBF responses represents a compensatory increase in rCBF that is present for a longer period of time in treated animals. These preliminary results provided a basis for a grant application entitled "Local Cerebral Blood Flow and Antidepressants." In addition, Dr. Barkai has continued the collaboration with Dr. Hungund in studies on the acylation and deacylation of neuronal membrane phospholipids. These studies are aimed at understanding mechanisms of ethanol effects on the nervous system. Dr. Lo has focussed upon the development of highly sensitive HPLC techniques for the assay of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in human plasma, spinal fluid, and urine. These procedures are currently being applied to an NIMH-funded study of stress in heart transplant patients (Drs. Shapiro, Sloane, Liaison Psychiatry). Dr. Lo has also published studies on the pharmacokinetics of betamethasone using transdermal patches. This work was made possible because Dr. Lo had developed a highly sensitive polyclonal antibody to dexamethasone which cross-reacted with betamethasone. After optimizing the assay for betamethasone we were able to obtain full kinetic profiles of this compound formulation for the first time. Dr. Lo, in collaboration with Dr. K.S. Hui (NKI), has pursued his long standing interest in enkephalins. A NIDA-funded study has resulted in the purification of brain Arg0-Met5- enkephalin to homogeneity with further identification by RIA, ELISA, HPLC, micro- sequencing, inhibition of amino-enkephalinase and suppression of contraction of vas deferens. Results indicate that this peptide is an immediate precursor and endogenous inhibitor of met-enkephalins. Mr. Trivedi has developed an assay for the stereoisomers of methylphenidate in plasma. The assay has picogram/ml sensitivity and is suitable for application in studies in children (collaboration with Dr. Greenhill). The unit continues to collaborate with investigators within the medical school and at many academic research centers in the USA, Canada, and Israel. The development of mass spectrometric procedures for cocaine and its five major metabolites in plasma, tissue, and other body fluids has made possible a NIDA-funded collaboration with Dr. Morishima (Department of Anesthesiology) investigating the hemodynamics and behavioral response to cocaine and cocaethyl in the pregnant sheep and rat. This study includes investigation of the pharmacokinetics of maternal-fetal and fetal-maternal transport of these toxic compounds. Collaborative work on clozapine blood levels and therapeutic response has been most productive. Two separate studies (Dr. Potkin of the University of California at Irvine and Dr. Lieberman of Hillside Hospital, Long Island Jewish Hospital) have demonstrated threshold blood levels above which clinical response is optimal. This has major importance in the management of clozapine treatment in this difficult treatment-refractory population.

Sackeim, Ph.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research D.P. Devanand, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II Mitchell S. Nobler, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II Joan Prudic, M.D., Psychiatrist II James R. Moeller, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Bobba J. Moody, M.S.W., Research Scientist III Yakov Stern, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV During 1994, the department conducted clinical and basic research in a variety of areas. This work involved clinical populations with major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, acute mania, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, stroke, and other psychiatric and neurological populations. The department provided primary clinical services through its Memory Disorders Center, Huntington's Chorea Center, Late Life Depression Center, Electroconvulsive Therapy Service, and inpatient depression subunit. The department also provides the clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) service at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Federal funding was continued from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for research on the affective and cognitive consequences of electroconvulsive therapy (Principal Investigator: Dr. Sackeim; Co-Principal Investigators: Drs. Devanand and Prudic), continuation pharmacological treatment following response to ECT (Principal Investigator: Dr. Sackeim; Co-Principal Investigator: Dr. Prudic), and the treatment of psychosis and behavioral disturbance in Alzheimer's disease (Principal Investigator: Dr. Devanand). The MERIT Award to Dr. Sackeim on the affective and cognitive consequences of ECT was renewed for another five years. The conclusion of this next funding period will represent 20 years of continuous research aimed at improving this form of treatment. New R01 support was received from the National Institute of Mental Health for a study of the predictors of questionable dementia (Principal Investigator: Dr. Devanand). Many older individuals report deficits in their cognitive functioning, but it is often difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in such cases. This study uses functional and structural brain imaging and neuropsychological measures to identify early signs of incipient Alzheimer's disease. This project received a supplement to add MRI measures of hippocampal atrophy as another predictor. Another new R01 from the National Institute of Mental Health concerns the pharmacological treatment of dysthymia in the elderly (Principal Investigator: Dr. Devanand). This work involves a random assignment, placebo-controlled trial, assessing the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine as treatment for chronic mild depression in late life. The study is conducted in the Late Life Depression Research Center. The National Institute of Aging (NIA) continued support for a large program project grant on the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease in Northern Manhattan (Principal Investigator: Dr. Mayeux), for a study of the predictors of the course of Alzheimer's disease (Principal Investigator: Dr. Stern), and for the Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Research Center (Principal Investigator: Dr. Shelanski). NIA funding continued for a project on the neuropathology of schizophrenia, involving collaborations among the Divisions of Brain Imaging and Neuropathology and Neurotoxicology, and the Department of Biological Psychiatry (Principal Investigator: Dr. Prohovnik). The department is also participating in the center grant from the Memory Loss and Aging Consortium of the Charles A. Dana Foundation (Center Directors: Drs. E. Kandel and R. P. Rowland), with Drs. Mayeux and Sackeim each as principal investigators on projects within the center. New findings to emerge in this research included the first demonstration that pre-existing cognitive impairment in the context of major depression predisposes to more severe and persistent amnesia following ECT. Dr. Sackeim was named an Honorary Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, the Jules Roth Scholar in Residence at the State University of New York in Purchase, and he received the Joel Elkes International Award from the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. The following sections highlight the new research conducted in the Huntington's Chorea Center and the Memory Disorders Center. Huntington's Disease Center The Huntington's Disease Center at the New York State Psychiatric Institute was opened in October 1991 to offer diagnostic, treatment, and counseling services to Huntington's disease patients and families. Services include neurological, neuropsychological, and psychiatric assessments as well as social work services. Since its inception, the Center has served over 100 people and their families and is actively following approximately 70 patients, making this Center one of the largest in the country. The Center is staffed by two neurologists, a psychiatric attending and resident, a nurse practitioner, and a social worker. Over the past three years training has been provided for two fellows in movement disorders, four psychiatric residents each spending six months in the Center, three genetic counseling students, and four social work graduate students. In 1993, Columbia University became part of the Huntington's Study Group, a group of 20 Centers throughout the United States and Canada who have created a collective database and systematic examination forms, with the goal of conducting large multi-center therapeutic interventions for Huntington's disease. Our Center has been an active participant in these efforts. As part of the Huntington's Study Group, we are currently participating in a phase II trial of OPC-14117, a powerful antioxidant, in a double-blind placebo-controlled, parallel design. This study is being conducted at the Irving Center for Clinical Research at Presbyterian Hospital. Memory Disorders Center The Memory Disorders Center continues to serve its role as a diagnostic and treatment center for dementia disorders. The center evaluates approximately 200 new patients yearly and has over 200 patients on its active follow-up roster at any time. Through its role as the primary diagnostic site for the Center for Alzheimer's Disease clinical core, the center serves as a referral resource for ongoing dementia research. To determine whether limited educational or occupational attainment are risk factors for incident dementia, 593 non-demented individuals age 60 or older in a registry of elders at-risk for dementia in North Manhattan were identified and followed for one to four years. The risk of dementia was increased in subjects with either low education (RR=2.02; 1.33-3.06) or low lifetime occupational attainment (RR=2.25; 1.32-3.84). Risk was greatest for subjects with both low education and low lifetime occupational attainment (RR=2.87; 1.32-3.84). The findings suggested that increased educational and occupational attainment may reduce the risk of incident AD, either by decreasing the ease of clinical detection of AD, or by imparting a reserve that delays the onset of clinical manifestations. We have also examined age at symptom onset of AD as a predictor of rate and pattern of cognitive decline. Forty-four early (onset before age 65) and 83 late onset patients were compared. Although early and late onset subjects were comparable at baseline for overall dementia severity on the modified Mini-Mental State exam, there was significantly more rapid decline in early onset subjects after two years of follow-up. The results provided longitudinal evidence of more rapid cognitive decline in subjects with early onset Alzheimer's disease, and suggest that early onset AD may be characterized by predominant impairment of attentional skills. To examine whether extrapyramidal signs (EPS) or psychotic features are associated with more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, 236 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease were recruited in three cities and followed semiannually. Using Cox proportional hazards models which adjusted for age, sex, disease severity, and estimated duration of illness at study entry, the presence of EPS at entry was associated with higher relative risk of reaching the endpoints of moderate cognitive impairment (RR=2.35, 95% CI=1.12-4.92) or severe functional impairment (2.31, 1.37-3.90), nursing home entry (2.51, 1.32-4.76), or death (3.04, 1.31-7.05). Psychosis predicted only the functional endpoint (1.85,1.18-2.90). This study confirmed that EPS and psychosis are robust predictors of disease endpoints and rapid progression in Alzheimer's disease.

Spitzer, M.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research Michael B. First, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) I Janet B.W. Williams, D.S.W., Research Scientist V Miriam Gibbon, M.S.W., Research Scientist IV Drs. Spitzer and Williams continue their work with a group of primary care physicians in the refinement of PRIME-MD (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders), a new procedure for diagnosing mental disorders in the primary care setting. During the past year, over four thousand primary care physicians have been trained in administering PRIME-MD. Utilizing the database from the PRIME-MD 1000 Study, Drs. Spitzer and Williams and their colleagues have investigated patterns of impairment in the domains of health-related quality of life (social, role and occupational functioning, mental health, bodily pain, and general health) to determine if different mental disorders have different patterns of impairment and how these patterns compare with those associated with general medical disorders. The results indicate that the most common types of disorders (mood, anxiety, alcohol, eating, and somatoform disorders) have distinctive patterns. Furthermore, the impairment associated with these mental disorders is far greater, in general, than that associated with common types of medical disorders. DSM-IV, the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, was published in May 1994. Several members of the department played major roles in its preparation. Dr. First served as Editor of Text and Criteria for DSM-IV, Dr. Spitzer was special advisor to the DSM-IV Task Force, and Dr. Williams was Chair of the Multiaxial Work Group. Dr. First has given numerous extensive workshops on using the new DSM-IV at a number of Office of Mental Health (OMH) facilities. In addition, a five-hour videotaped presentation by Dr. First has been distributed to all OMH facilities for the purpose of staff training. Dr. First is also serving as Editor of the DSM-IV-PC, a version of the DSM-IV for primary care clinicians. One of the most important products of the Biometrics Research department is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). The SCID is a diagnostic instrument that is widely used by researchers and clinicians in order to guide the diagnostic evaluation process. The introduction of the DSM-IV has necessitated a major revision of the SCID in order to update it for the new classification. This new version of the SCID also provides several new features to increase the instrument's usefulness. Drafts of the revised SCID were field tested at a number of research sites in order to elicit feedback. A final version of the SCID was made available at the end of the year. Dr. Williams has continued to collaborate in the analysis of data from the Psychosocial/Qualitative Assessment Core of the HIV Center. She and her colleagues have examined psychopathology in male and female intravenous drug users with and without HIV infection. They are currently exploring the relationship of personality pathology to the development of Axis I symptoms and disorders. Dr. Williams has also participated in the development of DSM-IV-PC as a member of the DSM-IV Primary Care Work Group. A major role of hers this year has been as Founding President of the Society for Social Work and Research, already 275 members-strong. She founded the organization to help build an infrastructure of supports and linkages for social workers who are interested in research. Dr. Williams is in charge of planning the first national social work research conference, which will be held in Washington, DC in April 1995.WT02-B10-166IA093-000995-B029-264http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_PY.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072712 text/html 10065HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:31:18 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 9935 Biopsychology Biopsychology John Gibbon, Ph.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research W. Crawford Clark, Ph.D., Research Scientist VI Gerard Bruder, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Michael Terman, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Steven Fairhurst, M.S., Research Scientist III James Towey, Ph.D., Research Scientist II Using behavioral, cognitive, and physiological measures, the Biopsychology department continues its central mission to investigate brain-behavior relationships in terms of underlying neural and psychological mechanisms. The department comprises four research units: Psychophysiology, Light Therapy, Timing, and Pain. Psychophysiology Unit Drs. Bruder and Towey, who direct the Psychophysiology Unit, investigate brain wave correlates of psychiatric disorders, in keeping with the tradition of the late Dr. Samuel Sutton. In 1994, they received a new project grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study brain event-related potentials (ERPs) in schizophrenic patients. In a preliminary study, they found evidence of left temporal lobe dysfunction in schizophrenia, which was particularly evident among patients with positive symptoms such as hallucinations. This research is being done in collaboration with the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Dr. Esther Rabinowicz, a postdoctoral fellow, has received a Scottish Rite Research Grant and a Gwill Newman Young Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) to do work related to this project. With NIMH funding, Drs. Bruder and Towey continue their study of cerebral asymmetry in affective disorders. In one collaboration with the Depression Evaluation Unit (DES) of the Department of Therapeutics, depressed patients did not show the normal right-brain advantage for pitch discrimination and also failed to show hemispheric asymmetries of the "classic P300," an important ERP measure of brain activity. Another collaboration includes DES and Harvard Medical School researchers as part of a multicenter study of Prozac, the first large-scale study of the effects of this widely used antidepressant on brain/cognitive function. Findings from this study indicate that dichotic listening and neuropsychological tests (word and design fluency) are predictive of outcome of treatment with Prozac. Preliminary findings from a collaborative study with Dr. Flemming Graae and others in the Department of Child Psychiatry suggest electrophysiological abnormalities for adolescent suicide attempters in response to slides of faces expressing emotions. In a collaboration with the Lowenstein Foundation, Drs. Bruder and Towey recently began a study of language function and hemispheric lateralization in children at risk for disruptive behavior disorders. Drs. Towey and Bruder also continue their NIMH-funded study of ERP correlates of cognitive function in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This project involves a collaboration with Drs. Liebowitz and Fallon of the Therapeutics department's Anxiety Disorders Clinic. Thusfar, their ERP/EEG findings have supported hypotheses of overaroused and overfocused attention in OCD, predicted subsequent response to treatment with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and distinguished two major subtypes in OCD based on enhanced ERP negativities, symptom severity, and neurological soft signs. Light Therapy Unit Drs. Michael Terman and Jian-su-Terman, who direct the Light Therapy Unit, have been studying the effects of bright light exposure on alleviating winter depression (seasonal affective disorder or SAD). They are continuing with NIMH-sponsored clinical trials of their 30 min/10,000 lux treatment method in collaboration with both the DES and the Department of Analytical Psychopharmacology. In an expansion of the light treatment paradigm, they have begun evaluating potential antidepressant effects of high-density negative air ions in a placebo-controlled trial. The temporal phase of nocturnal melatonin secretion is being assessed under both of these treatments. With Steven Fairhurst, Dr. Michael Terman has developed a computer model of natural outdoor illumination transitions which he has used to drive a novel bedroom-lighting device that provides simulated dusk and dawn transitions to sleeping patients. Such treatment appears to promote clinical remissions of winter depression, along with melatonin phase shifts and elimination of hypersomnia. In related animal laboratory work, the Termans are collaborating with Dr. Ziad Boulos of the Institute of Circadian Physiology at Cambridge University, in a study of dusk and dawn twilight effects on the phase and duration of daily activity in hamsters. With Dr. Virginia Lubkin of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, Dr. Michael Terman is evaluating light-deprivation-related symptoms in glaucoma patients. With Dr. Douglas M. Holmes of the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, he is assessing behavioral effects of bright-light administration to patients with Alzheimer's disease. The Light Therapy Unit has received international scholarly as well as media attention. Dr. Michael Terman serves as past President of the Society for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms (SLTBR), Chair of the Joint Task Force on Light Treatment for Sleep Disorders (American Sleep Disorders Association and SLTBR), and President of the newly formed Center for Environmental Therapeutics. Timing Unit Dr. Gibbon continues his NIMH-funded work on temporal memory and decision processes in animals. His competing continuation grant received a MERIT award in 1994. This project focuses on properties of variability in temporal memory. A postdoctoral fellow, Dani Brunner, continues her NIMH-funded study of this work in collaboration with Dr. Gibbon. Another postdoctoral fellow, Lynn Aronson, received a National Science Foundation (NSF) award to apply Dr. Gibbon's theory of temporal memory to associative learning problems, critical for higher cognitive processing. Such work studies the basic building blocks required for understanding associative and mnemonic deficits in clinical populations. In a new collaboration with Drs. Meck of the Duke University Department of Psychology, and Malapani of Inserm 289, Hospital Salpetriere, Paris, Dr. Gibbon is also studying temporal processing deficits in Parkinson's disease patients. These patients exhibit severe timing deficits when off medication. New studies on this problem are being pursued with Dr. Yaakov Stern of the Sergievsky Center with Huntington's as well as Parkinson's patients. A grant application on this work is currently pending. Pain Unit Drs. Clark and Janal direct the Pain Unit, which continues to study the dimensions and clusters underlying pain and emotion, and memory for pain. A renewal application was submitted in November 1994 to continue funding for this project from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke. This project has produced an instrument for the measurement of clinical pain, the COPE. Although the COPE scale is similar to the McGill Pain Questionnaire, its structure, content, and analytical power are substantially improved. In one study, responses to the COPE scale revealed differences among six ethnocultural and sex groups in their response to cold-pressor pain. It is being used now to study the response of healthy volunteers to laboratory pain and stress, and in the study of various patient groups: women with premenstrual syndrome (with Dr. Jean Endicott, Research Assessment and Training); patients with shingles pain (with Dr. R. Dworkin, Anesthesiology); and post-surgical patients (with Dr. R. Siegfried, Anesthesiology). Chinese and Russian translations of the COPE are being evaluated, with, respectively, Dr. J. Yang, Chief of Anesthesiology at the University of Hong Kong, and Academician E. M. Tsirulnikov of the Sechenov Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia. Additional funding is being sought for both projects. Drs. Clark and Janal continue their collaboration with Dr. Murray Glusman on his NIH-funded study of silent myocardial ischemia. This investigation of ST-segment depression of the electrocardiogram (a measure of the amount of ischemia present in the muscle) demonstrated that the asymptomatic patients are silent because they suffer a sensory deficit, and were not more stoical than symptomatic patients. Preliminary findings indicate that symptomatic patients may over-report symptoms of distress, while silent patients appear more like the normative group. Dr. Clark is a co-investigator with Dr. R. Dworkin of the Department of Anesthesiology on an NIMH-funded study of pain sensitivity in schizophrenia. Dr. Clark consults on pain measurement with: Dr. Karen Gil, Duke University (sickle cell anemia; funded); Dr. Mark Rus, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (self-mutilating patients; funded in 1994); and Dr. Ralph Wharton, Liaison Psychiatry (spinal injury and painful dysesthesia; prior and continuing funding). Dr. Clark also collaborated with Dr. F. Kronenberg on an alternative medicine grant application which was funded in 1994.

The mission of the division is to provide investigators at Psychiatric Institute with access to and training in state-of-the-art statistical techniques as needed for the optimal use of their research data. This includes developing and applying new methodology for the design and analysis of psychiatric studies, participating in major funded research, teaching statistics to researchers and post-doctoral fellows, and providing short-term consultations on data-analytic and design issues for grant submission and manuscript preparation. Methodological Research Methodological research in the division focuses on problems of particular relevance to psychiatric studies. Areas of expertise in the division include analysis of longitudinal studies with generalized linear models and variance components models, methods for dealing with missing data, causal models, and methodology for combining information from different sources (e.g., meta-analysis). For example, Dr. Christine Waternaux, Director, is investigating methods for power computations with longitudinal repeated measures. She has also investigated and published on the use of hierarchical models for combining psychiatric data. Dr. Eva Petkova, Associate Biostatistician, is specializing in statistical models for the analysis of longitudinal studies with informative drop-out. She is developing methodologies for the analysis of clinical trials when the traditional intent-to-treat approach is not appropriate because most drop-outs switch treatments. Dr. Xinhua Liu, Associate Biostatistician, is experienced in analyzing cohort data (e.g., New York gay man cohort) which traditionally have high dropout rates and a large proportion of missing observations. Her research is addressing the problem of adequacy of different analytical techniques in the presence of missing data. Collaborative and Consultative Activities Division staff have been very active in their collaborative and consultative efforts, thus demonstrating the great need for such services. For instance, in 1994, staff provided statistical input and participated in nineteen grant submissions. In April 1994, Dr. Christine Waternaux became the Director of the Biostatistics and Measurement Core of the NIMH-funded Clinical Research Center for the Study of Youth Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide (Principal Investigator: Dr. David Shaffer). In September 1994, Dr. Waternaux became the Director of the Statistics and Computing Core of the Clinical Research Center for the Study of Suicidal Behavior (Principal Investigator: Dr. J. John Mann). Division staff are also participating in consultations and meetings with the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core of the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies (Directors: Drs. Anke Erhardt and Zena Stein). As part of its training component, the division conducts weekly workshops in biostatistics and data management. These workshops illustrate analytic and data management issues, and explore emerging statistical methodologies in both fields. Topics covered this year have included random regression models, principles of modeling, meta-analysis, generalized estimating equations, and structural equation modeling. Division staff are also working with the Department of Postgraduate Education and with members of the NIMH Training Programs for Clinical and Research Fellows on matters concerning the statistical curriculum.

The NIMH-supported Child Psychiatry Clinical Research Center and the Research Training Grant were successfully renewed for a further five years. Initiatives were started to obtain funding for an endowed chair in Child Psychopharmacology. Several talented research trainees obtained new Career Development Awards and other support that will extend the department's funded research activities in measurement, developmental psychopathology, and biological psychology. The Child Training and Clinical Program adapted to the changing clinical climate by providing clinics and training in shorter and more focused forms of psychotherapy. The Clinical Department further developed its programs for the increasing number of children whose families are affected by HIV infection. New Research Activities The NIMH-supported Clinical Research Center and Research Training Program in Child Psychiatry were each renewed for a further five years. NIMH support was received by David Shaffer, Prudence Fisher, and Christopher Lucas to develop the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children for epidemiological use and as a diagnostic aid in a clinic setting. Jennifer Havens and Claude Mellins received a grant from the SAMHSA to develop a demonstration service for the mental health needs of families affected by HIV. NIMH Scientist Development Awards were received by Christopher Lucas, M.D., for a research program on measurement in child psychopathology and by Cheryl Slomkowski, Ph.D., to study sibling influences on antisocial behavior. Contracts were received from NIMH and NICHD by Christina Hoven and Hector Bird (Choices for Children in Need of Mental Health Services) and Gail Wasserman (Norming and Validating the Early-Adolescent HOME Scale). Awards from private foundations included an Aaron Diamond Foundation Award to Claude Mellins to study the impact of HIV on families; from the Klingenstein Third Generation Family Foundation to David Shaffer to implement suicide screening projects in local high schools; from the Carmel Hill Fund to David Shaffer and Christopher Lucas to study suicide screening at Boystown of America; and from the American Suicide Foundation to Susan Wolk to study serotonin measures in adults with childhood-onset major depression. Lawrence Greenhill, M.D. was supported by Richwood Pharmaceuticals to investigate the effects of Adderall and methylphenidate in children with ADHD. The Department of Child Psychiatry has several sources for funding internal grants. During the past year the following awards were made: from the Viola Bernard Endowment Fund to Richard Gaines, Ph.D.; from the American Suicide Foundation to Susan Wolk, M.D., John Piacentini, Ph.D., Daniel Pine, M.D., and David Castro-Blanco, Ph.D.; from the CRC Pilot Fund to Janet Fairbanks, M.D., Richard Gaines, Ph.D., Madelyn Gould, Ph.D., Arthur Green, M.D., Noreen Hernandez, Ph.D., Ronan VanRossem, Ph.D., Laura Whitman, M.D., Susan Wolk, M.D., and Jonathan Slater, M.D.; from the PIRSG Fund to Jorge Armenteros, M.D., Judith Feldman, Ph.D., and Arturo Sanchez-Lacay, M.D. The Department was supported by the Roddy D. Brickell Foundation to provide a broad program of support for research and services relating to child and adolescent suicide and by the American Suicide Foundation to fund small suicide-related research projects. The Department was responsible for sponsoring a joint Italian-American Research Conference at the Italian Academy of Columbia University for Child Psychiatrists from the mainland of Italy. Research Findings Drs. Gail Wasserman, Ph.D. and Daniel Pine, M.D., in the Lowenstein Center for the Study of Disruptive Disorders, have noted significant relationships between aggressive behavior and cardiovascular function and Body Mass Index. Center scientists have also identified significant short-term predictors of persistence and desistance of aggressive behavior in young children. Drs. Laurie Miller and Rachel Klein, in the Jonas Center for the Prevention of Disruptive Disorders, are undertaking an intensive prevention study with an emphasis on parent training. Preliminary data from a small number of subjects show positive effects that could have implications in larger studies for prevention of antisocial behavior. Dr. Shaffer has developed a screen that can be used in large samples of adolescents to identify teens at risk for suicide. This research has been well received and has led to grants from the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation to implement the strategies and techniques in a public school setting at low cost. Drs. Bird and Hoven have developed measures of impairment that have been tested in several large samples. These techniques differentiate purely symptomatic but well-functioning individuals from those who would be more properly classed as patients. This work is important in the field of epidemiology for the task of defining "caseness." Dr. Madelyn Gould, Ph.D., undertaking a large study of suicide clusters, has suggestive evidence that children who die in a cluster are less disturbed and commit suicide more impulsively than those who die in non-epidemic circumstances. This finding points to the importance of social psychological factors in facilitating suicide in young people. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, developed by David Shaffer, M.D. and his colleagues Prudence Fisher, M.S. and Christopher Lucas, M.D., is being revised under NIMH contract to achieve compatibility with DSM-IV and ICD-10. The interview has achieved broad currency and is now being translated into several languages and is being used in a large number of research projects. In a study in Boystown of America Institutions, it has been found to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of initial screening and triage leading to diagnosis based quality control at low cost. Honors Hector Bird, M.D. was appointed to the Child and Adolescent Development Risk and Prevention Committee of the NIMH and to the Editorial Board of the Journal of Child and Family Studies. Anke Ehrhardt, Ph.D. received tenure of title as Professor of Medical Psychology and Psychiatry, and joined the scientific review committee of AMFAR. Madelyn Gould, Ph.D. was appointed to the chairmanship of the DrPH Committee of Epidemiology at the School of Public Health and was appointed statistical consultant to the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Jennifer Havens, M.D. was elected Chairman of the Multi-site Steering Committee of HIV-AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program and was appointed to the Mayor's HIV Health and Human Services Planning Council. Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D. was given the Distinguished Scientist Achievement Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex. Daniel Pine, M.D. received first prize in the APA Residents' Research Award for the New York District. David Shaffer was appointed to the APA Committee on Psychiatric Diagnosis and Assessment and was appointed Chairman of the Ittleson Award Board of the APA. Clinical Services The Pediatric Psychiatry Division at Presbyterian Hospital, under the direction of Drs. Richard Gaines, Ph.D. and Jennifer Havens, M.D., is the major provider of psychiatric services to children and adolescents in northern Manhattan. In 1994, the outpatient service at Babies and Children's Hospital, the Neurological Institute, the Family Center (child abuse intervention program), and the On-Site School Program recorded 26,421 visits, a 5% increase over 1993. Major increments occurred in the Family Center (12% increase), which provides psychiatric services to HIV-infected and/or drug-exposed children. The Special Needs Clinic, founded in 1991, has continued to draw the attention of both private foundations and government agencies. Within the last year, major awards included Ryan White I funds, a contract from SAMSHA, New York State Office of Mental Health Family Support Funds, and the Child Welfare Fund. Training Programs The Child and Adolescent Residency Training Program under the direction of Drs. Clarice J. Kestenbaum and lan A. Canino provides training for graduate psychiatrists wishing to pursue a career in administrative, clinical, academic, research, or hospital-based child psychiatry. The program provides training in the most important and useful methods of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment, ensures familiarity with a range of clinical problems, provides trainees with an introduction to research methods and strategies and imparts a sense of competence in clinical teaching and administration. A three-year course in General Residency Training in Child Psychiatry is under the Directorship of Dr. Owen Lewis. Medical School Education in Child Psychiatry is under the Directorship of Dr. Donna Moreau. Dr. Steven Rosenheck directs training in Family Therapy and Dr. Ken Gorfinkel directs training in Cognitive Behavior Therapy. The residency is divided into discrete rotations in different clinical settings including one of the three state facilities with which we are affiliated: Manhattan Children's Psychiatric Center, Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center, and Queens Children's Psychiatric Center. The program of Manhattan Children's Psychiatric Center will be closing in 1995. There are six to eight openings for child fellowship training each year. Two are designated for a five-year track that integrates child, adolescent, and general psychiatry training. A special track has been established to study culturally sensitive approaches for inner city minority children. An NIMH grant (Principal Investigator: Ian Canino, M.D.) helps support two minority residents. In 1988, the CARING at Columbia fund was established to integrate some unusual programs in our residency training. These included a program to expose residents to group dynamics and social skill development of inner city children within a creative arts program (Museo del Barrio) and workshops provided by the Poets in Public Service. 1994-1995 First Year Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residents Michael Feldman, M.D. Nancy Lebowitz-Naegeli, M.D. Lourdes Soto-Moreno, M.D. Mehmet Tosyali, M.D. Helen Smith, M.D. Peter Walsh, M.D. 1994-1995 Second Year Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residents Eric Bartky, M.D. David Battista, M.D. Diana Dorfman, M.D. Susie Hou, M.D. Karen Kieserman, M.D. Roberto Negron, M.D. Daniel Pine, M.D. Elizabeth Wade Baisden, M.D. WT02-B10-169IA093-000995-B029-315http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_SP.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072739 text/html 14303HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:31:46 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 14172 Clinical and Genetic Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology Myrna M. Weissman, Ph.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research Susan E. Hodge, D.Sc., Research Scientist VI Priya Wickramaratne, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Phillip B. Adams, Ph.D., Research Scientist III Risë B. Goldstein, Ph.D., Research Scientist III Virginia Warner, M.P.H., Research Scientist II The major achievements of the Department of Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology include new funding, new awards, and new research findings. New Funding Myrna M. Weissman, Ph.D. received a grant from The Upjohn Company to test and refine a computer-driven system for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in primary care. The Genetic Epidemiology Core, part of the Center to Study Youth Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide (David Shaffer, M.D., Principal Investigator) was funded April 1994 through March 1999. The epidemiology component of the PPG Psychobiology/Genetics/Treatment of Anxiety Disorders (Donald Klein, M.D., Principal Investigator) was funded May 1994 through April 1999. Dr. Weissman has also received notification that her MERIT award to study the genetics of panic disorder will be renewed September 1995 through August 2000. Notification was also received of a grant from Bristol Myers Squibb to study access and barriers to treatment. Three junior members of the department also received new funding. Susan Wolk, M.D. received a two-year grant from the American Suicide Foundation to measure serotonin in adults with childhood onset Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and a Psychiatric Institute Research Scientist (PIRSG) pilot grant to study the continuity between childhood and adult depression, using biological measures. Risë Goldstein, Ph.D. received notification approving a two-year Aaron Diamond Fellowship beginning July 1995 to study predictors of substance abuse and barriers to treatment utilization in depressed children grown up. Veronica Vieland, Ph.D. received a two-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) Shannon Award to study sampling models and methods for complex genetic diseases. This grant has been funded by NIMH as a basic research grant for the period 1995-2000. Awards and Honors Dr. Weissman received the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) Selo Prize for her research. With the late Dr. Gerald L. Klerman, she received the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine's Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize for research in mental health. And she was elected President of the American Suicide Foundation. New Research Findings in Family and Genetic Studies Genetic Studies of Panic Disorder Working with Conrad Gilliam, Ph.D., and James Knowles, M.D., Ph.D., the department has tested 23 families (367 individuals) with panic disorder for linkage to 587 genetic markers in order to positionally identify genetic factors involved in panic disorder (Vieland et al., 1994). This work includes a systematic genomic screen using a set of CA repeat markers with average spacing of 13 centimorgans (cM) on a subset of the 13 most informative pedigrees. Essentially, all the markers have been run and the data is now being analyzed. The department has also been collecting "triads" (father, mother, and proband) to perform genetic association studies of panic disorder with candidate disease genes. Currently, 32 independence triads have been collected and an increase to 50 triads is expected in the first quarter of 1995. Using 17 triads, the GABA-*-1 and GABA-*-3 genes have been tested for linkage disequilibrium to panic disorder. Both were not in disequilibrium to panic disorder. Development of Data Management Methods Dr. Adams has continued to modify his family genetics tracking programs by adding the capability to manage best-estimate diagnoses across studies in order to accommodate unlimited lanes of data in addition to multiple families within a single gel/blot, to accept studies which include repeated measures. Security routines have been added, output modes now include SAS, BMDP, and SSPC formats, and the program will read from scanned data files. These programs are being adapted for use by investigators at the Medical College of Virginia, the University of Iowa, Trinity College (Dublin), Johns Hopkins University, the University of Alabama, Harvard University and the NIMH. Mathematical Genetics Concerns about whether ascertainment correction is even required for large pedigrees, about whether and how multiple probands in the same pedigree can be taken into account properly, and about how to apply sequential sampling strategies have occupied many investigators in recent years. Susan Hodge, D.Sc., and Veronica Vieland, Ph.D. showed that the common practice of conditioning on the observed pedigree structure, when data have been sequentially obtained, is in general not correct, except when ascertainment is "single." Moreover, in a major step forward for genetic epidemiology, they proved that the problem is literally intractable (again, except for single ascertainment). The Genetic Phenomenon of "Anticipation" This study examines how one tests for anticipation, defined as an inheritance pattern wherein a disease is progressively more severe, or is more frequent, or occurs at earlier ages, in successive generations of affected individuals. Recently, anticipation has become a "hot topic" in psychiatric genetics, with several studies purporting to demonstrate its existence for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, etc. If true anticipation does exist, this would be an important finding, which would point the way to a true gene for the disease, a gene most likely involving trinucleotide repeats (TNR's). However, there are serious statistical problems involved in the search for anticipation, and most published studies have not taken these problems sufficiently into account. Our study demonstrates some of these problems and ends on a note of caution for researchers. Association Analysis This is another "hot topic" in psychiatric genetics. Everyone is doing association studies, but many researchers are misinterpreting their findings. Dr. Hodge wrote an editorial summarizing recent mathematical modelling findings concerning association analysis. Her summary was expressed in less technical language in order to be more accessible to psychiatric researchers. Genetic Analysis Workshop The Genetic Analysis Workshops are held every two years and represent an opportunity for genetic epidemiologists from all over the world to come together and work on two or three problems that have been set ahead of time. Dr. Hodge was primarily responsible for developing and formulating these problems for the 1994 workshop. High Risk Studies and Longitudinal Studies An in-progress 15-year follow-up study of depressed, anxious, and normal children grown up has suggested the continuity between childhood and adult depression, with extremely high rates of suicide (4.4%) and suicide attempts (35%) in depressed children grown up. In addition to collection of longitudinal diagnostic information, biological studies are being conducted by Susan Wolk, M.D., and Jeremy Coplan, M.D., repeating and augmenting biological studies done during the initial treatment and study of these adolescents between 1978 and 1984. Preliminary findings suggest that non-suicidal MDD subjects may demonstrate nocturnal GH hypersecretion during adolescence as seen in prepubertal subjects with MDD. In contrast to the original reports, current studies indicate that adolescents with MDD and suicidal behavior at time of testing fail to show the increased GH secretion evident in their non-suicidal MDD counterparts irrespective of subsequent suicidal behavior. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies in children and adolescents have not found any consistent pattern of sleep changes associated with major depression. Goetz et.al. found no differences in REM sleep between the adolescent depressives and normal controls. Longitudinal follow-up has revealed that suicidality is an important variable in the sleep measures in both the prepubertal and adolescent cohort. Data indicates that the depressed children who were suicidal at the time of the original testing demonstrate significantly increased REM density during their first REM period compared to depressed children who were not suicidal at the time of the testing and to normal control children. No differences in REM latency were identified between the depressed and normal adolescents. Offspring of Depressed Parents A 10-year follow-up study of children at high risk for depression showed a high rate of recurrent depression and low prevalence of treatment even though these families come from clinics in which they or their parents received intensive treatment for their depression. Women had higher rates of untreated psychopathology than men, which goes against the help-seeking patterns normally observed. Further analysis is being done by Virginia Warner, M.P.H., Priya Wickramaratne, Ph.D., and Mark Olfson, M.D., to determine factors presenting barriers to treatment-seeking by these women. Also, data show that offspring of depressed parents showed higher rates of MDD and anxiety disorders compared to children of non-depressed parents. Offspring of depressed parents also showed significantly higher rates of alcohol dependency, a trend towards higher rates of any anxiety disorder, and higher rates of drug dependency. There appears to be an increasing linear trend in rates of offspring MDD with increasing number of episodes of MDD in parents. Using data from this study, Richard Rende, Ph.D. provided the first data on sibling resemblance for psychiatric disorders in offspring at high and low risk for depression. Sibling resemblance for depression was of a similar magnitude in both the high and low risk cohorts. However, striking differences were found for anxiety disorders, as sibling aggregation was much more noticeable in the high risk cohort. This finding suggests the genetic contribution to affective disorders may become manifest through early-emerging anxiety disorders. Offspring of Opiate Addicts In a study of offspring of opiate addicts, recruitment and psychiatric assessment of an ethnically diverse sample of 156 methadone-maintained opiate addicts from local area methadone clinics and 200 of their offspring has been completed. Neurological examinations conducted by Abba Cargan, M.D. in the Department of Pediatric Neurology have been performed on 102 of the offspring. Preliminary findings include high rates of psychiatric treatment, psychiatric disorders, and substance use in the offspring. Further, neurological soft signs in the offspring, particularly slowness in executing motor tasks, are associated both with lifetime histories of disruptive behavior disorders and with deficits in intellectual functioning. New Research Findings in Epidemiology Cross National Epidemiology A major study on the cross national epidemiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has been published, presenting data on the prevalence rates, age of onset, symptom profiles, and comorbidity of OCD. The study uses DSM-III from community surveys in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, Germany, Taiwan, Korea, and New Zealand. There is remarkable consistency in these countries where the annual rate for OCD ranges from 1.1/100 in Korea and New Zealand to 1.8/100 in Puerto Rico. The only exception is Taiwan (.4/100) which has the lowest rate of all psychiatric disorders. There is also consistency in the age of onset, comorbidity with major depression, and other anxiety disorders. There is variability among countries in the predominance of obsessions or compulsions. These findings suggest the robustness of OCD as a disorder in quite diverse parts of the world. Also published were data on the lifetime prevalence/100 and age at onset of major depression and bipolar disorder from the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, France, Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Taiwan, Korea, and New Zealand. The symptom profiles, comorbidity, secular trends, and marital status as a risk factor are also presented cross nationally. The lifetime rates for major depression vary widely across countries. The age at onset in early adulthood shows less variation. There was a preponderance of females in the rates of major depression across all countries. In contrast, the rates of bipolar disorder are more consistent across countries, and the sex ratios are nearly equal. Clinical Studies Laura Mufson, Ph.D. is conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) compared with clinical management type of treatment. Dr. Mufson adapted the original IPT manual for use with depressed adolescents; it was published by Guildford Press as a book titled Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents. Further plans include development of a Maintenance IPT-A treatment to administer to adolescents who have recovered during the three-month treatment in an attempt to prevent recurrence of depressive episodes.

Gorman, M.D., Director Dolores Malaspina, M.D., Associate Director Laszlo A. Papp, M.D., Research Associate Charles A. Kaufmann, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II Jeremy Coplan, M.D., Research Scientist V The Department of Clinical Psychobiology, directed by Dr. Jack Gorman, consists of three separate components: schizophrenia research, anxiety disorders research, and depression research. Schizophrenia Research A major focus of the Department of Clinical Psychobiology continues to be schizophrenia research. These efforts received important support with the funding of the Developing Clinical Research Center for the Study of Schizophrenia in August, 1994. This five-year grant is directed at elucidating the genetic and environmental determinants of schizophrenia. The study integrates research conducted on 38 inpatient research beds at Psychiatric Institute lead by Dr. Scott Clark, and at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center lead by Dr. Zafar Sharif. Studies currently underway with the Center's various cores include: Diagnosis & Assessment Core (Dr. Xavier Amador and colleagues)-Evaluation psychopathology and psychophysiology in inpatients and their first degree relatives; assessment of awareness of illness; assessment of affective deficits in patients. Genetics Core (Drs. Charles Kaufmann, Dolores Malaspina, Jill Harkavy Friedman, and colleagues)-Clarification of the relative roles of gene and environment on putative biological markers for schizophrenia; reduction of etiologic heterogeneity through the identification of phenotypic characteristics of highly familial schizophrenia; recruitment of parent/affected offspring "triads" for linkage disequilibrium studies. Epidemiology Core (Drs. Ezra Susser, Alan Brown, and colleagues)-Development of unique birth cohorts (located in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and the Netherlands) in which both genetic and epigenetic risk factors may be specified and their relative contributions to schizophrenia outcomes may be evaluated. Neuroimmunology/Neuropathology Core (Drs. Norman Latov, Saud Sadiq, David Strauss, Andrew Dwork, and colleagues)-Replication of the finding of elevations in antibodies against the human heat shock protein in schizophrenia; evaluation of the specificity of this finding; mapping of the antigenic epitopes mediating the immune response recognizing of their similarity to proteins of known pathogens; identification of alterations in a neuronal protein, MAP2, in post-mortem subiculum. Neuroimaging/Neurobiology Core (Drs. Dolores Malaspina, Ronald van Heertum, and colleagues)-Examining the role of dopamine D4 receptor alterations via SPECT, as well as examining the relationship between structural and functional hippocampal changes via MRI/MRS. These nascent neuroimaging efforts have been further strengthened by a major grant from the Mathers Foundation. Anxiety Disorder Research Dr. Laszlo A. Papp is in charge of this group of studies which are based at Psychiatric Institute in the Biological Studies Unit and at the Phobia, Anxiety, and Stress Disorders Clinic at Hillside Hospital. Drs. Papp and Gorman continue to focus on the role of respiratory abnormalities in anxiety disorders. Aided by several RO1 grants, among them the largest NIMH-sponsored treatment study of panic disorder, they have evaluated the respiratory status of hundreds of panic patients before and after medication treatment and psychotherapy. In two independent samples, they have found significant medication-but not psychotherapy-also altered respiratory sensitivity. Respiratory challenges have also been conducted under "tryptophan depletion" condition and during "varying cognitive" environments. In collaboration with Drs. Pine, Schaffer, and Wasserman, the respiratory challenge strategy has been extended to include children with anxiety disorders. Drs. Papp and Ethan Gorenstein have begun to develop a new area of research-the assessment and treatment of patients with late-life disorders. Dr. Jeremy Coplan continues his work with Dr. Leonard Rosenblum in non-human primates, studying the neurobiological effects of separation, and developing animal models for human anxiety. Dr. Coplan is also involved with the Department of Child Psychiatry in a series of biological challenges in children, including a collaboration with Dr. Janet Fairbanks to study young children at risk for behavioral inhibition. Dr. Mindy Fullilove continues her promising work with patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, developing intervention strategies for use with inner city women with PTSD. Dr. Fullilove was appointed to the National Task Force on AIDS Development, to the editorial board of the American Journal of Psychiatry, and to the editorial board of Current Issues in Public Health. Drs. Jack Gorman, Richard Sloan, and Peter Shapiro continue their work with cardiac transplant patients. They study the effect of psychological stress on the heart, focusing on heart rate variability as a biological risk factor for myocardial infarction. Depression Studies Dr. Julie Hatterer continues to study "CSF Transthyretin in Refractory Depression." Together with Dr. Steven Roose and Dr. Joseph Herbert of New York University, we are pursuing this work along with other studies of thyroid hormone effects in depressed patients.

A major focus is the investigation of optimal treatments for childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Major Depressive Disorders in Adolescents In 1994, we initiated a placebo-controlled investigation of the efficacy of standard antidepressants in adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder. Adolescent depression has been shown to be related to the adult form of the disorder in many ways: it predicts the occurrence of depression in adulthood, and it is associated with a family history of depression in adult relatives. Yet, several small studies have failed to document that its response to treatment follows the pattern observed in adult Major Depression. To remedy the limitations of small-sample studies, a group of researchers from several university centers have launched a large scale study of a tricyclic drug, imipramine, and a serotonergic agent, paroxetine. The study will provide the first powerful test of antidepressant efficacy in depressed adolescents. Conduct Disorders in Children and Adolescents In 1993, we completed a treatment study of children and adolescents with conduct disorders, comparing lithium and methylphenidate to a placebo. We found a striking positive outcome in methylphenidate-treated children. However, significant family and social problems continued in many cases. In 1994, we developed a comprehensive treatment program to address the diverse serious problems experienced by young people with conduct disorders. An ambitious one-year-long treatment package was developed. It includes family interventions, teaching of parental management, and medication. It is currently being put to the test in a controlled design. This multi-treatment approach to one of the most challenging problems in child mental health is the first of its kind. In tandem with efforts to reverse conduct disorders, we have designed a program, headed by Laurie Miller, Ph.D., that attempts to prevent the development of conduct disorders. Toddlers, at high risk for the development of antisocial behavior, participate with their caretakers in a two-year program that optimizes conditions in the home. The program is designed to minimize the development of the early onset of child behavior problems which are known to be strongly predictive of later antisocial behavior. This work has continued during 1993, under the sponsorship of Barbara Jonas and the Lowenstein Foundation. Risks for Mental Disturbance in Offspring of Adults with Mental Disorders Our interest in identifying risks for mental disturbance that may occur in young children due to mental disorders in their parents has led us to initiate a study of the offspring of adults who had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in their own childhood. This study, initiated in 1994, will contribute to our knowledge of the inter-generational transmission of a very common and disabling childhood disorder. It will also potentially provide the basis for refined genetic studies, as well as prevention studies, by enabling the identification of characteristics in young children that are related to a parental history of ADHD. We are examining as well, the children of adults with anxiety disorders in order to provide understanding of the risks conferred to children from a variety of parental psychopathology. The diversity of our high-risk research will generate important information about the specificity of possible disadvantages associated with different mental disorders in families. Collaborative Research Activities The department has a close collaboration with the Department of Child Psychiatry through joint research activities in the Child Psychiatry Clinical Research Center (CPCRC), which is dedicated to the study of depression, anxiety, and suicidality in children and adolescents. The department directs the Clinical Core of the CPCRC, through which established investigators and research fellows conduct studies that span the neuropsychology of adolescent major depression, the psychobiology of child and adolescent anxiety disorders, early temperamental characteristics in offspring of adults with panic disorder, interpersonal psychotherapy of adolescent major depression, the psychopathology and treatment of selective mutism, and the neurobiology of adolescent suicidality.

Glassman, M.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research Steven P. Roose, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II B. Timothy Walsh, M.D., Psychiatrist II We have focused our research efforts in the following major areas: * the safety of antidepressant drugs in hospitalized depressed patients with cardiovascular disease; * the efficacy of various antidepressants in outpatients with late-life depression; * the relationship between depression and death with particular focus on heart attack patients with depression; * pharmacological and psychological treatment of eating disorders; * smoking addiction, with special interest in the relationship between nicotine dependence and depression. Psychopharmacology Research Cardiovascular Effects of Antidepressants We are conducting a four-year study of the cardiovascular effects of a new group of antidepressants, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Though these drugs have different cardiovascular effects from the tricyclics, they are being used with a false sense of "safety" in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. Our studies will determine if these drugs prove to be more effective and safe than our standard antidepressants in patients with complicated cardiac problems. These cardiac studies have also allowed us the opportunity to determine the efficacy of the new antidepressants in the most severely depressed patients. Initially, it appears that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors may not be as effective as the standard tricyclics in the treatment of the hospitalized depressed patient. Late Life Depression Clinic With the Department of Biological Psychiatry, we have opened a Late Life Depression Clinic focusing on the study of the phenomenology, biology, and treatment of depressed patients over the age of 60. Depression is a common illness in this growing segment of the population and there has been insufficient investigation to determine the safest and most effective treatment for them. This is the only research clinic focusing on depression in the elderly in New York City. Studies already completed in the clinic have demonstrated that the mild, chronic type of depression, called dysthymia, occurs in older age patients. Initial trials have suggested that medication may be of help for these patients. Currently, the clinic is conducting studies of the effectiveness of antidepressant medication in older age patients with both mild and more severe forms of depression. Ongoing studies are also directed at comparing the safety and efficacy of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors vs. the tricyclics in depressed patients with ischemic heart disease. Antidepressant Studies in Patients After a Heart Attack There is now significant data to support the observation that depression dramatically increases the risk of dying after a heart attack. These data showing an increased mortality come in part from studies conducted in this department, arising both from our interest in the use of antidepressants in patients with heart disease and from our studies with smoking. What is not clear is if antidepressant drugs would be safe to use after a heart attack and, if they were used, if they would reduce the risk of depression and the associated increase in mortality. Based on our long interest in the safety of antidepressant drugs in patients with heart disease, we propose and have been funded to look at the safety of these drugs immediately following an infarction. Cardiac Studies in Children and Adults We have obtained information suggesting that the cardiovascular effects of tricyclic antidepressants are substantially different in children and adolescents than in adults. We are examining the physiological basis for these differences to determine whether they may increase the vulnerability to arrhythmias in some young people. Treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, Anorexia Nervosa, and Binge Eating Disorder We have recently completed a controlled treatment study of bulimia nervosa aimed at determining the relative efficacy of supportive therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and the utility of adding antidepressant medication to these therapies. A controlled treatment study to compare the relative effectiveness of interpersonal therapy and CBT in women with bulimia nervosa has recently been initiated. We have also initiated a controlled trial using fluoxetine to facilitate weight gain in hospitalized patients with anorexia nervosa. Preliminary work regarding the effectiveness of CBT in the post-hospitalization prevention of relapse in anorexia nervosa has been completed, and we have initiated a controlled trial. We are also exploring the utility of CBT and of medication for the treatment of binge eating associated with obesity. Eating Behavior Studies of Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder In continued collaborative studies with St. Luke's Medical Center, we are examining in detail the disturbances of eating behavior in these disorders. We have found increasing evidence of disturbance in the psychological and biological mechanisms responsible for the development of satiety in bulimia nervosa. We are also conducting studies to determine whether such disturbances also affect some obese individuals. Study and Treatment of Nicotine Dependence In previous studies, we found a larger than expected rate of a history of major depressive disorder in our samples of heavy smokers and a lower success rate among those with such a history. We are continuing our trials of the effectiveness of antidepressants, combined with behavioral counseling, on smoking cessation and long-term abstinence and we are examining biological, psychological, social, and demographic variables that may have an impact on smoking cessation. We are also collaborating with the Cancer Institute to study the molecular effects of smoking in tumor promotion with a view to improving cancer risk assessment. In addition, we are collaborating in an investigation of a genetic marker in dependent smokers. Perhaps most importantly, we are following smokers with a history of major depression who are able to stop and those who are not, to see if smoking cessation influences the subsequent frequency of serious depressions. Training and Patient Care The unit staff are active in a broad range of training programs. The educational objectives for all residents are to learn: 1) how to recognize and treat major depression and eating disorders; 2) principles of pharmacology that govern the use of psychotropic medications; 3) and how to design smoking cessation programs to allow psychiatric patients to better tolerate smoke-free hospitals. The 7th Floor Clinical Service of this department is a research unit devoted to the study and treatment of affective and eating disorders. Treatment modalities include antidepressants and ECT for depression, and antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy for eating disorders. Special Activities In addition to regional seminars in psychopharmacology, the department administers a statewide psychopharmacology "Hotline." This is a service offered to New York State Department of Mental Health facilities across the state through which physicians may, by phone, get immediate expert advice on any drug-related psychiatric problem. It functions to improve the level of patient care throughout the New York State psychiatric system.

Anderson, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Two currently funded projects were the primary focus of the department in 1994. The National Academy of Science/National Research Council Twin Study of Handedness as aMarker for Survival Fitness Dr. Joseph Jaffe is Principal Investigator and Dr. Steven J.C. Shea is Co-Investigator. It has been claimed that left-handedness reduces life expectancy by nine years! Handedness and mortality were examined in a cohort of 9,043 male twins, all World War II veterans. Preliminary data relating direction and strength of handedness to crude death rate showed a mortality peak for weak right-handers rather than strong sinistrals, laying to rest an already shaky claim that had terrified the left-handed community. We now pursue our finding of peak mortality among weak right-handers. A current genetic theory proposes that the "weak dextral" phenotype actually conceals a "weak sinistral" genotype that yielded to the postnatal pressures of a "right-handed world." One implication of our finding is that reduced survival fitness may be the price of compliance with social pressures that violate powerful biological imperatives. We hypothesize (a) that changes in genetically-driven behaviors such as handedness due to social pressures shortens the life span of both singletons and fraternal twins, and, (b) that the known symbiotic relationship between identical twins protects them from such outcomes. Higher death rate in dizygotic than in monozygotic twins was previously reported for cardiovascular disease. This finding has now been confirmed and also applies to cancer deaths. The Effect on the Infant of Post-partum Depression in the Mother Dr. Beatrice Beebe is Principal Investigator and Drs. Samuel Anderson and Joseph Jaffe are Co-lnvestigators. Infants of depressed mothers are at risk for social, emotional, and cognitive difficulty that may outlast the depression. We propose that mother-infant communication can be disturbed by deviant interpersonal timing. A new technology requires only ten minutes of interaction to measure the coordination of vocal timing between mother and infant. Furthermore, the method is completely automated and free of clinical bias. The technique is now being applied in a pilot study of depressed mothers and their infants, with a matched normal control group. Of the first 50 dyads studied, an important mode of mother-infant communication (simultaneous vocalizing) was less prevalent in depressed than in control dyads. This finding suggests one interpersonal timing mechanism, i.e., absence of coactive vocal contingency, whereby depressed mothers might transmit distress to their infants. Thus, the research contributes to our goal of an objective, automated test for early detection of risk for compromised social development. Dr. Beebe has also established didactic links to the Residency Program and the Psychoanalytic Clinic.

Hofer, M.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research Donald E. Hutchings, Ph.D., Research Scientist VI Gordon A. Barr, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Michael M. Myers, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Brandon G. Yongue, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Susan A. Brunelli, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Susan E. Carden, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV William P. Fifer, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Harry N. Shair, Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Ann Zmitrovich, Ph.D., Research Scientist III The department's research centers on the processes involved in the development of behavior and its underlying biological systems. We aim to understand more precisely how natural events and behaviors affect the course of normal development, and how certain experiences can produce aberrant responses that constitute models of clinical conditions. Projects range from molecular genetic studies of gene expression for a peptide regulating salt appetite in rats to linguistic analysis of cues enabling human infants to recognize their own mothers' voices within hours of birth. Thus, we hope to describe mechanisms at several different levels of organization that determine the expression of genetic potential as this is influenced by the environment. The most pervasive early environment for humans and most other mammals is the mother-infant relationship. Many departmental projects are devoted to understanding the behavioral and physiological processes at work within that relationship. Knowledge of these processes is essential for a clear understanding of how the expression of genetic potential is regulated by the environment of early life and, in turn, how these experiences influence the risk for the expression of anxiety disorders, cardiovascular disease, and vulnerability to mental illness under stress later in life. Departmental Research Fetal Behavior and Intrauterine Influences Following his discovery that a newborn baby recognizes and prefers her/his own mother's voice within a few hours of birth, Dr. Fifer, in collaboration with Dr. Myers, has extended these observations into a program of research on fetal responses to sound and to maternal emotional state, and on preterm development of sleep-wake state organization. Together, Drs. Fifer, Myers, and Yongue have been funded to incorporate these approaches in a study of early markers of risk for Sudden Infant Death and other neurological disorders. This project involves a mutually beneficial technology exchange between the sophisticated research environment of New York State Psychiatric Institute and the high risk rural populations in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. With funding from a new National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) grant, Drs. Hutchings and Zmitrovich have developed the first valid animal model for studying the developmental effects on the offspring of pregnant mothers who have been given methadone maintenance treatment. With a new post-doctoral fellow, E'mett Williams, they are now extending this work to the study of buprenorphine, a novel therapeutic compound for the treatment of heroin addiction in order to determine its safety for use during pregnancy. The Early Development of Motivational Systems Dr. Barr's research focuses on the neural circuitry that mediates the functional effects of opioid peptides and opiate drugs. He is mapping the neural substrates for opiate induced analgesia and opiate induced reward to determine how those substrates change during normal pre- and postnatal development. Most recently, he and his co-workers have begun to describe in detail the opiate abstinence syndrome that is seen in the neonatal rat following chronic treatment with opiate drugs. Understanding the physiological mechanisms of that syndrome will aid in our understanding of the effects of prenatal exposure of human infants to heroin and methadone. Dr. Myers has found further evidence of important linkages between feeding behavior in infancy and certain longterm developmental effects individual of variation in this basic behavior of neonates. In studies of newborn human infants, he and his colleagues have found an unexpected relationship between high birth weight and reduced cardiovascular reactivity during feeding. In rat studies, he has gathered evidence that the longterm consequences of rapid weight gain early in life on obesity and hypertension are more pronounced in males. Investigations of the mechanisms underlying these findings are ongoing. Dr. Yongue continued his work on neural mechanisms underlying the ingestive behavior and cardiovascular function of inbred strains of rats. In the past year, his work has focused on findings from his laboratory that fetal neural grafts from a genetic hypertensive strain alter blood pressure and ingestive behavior in normotensive hosts. In addition, Drs. Yongue and Resit Canbeyli continued their investigations of neuroendocrine differences in salt appetite during early development in genetic hypertensive and normotensive rats. Early Separation Anxiety Drs. Hofer, Brunelli, Shair, and Carden are studying the psychobiological mechanisms by which separation of young rats from their home nest, siblings, and mother induces a high rate of separation calling. They have found that this infant behavior responds (selectively) to drugs that alleviate or that produce severe anxiety in human adults. Thus, the brain systems involved appear to be remarkably similar to those thought to be responsible for human anxiety disorders. Dr. Brunelli completed initial studies on a genetically diverse strain of rats (N:NIH) that are now being selectively bred for high and for low levels of isolation distress calling during infancy. This line of work investigates the association of early separation distress with adult measures of anxiety, as a model for the development and inheritance of anxiety disorders. Dr. Carden has shown that the three different types of opioid receptors begin to contribute specifically to certain isolation and attachment behaviors of rat pups as soon as three days after birth. She has been able to measure differences in brain opioid levels (met-enkephalin) as a result of isolation, providing a potential link between attachment and brain mechanisms of reward. An Animal Model of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Two major difficulties in combating the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are identifying which infants are at greatest risk for this devastating phenomenon, and predicting when these events might occur. Home monitoring of infants thought to be at risk has proved expensive and ineffectual. In our animal model of SIDS, Drs. Shair, Myers, and Hofer have recently found that, prior to experimental manipulation, high heart rate is a predictor of susceptibility to unexpected mortality. After our experimental procedures, low heart rate predicts impending death. These results show how animal models can suggest complex and unimagined patterns that may underlie the difficulties in predicting risk of human disease. Research Training The department continues to play a central role in an NIMH-funded Research Training Program for postdoctoral fellows in the Psychobiological Sciences, directed by Dr. Hofer. The 20 faculty members represent five other departments from Psychiatric Institute and the Perinatology Division of the Pediatrics department at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students from Columbia, Hunter College, and several other universities conduct research and receive training in the department. Dr. Jonathan Polan, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell, began a two-year advanced research training fellowship in this department with funding from the Reader's Digest Foundation .

A sample of 294 women were interviewed at the time of referral to A-PLUS, with follow-up interviews conducted 12 and 24 months after baseline. Current data analyses focus on the relationship of A-PLUS services to housing stability, psychiatric status, and use of treatment services. Preliminary findings indicate that a third of the sample remained homeless after two years; 10% were in institutional settings (hospitals, jails); and the remaining 56% were housed-either independently (17%), with relatives (12%), or in supportive community settings (27%). Dr. Struening (Principal Investigator), Dr. Barrow (Co-Principal Investigator) and Ms. Córdova extended the data collection phase for their Follow-up Study of Adult Shelter Residents, which has entailed tracing and reinterviewing a sample of over 1,000 men and women initially interviewed in a 1987 survey of municipal shelter residents. The primary locus of field activity has shifted from the shelter system to other institutional and community settings. Current analyses of preliminary data focus on residence history and baseline psychiatric/substance abuse status as predictors of subsequent patterns of homelessness and shelter use. Dr. Barrow, as Principal Investigator, is beginning a study of low demand interim housing services provided by outreach and drop-in programs that serve homeless adults living on the streets and in other public places. The evaluation will examine the programs' effectiveness in transitioning clients to permanent housing and linking them to psychiatric treatment, substance abuse programs, and other support services. Dr. Patricia Cohen was President of the Society for Multivariate Experimental Psychology during this year. Her presidential address, delivered at the annual meeting at Princeton University, was entitled Childhood Risks for Adult Personality Disorder: Method and Substance. It reviewed the impact of 36 risks measured during childhood on young adult personality disorder in the longitudinal cohort studied in the Children in the Community study on which she has been Principal Investigator over the past 12 years. A symposium on related issues was featured at the meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, where papers based on the same study were presented by Dr. Cohen on the continuity of disruptive disorders into adulthood, by Dr. Stephanie Kasen on the adult consequences of adolescent disorder, by Dr. Anne Provet on a comparison of environment, family, and child characteristics as childhood risks for adult psychopathology, by Dr. David Bernstein on continuity of personality disorder from adolescence to adulthood, by Dr. Jason Liu on neurasthenia in this cohort, and by Dr. Judith Brook on risks for and consequences of illicit drug use in adolescence. Dr. Cohen continued work on the two projects on this cohort and its offspring, on which she is Principal Investigator, and on two related projects on which she is Co-Principal Investigator. A Research Scientist Development Award was given to Dr. Cheryl Slomkowski, with Dr. Cohen and Dr. David Shaffer as mentors. She also continues as a member of the Services Review Group at the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH). Dr. Mark Olfson helped to conduct a statewide study of the general hospital inpatients treatment of schizophrenia, developed a scale to measure the inpatient treatment of schizophrenia, examined national trends in utilization of mental health services and prescription of psychotropic medications, and assisted with the development of a novel system to facilitate the diagnosis of mental disorders in primary care. Dr. Rodrick Wallace's work for the period again focused on understanding the processes of outward diffusion of social disintegration and its correlates of deterioration in public health and public order from collapsing inner city communities into larger metropolitan regions. This has resulted in a number of papers published and in press, including one which examines the diffusion of AIDS, TB, violent crime, and low birthweight in eight United States metropolitan areas containing over 54 million people. AIDS was found to be diffusing outward near size of the eight, TB near five, violent crime near two, and low birthweight near one. All four pathologies were found to be diffusing into the suburbs near New York City. Dr. Daniel Herman received a five-year Scientist Development Award from NIMH which will permit him to obtain additional training in epidemiological and statistical methods at Columbia University's School of Public Health, and to conduct research under the mentorship of several senior researchers. His mentors include Drs. Struening, Link, and Cohen (of Epidemiology of Mental Disorders), as well as Drs. Christina Hoven, Ezra Susser, and Janet Williams. Dr. Herman's primary research focus continues to be on the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and adverse psychosocial outcomes during adulthood such as mental disorder, substance abuse, and homelessness. He published a paper in the American Journal of Public Health on the association between childhood foster care experience and depressive symptoms in adulthood, and is currently examining childhood risk factors for homelessness in data collected as part of Dr. Link's nationwide study of formerly homeless people. Dr. Bruce Link conducted research as Principal Investigator on two projects-an NIMH-funded study of the experience of homelessness in a nationwide sample of formerly homeless people and an intervention study designed to help people with mental illness cope with stigma, which was funded by a NARSAD Senior Investigator Award. Dr. Link published a major paper in the American Journal of Public Health concerning the surprising number of people who have experienced homelessness in the United States. He is now analyzing data about the psychosocial and mental health risk factors for homelessness based on this nationwide data. With respect to his research interest in stigma, Dr. Link, Dr. Struening, and colleagues have developed an intervention and are testing it in a randomized trial in a clubhouse setting for people with severe mental illness. Dr. Howard Andrews, together with Dr. Doris Goldberg of the New York City Department of Health and Dr. Virginia Rauh of the Columbia School of Public Health's Division of Population and Family Health, have been developing several projects based on the linkage of large data sets containing information on childhood risk and educational outcomes. One paper has been accepted for publication and two grant proposals have been submitted. The proposals involve use of the linked dataset to conduct comprehensive evaluations of the Head Start Program in New York City, using school outcomes data, including identification of children with emotional disorders in the school system. John Pittman and Howard Andrews, co-directors of the department's Database Management and Statistical Analysis Unit (DBM/SAU), have developed five long-term contracts for data management and statistical analysis. Three full-time RFMH staff members are supported by these contracts. A grant proposal that would involve an additional contract has been submitted. The impact of a relative with severe mental illness on the well being of a designated caregiver is a multi-site longitudinal study of hospitalized psychiatric patients. Drs. Elmer Struening (Principal Investigator), Phyllis Vine, Ann Stueve, Bruce Link, Dolores Kreisman, and Ms. Maureen Ellis and Margaret Newmark are assessing the impact of a relative with severe mental illness on a designated caretaker and other members of the household. Baseline interviews have been administered to 180 designated caretakers at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Westchester County. The follow-up protocol has been completed on 75% of the baseline sample. The liaison teams are comprised of Drs. Sig Ackerman, Marcia G. Torres, and Ms. Judith Greenwald, and Dr. Ken Terkelsen, Ms. Judith Guberman and Susan G. Salit, respectively. Baseline data are being analyzed for initial reports and papers. Studies of change in caregivers as a function of symptom remission and behavioral stabilization in their relatives are in progress. The Biosocial Treatment Research Division finished collecting data for the Work in Family-Aided Assertive Community Treatment project (funded by a NIMH Community Support Project Grant), and was engaged in cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. Preliminary analyses provided encouragement that our primary hypothesis for the study would be supported: that is, that FACT clients would be more likely to be employed than the conventional vocational rehabilitation (CVR) clients.

These issues are investigated outside the laboratory in population groups that are studied over time. The drugs of interest include cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, other illicit drugs, and medically prescribed drugs. Our investigations are currently based on four samples: (l) a longitudinal cohort of former New York State high school students that we have followed for nineteen years from adolescence to the mid-thirties (N=1,160), with data from the two oldest children aged 9 to 17 (N=385), spouses and partners when living in the household (N=621), and teachers (422); (2) a national longitudinal sample of young adults (N=12,000) and the women's first-born preadolescent children aged 10 and over (N=581) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY); (3) a random sample of 7th-12th graders representative of junior and senior high school students in public and private New York State schools, drawn from 53 schools throughout the state (N=7,611); and (4) multiple national cross-sectional samples of the general population aged 12 and over from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse, varying in size from 8,000 to 29,000 individuals. Our major activities have continued to focus on the impact of parental substance abuse-in particular, maternal use in pregnancy-on children's own drug use and development. We had discovered a significant relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy on the child smoking thirteen years later, especially daughters, with controls for prenatal drinking, current maternal smoking, and other factors. This past year, we investigated the impact of prenatal drinking. Heavy prenatal maternal drinking increases the risk of the child drinking. However, prenatal smoking appears to have a more pervasive effect than prenatal drinking on adolescent drug use, since, in addition to its effect on smoking, it affects adolescent drinking. These findings are of great public health import and represent a substantial advance in our understanding of the etiology of substance use. The perinatal effects of maternal drug use suggest novel ways of examining latent and long-term effects of drug consumption during pregnancy. Such consumption may affect brain functioning in utero functionally and in ways that do not become apparent until the child has had opportunities to try the substances. Children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy may also be at greater risk of becoming dependent on a variety of drugs other than nicotine. This is an hypothesis that we plan to test in our further work. We are also exploring the processes, such as increases in behavioral problems in childhood, through which the maternal prenatal effect on drug use would express itself in adolescence. This past year, under support from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), we initiated a new area of investigation on the relationship between patterns of drug use and drug dependence. The department has also been involved in two major collaborations. One collaboration is with members of the Department of Child Psychiatry in methodological studies of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents (child MECA). The second collaboration is with the Program on Human Development and Criminal Behavior at Harvard University, a prospective longitudinal study of individual and community risk factors for delinquency and substance abuse.WT02-B10-177IA093-000995-B030-53http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_GC.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072918 text/html 4998HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:33:25 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4868 Gen Clinical Research General Clinical Research Service Lyle Rosnick, M.D., Director Richard Brockman, M.D., Assistant Director Andrew E. Skodol, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) III In 1994, the General Clinical Research Service (PI 5) continued to devote 12 to 15 of its beds to research and treatment of patients with severe personality disorders. The remainder of the beds were reserved for depressed and/or suicidal adults and teenagers who participated in studies sponsored by the Departments of Biological Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Child Psychiatry. During the year, Drs. Craig Tomlinson and Adele Tutter did senior resident electives on the Service. The Unit for Personality Studies (UPS) research protocol, which utilized standardized instruments for the assessment of DSM-III-R personality disorders, continued in data-analytic and report-writing phases. Combining data collected on PI 5 patients with data on patients from the Psychoanalytic Center and the Depression Evaluation Service (DES), the Unit for Personality Studies published reports on the validity of self-report scales for personality disorders, the validity of self-defeating personality disorders and serotonergic sensitivity in borderline personality disorder. A paper on Axis I/Axis II comorbidity was accepted for publication. Papers on the relationship of anxiety disorders to personality disorders and on the specificity of dependent personality disorder for depression were submitted for publication. These studies continued under the direction of Andrew Skodol, M.D. with the participation of Drs. John Oldham, Steven Hyler, Lyle Rosnick, David Kellman, Ron Goldman, Jane Waters, Norman Doidge, Patrick McGrath, Peggy Gallaher, Susan Vaughan, Eric Hollander, and Dan Stein. This past year PI 5 continued to serve as the site of an investigation of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment for major depression. This project, sponsored by the Department of Biological Psychiatry, is headed by Dr. Harold Sackeim, Principal Investigator, with Joan Prudic, M.D., and D.P. Devanand, M.D., as Co-Principal Investigators, assisted by M. Nobler, M.D. and Barbara Erwin-Mcguire, Ph.D. until August 1994, and Shoshana Peyser, M.S.W. thereafter. In 1994, twelve patients were admitted to PI 5 for this protocol. This work was given a MERIT Award from NIMH with funding through 1995 and an extension to 2000. The findings from the second ECT study, completed in 1990, have been extensively published, with 81 articles in print or press, and eight more in review. Several data sets are in preparation for further publications. In addition, ten patients admitted to PI 5 also participated in a second multi-center study on continuation pharmacotherapy following ECT, now in its third year. The Division of Neurochemistry continued a large study of various forms of self-injuring behaviors. Over a period of three years, 180 individuals with depression, suicidal behavior, other self-injuring behavior and compulsive hair-pulling (trichotillomania) will be studied in a battery of neuropharmacological and psychological assessments. This research project, led by Dr. Barbara Stanley, is a continuation of previous research that has been carried out by the Division of Neurochemistry over the last seven years and will focus on dysregulation of the serotonin neurotransmitter system in people at high risk for various self-directed, damaging behaviors, particularly suicide. Clinical applications of the results of the study will include developing strategies to reduce the risk of dangerous suicidal behavior among people at high risk for such behavior. In addition, this study will obtain genetic material from 500 individuals, providing a database for the study of possible genetic markers of these conditions. Data from this study will also provide an opportunity to examine biological correlates of severe character pathology. In addition to the scientific and medical value of these investigations, the applied goal of this kind of research should lead to strategies which may enable doctors to reduce the risk of dangerous behaviors, allowing patients to avoid hospitalizations and continue safely in outpatient treatment.

Wilder, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Jeanne Teresi, Ed.D., Ph.D., Research Scientist IV Peter Cross, M.Phil., Research Scientist III Eloise H.P. Killefer, M.Ed., Research Scientist III During 1994, the department (also known as the Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology) was involved in the following on-going research projects. Research Projects The Morris W. Stroud III Program on Scientific Approaches to Quality of Life in Health and Aging This program is supported by a bequest from the late Dr. Stroud, a pioneer in rehabilitation medicine. Drs. Barry Gurland and Sidney Katz (Professor Emeritus of Geriatric Medicine at Columbia) are Co-Directors. An important theme of this program deals with changes in qualities of life accompanying mental health problems in aging. Related secondary analyses of data sets from the Center's major collaborative studies, the North Manhattan Aging Project, Active Life Expectancy Study, and Growing Older in New York City survey, have been supported by this program, leading to better understanding of the relative usefulness of competing concepts of dementia and depression for predicting problems in the quality of everyday living and demands on services. Ethno-racial comparisons revealed that substantial differences between Latinos, African-Americans, and Non-Latino Whites in rates of dementia and depression could be linked to corresponding impacts on qualities of life. The laptop computer-assisted interview covering qualities of life, developed by Dr. Jiming Chen, has now been administered to over 2,500 elders in their homes. The Stroud Program continued formal mentorship and partial support for Dr. Zachary Pine's Career Development Award to develop objective measures for assessing impairments of functioning in dementia, and to investigate affective responses to disability. The Program also continued mentorship of Dr. Terry Fulmer's National Brookdale Fellowship in finding objective measures of the match between capacity for independence and permitted autonomy in elders with mental disorders. With Dr. Steven Albert of the Sergievsky Center, the Stroud Program delivered a course on health related qualities of life, thus initiating the first formal curriculum in this field. Corresponding content has been inserted in the offerings of the Geriatric Education Center. North Manhattan Aging Project (NMAP) (Barry Gurland, M.D., Principal Investigator, and David Wilder, Ph.D., Co-Principal Investigator). NMAP was renewed for a second five-year period as part of the Program Project (Epidemiology of Dementia in an Urban Community) funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and conducted in collaboration with Drs. Richard Mayeux and Yaakov Stern of the Sergievsky Center and Psychiatric Institute. During the first five years, a case registry was established to identify and assess all cases of Alzheimer's and related dementias in the area of North Manhattan bounded by 155th Street to the south, 181st Street to the north, and by the Hudson and Harlem rivers, so that cross-cultural epidemiologic comparisons can be made among elderly Latino, African-American and Non-Latino White residents. A case reporting component of the registry occupied the first three years of the study and has been followed by a survey component. Each component evaluated over 2,000 of the target area elders. Prevalence of dementia among elders aged 65 and older was estimated from the case reporting component using thirteen different case definitions. Larger estimates resulted from the survey component, which was more successful than the reporting component in identifying early stage dementias in the community. Higher rates were found among Latinos and African-Americans than Non-Latino Whites in both registry components. Separate multiple regression analyses of the case reporting and survey component samples both showed age and education to be significantly related to rates of dementia, but neither gender nor ethnic/race, was significantly related when age and education were controlled. The continuation award maintains the collaboration with the Sergievsky Center and includes a study of the function/quality complex in borderzone cognitive impairment (Dr. Barry Gurland, Principal Investigator) and the survey and assessment core (Dr. David Wilder, Principal Investigator). Dr. Jeanne Teresi has led the statistical strategies, based on her work on item response theory, for deriving culture-fair scales for assessment of cognitive impairment. Ms. Eloise Killeffer has worked to effect closure on the informant interview sector of the North Manhattan Aging Project (963 completed interviews and a better than 90% response rate). These informant data have refined the distinguishing features of early dementia, its consequences for patient and family, and the estimation of service needs and fulfillment. Active Life Expectancy Among Urban Minority Elders With Dr. Rafael Lantigua, Principal Investigator, Dr. David Wilder, Co-Principal Investigator, and Drs. Barry Gurland and Sidney Katz, Co-Investigators, this project began the fourth year of a five-year study of transitions in function among elders in North Manhattan. It is funded by the National Institute on Aging, in collaboration with the Division of General Medicine and the Sergievsky Center, and coordinated with the North Manhattan Aging Project and the Stroud Program. Initial bilingual (Spanish and English) interviews were completed with a probability sample of over 2,100 community elders in their homes, and informant interviews and examinations by physicians were conducted for large subsamples (n=948 and 1,178 respectively). First follow-up assessments are currently underway, and second follow-ups are scheduled for the fifth year of the study. Cross-sectional analysis has included ethno-racial comparisons of disability and accompanying depression, development and refining of quality of life measures, and comparing informant and subject reports of functioning with performance test results. Quality of Life and Care of Elders in New York City Analyses continue on data from this study of 1,570 older New Yorkers, which was conducted in collaboration with the New York Community Trust Center for Policy on Aging and the Fordham University Third Age Center. Dr. Barry Gurland is the Principal Investigator of this study, and Dr. Cathy Berkman is the Co-Principal Investigator. With special emphasis on the very old and minority persons (African-American and Latino), the study focused on functional impairment, depression, and cognitive impairment. A report on the study was disseminated in 1993-94 among planning agencies by the New York Community Trust. Data analysis is now focused on the relationship between economic status, depression, and disability, and other aspects of quality of life in the elderly. Analyses in 1994 showed that rates of chronic physical and mental illness are highly related to income even in the middle income ranges. A comparison of cognitive impairment observed in the recent 1990 study and in our previous 1975 survey, indicate that prevalence of dementia may have increased over this period of time. Laboratory for Investigation of Objective Functioning Under the direction of Dr. Zachary Pine, a physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, a laboratory has been established for the investigation of neural and physiological mechanisms underlying impaired function in the tasks of daily living. This work is supported by a Federal Individual Physician Scientist Career Development Award, with clinical mentoring provided by Dr. Barry Gurland. Techniques have been developed and piloted for measuring impairments in vision, strength, sensation, and joint range of motion. Performance measures of integrated tasks such as ambulation and reaching for objects are also employed. Brain strategies underlying reaching tasks are being analyzed using computer-based motion tracking. The technique employs miniature electromagnetic sensors, and is designed for portability. This new and mobile system of investigation will focus upon early changes in functioning in dementia, which may be subclinical. Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment in Health and Aging Seminar This seminar is sponsored by the Stroud Program as part of an effort to foster quality of life research, including its applications to mental health and disorders. Taught jointly by Dr. Steven Albert and Dr. Barry Gurland, the course offers a state-of-the-art assessment of quality of life (QoL) inquiry. The course is offered through the School of Public Health at Columbia University for the spring semester. The following topics are covered as part of the seminar: health utility measurements, assessment in special populations, applications to quality assurance, medical technology, policy analysis, and related topics. New York Statewide Psychogeriatric Program This program is co-directed by Drs. John Toner and Barry Gurland, and supported by the New York State Office of Mental Health. It consists of two major components-education and research-organized around a geriatric psychiatry fellowship at Willard Psychiatric Center and Binghamton Psychiatric Center, both in upstate New York. The program focuses on preparing psychiatrists in the practice of geriatric psychiatry related to the transition of the public mental health system from a concentration on inpatients to integrated hospital and community mental health sites of service. The research is conducted by faculty-fellow partnerships working on the knowledge base underlying the development and implementation of innovative clinical modules. Current research activities include: a cross-national collaborative project on community reinvestment in New York State and the United Kingdom; a 25-year follow-up of the 1968-69 US-UK Cross National Diagnostic Study cohort; and studies of the diagnosis of dementia in the non-communicating elderly, the development of a scale for delusional depression, the effects of DNR on nursing home staff behaviors, causes of agitated behaviors in dementia, psychiatric differences between vascular and organic brain disorders, and a 10-year retrospective autopsy study of cerebral arteriosclerosis. Research Training and Information Transfer (RTIT) The RTIT Core of the Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research (Dr. Michael Shelanski, Principal Investigator) is now in the first year of its five-year renewal (1994-99) under Dr. Barry Gurland, Principal Investigator, and Dr. Ruth Bennett, Project Director. Content on Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be integrated into a course entitled "Long Term Care with an Emphasis on AD," offered within the School of Public Health. A new mini-residency was designed by Dr. Virginia Barrett, entitled "The Effect of Information on Quality of Life of Elders with Dementia and Their Families." A program of transfer of information to community advocates was initiated under Dr. Jiming Chen and Aline Ratau and entitled "Community Empowerment through Research Information." This involves the communication of relevant research information about North Manhattan elders to community agencies serving these elders. Co-sponsorship of events included the Alzheimer Information Day at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center on December 7, 1994. Organization and Effectiveness of Home-Delivered Services to Elders In 1994, this became a new focus of research under the leadership of Peter Cross with Dr. Jeanne Teresi and Eloise Killeffer. Such services-most notably, personal care services-have been among the most rapidly growing health services, swelling to over a billion dollars a year of public money in New York City alone. Of special interest is the articulation of home-based services with mental health and general medical services. This new thrust was inaugurated in a Stroud Distinguished Lecture by Dr. Morton Kramer in May 1993. Preliminary work has included a secondary analysis of data from the North Manhattan Aging Project on home care recipients to examine putative home care eligibility criteria, submitted as a contract report to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and a report on possible reforms of home care, submitted to the New York State Department of Health. Ongoing studies of home care are planned for the Upper West Side of Manhattan, an area with a high rate and number of home-care recipients. Home-care utilization data for this area has been obtained and analyzed preliminary to submission for funding of a large longitudinal study of the home-care population with special focus on their mental health problems and use of mental health services. Columbia University-New York Geriatric Education Center This project is a new three-year initiative under the direction of Dr. Terry Fulmer, with Co-directors Drs. Barry Gurland and Rafael Lantigua from Columbia University, Dr. Mathy Mezey from New York University, and Dr. Robert Kennedy from Beth Abraham Hospital. Funded by the Federal Bureau of Health Professions, it is a consortium of three institutions providing a five-day certificate program in interdisciplinary geriatric training to a wide range of professionals throughout New York State. It includes three days of core activities on geriatric assessment, multiculturalism, elder abuse, long-term care, nutrition, bioethics, Alzheimer's disease, and quality of life. In addition there are two days of intensive work in a choice of specialty modules on any core topic of geropsychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, occupational and physical therapy, dentistry, social work, and nursing. Full day conferences provide additional opportunities for learning. The interdisciplinary and multi-cultural focus provides professionals with the most up-to-date material available. The train-the-trainer approach with a short term intensive learning experience promotes leadership with the enthusiasm to institute change and to improve the quality of health care the elderly. Community Outreach Education on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in North Manhattan and Harlem Funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) for the period 1992-95 (Dr. Ruth Bennett, Principal Investigator) this project continued its regional AD outreach education work. A brochure describing all programs and services related to AD continues to be circulated. The North Manhattan Community Information Center on Memory Loss, an AD resource center funded by this grant at the Fort Washington Houses and Services for the Elderly, has reached over 50 community service organizations including churches and senior centers in Harlem and North Manhattan, which have received talks from Center bilingual outreach workers. Initial requests are highest for respite and support services.WT02-B10-179IA093-000995-B030-88http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_HV.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072941 text/html 18722HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:33:47 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 18591 HIV Center HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D., Director Zena A. Stein, M.A., M.B., B.Ch., Co-Director CPMC - Behavioral Sciences Research Training in HIV Infection In September, 1987, the National Institute of Mental Health in conjunction with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) awarded a five-year research grant to establish the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) in New York City. In 1992, the Center underwent a successful renewal process and was awarded another research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health for the next five years-February 1, 1993 to January 31, 1998. The mission of the first phase of the HIV Center was to study all aspects of HIV infection in order to develop appropriate treatment and intervention strategies. In its second five years, the HIV Center continues to be dedicated to interdisciplinary studies on the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV, with efforts focused within the thematic context-Determinants of Sexual Risk Behavior and Model Interventions for Behavior Change-and targeting heterosexual women and men, gay men, children, and adolescents. Sexual-risk behavior and behavior change are tackled from many different perspectives: with both genders (exploring the gender-specificity of behavioral determinants), at different developmental points (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), in various social contexts (the individual level, the couple level, the parent/child dyad, and social networks), with infected people and people at risk, among ethnically diverse populations, for special populations (depressed adolescent girls, homeless mentally ill men and women), and for different sexual orientations. The studies on behavior focus on the elucidation of determinants that can be modified to increase safer sex. The intervention studies are clinical trials with relatively small samples, allowing detailed examination of a large number of determinants and identification of components critical to the success of larger programmatic interventions. Thus, the goal is to isolate key elements of behavior change that can subsequently be used by programs in local communities, nationwide, and internationally. HIV Center Cores The core and project concept that worked effectively during the first five years of the HIV Center has been retained. Cores of the HIV Center are: Psychosocial/Qualitative Assessment Core (Principal Investigator, Susan Tross, Ph.D.) guides and advises HIV Center projects and assures that psychological and social theory and methods are kept sharply in focus in the design, implementation, and evaluation of research assessment. Issues of acculturation and transculturation are given special attention. The core played a major role in the development and leadership of several successful grant proposals that were developed and/or funded in 1994. Dr. Tross is a Co-investigator on the NIMH-funded HIV Risk in NYC's Homosexually Active Latin American Men, with Dr. Alex Carballo-Diéguez as Principal Investigator. A SAMHSA grant, Mental Health Services for Families Affected by HIV, is directed by Dr. Jennifer Havens as Principal Investigator. And the NIMH has also funded the AIDS Prevention Behavioral Consortium Psychosexual Assessment Core (Principal Investigator, Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D.) develops and provides instruments for the assessment of sexual risk behavior, oversees the quality control of assessments, and trains and monitors sex interviewers. Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core (Principal Investigator, Zena Stein, M.D.) advises in the solution of design problems and analysis of project data, maintains an overview of multidisciplinary data, provides statistical review of manuscripts, conducts regularly scheduled clinics, workshops, and seminars, and oversees data entry applications, project management procedures, and quality control procedures. The core includes the Data Bank, coordinated and managed by Dr. Meyer-Bahlburg, resulting from the studies of disease progression among gay men and injection-drug using men and women that was begun during the first five years of the HIV Center. Information Exchange Core (Principal Investigator, Patricia A. Warne, Ph.D.) provides a mechanism for bidirectional communication between the HIV Center and professional and general communities locally, nationally, and internationally. The core comprises the Community Liaison Program, led by Joyce Hunter, the Media-Based Intervention/Education Program, the International Program, and the Professional Education/Information Dissemination Program. In 1994, the Media-Based Intervention/Education Program produced two AIDS-prevention public service announcements, one for adolescent/young adult women, and the other for adolescent/young adult men. Both will be aired on WNYC-TV and on Time Warner Cable of New York City in Spring 1995. Also underway is a project to develop and air AIDS-prevention/education radio spots for heterosexually active young African-American adults. The AIDS-prevention video, Breaking the Silence, developed with Latinas and taped in Washington Heights, premiered in 1994 at a reception for the community at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The latest HIV Center video, Working It Out: Scenes from the Lives of Lesbian and Gay Youth, was produced this year and is being used by service providers working with lesbian and gay adolescents to effect HIV risk reduction behaviors. Ethics, Policy, and Legal Core (Principal Investigator, Ronald Bayer, Ph.D.) collaborates with the Columbia University School of Public Health to bring together ethicists, public policy experts, clinicians, philosophers, lawyers, and economists to serve the HIV Center by providing consultation to the research projects, initiating empirical studies on questions with an ethical or policy dimension, and providing an institutional context in which core members present their own ongoing HIV-related research on ethical, legal, and policy issues for critical review at monthly meetings. HIV Center Projects Determinants of Sexual Problem Behaviors in Childhood (Principal Investigator, Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D.) studies the emergence of sexual problem behaviors in children who are at increased risk for disruptive behavior/conduct disorders. The project adds onto a longitudinal project in the Lowenstein Center of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry on determinants of disruptive behavior/conduct disorders among elementary school-aged boys who are the younger brothers of juveniles adjudicated in New York Family Court for personal or property offenses. Developing methods for the study of childhood sexual problem behaviors among both boys and girls, HIV Center investigators aim to identify predictors of sexual problem behaviors and to explore whether or not those factors also predict disruptive behavior/conduct disorders. Thus far, they have found that parent-child communication about sex seems largely limited to negative statements, and that many parents, uncertain about how to talk to their children about sex, express great need for assistance in this area. Results from this study will contribute to the development of programs to prevent sexual problem behaviors in childhood and early adolescence. HIV Risk and Coming-Out Among Gay and Lesbian Adolescents (Principal Investigator, Margaret Rosario, Ph.D.) examines the developmental process of establishing one's sexual identity, the effect of that coming-out process on HIV-related and non-HIV-related risk behaviors, and the social norms and socially competent responses for negotiating safer sex and coming-out among adolescents who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. The first data from the study indicate that these adolescents are at risk for HIV and that their coming-out experiences contribute to HIV risk behaviors. For example, over 40% of the adolescents self-identifying as lesbian reported having had at least one male sexual partner who injected drugs, had a sexually-transmitted disease (STD), was HIV-positive or had AIDS, or was gay or bisexual. Lesbians reporting at least one lifetime male sexual partner who was gay or bisexual were likely to have been rejected by their mothers or fathers for being lesbian. Thus, HIV prevention programs must target lesbian girls. This study will provide guidelines for tailoring HIV prevention programs to adolescents who are struggling with issues of establishing their sexual identity. AIDS Prevention for Girls in Therapy for Depression (Principal Investigator, Donna Moreau, M.D.) has developed and will implement and evaluate a prevention program to delay the initiation of sexual activity and to eliminate or reduce HIV-related risk behaviors among high-risk adolescents-depressed Latino adolescent girls living in New York City. A central question in the AIDS prevention program is whether mothers can play a role in preventing sexual risk behaviors in their daughters, who are recruited from the Child Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. In order to reduce the incidence of sexual behaviors that place women and men at risk for HIV and other STDs, the project Sexual Risk Behavior Change in Heterosexual Women and Men (Principal Investigator, Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.) has developed and is testing an HIV/STD prevention program for heterosexual African-American, Latino, and Caucasian women who do not currently use drugs and who are of unknown or negative HIV serostatus. The women's study assesses barriers and facilitators of safer sex with an emphasis on issues of sexuality and gender, analyzing specific determinants of sexual risk behavior in the context of women's actual lives. Working with women recruited from a family planning clinic in Brooklyn, investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of eight- and four-session versions of a culturally sensitive intervention program. The study thus can test the validity and relevance of a theoretical model of HIV risk reduction. A qualitative, exploratory investigation has also been initiated with heterosexual men recruited from an STD clinic to identify gender-specific barriers to sexual behavior change and potential strategies for developing interventions for heterosexual men. Primary Prevention for Male HIV-Serodiscordant Couples (Principal Investigator, Robert H. Remien, Ph.D.) is a three-year study of 90 male couples having Puerto Rican and /or Anglo members who are of known discordant HIV serostatus. The investigators assess the contextual and psychological determinants of sexual risk behavior for both the couple and the individual in order to provide the foundation for a theory-driven intervention to reduce high-risk sexual behavior in this population. More than half the participating couples are discrepant in reporting risk behavior, and one-third disagree about what is risky. There are also ethnic differences in sexual behavior of Anglo and Puerto Rican men. In addition to reducing sexual risk behavior, the intervention under development will aim to increase and sustain mutual support and care-giving and decrease adverse reactions to HIV in the relationship. Having studied the determinants of HIV risk behaviors among psychiatric patients in the Fort Washington shelter for men in New York City, investigators of the Critical Time Intervention to Reduce HIV Risk Behaviors Among Homeless Mentally Ill Individuals Project (Principal Investigator, Ezra Susser, M.D., Dr.P.H.) have now proceeded with the development and testing of an intervention to reduce the frequency of unprotected sex among minority homeless mentally ill men. This population is mainly African-American and Latino, chronically ill, socially disadvantaged, and often afflicted by cognitive impairments that impede social learning. Thus, the culturally appropriate intervention is highly focused on one or two outcomes, uses skills training methods that have proven effective in schizophrenia, targets critical barriers to behavior change, takes account of the patterns of sexual relationships among these patients, and addresses the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and risky sexual behaviors. The past year has also seen the completion of an elicitation study among homeless mentally ill women and the development of a grant application to support an intervention trial in this vulnerable population. Cohort Studies: Progression Of HIV Infection In addition to the cores and current projects of the HIV Center, several independently funded studies have arisen at CPMC that follow the cohorts of gay men and injection drug-using men and women assembled and studied by the HIV Center during its first five years. These include a program project on oral findings in HIV infection at the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery (Principal Investigator, Ira B. Lamster, D.D.S.) and a Dana Foundation drug trial consortium to study the treatment of HIV dementia and related cognitive disorders (Principal Investigator, Richard Mayeux, M.D.). Both of these programs are connected to the HIV Center with subcontracts (Principal Investigator, Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.) to utilize the Center's Data Bank. Through these collaborations, the Center has maintained its links with clinical and basic science colleagues and has continued to address issues of disease progression, treatment, and care. Training Activities The Behavioral Sciences Research Training Program in HIV Infection (Program Director, Zena Stein, M.D.; Training Director, Robert Kertzner, M.D.) provides postdoctoral fellowship training for research on behavioral, mental health, and public health issues in HIV infection. The HIV Center is also the training site for four Aaron Diamond Foundation Postdoctoral Fellows, the most recent being Blanca Ortiz-Torres, Ph.D., who was awarded a fellowship to study gender scripts and safer sex among Latinas, under the mentorship of Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D. Dr. Stein directs an international training program in the epidemiology of AIDS in South Africa, supported by a training grant from the Fogarty International Center. Conferences In July, 1994, HIV Center investigators attended the Second International Conference on the Biopsychosocial Impact of HIV Infection in Brighton, England, where they made 10 oral and eight poster presentations. In addition, Dr. Ehrhardt delivered a plenary address, Gender Risk Behavior and Intervention Programs For Women. At the Tenth International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama, Japan in August, 1994, Dr. Stein delivered a plenary address on methods women can use for HIV prevention, and Joyce Hunter moderated a panel, Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS, and was an organizer of the Women's Satellite Conference for the International AIDS Society. Other Grant Support HIV Center investigators have played a key role in the following grants: Ezra S. Susser, M.D., Dr.P.H., is Principal Investigator and Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D., Co-Investigator of a NIMH grant to study HIV risk behavior among homeless mentally ill men. Francine Cournos, M.D., is Principal Investigator of a training grant from SAMHSA, HIV Training for Providers to the Severely Mentally Ill. Susan Tross, Ph.D. is Principal Investigator of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-funded Lower East Side Health Project assessing the efficacy of a peer outreach/media distribution program for HIV-related condom use attitudes, intentions, and behavior in inner city women who are sexual partners of injection drug users. She is Co-Investigator of a grant from SAMHSA to develop and evaluate mental health services for families affected by HIV (Principal Investigator, Jennifer Havens, M.D.). Dr. Tross is also Clinical Director of the Comprehensive Care Center for Addicted Mothers and Infants supported by NIDA at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center. Dr. Alex Carballo-Diéguez was awarded a grant from NIMH to explore interethnic variations in factors associated with sexual risk behavior among Latin American men in New York City who have sex with men. Current recipients of Aaron Diamond Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowships from the HIV Center are Claude A. Mellins, Ph.D (Mentor, Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.) to study stress, social support, and psychosocial functioning of HIV-infected mothers and children; Robert Klitzman, M.D. (Mentor, Mervyn Susser, M.D.) to study self-disclosure of HIV serostatus; and Paul Colson, Ph.D. (Mentor, Ezra Susser, M.D., Dr. P.H.) to study adherence to TB chemoprophylaxis among the homeless mentally ill. Overall, the HIV Center strives to stay at the forefront of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, conducting research on heterosexual transmission, on ways women can protect themselves, on young people, on gay men who are at particularly high risk, and on populations with special mental health needs. The Center continues to serve as a resource for exchange with communities in New York, the United States, and many parts of the world.

Fieve, M.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research This past year the Department of Lithium Studies continued to screen for mood disorders in new patients who came to the clinic from the neighboring community, New York City, and the surrounding states. We treated patients by giving them psychotropic medications that have been shown to correct alterations in brain chemistry and to address their social needs. In turn, we collected detailed data for our research projects that focus on the multifactorial causes of mood disorders. Our research encompasses the genetic, biological, psychogenic, and environmental factors and their interplay. Once more we were reminded of the fact that the clinic model we have been using for over 20 years at the New York State Psychiatric Institute is presently the new focus of New York State's mental health system as it is emphasizing "preventive" psychiatric services at the community level (OMH News, September 1994) rather than treatment after an acute episode occurs. The "well-patient" community clinics, which Dr. Fieve and his team initiated in the early 1970s, are an effective and low-cost way of treating large numbers of patients who live at home and receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Our research this year was supported by the Marmot Foundation, the Milhauser grant, and the Depression Research Fund. Treatment Our specialized clinic at Psychiatric Institute focuses on patients who otherwise would not have access to therapy because of their financial and socioeconomic status. The main goal was to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of subsequent affective episodes and make them functioning members of the community. The Lithium Clinic's Head Research Nurse, Annemarie Schlegel, RN, participated in treatment, research, and clinical care of patients. Research Psychopharmacotherapy Projects during the year have included a study comparing a new third generation antidepressant paroxetine (Paxil) with a traditional tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil) in depressed patients. There were no significant differences between the two drugs in alleviating the symptoms of depression. However, paroxetine appeared to have more beneficial effects on the anxiety symptoms that are frequently associated with depression when compared to imipramine. Side effects for paroxetine were typical of other drugs that enhance serotonergic function but different from those of imipramine. We found paroxetine to be an effective and safe medication for controlling depression especially in the elderly, whose treatment often is complicated by age and related comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease. We also continued our study on the effectiveness of fluoxetine (Prozac), the first of the new class of antidepressant compounds (the so-called, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the treatment of major depressive disorder. We found Prozac to be as effective in treating depression as the standard tricyclic antidepressants. Patients taking Prozac experienced fewer side effects when compared with the traditionally used antidepressants. We demonstrated that Prozac can be prescribed to patients suffering from dysthymia, (the milder form of major depression) and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as to patients who suffer from bulimia. Dr. Fieve's book Prozac: Questions and Answers for Patients, Family, and Physicians, published by Avon Books in April 1994, puts forth for the general public the current thinking of our research group about Prozac. Using a longitudinal life-table model analysis, we assessed the prophylactic efficacy of lithium alone, administered within the context of a naturalistic clinical setting, by calculating the probability patients remaining free of an affective episode (manic or depressive) over a five-year course. In addition, for those who suffered a manic or depressive relapse, we attempted to analyze the subsequent course of patients who were then restabilized on lithium plus either a neuroleptic, carbamazepine, or a benzodiazepine, or lithium plus an antidepressant. Lithium alone offered an average 83% probability against an affective relapse after one year, 52% after three years, and 37% after five years. For patients who failed on lithium alone, it appeared that combination treatment offered greater protection against subsequent affective relapses than the initial course on lithium alone. We also continued to investigate alternatives to lithium to help those patients who are not able to take lithium due to kidney disease, cardiovascular problems, severe lithium intolerance, or electrolyte conditions. Our studies show carbamazepine, valproic acid, and klonopin to be effective alternatives in many manic depressive patients. In addition, we examined personality traits before and after pharmacological treatment for depression. We concluded, based on our data, that the melancholic subtype of depression is associated with greater frequency of Cluster A personality disorders than the non-melancholics. The department's research was done in collaboration with The Foundation for Depression and Manic Depression and Dr. Fieve's team at Columbia University. Genetics In a collaborative study with Dr. Miron Baron of the Department of Medical Genetics, we continued to collect epidemiological data from our Columbia University and Foundation patient populations. This study also included bipolar patients from other clinics in the US and abroad, thus making it the largest bipolar pedigree study reported to date. Results suggest that X-chromosome linkage can be applied to a small subgroup of bipolar cases; however, in light of conflicting findings and methodological uncertainties in studying a disorder with unclear phenotype and complex linkage data, an extension and re-evaluation of published data will be required to further an understanding of this intriguing hypothesis. Education We continue to educate the public at large as well as professionals at conferences in the US and abroad. The staff was also available for Columbia students and for resident teaching. Dr. Fieve appeared on CNN-"Sonya Live," on Channel 17-"Turning Point," Channel 1-"Good Day New York," and a number of radio shows discussing the affective disorders, in particular, depression and the effectiveness of Prozac and other SSRIs in treatment of this often debilitating illness. Two posters at the 33rd Annual ACNP meeting addressed the issues of the relationship between melancholia and personality and placebo response in depressive illness. At the sesquicentennial meeting of the American Psychiatric Association this past year, Dr. Fieve's work on lithium was considered one of several "milestones in American Psychiatry's first 150 years."WT02-B10-181IA093-000995-B030-119http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_ME.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073011 text/html 15594HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:34:07 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 15463 Medical Genetics Medical Genetics L. Erlenmeyer-Kimling, Ph.D., Acting Chief of Psychiatric Research Miron Baron, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II Charles A. Kaufmann, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II Dolores Malaspina, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) II David Friedman, Ph.D., Research Scientist VI T. Conrad Gilliam, Ph.D., Research Scientist VI Harlow K. Fischman, Ph.D., Research Scientist V M. Bento Soares, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Nancy S. Wexler, Ph.D., Head, Division of Neurology After achieving major breakthroughs in recent years, the Department of Medical Genetics continued to pursue research into the genetic basis of psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Molecular Genetics Unit Research in the Molecular Genetics Unit (MGU), directed by Dr. Conrad Gilliam, continues to focus on the genetics and pathogenesis of single-locus and complex heritable disorders in humans. In 1994, the MGU focused on seven major efforts: (1) continuing the gene-mapping effort to identify the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) gene; (2) beginning studies of the pathogenesis of heritable disorders by expressing and characterizing the copper-transporting ATPase that was identified by the MGU as the Wilson disease gene in 1993; (3) beginning a collaboration with Dr. Jurg Ott's Department of Statistical Genetics on the genetic mapping of an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa on chromosome 6, in which the lab is continuing to narrow the disease locus; (4) beginning a collaborative effort with a group in Finland to identify a rare single-locus gene for epilepsy; continuing large scale efforts to map predisposition genes for (5) bipolar affective disorder and (6) panic disorder; and (7) performing linkage studies on a small set of families with schizophrenia. The search for the SMA gene, now in its final stage, has led to the identification in the MGU of two genes as candidates for the disease locus. These genes, along with two genes identified by others, are preferentially deleted in SMA patients. The MGU has identified a basic transcription factor sub-unit and a cell cycle regulatory protein kinase that map to the deletion region in SMA patients and has formulated a theory about the role of the protein products of the genes in forming a nucleotide excision repair complex to protect against increased oxidative metabolism that is known to damage DNA. In the work on bipolar disorder, carried out collaboratively with Dr. Baron's Psychogenetics Division, genotyping of 100 DNA markers in 47 large families has led to detection of strong linkage to chromosome 21q22.3 in a single family. The data, which have proved to be robust to rigorous testing for a number of parameters, constitute one of the strongest linkage findings with respect to a psychiatric disease in a single family and are consistent with the presence of a single-locus gene that predisposes to bipolar affective illness in at least a small fraction of cases of this disorder. Dr. James Knowles was recruited into the MGU as Assistant Professor to oversee the panic disorder studies and to design new strategies to identify loci for psychiatric genetics diseases. Psychogenetics Division The Psychogenetics Division, directed by Dr. Miron Baron, continues its studies designed to localize and characterize susceptibility genes for bipolar and other mood disorders in a genome-wide search using DNA markers, in collaboration with the department's MGU and with Dr. Jurg Ott's Department of Statistical Genetics. Collaborating with Dr. Jean Endicott's Department of Research Assessment and Training, the Psychogenetics Division has assembled, in North America and Israel, the largest sample of bipolar families reported to date, thus affording substantial statistical power to detect or exclude susceptibility genes. As recently reported in Nature, a potentially important fruit of this labor is a possible linkage between bipolar disorder and chromosome 22 (also mentioned above under the MGU). Huntington's Disease Research Group The Huntington's Disease (HD) Research Group, directed by Dr. Nancy Wexler, began work on the nature of the protein ("huntingtin") made by the HD gene. The protein, which has never been described, is made by both the normal gene and the HD allele, although in much larger quantity by the latter owing to the excessive number of trinucleotide repeats that made up the HD allele. Although the disease attacks a specific portion of the brain, the protein is found in all body cells. The task is to discover its normal function, as well as its altered function, in HD. The HD Research Group is collaborating with Dr. Efstratiadis of Columbia University in creating a mouse model of HD, using expanded trinucleotide repeats from children with juvenile onset HD from the large Venezuelan pedigree studied by Dr. Wexler. Use of the mouse model to "knock out" the HD gene is expected to discover the normal function of the gene and how the expanded repeat causes its lethal damage in HD. Dr. Wexler received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award and the J. Allyn Taylor International Prize in Medicine. Keck Laboratory The Keck Laboratory, directed by Dr. Marcelo Bento Soares, has been selected to be responsible for generating most of the cDNA libraries for a major multi-institutional, worldwide effort that has been initiated with the goal of obtaining partial nucleotide sequences from human genes. The cDNA libraries will be arrayed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. The information will be deposited in Genbank as well as being available worldwide for laboratories pursuing large scale mapping of human genes. The Keck Laboratory plays a major part in the Columbia University program, funded by the National Center for Human Genome Research, which is generating a complete physical map of human chromosome 13. NIMH Genetics Initiative The New York site of the NIMH Genetics Initiative, directed by Drs. Charles Kaufmann, Dolores Malaspina, and Jill Harkavy Friedman, continues to identify and evaluate families with several schizophrenic members. The several sites of the Genetics Initiative have ascertained 108 families with 910 individuals, making it the largest systematically acquired sample of multiply-affected schizophrenic pedigrees in the world. The study has now been re-funded by the NIMH for sample expansion, pedigree extension, and subject re-evaluation. Pedigrees from the Genetics Initiative have been genotyped in collaboration with the MGU in an effort to respond to preliminary linkage results reported by other groups. The focus has been on chromosomes 5, 17, and 22, based not only on reports by others but also on several aspects of the Psychiatric Institute investigators' own work. Linkage to chromosome 5p or chromosome 22q appears to have been excluded; analyses of possible linkage to chromosome 17q is under way. Schizophrenia Developing Clinical Research Center (SDCRC) Dr. Kaufmann, heading the Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, and Dr. Malaspina, heading the Laboratory of Clinical Neurobiology, have been closely involved in the establishment of the Schizophrenia Developing Clinical Research Center (SDCRC) as Co-principal Investigator and Coordinator, respectively. In conjunction with the SDCRC and the Genetics Initiative, and in several other collaborative efforts, these researchers have been engaged in tackling a large number of important problems concerned with schizophrenia. These include efforts to determine the relative importance of prefrontal versus temporal lobe dysfunction in patients from families with minimal versus heavy loading of schizophrenic relatives; examination of other features associated with high familial loading for schizophrenia; and research into a variety of other questions, such as the prevalence of schizotypal personality disorder in relatives of schizophrenic proband pairs and the evaluation of possible evidence for the phenomena of anticipation and imprinting in multiply-affected pedigrees. Dr. Malaspina has commenced several projects in SPECT functional brain imaging, in which the dopamine 3 (D4) receptor is being quantified among groups of schizophrenic patients and normals, and brain activity during an olfactory neuroactivation task is being examined. Ongoing studies also include examination of tonic cardio-vagal tone in schizophrenia, investigation of neural pathways significant to olfactory discrimination, and study of traumatic brain injury as an environmental exposure relevant to schizophrenia. Division of Developmental Behavioral Studies The Division of Developmental Behavioral Studies, directed by Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling, continued a search for pedigrees with several schizophrenic relatives in Croatia. The search is being conducted in collaboration with Dr. Endicott's Department of Research Assessment and Training, Dr. Gilliam's MGU, and Dr. Ott's Department of Statistical Genetics, as well as with a group of Croatian colleagues. Despite the difficulties of collecting these pedigrees in current circumstances in Croatia, 30 multiply-affected pedigrees have now been entered into the study. These families include 196 individuals on whom diagnostic interviewing and collection of blood samples for DNA analyses are proceeding. In addition, histories are being collected on another 194 members of these families. Efforts to expand the sample are continuing. Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling's research group completed the 23rd year of the NIMH MERIT-awarded longitudinal study following offspring of schizophrenic, affectively ill, and normal parents from childhood to adulthood. Recent analyses of the adulthood psychiatric diagnoses of the first of two independently ascertained time samples in this study shows the prevalence rates of schizophrenia and related psychoses to be 18% in the offspring of schizophrenic parents, 10% (chiefly schizoaffective disorders) in offspring of affectively ill parents, and 1% in offspring of normal controls by the age of 31. Other Axis I (psychotic and nonpsychotic major psychiatric disorders) and Axis II (personality disorders) diagnoses have also been recently investigated in the first sample. Diagnostic interviews for both Axis I and Axis II are now being completed with the second sample at age 27. Analyses continue to confirm that childhood attentional dysfunctions in psychiatrically normal children of schizophrenic parents are moderately predictive of adulthood schizophrenia-related psychopathology. Childhood neuromotor, memory, and other neurobiological dysfunctions, as well as social behavior and personality characteristics, are being investigated with respect to their relationship with specific types of later psychiatric outcomes in the offspring in both samples of this study. Dr. Elizabeth Squires-Wheeler continues to collaborate in the investigation, especially in the effort to redefine the diagnostic boundaries of conditions related to schizophrenia and the genetic aspects of the schizophrenia spectrum. Cognitive Electrophysiology Laboratory Dr. David Friedman's Cognitive Electrophysiology Laboratory is engaged in a series of interrelated investigations concerned with cognitive event-related brain potentials, memory, and attentional function in normal development and disease states. A project on cognitive development examines the maturation of the brain's electrical activity in relationship to the development of memory function during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Similarly, an investigation of the effects of aging on these types of phenomena is aimed at a better understanding of these basic memory processes and how they change, in relationship to brain activity, in normal aging. An interesting and potentially important finding that has resulted from these studies is that the reduced memory function of normally aging older adults (in comparison to young adults) may be due to inefficiency in frontal lobe function. Studies of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (in collaboration with Dr. Gerard Bruder of the Department of Biopsychology) are also geared towards an understanding of how basic memory processes are either maintained or deteriorate in these disease states. New studies of Alzheimer's disease patients are concerned with how their memory function may be affected by disorders of attention, which also appear early in the course of this devastating illness. Drs. Friedman and Squires-Wheeler continue to collaborate on analyses relating event-related potentials collected during adolescence to the development of psychopathology in Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling's longitudinal high risk project described above. Psychogenetic Stress Studies Dr. Fischman continued his long-term studies on the effects of psychogenic stress on the genetic system, begun in collaboration with the late Dr. Dennis Kelly of the Department of Developmental Psychobiology. These studies had previously shown that a wide variety of psychological stressors elicited damage in the genetic systems of rats, increasing both DNA and chromosomal damage and raising the level of Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs). Rats subjected to repeated stress over a period of time demonstrate a reduction in behavioral and physiological responsiveness, a process known as habituation. To study whether this response also applies to genetic damage, Dr. Fischman subjected groups of rats to a variety of stressors in an unpatterned manner for 72 to 240 hours respectively. Both types of stress increased SCEs and chromosome aberrations, but the level of chromosome aberrations was lower in the 240-hour stressed rats, thus mirroring genotoxically the phenomenon of physiological habituation. SCEs, on the contrary, increased in the longer-stressed animals. Thus, SCE induction by stressors may be cumulative and long lasting, whereas chromosome aberrations are of shorter duration. An alternative explanation is that chromosome aberrations are effected by the same mechanism that accounts for habituation but SCEs are not. Drs.

Bailey, Ph.D., Research Scientist V Howard Hughes Medical Institute Eric R. Kandel, M.D., Director, University Professor of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics & Psychiatry in the Center for Neurobiology & Behavior Steven Siegelbaum, Ph.D., Professor of Pharmacology in the Center for Neurobiology & Behavior The Center for Neurobiology and Behavior consists of eleven independent laboratories, including two laboratories of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The overall research goal of the Center is to provide an analysis of neural development, behavior, learning, and diseases of the nervous system in terms of their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The subjects used in these studies range from simple invertebrate animals to humans. Learning and Memory A cross-species approach to understanding the mechanisms of memory and learning has been applied, using two preparations: (1) the defensive gill and siphon withdrawal reflex of the sea hare, Aplysia californica, which undergoes habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning; and (2) the mammalian hippocampus, which exhibits two pronounced types of long-lasting synaptic plasticity that are thought to underly long-term memory-long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These two complementary approaches have led to a number of fundamental observations concerning the mechanisms that underly learning and memory. In studies using Aplysia, Dr. Bailey has examined the subcellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of new synaptic connections associated with long-term memory. In collaboration with Dr. Kandel, he has utilized gene transfer and mutation experiments to further define the signaling events responsible for the internalization of cell adhesion molecules during the initial stages of learning-related synaptic growth. Dr. Schwartz has elucidated important new regulatory steps in the ubiquitin pathway that are involved in the acquisition of long-term memory and memory storage processes. In addition, persistent activation of protein kinase C has been shown to be required for intermediate stage memory. Dr. Hawkins has further defined the contributions of mechanosensory sensory cells to plasticity of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia and of cyclic-guanosinemonophosphate to LTP in the hippocampus. Dr. Siegelbaum has identified the mechanism of induction and site of expression of long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the mammalian hippocampus. To study explicit learning and memory, new strains of transgenic mice have been developed by Dr. Kandel, in collaboration with Stanley McKnight of the University of Washington in Seattle. They have been used to examine the behavioral effects of ablations of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of protein kinase A. This kinase was found to be required for both the early and late phase of LTP in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, but only for the late phase in the CA1 region. Neural Development Dr. Schachter has provided evidence that regulation of expression and distribution of a family of cell surface adhesion molecules can regulate cell-cell interactions and synapse formation during the initial establishment of specific connections. The regulation of the same cell surface molecules contributes to the functional and structural changes associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. Using gene-cloning techniques, Dr. Role has identified a family of genes that contributes to the regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit expression that occurs with innervation in vitro. The gene product thus identified mimics the effects of presynaptic input in increasing the expression of a particular subset of acetylcholine subunit genes and likewise alters the resultant expression of the final acetylcholine receptor. Ion Channels Dr. Siegelbaum has proposed a molecular mechanism for the ligand-activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, based on studies using molecular biological techniques to engineer chimeric channels. Dr. Koester has investigated the mechanism and role of frequency-dependent action potential broadening. This phenomenon, which increases both chemical and electrical synaptic transmission, was shown to be caused by the complex interaction of several types of voltage-gated ion channels. Behavior Dr. Hen, who joined the Center this year, has determined that genetically engineered mice lacking the serotonin-1B receptor are less responsive to cocaine. These results suggest that the serotonin-1B receptor is mediating some of the reinforcing effects of cocaine. Dr. Qian, another new arrival to the Center, has provided the Center with a new level of expertise in neural modeling. He has recently finished setting up a computational neuroscience and visual psychophysics laboratory, to be used to study the neural mechanisms that underly motion and depth perception. Through studies of human reaching, Dr. Ghez has discovered that distinct sensorimotor transformations are responsible for both specifying and learning handpaths, joint angles, and joint torques. Moreover, he found that joint torque specification is based on short-term learning that requires proprioceptive information. Research performed in collaboration with Dr. Martin on cats points to the intermediate cerebellum as a critical structure for the control and possibly the learning of limb dynamics. In an ongoing study of motivated behaviors, using feeding behavior in Aplysia as a model, Dr. Kupfermann has demonstrated extensive and highly specific distributions in the nervous system of chemosensory fibers that have their cell bodies of origin in the periphery. These data suggest a parallel distributed organization of sensory input.

Malone, M.D. Research Scientist VI Claire Metz, Ph.D., Research Scientist II In 1994, the Department of Neuroscience underwent a significant reorganization that greatly heightened its multidisciplinary approach to psychiatric research, integrating psychology, psychiatry, pharmacology, and basic neuroscience in order to examine the biological substrate of mental illness at multiple levels. The department comprises three divisions to pursue the application of postmortem and in vivo studies of psychiatric disorders. The Division of Neurochemistry develops laboratory probes for clinical studies of the serotonergic and other monoamine systems, and organizes clinical studies. The Division of Neuropathology conducts postmortem brain studies and provides neuropathology services to the Office of Mental Health. The Division of Brain Imaging conducts functional and structural brain imaging studies. Division of Neurochemistry The major area of investigation for the Division of Neurochemistry has been the biological basis of suicidal behaviors. Dr. John Mann is the Director of the NIMH-funded Clinical Research Center for the Study of Suicidal Behavior. The Center supports a range of studies into the risk factors for suicidal behavior. Dr. Barbara Stanley and Dr. Ronald Winchel are conducting neurochemical and psychological investigations in individuals who manifest impulsive self-injury and trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling). Drs. John Mann and Kevin Malone have developed methods using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for visualizing regional brain responses to serotonin activation. This technique allows identification of high risk patients and the localization of regional brain abnormalities in high-risk patients. Other studies are in progress examining possible genetic influences on the manifestation of suicidal and other self-harming behaviors. In collaboration with Dr. Conrad Gilliam, a candidate gene approach has been adopted, focused on key serotonin-related genes. Dr. Bruce Parsons has a NARSAD award to continue his work on the autoradiographic analysis of dopamine receptors and uptake sites in postmortem tissues both from adults and adolescents who have committed suicide. Dr. Stephen Karpiak and Heljo Laev continue to detail the CNS injury cascade that occurs with excitotoxic (glutamate) damage. Using cortical and spinal cell cultures, they have described the sequelae of plasma membrane pathology associated with trauma and excitotoxic injury, and found the lipid GM1 to be an effective neuroprotective agent against such injuries. In a collaborative effort with Dr. B. L. Hungund, they have reported similar findings when studying acute alcohol toxicity. Dr. Tamir and her associates are continuing their work on secretogogue-induced gating of chloride channels in the secretory vesicles of parafollicular cells (PF). They have shown that PF cells of the thyroid have features of both neurons and endocrine cells. Thyroid PF cells are neural cres-derived endocrine cells that secrete serotonin and calcitonin. The function of secretory vesicles in neurons is important for neurotransmission and, therefore, for disease and therapeutics. Dr. Mark Underwood conducts research into the regulation of regional cerebral blood flow by the serotonergic system. The coupling of metabolism and blood flow is a fundamental assumption governing the interpretation of functional brain imaging studies using blood flow as a guide to neuronal activity. Dr. Underwood is one of the few scientists studying the validity of this assumption. Enormous technical advances have allowed the use of brain imaging techniques to be applied to the study of neurotransmitter systems in both postmortem and living brain. Dr. Underwood has spearheaded the laboratory, applying these techniques to postmortem brain studies. In postnatal mesolimbic cultures, Drs. Rayport and Sulzer have pursued studies of the synaptic physiology and psychopharmacology of mesolimbic neurons. They have found that glutamate may be a cotransmitter in mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Pursuing their weak base mechanism of amphetamine action, they have directly monitored amphetamine-induced dopamine release in real time and further confirmed the model. Using fluorophobes, they have shown that dopamine receptor subtypes are frequently colocalized on nucleus accumbens neurons. Finally, they have found that methamphetamine neurotoxicity involves an intracellular free radical mechanism. Dr. Stephen Rayport received a five-year award from the NIH, a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Scholar Award in Experimental Therapeutics, and a two-year award from the Scottish Rite for schizophrenia research. Division of Neuropathology The Division of Neuropathology conducts basic and clinical research, participates in postgraduate medical education, and operates the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) in Neuropathology. The Neuropathology division examines the brains of OMH patients obtained at autopsy. Drs. Andrew Dwork and Mavis Kaufman, in collaboration with Dr. Isak Prohovnik of the Division of Brain Imaging, have continued their studies of senile degenerative changes in schizophrenia. One achievement of this project has been to catalogue several thousand brains collected by the division. This collection, started in the preneuroleptic era, is now being studied with modern neuropathologic techniques. Dr. Dwork has continued structural and functional studies of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, with particular attention to the interactions of these receptors with neuroleptic drugs. Dr. Victoria Arango, in collaboration with Drs. Mark Underwood, Andrew Dwork, Bruce Parsons, Victor Arkhipov, and John Mann, is conducting a program of postmortem studies of suicide victims utilizing a combination of quantitative receptor autoradiography, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and morphometry of brain stem nuclei. A parallel set of postmortem studies are being conducted by the same investigators in alcoholics in order to determine the neurochemical and morphological consequences of acute and chronic alcohol consumption. Dr. Jonathan Javitch has worked in collaboration with Dr. Arthur Karlin of the Center for Molecular Recognition to map the binding sites for antipsychotic drugs in dopamine D2-like receptors. They have expressed human D2 receptors in cultured cells and are localizing the site of interaction of a photoaffinity-labeled drug with the receptor. This approach will be extended to D3 and D4 receptors to compare and contrast the binding sites for typical and atypical antipsychotics. Dr. Javitch has also demonstrated the existence of reduced cysteine residues near the binding site of the D2 receptor and is identifying the role of these cysteines using a combination of protein chemistry and site-directed mutagenesis. Dr. Andrew Dwork was successful in receiving funding from NIMH on "Effects of Education and Occupation on Synaptic Density," and from the Smokeless Tobacco Research Council. Dr. Javitch is supported by a Scientist Development Award from NIMH. Drs. Arango and Mann are supported by multiyear grants from NIMH and NIDA for the postmortem human brain research. Drs. Bruce Parsons and Avi Molcho have NARSAD awards for postmortem neurochemical studies of suicide. Division of Brain Imaging The Division of Brain Imaging has begun a transition from the use of the 133Xe rCBF method to the use of SPECT and PET. NIH-funded projects include Dr. Devanand's study of blood flow in early cases of suspected dementia using SPECT, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with Dr. Solomon using 133Xe, and a new study of sickle-cell disease, directed by Dr. Prohovnik, that is part of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center of Columbia University, under the direction of Dr. S. Piomelli. Work with functional magnetic resonance has begun. The new high field strength research group is bringing the five Tesla magnet on line. A major technological project to be finished this year includes the establishment of software to do PET image analysis of activation studies and volumetric analysis of MRI. Other funded projects are: a study of cerebral Lyme disease by Dr. Brian Fallon, a study of cerebral blood flow responses to anger by Dr. Peter Shapiro, and a study of cerebral blood flow responses to mood change by Dr. Eric Rubin. PET projects involve studies by Drs. Kevin Malone and John Mann on the serotonergic responsivity in major depression and the relation to suicide risk.WT02-B10-184IA093-000995-B030-171http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_CE.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073111 text/html 6108HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:35:17 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 5978 Psychoanalytic Ctr Psychoanalytic Center for Training and Research Roger A. MacKinnon, M.D., Director Stanley Bone, M.D., Associate Director Milton Viederman, M.D., Associate Director June 1994 graduates of the Center were: Stephen Donovan, M.D., Judith Marcus, M.D., David Pelino, M.D., George Sagi, M.D., Larry Sandberg, M.D., Meriamne Singer, M.D., Mark Sorensen, Nina Toshav, M.D. and Ilene Lefcourt, M.D. At that time, Morton Aronson, M.D. was presented with the George S. Goldman Award for Achievement in Clinical Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Education, Helen Meyers, M.D. received the Howard Klar Award for Excellence in teaching and Sam Perry, M.D. received the John Weber Award for Psychoanalytic Research, posthumously. In 1994, the following were appointed as new faculty members: Stephen Donovan, M.D., Judith Marcus, M.D., David Pelino, M.D., George Sagi, M.D., Larry Sandberg, M.D., Meriamne Singer, M.D., Mark Sorensen, Nina Toshav, M.D. and Ilene Lefcourt, M.D. Helen Meyers, M.D. was the Sandor Rado Lecturer and presented "The Uses and Abuses of Reality" on April 5, 1994. Daniel Shapiro, M.D. was honored with the George E. Daniels Merit M.D. Award. At the New Candidates Dinner, on September 27, 1993, Arnold Wilson, Ph.D. received the Alexander Beller Award. From January through December 1994, the Admissions Service received 128 requests for application; 39 applications were received; 35 applicants were seen; 14 applicants accepted for analysis. There are a total of 21 private patients in analysis. Significant progress has been made with our major research project. Two of our PGY-IV residents, Randall Marshall, M.D. and Susan Vaughan, M.D., have used their PGY-IV elective time to collaborate with Steven Roose, M.D. and Roger MacKinnon, M.D. to develop a protocol for a feasibility study to evaluate the possibility of a major prospective outcome study, possibly multi-centered. The research help and guidance from some of the department's most outstanding clinical investigators has made this project possible. Ronald Rieder, M.D., in particular, has helped and, with his support, both Dr. Marshall and Dr. Vaughan have obtained research fellowships that will allow them to devote significant time to this project. The Center is very grateful to the Psychiatric Institute faculty who are helping with our research effort. The Executive Committee of the Center has endorsed the project with its multiple rating scales, independent raters, and audiotaping of sessions. Thus far, nine psychoanalytic cases have accepted the study. The Center is supporting the inclusion of a parallel group of long-term analytic psychotherapy cases treated by residents under the supervision of Lisa Mellman, M.D. and our supervisory faculty. We have obtained a small grant from the Dorgan Fund to support most of the expenses. In 1993, the Center, in collaboration with the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine, established the Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Division, an advanced course in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy for clinical psychiatrists who have recently completed training. The program was developed by Roger MacKinnon, M.D., Don Meyers, M.D., and Fred Kass, M.D. The course, which meets one evening per week for one year, is designed as a skills enhancing experience for those psychiatrists who are uncertain about formal psychoanalytic training, who have ruled out such training because of other career commitments, or who seek additional supervision and course work in psychotherapy. At the American Psychoanalytic Meetings in May 1994, Jacob Arlow, M.D., Jane Asch, M.D., Jose Barchilon, M.D., Edward Brennan, M.D., Deborah Cabaniss, M.D., Stanley Coen, M.D., Nathaniel Donson, Gerald Fogel, Otto Kernberg, M.D., Paulina Kernberg, M.D., Burton Lerner, M.D., Helen Meyers, M.D., Richard Munich, M.D., Bernard Pacella, M.D., Roy Schafer, Ph.D., Sally Severino, M.D., Daniel Shapiro, M.D., and C. Philip Wilson, M.D. participated in programs of the meetings. At the December 1994 meetings of the American Psychoanalytic Association, Morton Aronson, M.D., Jose Barchilon, M.D., Deborah Cabaniss, M.D., Stanley Coen, M.D., Arnold Cooper, M.D., Katherine Dalsimer, Ph.D., Lawrene Deutsch, M.D., Jeff Halpern, M.D., Jules Kerman, M.D., Otto Kernberg, M.D., Paulina Kernberg, M.D., Lucy LaFarge, M.D., Frederick Lane, M.D., Burton Lerner, M.D., Elena Lister, M.D., Eric Marcus, M.D., Helen Meyers, M.D., Richard Munich, M.D., David Olds, M.D., Ethel Person, M.D., Ellen Peyser, M.D., Steven Roose, M.D., John Munder Ross, Ph.D., Roy Schafer, Ph.D., Beth Seelig, M.D., Sally Severino, M.D., Daniel Shapiro, M.D., Ellen Handler Spitz, Ph.D., Milton Viederman, M.D., and C.

Data collection and recording procedures (along with training programs for clinicians and computer programs to assist in the scoring and analysis of the data) are made available to investigators and clinicians at Psychiatric Institute, in other New York State facilities, as well as elsewhere in the United States and abroad. These procedures are primarily focused upon diagnosis, evaluation of severity symptoms and functioning, quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction, and work productivity. Substantive research studies are also conducted by members of the department. Some ongoing during 1994 are briefly described below. Major Mood Disorder Studies A number of the projects directed by Dr. Jean Endicott and her staff are focused upon the course of illness of patients who have major mood disorders. A large scale NIMH-funded multifacility long-term follow-up study of 955 patients with major mood disorders is still ongoing. To date, subjects have been followed between 14 and 17 years. During the intake episode and in subsequent episodes, depressed subjects who have active alcoholism have only half the likelihood of recovery of those who are not abusing alcohol. During the first 10 years of follow-up, patients with manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder had a mean of 4.5 hospitalizations and continued to have remissions and recurrences with no evidence of a tendency for the disorder to become less active. Patients who entered the study with a first episode of major depressive disorder also were at high risk to have at least one additional period of major depressive disorder (over 50% did so) and to attempt suicide (25% did so). These findings, coupled with those reported previously indicate that the major mood disorders tend to recur or become chronic and are associated with major negative consequences for the majority of patients who suffer from them. Other studies funded by NICHD of women who have had prior episodes of major depressive disorder indicate that they are at a very high risk of having subsequent episodes, particularly if they report having severe dysphoric mood changes premenstrually. Dr. Endicott's group participated in a large multifacility study of the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder with sertraline or placebo which indicated that sertraline was quite effective in treating this condition. These findings were in keeping with previous work of Dr. Endicott and her group and support efforts to encourage women to obtain treatment for severe premenstrual mood changes. The follow-up studies conducted by Dr. Endicott's group as well as the findings from a NARSAD-supported study of the barriers to seeking and receiving treatment indicate that most patients with a major mood disorder still delay or never seek treatment when such is warranted. Although the reasons for this are multiple, two major problems continue to be cost and stigma. Members of the department have continued to participate in studies of the genetics of mood disorders. Dr. Endicott received funding from NIMH for a new multifacility linkage study of recurrent major depressive disorders. Dr. Endicott's staff will be responsible for making the "best estimate" diagnoses for the subjects from all five facilities. The staff has continued to work with Drs. Baron, Gilliam, and Ott on a linkage study of bipolar disorder with mania. The group recently published findings supportive of possible linkage of the disorder to a gene on chromosome 21. ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alcohol and Drug Problem Studies Dr. Deborah Hasin and her staff continued to work on multiple facets of alcohol and drug problems, including diagnostic assessment, investigation of longitudinal course, issues of psychiatric comorbidity, and general population patterns. This work is funded by NIAAA and NIDA. Analyses of her follow-up study of 969 community residents who were at high risk for alcohol dependence showed that most of those who met criteria for alcohol dependence at the time of the first interview did so only at a mild level and were much more likely to manifest psychological aspects of alcohol dependence than physiological aspects (such as a full withdrawal syndrome). Analyses of one-year follow-up interviews showed that severity of alcohol dependence at the initial interview predicted continuing difficulties with alcoholism one year later. Severity of alcoholism outweighed sex, age, social status, and depression in predicting ongoing problems with alcoholism. Dr. Hasin's group is in early stages of a longitudinal study of the course of drug and alcohol dependence in patients who have substance abuse problems as well as varying types and levels of psychiatric difficulties. Several hundred patients will be evaluated when they enter treatment and will be followed up every six months for two years to determine the relationship of the psychiatric and substance abuse problems, and how these appear to be affected by treatment. Dr. Hasin has also collaborated with colleagues at NIAAA in investigating help- seeking for alcohol problems among former drinkers in the U.S. The information came from a national survey of about 40,000 Americans. A substantial minority (about 40%) of former drinkers had met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol abuse or dependence at some time in the past. However, only a small proportion (7%) of those who had stopped drinking had sought help for alcohol problems. Those who had sought specialized help were likely to have reported a sense of compulsion to drink, heavier alcohol consumption, and social pressure to cut down on their drinking. ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Infertility Studies Dr. Jennifer Downey has continued to study women who suffer from infertility and the possible effects of the new reproductive technologies on their likelihood of development of a mental disorder. A paper by one of Dr. Downey's graduate students based upon this work recently won first prize in a competition for best paper by a trainee sponsored by the American Society for Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology. Menstrual Cycle Studies Dr. Dianne Schechter's NIMH-funded work has focused upon efforts to identify factors that may be associated with the pathophysiology of severe premenstrual dysphoric mood changes. She has examined several endocrine parameters and their association with severity of premenstrual mood changes in women who have been studied intensively over at least five menstrual cycles. The strongest relationships were a positive association between luteal phase pregnanediol levels and severity of mood changes and a negative association of the severity of mood changes and late follicular estrone and luteal estrone levels. The results of the study supported efforts to obtain funding to study a larger sample of subjects and a proposal was submitted to NIMH. A NARSAD-funded study of menstrual cycle fluctuations in severity of psychotic and affective symptoms in women with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder is being conducted by Dr. Schechter in collaboration with the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Preliminary data suggests that, at least for some women, symptom severity may decrease just prior to ovulation and increase just prior to menses and perhaps just after ovulation. If these findings are confirmed with a larger sample, they would have implications for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the symptom formation and for treatment and management. Reliability and Validity Studies Reliability and validity studies of procedures developed by members of the department was conducted, new training materials were prepared, and consultation was given to other investigators who plan to employ them in their studies. Those of primary focus during 1994 were the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) developed by Dr. Hasin and colleagues and the Work Productivity Scale developed by Dr. Endicott. Dr. Dianne Schechter continued to direct the Mental Health Clinical Research Center Normal Controls project. Over 40 investigators successfully recruited subjects for their studies from the pool of over 1,000 subjects who have been enrolled in this project.

Dohrenwend, Ph.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research Andrew E. Skodol, M.D., Psychiatrist (Research) III The focus of the research of this department is on adversity, stress, and psychiatric disorders. One of the important activities of the past year has been the editing of papers on this topic that were presented at the March 1994 annual meeting of the American Psychopathological Association. The program was organized by Dr. Dohrenwend and the papers will appear in a monograph to be published by the American Psychiatric Press. In addition, Drs. Dohrenwend and Skodol have been involved in organizing a symposium of the World Psychiatric Association Section of Epidemiology and Community Psychiatry to be held in New York May 15-17, 1995 on Search for the Causes of Psychiatric Disorders: Epidemiological Approaches. At the same time, three major investigations of adversity, stress, and psychiatric disorders have continued and planning has begun for two additional investigations. The following are brief descriptions of the on-going studies and of the plans for new research. On-going Studies Social and Psychological Factors in Episodes of Schizophrenia and Major Depression This project has sought to determine the relative importance and specificity of three sets of factors (remote and recent life events, personal dispositions, situational contexts) for episodes of major depression by contrast with episodes of schizophrenic disorder. Analyses of data collected under the above grant have continued even though a substantial number of papers have been previously published and reported and even though the NIMH-funded project period has ended. The retrospective case-control design of the project focuses on a sample of 96 major depressives, 65 persons with schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychotic disorders, and 404 controls from the general population. Data collection occurred in New York City. The most important analyses to date will be included in the book from the 1994 APPA meeting mentioned above. The results indicate, for example, that recent life events play a far more important role in the occurrence of episodes of major depression than in episodes of nonaffective psychotic disorders, including DSM-III schizophrenia, regardless of whether first episodes or recurrences are the outcomes being investigated. Social Stress, Social Selection, and Psychiatric Disorders This on-going project started on January 1, 1982, with grant support from NIMH. Based on over two years of preliminary research, it involves study of the roles of social, psychological, and family history factors in the etiology of the main types of psychopathology that are inversely related to socioeconomic status: schizophrenia, major depression, substance use disorders, alcoholism, and antisocial personality. Israel was chosen as the research setting for two main reasons: (1) it is an open class society in which ethnic assimilation is taking place as required by the theoretical framework of the study, and (2) a well-kept Population Register was available as an aid to the type of sampling that facilitates obtaining unbiased estimates of rates of disorder. From a screened and diagnosed probability sample of 4,914 young adults, 340 cases, 191 controls, and a sample of their adult siblings have been chosen for intensive study. Brief telephone interviews were conducted with most of these 531 persons following the Scud missile attacks on Israel during the Gulf War. In previous years, we summarized major findings from the epidemiological study on the role of socioeconomic status that were published in the February 21, 1992 issue of Science and in descriptive analyses of the epidemiological data published in Psychological Medicine. Further descriptive analyses of the epidemiological data were published in 1994 in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Many of the main analyses of the case/control data have been conducted, along with some further analyses of data from the telephone interviews following the Scud attacks during the Gulf War. As in the New York study described above, some of the findings from the case/control study in Israel show that recent life events are more important in the occurrence of episodes of major depression than in exacerbations of schizophrenic disorder. The importance of this corroboration of the New York results is that the New York cases consisted of samples of patients whereas the research in Israel involves persons with these disorders who have been sampled from the general population. In addition to these similarities in the findings from the two studies on the relative importance of recent life events in the two disorders, some striking contrasts are also beginning to emerge, especially on the types of negative events involved in precipitating depression and in the role of family history in major depression. These will be written up along with other results from the case/control study in Israel during the following year and submitted for journal publication, as will results from the Scud follow-up. Myofacial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome and Life Stress This project started in July 1, 1982 with grant support from NIDR. The first investigation was a longitudinal study of 136 pain patients and 131 controls. Detailed interviews were conducted with the respondents at entrance into the study and at monthly intervals for the period of one year. The purpose was to examine the role of environmental stress in episodes of myofascial pain. The main analyses have been completed, published, or accepted for publication. The problems addressed in the second study have grown out of a finding from the first study that there are unusually high rates of major depression in the pain cases compared to controls. These results, consistent with findings from research by others on various types of chronic pain of unknown origin and depression, strongly indicate that the two are related. The results are equivocal about the direction of the relationship and, consequently, have not thrown much light on such competing theories as those suggesting that pain is "masked" depression or that depression is a reaction to the stress of chronic pain. The aims in the second study, which started four years ago with a four-year competing continuation grant, involve an attempt to understand the relationship between depression and pain in persons suffering from temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome (TMPDS). To do so, an attempt is being made (1) to establish retrospectively the times of onset of depression and TMPDS in a new sample of TMPDS cases with and without a history of depression and (2) to investigate the rates of major depression in the adult first-degree relatives of the TMPDS cases and controls with and without a history of depression. Field work has been completed with samples of 164 pain cases, 175 controls, and 225 first-degree relatives of these cases and controls. We expect to have major findings to report in the coming year. New Research Initiatives We are planning two new research initiatives that involve submission of substantial grant applications to NIMH. The first is a follow-up of respondents first interviewed an average of 12 years ago in the epidemiological research in Israel. Its purpose will be to build on the findings from the previous epidemiological and case/control studies by adding longitudinal and prospective components to the research. The second new undertaking involves the preparation of a grant application to analyze data previously collected by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in response to a Congressional mandate to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological problems in U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam. RTI began this ground- breaking study of nationwide samples of Vietnam Theater veterans, other Vietnam Era veterans, and nonveterans, totaling 3,016 respondents in 1984. The strikingly high rates of PTSD that they found in both male and female Theater veterans and the ethnic/racial differences in these rates virtually demand more analysis, and we plan to focus on these differences.

Terwilliger, Ph.D., Research Scientist III Statistical Genetics - Home Page at Columbia University The main task of the Department of Statistical Genetics is to pursueresearch in genetic linkage analysis, primarily for the genetic mapping of psychiatric traits. This research is also used in building genetic maps of marker loci, which, in turn, enhance the power for mapping disease genes. The work falls into two broad categories: 1) developing new and improving existing methods of linkage analysis and genetic mapping, and 2) applying these techniques to family data gathered by other researchers at Psychiatric Institute and elsewhere. Work in the first category is carried out with mathematical-analytical tools, if feasible, but computers must often be used to furnish numerical results (e.g., by computer simulation) when a problem is too complicated to be solved analytically. Newly developed methods are made available to other researchers in the form of computer programs, which are written by the researcher developing the method. Drs. Terwilliger and Ott wrote a handbook on human linkage analysis which was published by Johns Hopkins University Press. It is a self-study book that makes it possible for researchers to learn how to carry out linkage analysis on computers. Dr. Terwilliger received a NARSAD Young Investigator Award to explore novel methods of carrying out linkage analysis in complex traits such as schizophrenia. Together with one of his former students, Dr. Suzanne Leal, Dr. Ott published a new method for obtaining approximate confidence intervals for genetic risks. This method evaluates the effect on the risk of not exactly knowing allele frequencies and recombination fractions, that is, it provides a realistic assessment of the accuracy of a risk estimate. Collaboration with Drs. Baron, Endicott, and Gilliam continued on the search for susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder; with Dr. Weissman on panic disorder; with Dr. Shaffer on suicide, and with Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling on schizophrenia. Grant support was received from various sources. The Muscular Dystrophy Association renewed its grant to carry out statistical investigations for the Spinal Muscular Atrophy gene on chromosome 5. The MERIT award grant from NIMH was renewed for another year. A conference grant from the National Center for Human Genome Research was renewed to hold a Workshop on Statistical Methods in Genetic Mapping.

Comer, Ph.D., Research Scientist III Suzette M. Evans, Ph.D., Research Scientist III Margaret Haney, Ph.D., Research Scientist III The Division on Substance Abuse started the year with existing faculty of Herbert D. Kleber, M.D., Director, Marian W. Fischman, Ph.D., Co-Director, Sandra Comer, Ph.D., Suzette M. Evans, Ph.D., Richard W. Foltin, Ph.D., and Frances R. Levin, M.D. In February 1994, Margaret Haney, Ph.D. joined the division. Research Projects Research in the division focuses on the antecedents and consequences of substance use and abuse, with particular emphasis on the development and testing of novel approaches to the treatment of substance abuse. The division is unique in its ability to examine substance abuse issues at three levels: in non-human primates, in controlled laboratory research with human subjects, and, clinically, in treating cocaine-abusing patients. Faculty in this division not only conduct their own research, but, consistent with the major goals of the division, foster collaborative research both at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and across the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center complex. In October 1994, the Division on Substance Abuse, in collaboration with Drs. Edward Nunes and Ronald Van Heertum at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, received a Medications Development Center grant from NIDA to develop novel medication approaches to treat cocaine and heroin abuse. The Core, in addition to providing centralized coordination and support, will carry out pilot studies on promising medications and provide funding for small pilot studies, including those of interest to the Research Fellows. Project 1, headed by Drs. Fischman and Comer, will focus on developing a laboratory model of smoked heroin and then use it in the Residential Laboratory to evaluate both new medications for opiate addiction, e.g., depot naltrexone and methoclocinnamox, as well as improving outcome and acceptability of existing medications such as methadone and naltrexone. In Project 2, Dr. Gottschalk, a Substance Abuse Research Fellow, is working with Dr. Van Heertum, examining the temporal course of cocaine's effects on regional brain activity using PET. These studies will examine human brain activation by intravenous cocaine in chronic abusers, using PET imaging techniques for measuring cerebral blood flow. The first experiment will examine direct drug effects of cocaine, tolerance effects, and conditioned cue response. Project 3, headed by Dr. Nunes, will evaluate treatment-seeking cocaine abusers and then use existing psychiatric medications to see whether treating specific disorders, such as depression, will improve outcome and retention. In addition, this project will use both a cue reaction paradigm and a novel clinical trial design to test new medications such as amoxapine and risperidone for cocaine treatment. A Cocaine Research Clinic will be opened on PI 11 to carry out this project and the Core pilot studies. Dr. Richard Foltin is continuing his series of studies in non-human primates. His research project with baboons is providing both an animal model for assessing the behavioral mechanisms of action of anorectic drugs, with new substances evaluated as they are developed, and a behavioral economics model of eating behavior. Drs. Fischman, Foltin, Comer, and Haney are conducting similar studies in human subjects to investigate the neurochemical basis for the control of eating behavior in humans and to evaluate the commonalities and differences between food and drugs. Dr. Foltin, in collaboration with Dr. Evans, has another non-human primate research grant to develop and test a novel animal model of cocaine craving in rhesus monkeys. The availability of an animal model that operationalizes the concept of drug craving, i.e., cocaine-seeking rather than cocaine- taking behavior, will provide an immense benefit to the development of pharmacotherapies specifically aimed at the alleviation of drug craving and subsequent drug taking. Drs. Fischman and Foltin are continuing their research on the effects of cocaine, cocaine self-administration, and the interaction of cocaine with potential therapeutic agents using a controlled laboratory environment. Drs. Fischman and Foltin have developed a laboratory model of cocaine use in which volunteer cocaine-using research subjects can take repeated doses of cocaine, much as they might outside of the laboratory during a cocaine "binge." They measure cocaine self-administration before and during maintenance on a potential treatment medication to assess whether these proposed pharmacological adjuncts to cocaine treatment interfere with the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine. This is an efficient and scientifically useful adjunct to traditional clinical trial procedures for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of potential treatment medications. Cocaine abuse by patients maintained on methadone has become a serious problem. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of these two drugs in combination, and the clinical treatment efforts for this group have not been particularly effective. Drs. Fischman and Foltin are currently investigating the efficacy of buprenorphine as a treatment for both cocaine abuse and opiate dependence by examining the propensity to take cocaine in subjects maintained on either methadone or buprenorphine. Dr. Levin has been working with Dr. Foltin in developing protocols for optimal tapering of subjects off methadone and onto buprenorphine. This research will have clinical implications when buprenorphine is routinely used in methadone programs. Drs. Fischman, Evans, and Levin are evaluating another potentially useful medication for the treatment of cocaine abusers. They are studying cis-flupenthixol, evaluating its safety in combination with cocaine and its efficacy both orally and in depot form. Drs. Foltin and Fischman are also conducting a laboratory analysis of cocaine abstinence including assessing changes in affect and reports of withdrawal symptoms following the termination of different doses and durations of a cocaine binge, changes in ratings of cocaine "craving" during abstinence, and differences in cocaine abstinence based on route of administration. Drs. Fischman, Foltin, Comer, and Haney are conducting research on the workplace implications of drug use. The Substance Use Research Center is designed for continuous observation of human behavior over extended periods of time. Subjects can live under conditions in which sleep-waking cycles, daytime work activities, and evening recreational activities simulate those in the natural ecology. The effects of acute and chronic administration of frequently used drugs and medications on human capacities that are commonly used in the workplace are being evaluated. In addition, other studies will focus on residual drug effects, i.e., "hangover" on workplace performance, and the modification of drug use under workplace conditions. In collaboration with Dr. Fischman, Dr. Evans is continuing to conduct studies to assess the abuse liability of newly developed sedatives/anxiolytics prior to their marketing, as well as currently marketed sedatives/anxiolytics. Such procedures provide profiles of physiological and behavioral effects of these compounds including performance and memory impairment, as well as an estimate of the likelihood that they will be abused if they become commercially available. In October 1994, Dr. Fischman, in collaboration with Drs. Evans and Haney, received an NIH Women's Supplement to evaluate in women with premenstrual syndrome the effects of alprazolam on workplace performance. In line with the research mission of Psychiatric Institute, Drs. Kleber, Levin, and Evans have intensified their efforts in epidemiologic studies and new treatments for dually diagnosed patients, i.e., individuals with a substance abuse disorder (primarily cocaine) and another psychiatric disorder. To treat cocaine abuse more adequately, future studies may need to be targeted at different subgroups of cocaine abusers and to develop interventions appropriate to those populations. A NIDA-funded grant under the direction of Dr. Kleber and his associates, Drs. Levin and Evans, is assessing the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among cocaine abusers seeking treatment, including documentation of prevalence rates among specific minority populations. At the same time, parallel studies with cocaine abusers diagnosed with ADHD are being conducted in the research laboratory and these studies will focus on the interaction of cocaine with pharmacologic treatments for ADHD. Lastly, as part of the Core of the recently funded Center Grant, they will conduct an outpatient treatment study to assess the efficacy of methylphenidate and desipramine in reducing cocaine use in cocaine abusers with ADHD. Another subgroup of interest is cocaine abusers with schizophrenic symptoms. Drs. Levin and Evans are conducting studies to determine the effectiveness of the neuroleptics flupenthixol and risperidone in treating both the psychotic symptoms and reducing cocaine abuse in this patient population. Dr. Levin recently received a Scientist Development Clinical Award to assess cocaine abusers for psychiatric co-morbidity and develop interventions appropriate to those subpopulations. In addition, Dr. Levin received a Clinical Trials Award to determine the effectiveness of the neuroleptics, flupenthixol and risperidone, in treating cocaine abusers with schizophrenia or schizo-affective illness. Education and Training Drs. Kleber and Levin have been actively involved with the Substance Abuse Steering Committee, co-chaired by Dr. Kleber and Dr. Oldham, in developing a new substance abuse curriculum for first- and second-year medical students. In addition, Drs. Kleber and Levin began a program to teach all housestaff at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center key aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of substance abuse. They are also working with Dr. Edward Nunes on courses for PGY-III and IV psychiatric residents. The Division continues to play a central role in a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded Research Fellowship in Substance Abuse Disorders for research fellows directed by Dr. Kleber and by the associate directors, Drs. Frances Levin and Edward Nunes. The purpose of this fellowship is to train candidates for careers in clinical research in substance abuse and dependence. The program is designed as a two-year curriculum with emphasis on four different components: didactic introduction to clinical research in the addictions, clinical experience, research apprenticeship-preceptorship, and development of teaching skills. From January-June 1994, the Division had two fellows-Michael Hwang, M.D., and Denise Hien, Ph.D. The former is now working as Director of the Anxiety Clinic at the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York City and is also Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at New York University. The latter received a FIRST Award from NIDA and is carrying out the research at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center. In July 1994, the division had two new Research Fellows, Dr. Christopher P. Gottschalk and Dr. Eric Collins. Dr. Angela Seracini, who is currently working with Dr. Nunes on the DES, will join the fellowship in January 1995.

S. Kaplan, Ph.D., Director, Sexual Behavior Clinic Richard Herman, M.A., Administrator Washington Heights Community Service outpatient programs had a very productive and stable year. Compared to 1993, our census increased by 36 patients, and we delivered 391 more visits, which represents a slight increase. In September 1994, our outpatient programs successfully completed their state certification site visit, and were praised for the excellent clinical care delivered. Some notable staff changes occurred. Alexis Brosen, M.D., resigned her position as director of the Inwood Clinic, and Siobhan Coomaraswamy, M.D. became the new director. Other changes at Inwood included the arrival of two new psychiatrists, Richard Kreuger, M.D. and Dora Cardenas, M.D., and the departure of two psychiatrists, Sarah Hartman, M.D. and Raul Soto, M.D. On the PI 6 in-patient unit, Deborah Cabaniss, M.D. resigned and Mary Bongiovi, M.D. became the new attending psychiatrist. We were able to significantly improve therapeutic activities for our inpatients and outpatients under the leadership of Elaine Mullen, OTR. Ms. Mullen reorganized group programming in the PI 6 inpatient unit and helped recruit two new occupational therapists. WHCS faculty remained active in the area of HIV/AIDS and people with mental illness. In addition to continued publications of our research findings, the second year of our federal Center for Mental Health Services training grant allowed us to train more than 2,000 mental health providers. We held three large conferences (New York, Albany, Buffalo) and conducted on-site workshops and grand rounds at numerous mental health programs in the tri-state area. Four thousand copies of the HIV Risk Reduction Manual, written by WHCS staff, were distributed throughout the English-speaking world. This manual is based on ongoing HIV risk reduction groups at the Audubon and Inwood Clinics. Dr. Francine Cournos authored Commonly Asked Questions about HIV/AIDS and People with Mental Illness, which was distributed nationwide by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. In addition, WHCS worked with Housing Works, Inc., a program for HIV infected people, in the development of their mental health services. WHCS continues to be a popular site for the training of students of all disciplines.

If you meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa or the criteria for bulimia nervosa you may be eligible to receive free treatment as part of the research program at the Eating Disorders Unit at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, located at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. The Eating Disorders Unit is a nationally recognized treatment/research program which provides both inpatient and outpatient treatment. The clinic is staffed by psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and research personnel, all with training and experience in the treatment of eating disorders. The purpose of the clinic is to study bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa and to find more effective treatments for each. Since ours is a research program, we offer free treatment to women with moderate to severe eating disorders who are appropriate for our current research and treatment studies. The Eating Disorders Unit receives support from private grants and from the federal and state governments. How Do I Get More Information? If you would like further information, to make a referral, or to apply to the program, please contact us at the Eating Disorders Clinic. When you call you will be given a more detailed description of the program and asked a series of questions. A personal interview is then scheduled, to determine eligibility for participation and to provide additional information.

What is Anorexia Nervosa? Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-maintained low weight and loss of menstrual periods accompanied by an intense fear of fatness and a distorted body image. There are two types of anorexia nervosa: restricting and binge-eating/purging. Individuals with restricting type severely limit their food intake and/or exercise excessively. Individuals with binge-eating/purging type engage in binge-eating; self-induced vomiting; or the abuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas. Who Gets Anorexia Nervosa? About 95% of patients with anorexia nervosa are women. Most of them develop the disorder in late adolescence or early adulthood. Despite the large number of women who report some sort of eating disturbance, only a small number (0.5-1.0%) actually meet full diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa.

What is Bulimia Nervosa? Bulimia nervosa is characterized by binge-eating and inappropriate methods of weight control accompanied by excessive shape and weight concerns. A binge is defined as an episode in which one eats a much larger amount of food than most people would in a similar situation and experiences a sense of loss of control. There are two types of bulimia nervosa: purging and nonpurging. Individuals with purging bulimia nervosa self-induce vomiting or abuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas to counteract the effects of binge-eating; Individuals with nonpurging type fast or exercise excessively following episodes of binge-eating. Who Gets Bulimia Nervosa? About 90% of patients with bulimia nervosa are women. Most of them develop the disorder in early adulthood. While many women report various symptoms of bulimia nervosa, only 1-3% of young women meet the full diagnostic criteria for the disorder.

Our inpatient facility provides treatment for women from ages 16 through 45 who meet diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. The average length of stay is three to four months. Treatment is multi-disciplinary and consists of nutritional management, group and individual psychotherapy, and behavioral interventions geared towards normalizing eating behavior and weight. Patients are placed on a well-balanced diet and their weight is gradually restored to a normal range (90% of expected body weight and above). Psychotherapy is used to treat emotional problems associated with the eating disorder as well as to help restructure distorted thoughts about eating and weight. Treatment is offered at no cost in exchange for participation in ongoing research studies. Currently this entails participating in a seven week trial of fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant medication, during the inpatient stay. Upon discharge, patients who received treatment on the inpatient unit may be eligible to receive up to one year of free outpatient psychotherapy as part of our investigation of relapse prevention in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.

We offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment to women age 18 through 50 who meet diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Research studies currently underway for bulimia nervosa aim to clarify the importance of a variety of psychological and biological disturbances in the development of this eating disorder. Eligible individuals who participate in these studies may receive inpatient or outpatient care at no charge. In the past we have conducted studies examining the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on how one's attitudes about food, dieting, weight, and body shape may affect behavior. Interpersonal therapy focuses on examining interpersonal relationships and how they affect eating habits and attitudes. Since the research on the unit frequently changes, we are unable to provide details on what studies are currently available. You can, of course, contact us for more details. Typical research can take anywhere from an afternoon to a few months. Participants in the IPT & CBT study mentioned above received approximately 19 sessions of individual psychotherapy (either cognitive behavioral or interpersonal) free of charge over the course of four months.

In the letter, which requested that she be accepted into his program, the woman described her problems as follows: Several years ago, in college, I started using laxatives to lose weight. I started with a few and increased the number as they became ineffective. After 2 years I was taking 250-300 Ex-Lax pills at one time with a glass of water, 20 per gulp. I would lose as much as 20 pounds in a 24-hour period, mostly water and some food, [and would be] dehydrated so that I couldn't stand, and could barely talk. I ended up in the university infirmary several times with diagnoses of food poisoning, severe gastrointestinal flu, etc., with bland diets and medications. I was released within a day or two. A small duodenal ulcer appeared and disappeared on X-rays in 1975. I would not eat for days, then would eat something, and, overcome by guilt at eating, and hunger, would eat, eat, eat. A girl on my dorm floor told me that she occasionally forced herself to vomit so that she wouldn't gain weight. I did this every once in a while and discovered that I could consume large amounts of food, vomit, and still lose weight. This was spring of 1975. 1 lost nearly 50 pounds over a few months, to 90 pounds. My hair started coming out in handfuls, and my teeth were loose. I never felt lovelier or more confident about my appearance: physically liberated, streamlined, close-to-the-bone. I was flat everywhere except my stomach when I binged, when I would be full-blown and distended. When I bent over, each rib and back vertebra was outlined. After vomiting, my stomach was once more flat, empty. The more I lost, the more I was afraid of getting fat. I was afraid to drink water for days at a time because it would add pounds on the scale and make me miserable. Yet I drank (or drink; perhaps I should be writing this all in the present tense) easily a half-gallon of milk and other liquids at once when bingeing. I didn't need the laxatives as much to get rid of food and eventually stopped using them altogether (although I am still chronically constipated, I become nauseous whenever I see them in the drugstore). I exercised for hours each day to tone my figure from the weight fluctuations, and joined the university track team. I wore track shoes all the time and ran to classes and around town, stick-legs pumping. I went to track practice daily after being sick, until I was forced to quit; a single lap would make me dizzy, with cramps in my stomach and legs. At some point during my last semester before dropping out I came across an article on anorexia nervosa. It frightened me; my own personal obsession with food and body weight was shared by other people. I had not menstruated in 2 years. So, I forced myself to eat and digest healthy food. Hated it. I studied nutrition and gradually forced myself to accept a new attitude toward food—vitalizing—something needed for life. I gained weight, fighting panic. In a rigid, controlled way I have maintained myself nutritionally ever since: 105-115 pounds at 5'6". I know what I need to survive and I eat it—a balanced diet with the fewest possible calories, mostly vegetables, fruits, fish, fowl, whole grain products, and so on. In 5 years I have not eaten anything like pizza, pastas or pork, sweets, or anything fattening, fried or rich without being very sick. Once I allowed myself an ice cream cone. But I am usually sick if I deviate as much as one bite. It was difficult for me to face people at school, and I dropped courses each semester, collecting incompletes but finishing well in the few classes I stayed with. The absurdity of my reclusiveness was even evident to me during my last semester when I signed up for correspondence courses, while living only two blocks from the correspondence university building on campus. I felt I would only be able to face people when I lost "just a few more pounds." Fat. I cannot stand it. This feeling is stronger and more desperate than any horror at what I am doing to myself. If I gain a few pounds I hate to leave the house and let people see me. Yet I am sad to see how I have pushed aside the friends, activities, and state of energized health that once rounded my life. For all of this hiding, it will surprise you to know that I am by profession a model. Last year when I was more in control of my eating-vomiting I enjoyed working in front of a camera, and I was doing well. Lately I've been sick too much and feel out-of-shape and physically unself-confident for the discipline involved. I keep myself supported during this time with part-time secretarial work, and whatever unsolicited photo bookings my past clients give me. For the most part I do the secretarial work. And I can't seem to stop being sick all of the time. The more I threw up when I was in college, the longer it took, and the harder it became. I needed to use different instruments to induce vomiting. Now I double two electrical cords and shove them several feet down into my throat. This is preceded by 6-10 doses of ipecac [an emetic]. My knees are calloused from the time spent kneeling sick. The eating-vomiting process takes usually 2-3 hours, sometimes as long as 8. I dread the gagging and pain and sometimes my throat is very sore and I procrastinate using the ipecac and cords. I sit on the floor, biting my nails, and pulling the skin off around my nails with tweezers. Usually I wear rubber gloves to prevent this somewhat. After emptying my stomach completely I wash thoroughly. In a little while I will hydrate myself with a bottle of diet pop, and take a handful of Lasix [furosemide; a diuretic] 40 mg (which I have numerous prescriptions for). Sometimes I am faint, very cold. I splash cool water on my face, smooth my hair, but my hands are shaking some. I will take aspirin if my hands hurt sharply . . . so I can sleep later. My lips, fingers are bluish and cold. I see in the mirror that blood vessels are broken. There are red spots over my eyes. They always fade in a day or two. There is a certain relief when it is over, that the food is gone, and I am not horribly fat from it. And I cry often . . . for some rest, some calm. It is foolish for me to cry for someone, someone to help me; when it is only me who is hiding and hurting myself. Now there is a funny new split in my behavior, this honesty about my illness. Hopefully it will bring me more help than humiliation. Sometimes I feel a hypocrisy in my actions, and in the frightened, well-ordered attempts to seek out help. All the while I am still sick, night after night after night. And often days as well. Two sets of logic seem to be operating against each other, each determined, each half-canceling the effects of the other. It is the part of me which forced me to eat that I'm talking about . . . which cools my throat with water after hours of heaving, which takes potassium supplements to counteract diuretics, and aspirin for torn hands. It is this part of me, which walks into a psychiatrist's office twice weekly and sees the liability of hurting myself seriously, which makes constant small efforts to repair the tearing-down. It almost sounds as if I am being brutalized by some unrelenting force. Ridiculous to feel this way, or to stand and cry, because the hands that cool my throat and try to make small repairs only just punched lengths of cord into my stomach. No demons, only me. For your consideration, I am Gratefully yours, Nancy Lee Duval Ms. Duval was admitted to the research ward for study. Additional history revealed that her eating problems began gradually during her adolescence, and had been severe for the past 3-4 years. At age 14 she weighed 128 pounds and had reached her adult height of 5'6". She felt "terribly fat" and began to diet without great success. At age 17 she weighed 165 pounds and began to diet more seriously for fear that she would be ridiculed and went down to 130 pounds over the next year. She recalled feeling very depressed, overwhelmed, and insignificant. She began to avoid difficult classes so that she would never get less than straight A's, and began to lie about her school and grade performance for fear of being humiliated. She had great social anxiety in dealing with boys, which culminated in her transferring to a girls' school for the last year of high school. When she left for college, her difficulties increased. She had trouble deciding how to organize her time—whether to study, to date, or to see friends. She became more desperate to lose weight and began to use laxatives, as she describes in her letter. At age 20, in her sophomore year of college, she reached her lowest weight of 88 pounds (70% of ideal body weight) and stopped menstruating. As Ms. Duval describes in her letter, she recognized that there was a problem and eventually forced herself to gain weight. Nonetheless, the overeating and vomiting she had begun the previous year worsened. As she was preoccupied with her weight and her eating, her school performance suffered, and she dropped out of school midway through college at age 21. Ms. Duval is the second of four children and the only girl. She comes from an upper-middle-class professional family. From the patient's description, it sounds as though the father has a history of alcoholism. There are clear indications of difficulties between the mother and the father, and between the boys and the parents; but no other family member has ever had psychiatric treatment. Discussion Ms. Duval has Anorexia Nervosa, a disorder that was first described 300 years ago and given its current name in 1868. Although theories about the cause of the disorder have come and gone, the essential features have remained unchanged. Ms. Duval poignantly describes these features. She had an intense and irrational fear of becoming obese, even when she was emaciated. Her body image was disturbed in that she perceived herself as fat when her weight was average and "never lovelier" when, to others, she must have appeared grotesquely thin. She lost about 30% of her body weight by relentless dieting and exercising, self-induced vomiting, and use of cathartics and diuretics. She had not menstruated for the past 3 years. Significantly, Ms. Duval's dieting takes place despite persistent hunger; thus, the anorexia (loss of appetite) in the name of the disorder is a misnomer. In fact, she also has recurrent episodes of binge eating—rapid, uncontrolled consumption of high-caloric foods. These binges are followed by vomiting and remorse. This pattern of recurrent binge eating and purging, if it occurred by itself, would warrant the diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa, Purging Type. However, when it occurs during the course of Anorexia Nervosa, only the diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa is made, but qualified as Binge Eating/Purging Type. When an emaciated patient with Anorexia Nervosa insists that she is fat, this suggests the presence of a somatic delusion, as might be seen in Schizophrenia or Major Depression. However, such a patient is generally not considered to have a delusion because she is describing how she experiences herself rather than disputing the facts of her weight. Follow-up Ms. Duval remained in the research ward for several weeks, during which time she participated in research studies and, under the structure of the hospital setting, was able to give up her abuse of laxatives and diuretics. After her return home, she continued in treatment with a psychiatrist in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy two times a week, which she had begun 6 months previously. That therapy continued for approximately another 6 months, when her family refused to support it. The patient also felt that, although she had gained some insight into her difficulties she had been unable to change her behavior Two years after leaving the hospital, she wrote that she was "doing much better." She had reenrolled in college, and was completing her course work satisfactorily. She had seen a nutritionist, and felt that form of treatment was useful for her in learning what a normal diet was and how to maintain a normal weight. She was also receiving counseling from the school guidance counselors, but she did not directly relate that to her eating difficulties. Her weight was normal and she was menstruating regularly. She continued to have intermittent difficulty with binge eating and vomiting, but the frequency and severity of these problems were much reduced. She no longer abused diuretics or laxatives.

She had begun to lose weight 4 years earlier, initially dieting to lose an unwanted 6 pounds. Encouraged by compliments on her new body, she proceeded to lose 8 more pounds. Over the next 2 years she continued to lose weight, increased her physical activity until her weight reached a low of 64 pounds, and stopped menstruating. She was admitted to a medical unit, treated for peptic ulcer disease, and discharged, only to he admitted 3 months thereafter to the psychiatric unit of a general hospital. During that 8-week hospitalization, she went from 84 pounds to 100 pounds. She did well until she went off to college, where, with increased academic and social demands, she again began to diet until she weighed only 67 pounds. Her eating habits were ritualized: she cut food into very small pieces, moved them around on the plate, and ate very slowly. She resisted eating foods with high fat and carbohydrate content. She was troubled by the changes in her body, and became increasingly anxious as her figure developed. She was forced to drop out of school and to accept another hospitalization . Peggy was motivated to comply with treatment, but her fears of gaining weight and becoming obese affected her progress. She was expected to gain a minimum of 2 pounds every week, and she was restricted to bed rest if she failed to gain sufficient weight. In psychotherapy Peggy was gradually guided to discuss her feelings and to actually look at herself in the mirror. She was initially instructed to look at one part of her body for a minimum of 10 seconds, and the time was progressively increased until she could look at her whole body without any anxiety. Her menses returned at a weight of 93 pounds. After 7 months of individual and family treatment, she was discharged at a weight of 100 pounds. Peggy returned to college, worked part time, and lived with her parents. Discussion As is usually the case with Anorexia Nervosa, the characteristic signs and symptoms leave little doubt concerning the correct diagnosis. Peggy has all of the salient features, including refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height; intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, even though underweight; disturbance in the way in which her body weight or shape is experienced (anxiety when viewing her body); and in postmenarchal females, amenorrhea. Because her method of losing weight has never involved purging (self-induced vomiting or use of laxatives or diuretics) or binge eating (consumption of large amounts of food with a sense of loss of control), the subtype is specified as Restricting Type. Peggy exhibited compulsive ritualistic behavior with regard to food (e.g., cutting her food into very small pieces and moving it around on her plate before eating it), a feature commonly see in patients with Anorexia Nervosa. Although her compulsive eating behavior might suggest the possible additional diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, a separate diagnosis is not given as the compulsive behavior is accounted for by the diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa. During the course of the Anorexia Nervosa, Peggy experienced depression and panic attacks. There is insufficient information about these symptoms to make a definitive diagnosis of a Mood or an Anxiety Disorder. However, the occurrence of these comorbid disorders is common in patients with Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa is a serious and often life-threatening disorder. This case illustrates that with expert treatment, a good outcome is possible. Follow up Over the next 10 years, Peggy graduated from college with a degree in nutrition and was selected to do an internship with a major corporation. She has excelled in her work, receiving several promotions. She married, but the relationship deteriorated as her husband became physically abusive. She moved out, obtained a court order of protection, and eventually a divorce. Her most recent correspondence told of her return to graduate school (all expenses paid and full salary), a new romance, and success in a marathon (third place in a 26-mile race). She has maintained her weight at around 116 pounds and menstruates normally. She did seek counseling to sort out issues related to her broken marriage and her estrangement from her sister, which has since been resolved. She describes her life now as full and satisfying.

Single, independent, and devoted to her work, Abby had just sold her first screenplay. She was pleased, but she was also experiencing the "postpartum" letdown that always occurred when she finished a major project. Despite knowing, from 2 years in Overeaters Anonymous (OA), that she needed to keep a safe distance from food, especially in emotionally hard times, Abby spent the entire day of the wedding rehearsal party in the company of food. She stood in her friend's kitchen for hours cutting, chopping, sorting, arranging, and, eventually, picking at the food. When night and the guests came, the flurry of activity made it easy for Abby to disappear—physically and emotionally—into a binge. She started with a plate of what would have been an "abstinent" meal (an OA concept for whatever is included on one's meal plan): pasta salad, green salad, cold cuts, and a roll. Although the portions were generous, Abby wanted more. She spent the next 5 hours eating, at first trying to graze among the guests, but then, when shame set in, retreating to dark corners of the room to take frantic, stolen bites. Abby stuffed herself with crackers, cheeses, breads, chicken, turkey, pasta, and salads, but all that was a prelude to what she really wanted—sugar. She'd been waiting for the guests to leave the dining room, where the desserts were. When they finally did, she cut herself two pieces of cake, then two more, then ate directly from the serving tray, shoveling the food into her mouth. She reached for cookies, more cake, and cookies again. Heart racing, terrified of being discovered, Abby finally tore herself away and slipped out onto the terrace. By now, in what she thought of as a "food trance," Abby piled her plate with bread, onto which she smeared some unidentifiable spread. Though the food tasted like mud, Abby kept eating. Soon. other guests came out to the terrace, leaving Abby feeling she had to move again, which she did, stepping into the kitchen—and the light. When Abby glanced down at her plate, she was horrified; ants were crawling all over it. Instead of reflexively spitting out the food, Abby, overcome by shame, could only swallow. Then her eyes began to search the debris on her plate for uncontaminated morsels. Witnessing her own madness, Abby began to cry. She flung the plate into the trash and ran to her room. That event marked the beginning of a 6-month relapse into binge eating—Abby's worst experience with bingeing since the problem began 15 years earlier. During the relapse, she binged on sugar foods and refined carbohydrates, returned to cigarette smoking to control the bingeing, and once again was driven to "get rid" of the calories by incessant exercise after each binge, walking 4 or 5 hours at a time, dragging her bicycle up and down six flights of stairs, and biking miles after dark in a dangerous city park. Discussion The term eating binge is often used by people to describe occasions on which they eat more food than they should. However Abby's description of her eating episode at the wedding rehearsal leaves little doubt that her episodes of binge eating, during which she has no control over how much she eats, represent a serious symptom. In diagnosing a person with recurrent eating binges, the first question is whether or not that person regularly compensates for the overeating by some drastic inappropriate behavior. If the answer is no, the diagnosis is probably Binge-Eating Disorder, a nonofficial diagnosis that is included in a DSM-IV appendix of diagnoses requiring further study. If the answer is yes and as is usually the case, self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight, the diagnosis is Bulimia Nervosa. Most patients with Bulimia Nervosa compensate for the binge eating by some method of purging—either self-induced vomiting (most common) or the use of diuretics or laxatives. Abby's disorder is an example of the relatively unusual diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa, Nonpurging Type, in which the patient uses methods such as excessive exercise (Abby's method) or fasting. Follow-up Throughout the relapse, Abby went to therapy and to OA. But the bingeing worsened, as did the accompanying isolation and depression, which kept her awake, often crying uncontrollably, until the early morning hours. Finally, her therapist, a social worker, referred her to a psychiatrist, who put her on an antidepressant that has been used to control binge eating and on a structured food plan that excluded refined sugars, breads, crackers, and similar carbohydrates. Within a few weeks, Abby was able to stop bingeing, come out of the depression, and resume her life. After 2 years on the medication, no binges, and the gradual reintroduction of breads and related carbohydrates into her diet, Abby was able to stop taking the antidepressant, without depression or a return to binge eating. She continues to be active in OA. From: Spitzer RL, Gibbon M, Skodol AE, et al.: DSM-IV Casebook: A Learning Companion to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.

Although he had lost 58 pounds in the last 5 months, dropping from 250 to 192 pounds on a 6'1" frame, he was still terrified of getting fat. Gregory first began to diet 5 months earlier when his wife told him he was "a fat slob" and implied that she might be considering a divorce. This terrified him and started him on a strict dietary regimen: an omelet and bran for breakfast, coffee for lunch, and salad and shrimp or chicken for dinner. His original goal was to lose about 50 pounds. When dieting did not result in sufficiently rapid loss of weight, he started sticking his finger down his throat to induce vomiting after meals. Gregory is now "obsessed" with food. Before he goes to a restaurant, he worries about what he will order. He has done a study of what he eats in terms of what is easiest to purge, and he knows all the bathrooms in the areas he frequents. He cannot bear feeling full after eating and worries that his stomach is "fat." Three or four times a week he is unable to resist the urge to "binge." At those times he feels that his eating is out of control, and he may gobble down as much as three hamburgers, two orders of french fries, a pint of ice cream, and two packages of Oreo cookies. He always induces vomiting after a binge. He has never used laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills to lose weight. Gregory is also preoccupied with being thin. He has progressively revised downward his original goal in dieting, first to 190, and then to 185 pounds. He has begun to exercise, walking at least an hour a day and, more recently, working out with weights several times a week. He believes that women look at him differently now: when he was heavy, they glanced at him casually; now their response is "admiring." Gregory has always been somewhat heavy, turning to food in times of stress, but he never worried about his weight until his wife criticized his appearance. He can no longer enjoy any meals and feels he has lost control of this area of his life as he cannot stop dieting, even though his wife has told him he is now too thin. He therefore recently saw his internist, who found no physical problems and referred him for psychiatric evaluation. Discussion Gregory's eating disorder began, as is often the case, with a reasonable attempt to lose some weight. He soon became preoccupied with losing weight and continued to view his body as "fat" even though others did not. This preoccupation with losing weight and distorted body image suggest Anorexia Nervosa, but this diagnosis is not made as Gregory has not let his weight go far below the normal minimum for his size. Gregory's binges (recurrent eating of a large amount of food with a sense of loss of control), his recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to avoid weight gain (in his case, by self-induced vomiting), and the overconcern with weight and shape indicate Bulimia Nervosa. As is usually the case in Bulimia Nervosa, the predominant method for avoiding weight gain is vomiting, hence the diagnosis is further qualified as Purging Type. Less common methods for avoiding weight gain are misuse of laxatives or diuretics (also considered as Purging Type), fasting, and excessive exercise.

The Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc. Abel Lajtha, Ph.D., President Stewart O. Hughes, Managing Director Steven M. Papp, Director of Administration - RFMH at NYSPI Frank L. Mucha, Deputy Director of Administration - RFMH at NYSPI The Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc. is a not-for-profit membership corporation organized in 1952, for the purpose of assisting and enhancing the research and training objectives of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene and its component agencies; the Office of Mental Health, the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. It is governed by a Board of Directors, consisting of twenty-two prominent scientists, administrators and government officials, which is responsible for setting the operational policies of the corporation. Through an agreement with New York State, the Foundation has been designated as the organization responsible for administering and directing the conduct of all sponsored research programs carried out by scientists at Department research institutes or facilities. In this role the Foundation provides an organizational bridge between the scientist and those wishing to support his or her work, be it the Federal Government, State Government, Industry, Individuals, Foundations or, as is frequently the case, a combination of multiple sponsors. We see ourselves as unique in our ability to bring together the resources of organizations having different legal or management systems. We do this in a well coordinated, fiscally sound fashion. The Foundation manages grant and contract funds exceeding sixty million dollars annually. Its member scientists have been involved in hundreds of pioneering studies in the basic and clinical sciences, many of which have led to major breakthroughs in the care and treatment of mentally disabled persons. For their efforts, our member scientists have received numerous awards and honors, placing them and their work at the forefront of science throughout the world. Along with our basic and clinical research, we are frequently asked toundertake special projects on behalf of the New York State Department ofMental Hygiene. These typically involve operational needs of theDepartment. Included in these projects have been evaluation studies ofservice programs, needs assessment and epidemiological studies anddevelopment of clinical and administrative computerized informationsystems. While these efforts are normally undertaken at one of the fourresearch institutes operated by the Department, they may also take placeat one of the thirty Adult and Children's Psychiatric Centers operated bythe Office of Mental Health, the thirteen Developmental DisabilitiesServices Offices operated by the Office of Mental RetardationDevelopmental Disabilities, or the thirteen Alcoholism Treatment Centers operated by the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. Our designation by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) Corporation means that all donations are fully tax deductible. In addition, we can accommodate the wishes of individuals in their estate planning, should they be interested in providing general or designated support of our programs. As our focus is research and treatment of the mentally disabled, a major concern is the transfer of new knowledge, technology and treatment methods to the service system. We do this by publishing the results of our research and by sponsoring symposia and training programs. Where patentable technology is involved, depending on the sponsorship, we have the capacity to enter into various types of licensing or other agreements with industry to insure expeditious development and commercialization. Our research is conducted at the following Institutes: New York State Psychiatric Institute The Nathan S.

A number of these volunteers were students from a variety of clinical disciplines, such as Recreational Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Social Work, who were completing internships under the supervision of Institute staff. The majority of volunteers, however, were people who wanted to contribute to the field of psychiatry as well as gain some invaluable experience for their future. In many cases, people who were dissatisfied with their present careers volunteered their service as a means of sampling a career in mental health. Prospective volunteers were first interviewed by the Coordinator of Volunteer Services to determine what they may have to offer the Institute, and to determine what the Institute may have to offer them. A referral was then made to the appropriate department head or liaison. Areas that made regular use of volunteers during this period included several research projects, clinical units, and departments. Volunteers led diverse patient groups, such as Writers' Workshop, Crafts, and Computer Class. Under the guidance of Dr. Jane Fried, Chairperson of the Infection Control Committee, efforts were made in 1994 to make the Institute a safer environment in which volunteers would work. Policy was initiated that required all prospective volunteers to attend orientation to Fire Safety and Infection Control procedures. They were also required to submit a physical health history that documented their TB status and history of vaccinations. No volunteer could be registered without having satisfied these requirements.WT02-B10-208IA093-000995-B030-329http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_NU.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073332 text/html 4628HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:37:35 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4498 Support ServicesNursing Department Marcia Lipper Michaelson, R.N., M.S., C.S., Director During 1994, the Department of Nursing attained full staffing. Nurses and Mental Health Therapy Aides applied for both full and part-time positions at Psychiatric Institute, because of interesting assignments in our research areas and acute setting, and opportunities to attend sophisticated education programs. The Nursing Staff Development department focused on a number of topics pertinent to our patient population. Education was provided concerning the Adolescent and Older Adult, as well as Dual Diagnosis, Cultural Awareness, and the Interrelationship of Physical/ Mental Illness. The department's most significant contribution to the Institute was the continuation of exemplary nursing practice. As with many other institutions offering nursing services, the department provides twenty-four-hour per day care. While there is overlapping of duties on each shift, each tour provides its own special contributions, as patients' and families' needs change throughout the day. Due to their expertise, proximity, and direct care responsibilities nurses and aides respond immediately to both psychiatric and medical emergencies, providing necessary interventions and support. Two nursing staff members received awards for outstanding service. Ms. Gretchen Seirmarco was selected for the 1994 Nursing Excellence Award, and Mr. Peter Biggins was recognized by his colleagues for the 1994 Mental Health Therapy Aide Award for Excellence. Group work remained a priority on a number of units and two new groups began. On PI6 ICU, Allen Spatafore, R.N. is leading Current Events, and on PI5 South, Frances Martinez, M.H.T.A. is running a Crafts Group. Other ongoing groups led by nursing personnel are: Horticulture, Smoking Cessation, Patient Pass, and Health Education on the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Washington Heights inpatient staff lead forums concerning Discharge Planning, Psychoeducation, Current Events, Unit Orientation, and issues concerning people with Mental Illness/Chemical Abuse. Nurses and mental health therapy aides of the General Clinical Research Unit are involved in Discharge, Health Awareness, Women's, Crafts, and Addictions Groups. Clinical Psychopharmacology nursing service staff members lead Multi-Family and Eating Disorder Groups. Children in the Day Hospital Program attend Social Skills Training, as well as Boys' and Girls' Groups. Outpatient nurses and aides greatly contribute to patients remaining in the community. When patients have exacerbations of problems/symptoms, they may often be first noted by OPD staff who provide assessment and assist them in obtaining appropriate treatment. Nurses in outpatient research settings are also facilitating protocols and contributing to the research efforts. Registered nurses are employed by the Children's Day Program, Biological Psychiatry, Clinical Psychopharmacology, and Brain Imaging, as well as in the Lithium, Anxiety Disorders, HIV, and Depression Evaluation Clinics. Nursing personnel are also encouraged to share their expertise in the community. Ms. Kathleen Ibrahim, Assistant to the Director of Nursing for Staff Development, presented "Perspectives on Multiple Family Group Therapy with Eating Disordered Patients," at the Society for Education and Research in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing. Linda Fitzsimons, ECT Nurse, was a guest lecturer at Adelphi University's Masters Degree in Social Work Program where she spoke on "Group Psychotherapy with the Elderly"; she also contributed to a number of publications concerning ECT and depression. A number of personnel were also awarded advanced degrees, certificates, or honors. Kathleen Ibrahim completed the Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing program in Psychoanalysis at Columbia University School of Nursing. Other degree recipients included: Lonnie Crews, M.H.T.A. earned an Associate in Applied Science, with a major in nursing; and Nevada Solano, M.H.T.A. earned an Associate in Human Services. Mary Ellen Lovrin, R.N. and Dee Mancuso, R.N. were inducted into the International Nursing Honor Society.WT02-B10-209IA093-000995-B030-384http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_RT.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073424 text/html 4392HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:38:22 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4262 Support Services Recreational Therapy Matt Gold, C.T.R.S., Director During 1994, the Recreational Therapy department of Psychiatric Institute continued its work towards enabling the inpatients to attain more fulfilling and independent leisure lifestyles. Therapeutic Recreation is the use of leisure services to improve or maintain physical, emotional, cognitive, and/or social functioning to assist patients in expressing independent leisure lifestyles. During this year, the staff of the department again functioned as active members of their respective interdisciplinary treatment teams. Their responsibilities included assessing patients' levels of leisure functioning, planning and implementing a variety of activities, charting patients' progress, participating in team meetings, maintaining their own level of professional preparedness, and contributing to the education and training of the many volunteers, students, new practitioners, and interns who come to the Institute. Recreational Therapy services were offered during days and evenings. The major focus of this treatment modality was activity groups, but individual attention was also provided, as appropriate. The Recreational Therapy department offered a weekly average of well over 40 regularly scheduled groups on the inpatient units, in addition to individual work with the patients, and special event programming. In all, the department provided almost 50 hours per week of group and individual service. Groups included sports and movement groups, crafts and hobby groups, and discussion groups. 1994 was an active period of personnel change within the department. Kay Gimmestad resigned from her position as half-time Recreation Therapist on the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Johnny Lopez, C.T.R.S., and Robert Goldstein, C.T.R.S., were hired to provide evening and weekend programming. Leon Sanders resigned his position as Senior Recreation Therapist within the Washington Heights Community Service, to accept a similar position at another OMH facility. Wendi Hapke, C.T.R.S. was hired as a Recreation Therapist on the Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit. Lori Alpert, C.T.R.S. was hired as a Senior Recreation Therapist on the WHCS-lntensive Care Unit. Patricia Smith was promoted to a Senior Recreation Therapist position and was named Assistant Director of the department as she continued her work on the General Clinical Research Service. Special Event Programming also figured prominently in the department's service during the summer. Included were trips, barbecues on the Porch, and a softball game and picnic. During National Therapeutic Recreation Week in July, department members joined their colleagues within the Therapeutic Recreation department at Presbyterian Hospital for a softball game against local radio station WMXV to raise funds for the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) Neighborhood Fund. Again meeting its responsibility to the community at large, the medical center, and to the staff of the Institute, the department made the gym available to the Audubon O.P.D., Neuro 12 and Eye 6, the Presbyterian Hospital Employees' Recreation Association, a community-based Karate Club, an Exercise Class for staff, and a staff basketball group. Department members improved their own clinical skills by attending professional conferences and workshops, such as the Mid-Eastern Symposium on Therapeutic Recreation, the Therapeutic Recreation Forum, and the Annual Conference sponsored by the American Therapeutic Recreation Association. Matt Gold continued teaching Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation this year, as one of the Institute's American Heart Association C.P.R. instructors. Mr. Gold continued his active involvement in professional organizations, and helped form the New York State Therapeutic Recreation Association, representing Therapeutic Recreation professionals within New York State. He serves as this organization's Treasurer.WT02-B10-210IA093-000995-B030-315http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_CC.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073318 text/html 1057HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:37:24 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 928 Support Services Computer Center Donald C. Ross, Ph.D., Director The Psychiatric Institute Computer Center (PICC) has consolidated with the Computer Center at Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) to form the Integrated Research Information System (IRIS). The mainframe computer, now located at NKI, is an IBM ES/9000 with 64 MB of memory. The PICC continues to serve users with computer programming and statistical consultation; remote terminals and PCs are used to access the mainframe. PICC also provides its users with technical support for Macintosh and IBM clones. A large variety of up-to-date statistical and graphics (illustration, statistics related) software on PCs is provided as well as professional consulting in these areas.WT02-B10-211IA093-000995-B030-357http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_RX.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073354 text/html 3809HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:38:00 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 3679 Support Services Pharmacy Stephen McMillan, M.S., R.Ph., Director During 1994, the Pharmacy of the Psychiatric Institute continued to provide services for the two patient populations it serves. The inpatients, both acute care and research, were maintained on our modified unit-dose system. This system provides the staff with patient-specific packaging, thus minimizing the potential for error. Additionally, it allows the pharmacy to track with greater precision such issues as non-compliance, missed or refused dosages, and cost containment. Maintained via our computerized profile and order entry system, Pharmakon, the patients are consistently monitored for potential adverse events. Our outpatient population is comprised of both Washington Heights Community Services (WHCS) patients and those research outpatients who are maintained in our Compassionate Care program. The WHCS patients, also maintained within the Pharmakon system, have a computerized patient profile by which we perform prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) activities. The research outpatients are currently maintained on a manual profile system with the goal of computerization in early 1995. They, too, are monitored for any potential adverse events that could arise from the medications which they take. Patient education activities continued throughout 1994. All outpatients who picked up their medications at the pharmacy were offered written and verbal counselling in accordance with OBRA '90 regulations. In conjunction with requests from the WHCS or research clinics, written or verbal information was distributed to any patients requesting such who did not present at the pharmacy. On the inpatient side, with the help of the medical and nursing staff, written and verbal medication information was disseminated upon request. Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) principles were also stressed throughout the year. In addition to those indices which are presently monitored, the Pharmacy, Nursing, Medical Staff, and Quality Assurance departments formed a CQI committee specifically designed to address the process by which medications are "delivered" to the patient. A strategic plan was formulated for the committee, and we have nearly completed the first of our many intended projects. 1994 was also a year of many changes. After nearly 22 years of dedicated service, Valerio Nuccitelli, R.Ph. retired in July and was feted with a surprise retirement party. Stephen McMillan, M.S., R.Ph., former Director of Pharmacy at the St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, assumed the Director's role at Pl. In addition, Mr. McMillan has since been appointed to the OMH Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee as well as to a statewide multidisciplinary committee which is concerned with the processes by which medication is "delivered" within OMH. The addition of new computer equipment and software, as well as access to the on-line information superhighway, has allowed the Pharmacy to tap into a myriad of clinical and support information, thus providing opportunities by which to improve patient care. Computerization of our drug purchasing enabled us to provide quality drug products at the best possible price. We look to 1995 with great anticipation. We will continue to implement CQI principles as we strive to provide streamlined, professional, and courteous service to the patients and employees of the Institute.WT02-B10-212IA093-000995-B030-370http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_QA.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073402 text/html 4663HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:38:09 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4533 Support Services Quality Assurance Ruth Corn, M.S.W., Director 1994 was a year for the Institute to strengthen the principles and practices of its Quality Improvement Program led by the Department of Quality Assurance. This approach combines problem solving and continuous quality improvement efforts in order to ensure quality care. Quality Improvement (QI) activities focused on planning, measuring, assessing, and improving care in functions and processes involving clinical, administrative, support, and managerial services. A multi-disciplinary approach to reviewing and improving systems continued to be the core of comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and preventive activities. The Medical Staff Executive Committee and the Medical Staff Organization's many multi-disciplinary committees reviewed clinical practice with active leadership and participation of the staff of the Department of Quality Assurance. Consultation and guidance regarding QI activities were provided to Nursing, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Pharmacy, Infection Control, Dietetic Services, Housekeeping, Safety, and Education and Training. The monitoring of research protocols was conducted by the Research Monitor under the supervision of the Director for Quality Assurance with excellent results. The Research Monitor also took on an educative role in working with the staff of the outpatient research clinics regarding documentation and had much success in this endeavor. In addition, the plan to add a Program Evaluation Specialist to the Department of Quality Assurance was realized in the fall of 1994. The Program Evaluation Specialist has been able to develop specific trending and patterning reports over time regarding several patient care processes, and, in addition, is consultant to QI teams on the preparation and analysis of data in evaluating and improving specific functions of patient care. In the latter part of 1994, a questionnaire was developed by the Program Evaluation Specialist to assess the computer literacy and training needs of the clinical staff. Educational courses are now being set up to meet these needs by the Education and Training Department. A major organizational change occurred in March, 1994 with the establishment of a QI Council, chaired by the Director for Quality Assurance and composed of senior level representatives of various disciplines and programs. This council has become a central structure in providing leadership to promote the education of all staff in the methods and philosophy of the CQI process, in providing a forum for the identification of opportunities for improvement, in setting priorities for assessment and improvement, in identifying and convening interdepartmental teams for QI projects, and in recommending actions to improve and/or maintain improvement. The Council became the main coordinating group for carrying out the QI Program throughout the Institute. Some of the QI Projects that were initiated and completed in 1994 were: Medication Management Project, the Inpatient Adolescent Education Project, the Patient/Family Education Project, the Victims of Abuse Policy Project, and the Medical Records Documentation Project. Coping with Psychiatric Emergencies Project was begun in 1994 and is in progress. The Department of Quality Assurance continued its responsibility for credentialing and privileging of physicians as well as for the ongoing activities of the Department of Medical Records, Education and Training, and Utilization Review. The Medical Records Department increased its staffing and therefore was able to improve the turnaround time for research requests as well as to facilitate the timeliness of Medical Records completion. The Department of Education and Training organized special educational lectures and seminars on the topics of Child and Adolescents, The Aging Process, and Trauma and Abuse, and sponsored the annual Ethics lecture on "Boundary Violations in Clinical Practice." Much of this year's work by the Department of Quality Assurance focused on interpreting, communicating and implementing the new JCAHO Standards for the Institute. Preparation for the expected JCAHO Survey in March, 1995 was a major emphasis for the department and the Institute.WT02-B10-213IA093-000995-B028-324http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PI_ADMIN.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072051 text/html 805HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:24:58 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 676 N.Y.S.P.I.

Lane, M.S., Director During the year, the collection continued its rapid growth with the acquisition of many new books and journals. The journal collection was enhanced with several new titles from areas of current research and clinical interest. Notable among these were Anxiety and Human Brain Mapping. The subscription to Anxiety was initiated due to the ongoing interest in anxiety and panic disorder at the Institute. Together with Journal of Anxiety Disorders, this journal offers a convenient source for maintaining literature awareness in the anxiety disorders field. Human Brain Mapping is a richly illustrated journal which offers a source for the many Institute scientists investigating brain imaging and behavior. Book acquisitions included the latest edition of the DSM publications, which now consume almost an entire shelf. The library maintains a collection of all the DSMs from the first psychodynamically based system, published in 1952, to the present multiaxial classification. Literature searching on compact disc continued to be a heavily used service of the library. An estimated 8,000 search sessions were conducted during the year on the four work stations provided. The terminals were busy throughout the day and waiting lines were a common occurrence. The work stations were also busy during Saturday hours. During the year, the library attempted to improve the delivery of database services by entering into an agreement with Columbia University to subscribe to PsychInfo, a psychological database that offers many improvements over the PsychLit database currently used by the library. Among these benefits are increased coverage, faster response time, and lower cost. The database will also be on the ColumbiaNet system, making it accessible from office computers throughout the Institute. It will no longer be necessary to travel to the library to conduct searches. Interlibrary loans to other institutions have continued to be an important function of the library. Memberships in clearinghouse organizations such as the Medical Library Center of New York and the Northeast Regional Medical Library network have enhanced the library's visibility and have made the collection accessible to libraries throughout the country. Any library with a computer terminal and a subscription to the journal holdings microfiche of the Medical Library Center can request an interlibrary loan of a journal article and know in advance that it is in the library's collection. As a result, interlibrary loan statistics have risen this year to an all time high of 5,800 loans supplied to other institutions. By participating in these programs, the library has taken advantage of an excellent opportunity to share its resources and contribute to scientific scholarship.

The department added three new staff members during the year. Elaine Toskos, M.A., O.T.R./L and Ana Maria Loaiza, B.S., O.T./L joined the staff of the Intensive Care Unit, bringing the number of Occupational Therapy staff members on the unit to three. Lauren Roth, B.S., O.T.R./L, a Senior Occupational Therapist, joined the staff of the Audubon Clinic Continuing Treatment Program. Ms. Roth initiated a therapeutic community outreach activity in which several of her clients taught table games to clients of a nearby geriatric center. The program was successful in promoting the development of social skills in both populations and in increasing the self esteem of the psychiatric clients. On the Schizophrenia Research Unit, Jodi Carlson, M.S., O.T.R./L initiated data collection for her clinical research study, "Effectiveness of Social Skills Training of Schizophrenic Patients." She also developed a second research study, "Sensory Integration Treatment of Schizophrenia," with Scott Clark, M.D. Ms. Carlson began two new groups, Power Walking, which provides patients with low impact exercise to improve physical health and expand leisure interests, and Let's Move!, a sensorimotor group which is designed to improve patients' ability to attend to their surroundings and increase adaptive motor responses. Elaine Mullen, M.S., O.T.R./L continued to coordinate expansion of the activities program on the Intensive Care Unit, increasing the number of groups to more than 40 per week, with all disciplines assisting in group leadership. Bette Gifford, A.S., C.O.T.A./L added two new groups on the ICU-Sewing, a group designed to improve patients' task skills and to enhance their creative expression through structured sewing projects, and Memory Group, a group which utilized games requiring attention, memory, concentration, and decision making to improve patients' cognitive functioning. Jose Ortiz, A.S., C.O.T.A./L, led Shopping and Cooking groups to promote the development of independent shopping and meal preparation skills in patients of the ICU. His Shopping group included instruction in unit pricing and reading of food labels in order to improve patients' budgeting skills and compliance with special diets after discharge. On the General Clinical Research Service, Barbara Bouley, M.A., O.T.R./L, C.S.W. began a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Group based on Dr. Marsha Linehan's model of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. This group provided psychoeducation in four skill areas-mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance-to help patients with borderline personality disorder improve their behavioral coping skills. Jeffrey Tomlinson, O.T.R./L, M.S.W., C.S.W. received a Merit of Service Award from the American Association of Occupational Therapy in July, 1994 in recognition of his service on the AOTA's Mental Health Special Interest Section and on a Mental Health Task Force of the Association's Council on Education. Staff members supervised 64 Occupational Therapy students during the year. These included four Level II affiliating students, 18 Level I clerkship students, and 42 student observers.WT02-B10-216IA093-000995-B030-415http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PIDPT_SS.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073448 text/html 4944HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:38:55 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 4814 Support Services Social Work Jane A. Waters, A.C.S.W., Director A few changes in staff occurred in 1994. Barbara Erwin McGuire, Ph.D. left her position as the social worker on the ECT research project and Late Life Depression Clinic and was replaced by Shoshana Peyser, C.S.W. at the end of the year. Grant Stitt, C.S.W. resigned his position as social worker on the inpatient Washington Heights Community Service unit. Two new bilingual staff members have joined the Community Service. Quisqueya Meyreles, C.S.W., who trained as a social work intern in the Inwood Clinic during the 1993-1994 academic year, joined the Audubon and Inwood Clinics. Shane McGrail, C.S.W. was hired to replace Mr. Stitt on the inpatient community service. In addition to continuing her assignment as social worker in the Memory Disorders Clinic, Bobba Moody, C.S.W. has joined Shoshana Peyser, C.S.W. and Nancy Turret, C.S.W. in the Late Life Depression Clinic, which continued to experience a growth in its patient population and numbers of research protocols over the year. In the clinic, the social workers provide structured interviews and ratings of research subjects as well as assist in recruitment, evaluation, and referral of patients. The outpatient community clinics also experienced a growth in census, not only in the new MICA program at Inwood, but throughout the clinics and day programs. On the inpatient research units, staff continued their clinical assignments to provide assessment, treatment, and discharge planning for patients and their families and as supervisors of social work trainees in all aspects of clinical social work. Many staff also serve as cotherapists with and/or supervisors of residents and other staff and trainees in family or group treatment. Some highlights of the year 1994 in these areas were the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy group for eating disorder patients co-led by Carla Sadik, C.S.W. and Barbara Bouley, M.A., O.T.R./L, C.S.W. Ms. Sadik also continued to develop her eating disorder lunch/shopping group, which challenges these patients to practice normal eating in restaurants outside of the hospital and to deal with their changed bodies by trying on clothing appropriate to their increased body habitus as they approach their target weights. This group provides a forum for dealing with the many body-image and self-esteem problems presented by these patients. On the Schizophrenia Research Unit, Ellen Lukens, Ph.D. and Helle Thorning, C.S.W. have continued their research in the effectiveness of psychoeducational multiple family groups for this disorder. Ms. Thorning is also studying the impact of schizophrenia on family life with a focus on the experience of loss and its effect on siblings. Dr. Lukens has also provided supervision for other unit staff on psychosocial research and for the multiple family group on the Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit. Ms. Thorning and Dr. Lukens have also continued to present their research and to conduct workshops at other facilities and at the Annual Schizophrenia Conference for families and consumers hosted by the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry. Two new groups led by social workers in the outpatient clinics include a parenting group in the Audubon Clinic led by Cynthia Kolbowski, C.S.W. and a Latino Women's Group led by Quisqueya Meyreles, C.S.W. which utilized a culturally sensitive mixture of films, short stories, music, and food to address common themes. In the Memory Disorders Clinic, Bobba Moody, C.S.W. and Deborah Thorne, C.S.W. initiated a support and educational group for caregivers and family members of Alzheimer's patients. Ms. Moody served on two panels at meetings outside the Institute: "The Scientist-Practitioner" at the annual meeting of the New York State Society of Clinical Social Work and "Social and Economic Issues Related to Parkinson's Disease" at the Parkinson's Disease International Symposium. The social work student program continues to be highly sought after. In the 1993-1994 academic year, 16 students were placed at Psychiatric Institute for the practicum during the second year of their Masters in Social Work program. Our ten-week long summer internship was also highly subscribed, with six students and one new M.S.W. graduate completing the placement for which students at Hunter and New York University Schools of Social Work receive academic credit. In the fall of 1994, 17 students began their second-year placements in the department.WT02-B10-217IA093-000995-B028-373http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/PI_RCSDP.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121072117 text/html 935HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:25:25 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 806 N.Y.S.P.I.

This animal care facility serves scientists at Psychiatric Institute, the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and provides the best possible care for all animals. During the past year, we have made several advances in both the physical aspects of the facility and in the efficiency of its operations. Renovation of the steam exhaust system was completed, markedly improving the work environment for our staff. In addition, an automatic system for providing water to animals was installed. This system is labor saving, economical, and easier to sanitize than our previous water system. In response to the increasing care of transgenic mice, we have also revised our procedures to include autoclaving their cages to ensure the elimination of potentially harmful microorganisms. Our continuing education program has been highly effective. All personnel involved in animal research have now attended at least one seminar covering the rules and regulations that govern laboratory animal care, as well as animal procedures, and animal care preventive medicine. Dr. Marshall Primack continues to manage our Occupational Health Program. Our animal health monitoring system demonstrates that all the animals housed in PI are healthy.

Gorman, M.D. Deputy Director In 1994, we reaffirmed the threefold mission of the Psychiatric Institute: state-of-the-art research, outstanding clinical service, and excellent teaching. Although PI may be best known internationally for its research accomplishments, we continued to stress that all of our efforts ultimately serve one goal: to find and provide the best possible therapies for people suffering with mental illness. Construction of PI's new building has remained very close to schedule, thanks to the continued efforts of Dr. Oldham, Mr. Papp, and Ms. Corn. They have been assisted in this very complicated endeavor by many people, including Mr. Peter Reynolds and Mr. Hal Seligson. At every step of the way many things could easily have derailed this construction; each time these people have worked very hard to keep things on track. We now anticipate opening the building in slightly more than two years. In l994, Dr. David Strauss filled in ably as Acting Clinical Director after Dr. Russakoff's departure. An important new committee was established, the Quality Improvement (QI) Council, chaired by Ms. Corn. The QI Council is charged with the responsibility of developing and monitoring an ongoing process of continuous quality improvement at Psychiatric Institute. Many QI projects have already been initiated, and each has involved staff from many disciplines. It is the aim of the QI Council and of the QI Cabinet that all employees at Psychiatric Institute play a major and ongoing role in identifying areas for improvement, helping to implement changes, and assessing the progress we are making. In 1994, after many years of dedicated service to PI, Mr. Valerio Nuccitelli retired as director of our pharmacy. We were fortunate to have Mr. Stephen McMillan join us as the new pharmacy director. He has already made an outstanding contribution to the Institute. The multidisciplinary approach is key to our clinical efforts. Under the direction of the President of the Medical Staff Organization, Dr. Ewald Horwath, we have seen our medical staff take a larger role in assuring the quality of our clinical care. Every discipline is involved including Nursing, directed by Ms. Marcia Michaelson, Social Work, directed by Ms. Jane Waters, Occupational Therapy, directed by Ms. Barbara Bouley, Recreational Therapy, directed by Mr. Matt Gold, and Pharmacy, directed by Mr. Stephen McMillan. Mr. Gold also directs our very important volunteer program and made important steps this year to strengthen it. All of these disciplines work directly with our inpatient and outpatient services. Dr. Evelyn Attia led the Clinical Psychopharmacology service on PI7 which specialized in research involving patients with depression or eating disorders. The General Clinical Research Service, led by Dr. Lyle Rosnick on PI5, continued to hospitalize patients enrolled in several research protocols, including adolescents with suicidal behavior, patients needing ECT, and adults with suicidal behavior. In addition, patients with severe character disorders were also admitted to PI5. The Schizophrenia Research Unit, on PI4, had new leadership; Dr. Scott Clark stepped in to assume many of the unit chief responsibilities with the appointment of Dr. Strauss to the position of Clinical Director. Dr. Clark immediately began working to boost the census of PI4 and to solidify its relationship with its associated unit, the Schizophrenia Research Unit at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center. The latter came under the direction of Dr. Zafir Sharif in 1994. These two units form the foundation of the Developing Clinical Research Center that was funded in August 1994, by the National Institute of Mental Health. All of our research outpatient clinics continued to provide both outstanding care and important training sites in 1994. Of particular note was the funding by NIMH of a Hispanic Treatment Program, directed by Dr. Michael Liebowitz. This development makes it increasingly possible for us to be responsive to our community. The Washington Heights Community Service continued to be a model care-provider for patients with serious mental illness. Operating both an inpatient unit (on PI6, directed by Dr. Ewald Horwath) and two outpatient clinics (the Audubon Clinic, directed by Dr. Pellegrino Sarti, and the Inwood Clinic, directed by Dr. Siobhan Coomaraswamy), the Washington Heights Community Service continues to reflect the vision and dedication of its director, Dr. Francine Cournos. Our educational programs continue to be national resources. The residency education program, directed by Dr. Ronald Rieder, with assistance from Dr. Lisa Mellman, once again maneuvered successfully through the "Match," so that PI's residents continue to be among the best of any program in the United States. Dr. Rieder also continued to direct two NIMH-funded research fellowship programs. Medical students also continued to rate our educational programs very highly, thanks to the direction of Dr. Eric Marcus with assistance from Dr. Janice Cutler. We also continued major training programs in social work, psychology, nursing, and occupational and recreational therapy. For new and continuing employees we maintain many levels of educational programs, directed by Dr. Sandra Rosenblum. All of this work must take place in an environment that is safe and functions optimally. Here we recognize the efforts of Mr. Willie Herriott and our Safety Department and of Mr. Harold Jones and our Housekeeping Department. Resources are preciously few for these two departments, yet they continue to provide us with a very high level of service, for which all employees at PI are grateful. PI is only one year away from celebrating its 100th birthday, and it continues to provide a unique environment for the highest quality patient care, research, and education. This is because no matter how difficult things become, we have a group of clinicians, researchers, and support staff who are second to none, and who are dedicated to carrying out our nearly 100-year-old mission.

The mission of the division is to provide investigators at Psychiatric Institute with access to and training in state-of-the-art statistical techniques as needed for the optimal use of their research data. This includes developing and applying new methodology for the design and analysis of psychiatric studies, participating in major funded research, teaching statistics to researchers and post-doctoral fellows, and providing short-term consultations on data-analytic and design issues for grant submission and manuscript preparation. Methodological Research Methodological research in the division focuses on problems of particular relevance to psychiatric studies. Areas of expertise in the division include analysis of longitudinal studies with generalized linear models and variance components models, methods for dealing with missing data, causal models, and methodology for combining information from different sources (e.g., meta-analysis). For example, Dr. Christine Waternaux, Director, is investigating methods for power computations with longitudinal repeated measures. She has also investigated and published on the use of hierarchical models for combining psychiatric data. Dr. Eva Petkova, Associate Biostatistician, is specializing in statistical models for the analysis of longitudinal studies with informative drop-out. She is developing methodologies for the analysis of clinical trials when the traditional intent-to-treat approach is not appropriate because most drop-outs switch treatments. Dr. Xinhua Liu, Associate Biostatistician, is experienced in analyzing cohort data (e.g., New York gay man cohort) which traditionally have high dropout rates and a large proportion of missing observations. Her research is addressing the problem of adequacy of different analytical techniques in the presence of missing data. Collaborative and Consultative Activities Division staff have been very active in their collaborative and consultative efforts, thus demonstrating the great need for such services. For instance, in 1994, staff provided statistical input and participated in nineteen grant submissions. In April 1994, Dr. Christine Waternaux became the Director of the Biostatistics and Measurement Core of the NIMH-funded Clinical Research Center for the Study of YouthDepression, Anxiety, and Suicide (Principal Investigator: Dr. David Shaffer). In September 1994, Dr. Waternaux became the Director of the Statistics and Computing Core of the Clinical Research Center for the Study of Suicidal Behavior (Principal Investigator: Dr. J. John Mann). Division staff are also participating in consultations and meetings with the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core of the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies (Directors: Drs. Anke Erhardt and Zena Stein). As part of its training component, the division conducts weekly workshops in biostatistics and data management. These workshops illustrate analytic and data management issues, and explore emerging statistical methodologies in both fields. Topics covered this year have included random regression models, principles of modeling, meta-analysis, generalized estimating equations, and structural equation modeling. Please take a look at our calendar section of the home page for more up-to-date information. Division staff are also working with the Department of Postgraduate Education and with members of the NIMH Training Programs for Clinical and Research Fellows on matters concerning the statistical curriculum.

The mission of the division is to provide investigators at Psychiatric Institute with access to and training in state-of-the-art statistical techniques as needed for the optimal use of their research data. This includes developing and applying new methodology for the design and analysis of psychiatric studies, participating in major funded research, teaching statistics to researchers and post-doctoral fellows, and providing short-term consultations on data-analytic and design issues for grant submission and manuscript preparation. Methodological Research Methodological research in the division focuses on problems of particular relevance to psychiatric studies. Areas of expertise in the division include analysis of longitudinal studies with generalized linear models and variance components models, methods for dealing with missing data, causal models, and methodology for combining information from different sources (e.g., meta-analysis). For example, Dr. Christine Waternaux, Director, is investigating methods for power computations with longitudinal repeated measures. She has also investigated and published on the use of hierarchical models for combining psychiatric data. Dr. Eva Petkova, Associate Biostatistician, is specializing in statistical models for the analysis of longitudinal studies with informative drop-out. She is developing methodologies for the analysis of clinical trials when the traditional intent-to-treat approach is not appropriate because most drop-outs switch treatments. Dr. Xinhua Liu, Associate Biostatistician, is experienced in analyzing cohort data (e.g., New York gay man cohort) which traditionally have high dropout rates and a large proportion of missing observations. Her research is addressing the problem of adequacy of different analytical techniques in the presence of missing data. Collaborative and Consultative Activities Division staff have been very active in their collaborative and consultative efforts, thus demonstrating the great need for such services. For instance, in 1994, staff provided statistical input and participated in nineteen grant submissions. In April 1994, Dr. Christine Waternaux became the Director of the Biostatistics and Measurement Core of the NIMH-funded Clinical Research Center for the Study of YouthDepression, Anxiety, and Suicide (Principal Investigator: Dr. David Shaffer). In September 1994, Dr. Waternaux became the Director of the Statistics and Computing Core of the Clinical Research Center for the Study of Suicidal Behavior (Principal Investigator: Dr. J. John Mann). Division staff are also participating in consultations and meetings with the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core of the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies (Directors: Drs. Anke Erhardt and Zena Stein). As part of its training component, the division conducts weekly workshops in biostatistics and data management. These workshops illustrate analytic and data management issues, and explore emerging statistical methodologies in both fields. Topics covered this year have included random regression models, principles of modeling, meta-analysis, generalized estimating equations, and structural equation modeling. Division staff are also working with the Department of Postgraduate Education and with members of the NIMH Training Programs for Clinical and Research Fellows on matters concerning the statistical curriculum.

Thevariety of course offerings match the extraordinary diversity ofresearch and clinical activity of the Institute, from the most refinedbrain research to the broadest epidemiological investigations, fromstudies of brief, specifically targeted psychotherapies to studies ofservices and health policy. At Psychiatric Institute, clinicaleducation falls into several categories: * Psychiatric Educationfor medical students * Residency Training for psychiatrists *Child Psychiatry Residency and Fellowships * Post-ResidencyFellowship Training in Psychiatric Research * Post-ResidencyFellowships in Public Psychiatry * Internship Training Program inPsychology * Training Programs in Nursing, Social Work,Occupational Therapy, and Recreational Therapy The Institutealso offers research fellowships in schizophrenia, affective disordersand substance abuse, fellowships in consultation-liaison, ingeriatrics and in HIV-related disorders. The co-existence of all thesesub-specialties, as well as the immediate availability of the finestresearch faculty and research technology provides an atmosphere ofextraordinary stimulation for the scores of professionals completingtheir postgraduate studies here each year. The graduates ofPsychiatric Institute's educational programs continue to be theleaders of their fields becoming heads of academic and clinicaldepartments, as well as public service programs, in centers andcommunities across the country. They also assume leadership positionsin psychiatric, psychological and psychoanalytic organizations andbecome editors of the most respected journals. PRACTICE AND RESEARCH IN PSYCHOTHERAPY Founded in 1945 in the Department of Psychiatry ofColumbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, thePsychoanalytic Center for Training and Research is located atPsychiatric Institute. The founders recognized that interpersonaltherapies and medicine would benefit from a close relationship whichemphasized the interaction of the biological sources of humanmotivation with cultural, developmental and environmental forces. Inthat context, the faculty provide courses on the theory and practiceof psychoanalytic psychotherapy and supervision of psychodynamicpsychotherapy.

But its first director, Ira Van Gieson, petitioned the NewYork State Commission in Lunacy to change the mission of theinstitution, redefining its goal as carrying out multidisciplinaryresearch in the field of psychiatry. With the Commission's approval,Van Gieson first changed the name of the Laboratory to the New YorkState Pathological Institute and then proceeded to hire a professionalteam that included a physical anthropologist, a bacteriologist, abiochemist and a comparative neurologist, an innovation in psychiatricstaffing that was declared unique in the American Journal of Insanity. The solidscientific footing on which the Institute stood from the start allowedits second director, Adolph Meyer, to add education as a second focalarea, initiating postgraduate training for psychiatrists. Witheducation a priority throughout his career, Meyer is often said tohave trained almost all of the senior academic psychiatrists workingin the United States during the first half of the 20thcentury. TheInstitute expanded its capacity for clinical research in 1929 when itsnew building, located at the recently established northern Manhattancampus of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, provided space forin-patient beds. Affiliation with the University and the Hospital gavethe Institute a still broader opportunity for interdisciplinarycollaboration which has kept it in the vanguard of psychiatricresearch throughout its long history. To this day, PI is ranked as aleader among the best psychiatric facilities in the world because ofits deep commitment to research, training and clinical care, each ofthe three aspects of its mission fostering excellence in the others.Improved understanding and more successful treatment of mentalillness, as well as strong strides toward achieving the ultimate goalof preventing psychiatric problems are the results of this dynamicpartnership. None of this could have been realized without the ongoingsupport provided by the State of New York.

A P.I. pathologist working with a researcher from RockefellerInstitute discovered the relationship between paresis and thespirochete responsible for syphilis. EPIDEMIOLOGY. The first epidemiologicalstudies of the environmental influences on psychiatric disorders werebegun here. STUDY OFEPILEPSY. The key experimental animal model for the studyof epilepsy originated at P.I. PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES FOR THE DEAF The firstclinical psychiatric unit for the deaf was established at theInstitute. RORSCHACHSCORING The first use of the Rorschach scoring system inthe U.S. took place at P.I. GENETIC STUDIES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. The firstpsychiatric research program in genetics in the U.S. produced datawhich gave evidence of a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR MENTALDISORDERS. 1. The earliest U.S. demonstration of thepositive effects of phenothiazines ( a group of psychotropicdrugs) in arresting the symptoms of schizophrenia took place atthe Institute. 2. Medical research on the use of electroconvulsivetherapy was first undertaken in this country at P.I. 3.Lithium carbonate, the most successful treatment of manic-depression,was introduced in the U.S. at the Institute when the firstlithium clinic in the country opened here. Lithium has saved theU.S. more than $145 billion since 1970. P300 BRAIN WAVE IDENTIFIED. A scientist at theInstitute isolated the wave in the electrical activity of the humanbrain which is related to cognitive mental activity, therebystimulating the search for other components involved in thoughtprocesses such as attending to stimuli and making decisions. ADVANTAGES OF BRIEFHOSPITALIZATION. A pioneer study documented that patientswith chronic mental illnesses could benefit as much from a briefhospital stay, reinforced by day hospital programs and communitysupport services, as from the traditionally longer hospital stay. CHILDHOOD DEPRESSIONCLINIC. The first such clinic in the world wasestablished here, providing services for children and adolescentssuffering from depressive and anxiety disorders. It was followed bythe establishment by the federal government of the first ClinicalResearch Center for the Study of Child and Adolescent SuicidalBehaviors, Affective Disorders and Anxiety States. The concept of"cluster suicides" among adolescents, originated here, hasled to widespread attention to triggers for such behaviors. PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC MANUAL. Researchers at the Institute led the development of theDSM-III, DSM-III-R and were key to its most recent major revision,DSM-IV, the official diagnostic manuals published by the AmericanPsychiatric Association and used universally by the profession. HUNTINGTON'S DISEASEGENE. A P.I. investigator organized the internationalcollaboration of researchers, which led to the identification of thegene for Huntington's disease. WILSON'S DISEASE GENE. A molecular geneticistat P.I. and an international team of researchers identified the generesponsible for Wilson's disease, a disorder which mimics symptoms ofschizophrenia and other neurological disorders. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DEPRESSION. AP.I. researcher, using data from a multi-national study, establishedthat rates of depression are on the rise in ever younger populations,with the risk of depression two to three times higher among women. Thestatistics hold true for almost all countries in the study. RESEARCH CENTERS. Because of its excellence,P.I. was designated a Clinical Mental Health Research Center by theNational Institute of Mental Health in 1978. Since then, seven otherCenters have been established here: * the Cellular Analysis ofBehavior, * Clinical and Behavioral Studies of HIV, * theStudy of Childhood Mental Disorders, * Development of Medicationfor Substance Abuse, * the Study of the Genetic Origins andTreatment of Schizophrenia, * the Study of the Genetic Approachto Neuroplasticity and Learning * the Study of Suicidal Behavior. In addition, Psychiatric Institute is one of the sites inthe U.S.named a Diagnostic Center for Collaborative PsychiatricLinkage Studies in Schizophrenia.

The first step toward pinpointing a disease locus on anarrow region of a chromosome is to identify family groups in whichthe prevalence of a particular disease is high. Histories are thentaken and blood samples are collected. From there, mathematicalanalyses determine the likelihood that sophisticatedphysical mappingtechniques and sequencing work will yield specific information aboutthe disease gene. By these means, Psychiatric Institute scientists aresteadily making contributions to the major U.S. effort called theHuman Genome Project. Scientists in neurobiology andbehavior, located in twelve independent laboratories, are working toprovide analyses of neural development, behavior, learning anddiseases of the nervous system in terms of their underlying cellularand molecular mechanisms. Researchers have made seminal discoveriesabout learning and long and short term memory from the study of themarine snail, Aplysia. They are now examining genetically alteredmice, making it possible to relate the action of known genes to thephysiology of specific cells in regions of the brain. Brainimaging has become an essential tool in psychiatric research. Much hasbeen learned about how and where neurotransmitters, the chemicalmessengers in the brain, convey information. Variations of intensityof activity, interruption of transmission, depletion of specificchemicals or changes in brain structure may be clues to disorderedstates. Brain imaging is now being used in many studies at theInstitute, such as those relating to suicide and aggression, aging andmemory, and schizophria. OTHER RESEARCH Epidemiological studies reveal much about theprevalence of disease in certain populations. Surveys are beingconducted by Psychiatric Institute epidemiologists to determine theprevalence of major depression, panic disorder and the social andpsychological factors involved in adversity and stress, for example.What is the incidence of mental illness in the homeless in New YorkCity? What is the nature and extent of mental health problems in lowincome populations? Which children will have need of special educationservices? What brain disorders present at birth or arising early inchildhood will have effects on mood, behavior or cognition later on?These are just a few of the questions being asked at PsychiatricInstitute. Scientists need standardized tools to conduct theinterviews which will achieve a diagnostic consensus ofpsychopathology. Many of the most effective diagnostic interviewschedules used in countries all over the world have been developed atPsychiatric Institute. These include the SADS (Schedule for AffectiveDisorders and Schizophrenia), the SCID (Structured Clinical Interviewfor DSM-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV), the DISC (Diagnostic InterviewSchedule for Children) and the GAS (Global Assessment Scale).Psychiatric Institute researchers, known for their work on theofficial diagnostic manuals of the American Psychiatric Association,also developed the popular PRIME-MD (Primary Care Evaluation of MentalDisorders) which enables the busy general practitioner to make rapidand accurate diagnoses of depression, panic, bulimia and other commonmental disorders. The newest of these instruments, PRISM (PsychiatricResearch Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders), was quicklyand widely adopted as a practical and efficient tool in assessingpsychiatric disorders in people who use alcohol and otherdrugs.

SERVING THE COMMUNITY Boththe local community and the larger community receive the benefit ofPsychiatric Institute's innovative and skillful services. Not onlydoes the Institute provide the most up-to-date psychiatric inpatientand outpatient treatment to people who participate in a variety ofresearch projects, but it offers State-supported general psychiatriccare to the residents of northern Manhattan. The Washington HeightsCommunity Service is a major source of psychiatric evaluation andtreatment available to people living in northern Manhattan. TheService consists of a 22-bed intensive care inpatient unit atPsychiatric Institute and two outpatient clinics, the Audubon AvenueClinic and the Inwood Mental Health Center where outpatient therapy,continuation day treatment and vocational rehabilitation are among thetreatment modalities provided. The staff is largely bilingual inrecognition of the large Hispanic population which lives in WashingtonHeights and Inwood. The information needed to shape policyregarding long-term care for aged local residents in community-basedand residential facilities is being gathered by P.I. researchers.Scientists from the Memory Disorders Clinic and from the NorthManhattan Aging Project are establishing a registry identifying allcases of dementia in the Washington Heights area. The HIVCenter for Clinical and Behavioral Studies, engaged in educatingvarious high risk populations on how to prevent HIV infection, hasproduced four prize-winning videotapes which emphasize the need to beactive on one's own behalf in promoting safe behaviors. Useful tocommunity groups and agencies, these tapes have been widelydistributed locally and across the nation. Clinicians fromChild Psychiatry provide on-site mental health services to thosechildren who need clinical support while attending classes in some ofthe elementary and intermediate schools in Washington Heights, WestHarlem and Inwood. A small public school is also located on the actualpremises of the Institute; every attempt is made to provide childrensuffering from psychiatric problems who are enrolled in researchstudies at the Institute with the same education they would receive inregular public schools. Summer employment in the form ofresearch apprenticeship programs at the Institute is available toseveral local high school students. Teachers, too, may update theirskills in modern research techniques. And, since 1972, theState-supported Youth Opportunity Program has provided low-income highschool students with after school jobs in the Institute laboratories,offices and library. This program has consistently encouraged thesestudents to go on to college and many have pursued careers in science. CLINICAL RESEARCHUNITS Several specialpurpose clinics, combining research and treatment, serve people fromthe neighborhood and the greater metropolitan area. Among them arethe: * Anxiety Disorders Clinic * Child & AdolescentDepression Clinic * Children's Day Program * DepressionEvaluation Service * Eating Disorders Clinic * GeneralClinical Research Unit * Hispanic Anxiety & DepressionClinic * HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies *Huntington's Disease Clinic * Late Life Depression Clinic *Memory Disorders Clinic * Sexual Behavior Clinic *Schizophrenia Research Unit * Smoking Cessation Clinic *Substance Abuse Clinic CLINICALRESEARCH The Schizophrenia Research Centerhas a dual purpose: to clarify the origins of schizophrenia and todevelop and test the most promising treatments for that disorder.Research ranges from epidemiological studies of prenatal risk factors,clarification of the relative roles genes and environment play in theillness, and assessments of patients' awareness of illness to multiplefamily group therapy. Differentiation and treatment ofvarious types of depression, matching the optimum anti-depressantmedication with a specific form of depressive disorder, hasestablished Psychiatric Institute's Depression Evaluation Service asarguably the best such unit in New York City. The concept of dualdiagnosis is also receiving close scrutiny because many people whoabuse alcohol or cocaine may have an underlying depression and may beusing the alcohol or drugs as a form of self-medication. Treating thedepression often resolves the addiction. The Late LifeDepression Clinic takes into consideration the other illnesses andconditions which can complicate the treatment of depression in elderlypeople. Depression following stroke or heart attacks may be a riskfactor possibly decreasing longevity; treating it appropriately may belife-saving. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), widely recognized as aneffective treatment for depression, has been an option. Nowresearchers are testing rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) as a possible replacement for ECT because of its focalprecision. The National Institute of Aging supports studies ofAlzheimer's Disease and other dementias within the Memory DisordersClinic where researchers are also looking at the cognitive changesthat occur as a result of normal aging. The Anxiety DisordersClinic works to advance the understanding of DSM-IV anxiety disorderswith particular emphasis on panic disorder and agoraphobia, socialphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stressdisorder. The Clinic is also the site of the only NIMH funded study ofhypochondria, believed to be a legitimate and treatable anxietydisorder. Treatment is available for both Spanish and English speakingpatients. The HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studiesis dedicated to interdisciplinary studies of the prevention oftransmission of HIV, working with populations at risk: children,adolescents, gay men and heterosexual women and men. Risk behavior andinterventions for behavior change are approached from many differentperspectives - with both genders; at different developmental points;with individuals and with couples, at the level of the parent/childdyad and the social network; with infected people and people at risk;among ethnically diverse populations; among special populations suchas the mentally ill homeless; and for different sexual orientations. In collaboration with Presbyterian Hospital, Mental HealthServices for the Homeless are provided to the mentally ill men housedin the Fort Washington Shelter. Scientists from Psychiatric Institutehave tested and validated new methods of treating the homelessmentally ill, helping them to live independently. These interventionsappear to reduce the amount of time an individual remains homeless.Likewise, psychiatric and case management services to mentally illwomen in other New York City shelters are provided. Withinthe Center for the Study of Childhood Mental Disorders, children areevaluated and treated for anxiety and depression. Innovativetherapeutic interventions for adolescent suicide attempters have beendeveloped and tested here. A small school on the premises ofPsychiatric Institute permits children to continue to receive the sameeducation they would get in neighborhood public schools as they arebeing observed and treated for psychiatric disorders. Researchers arealso engaged in epidemiological studies to determine the antecedentsof juvenile delinquency, illicit drug use, high risk sexual behavior,etc. Page created by Gerry Segal:segalge@nypsych.cpmc.columbia.edu WT02-B10-280IA093-000995-B030-464http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/RFMHGRNT/RF_SPON.HTM 156.111.80.30 19970121073547 text/html 47052HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:39:53 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 46921 NYSPI Sponsored Research NYSPI Sponsored Research Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

Kazmerski, Yael M. Cycowicz,and David Friedman Cognitive Electrophysiology Laboratory New York State Psychiatric Institute Psychophysiology, in press Brief non-tonal sounds are used in electrophysiology inthe novelty oddball paradigm. These sounds vary in thebrain activity they elicit and in the degree to which they canbe identified, named, and remembered. Because ease of soundidentification may influence sound processing, naming andconceptual norms were determined for 100 sounds for 77 youngadults. Naming ability decreases in normal and pathologicalaging. Therefore, norms were also derived for older adults andfor probable Alzheimer's disease patients. With respect to theyoung, perseverative naming behavior increased in these groups,and sound and picture naming performance were correlated.Finally, The sound naming performance of children aged 5-6,9-11 and 14-16 years was compared. Name and conceptualagreements improved with age, whereas perseverative behaviordecreased. These normative data should be useful in guiding soundselection in future studies and help clarify the relationshipsbetween sound naming and other variables, including direct andindirect memory performance. This paper contains the following 6 files: 1) README.TXT (this file) 2-4) SND.ZIP, WAV.ZIP, and WAV(SCL).ZIP which are, respectively, the sound files in Neuroscan format (*.snd), the sounds in wave format, and the scaled (i.e.volume adjusted) sounds in wave format. Note that the norms were derived on the basis of the *.snd sound files. The wave files are not identical due to translation factors. 5) SCALING.TXT contains the scaling factors to use with Neuroscan to obtain a volume of 92 dB. Note that the wave and scaled wave sounds need to be calibrated for volume, because their actual intensity was not tested in our study. 6) SOUNDDB.ZIP contains the sound norm database in Paradox (db) format.WT02-B10-282IA093-000995-B030-446http://www.nyspi.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/NYSPI/RFMHGRNT/FORM_HOM.htm 156.111.80.30 19970121073536 text/html 1324HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: GLACI/2.01Date: Tue Jan 21 02:39:39 1997Content-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 1194 RFMH Forms SPONSORED RESEARCH RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR MENTAL HYGIENE,INC.

Membership Services Membership can access through NNTP or Direct Read News Membership can access restricted access news groups The Few Simple Rules - For Everyone No SPAM or Cross Posting to more than 15 newsgroups. If you are not sure what's appropriate, read the FAQs in news.announce.newusers. Access to restricted news groups is by specific request only, and only for adults. If you have selected the optional news groups, do not give your password to minors. Don't do anything illegal. Pyramid schemes, and posting pictures of minors in sexual context are examples of illegal posts. At the very least, it will get you removed from the service. Zippo is not to be used as a feed for other services, and is not for resale or redistribution. Exceeding access to 500 news groups each day, or connecting for more than 6 hours during a 24 hour period, will cause the system to lock you out for 24 hours. Repeat violations will terminate a membership. Rules for Us We will do our very best to keep the servers running at all times and keep equipment in good repair While the servers will get slower as more members are added and traffic builds, we will limit membership to a reasonable level We will maintain news groups at approximately the same count and range of topics. We will routinely update hierarchies and replace obsolete groups with current groups in similar categories. We will not edit, censor or cancel posts on content, and we will not take sides in disputes over appropriate posts. We will continue to add features to the service, and upgrade program modules to enhance the performance of the service. If you wish to become a member of the Zippo News Service please continue for membership and immediate access. � 1995,1996 Zippo Dot Com Incorporated All rights reservedWT02-B10-288IA038-000734-B027-157http://zippo.com:80/drnhelp.htm 205.185.79.4 19970210062519 text/html 9981HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 06:27:21 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sat, 07 Dec 1996 02:14:59 GMTContent-length: 9807 The Daily News Service Zippo News Service's Direct Read News � Overview Zippo Direct Read News (tm) is a method of sorting, selecting, decoding, and reading Usenet News on a realtime basis, without using a news reader. Direct Read News is not a database of news articles. Our servers receive news on a continual basis, 24 hours each day. Direct Read News provides immeddiate access to all articles. The following help items explain how to navigate through the news systems and get the most information, with the fewest steps. Where appropriate, we also explained some of the common elements of Usenet News. The Super Zippo Home Page, and Related Web Pages There are actually four types of service available through the Zippo Home Page: Direct Read News, which provides access to Usent News Groups. Whenever you click on a News Group Link, Direct Read News takes you to that section of Usenet News and displays; group lists, articles headers and content. Direct Read News handles all decode, multipart file assembly and disply chores for the user. Web Ftp, which moves software and image files from the Zippo Systems to the user's system. Clicking on a link in this section, connects the user to the correct file, and prompts the user with further instructions, prior to downloading the files to the user's system. Direct Ftp connection which requires an Ftp client, and can be used to download large software program and utility files. Direct NNTP News for users that prefer direct newsreader connection to the Zippo Systems. The nntp host name is snews.zippo.com All of these services can be reached by clicking on the applicable Icon. The Zippo Direct Read News Server manages connections to these various protocols for you. Newsgroup Selections The newsgroup selections cover all newsgroups carried on the Zippo News Server. The group list may be selected in total, or by newsgroup category, from the hyperlinks on the web pages. Listing will appear in several formats. Bionet There are numerous links of this type on the home page. Clicking on one will take you to the applicable news category. 29 alt.books.* This level is displayed after a category selectionhad been made. Whenever a listing is followed by an asterisk, it means there are other related groups within the same major heading. In the case of this example, there are 29 individual newsgroups that fit into the alt.books.* category. Clicking on the hypertext entry will display the newsgroups within the category. 45 alt.bored is a single newsgroup heading, there is no following asterisk, and there are 45 individual articles within the group. Clicking on the hypertext entry will display the individual articles within the newsgroup. Within A Specific News Group: alt.binaries.pictures.animals Clicking on the newsgroup icon will return you to the next highest level of the group hierarchy. In the case of this newsgroup, the icon would take you back to alt.binaries.pictures.* and all specific newsgroups under this listing. Page Controls Sort list by earliest article number Sort list by the newest article number Sort article list by subject Sort article list by author Sort article list by earliest date Sort article list by newest date Display threaded article list, newest date first Display headers for binary files only, newest date first Post an article, new or in response Post a binary file, new Post an article, new or in response - with x-archive instruction, requesting Internet Archive services to not store article Post a binary file, new - with x- archive instruction, requesting Internet Archive services to not store article Jump to the previous list screen within the newsgroup, or previous article Jump to the next list screen within the newsgroup, or next article 00018 02/08 GINA 2 hi friendsThe leading icon defines the file type Text GIF, BMP, TIF Binary Exec, Zip, UUE. AVI. MPG, MOV Icons are interactive, with the exception of "Text". Clicking on image Icons will decode the applicable article and display the image. Clicking on a Bin Icon will decode the file and download it to your system. 00018 This is the article number which is established when the article arrives at the server. 02/08 This is the date the article was originally posted to Usenet News. At times, either due to the number of systems the article passed through as it was propagated throughout the Internet, or if was just delayed in reaching an outbound feed to the Internet, this date may be earlier than the current date. GINA This is the name of the posting author 2 This is the number of lines of data posted within the article, other than header information. hi friends This is the article subject as defined by the author 00018 02/08 GINA Combined in hypertext format, clicking on this information will allow you to view the actual text of the article and display additional information about the article. As an example, you can initiate an e-mail response to the author of the article, reference cross postings, and display the full news header. Building Custom Group Lists and Lookups with Direct Read News You can "subscribe" to News Groups by bookmarking individual newsgroup pages, or by linking multiple groups or hierarchies to make custom lists as bookmarks. If you click on the Zippo news group list on the home page, you will get a list of the major zippo newsgroups and this URL will appear in your browser window - http://sdrn.zippo.com/news-bin/wwwnews?zippo.* The first part of the string, "http://sdrn.zippo.com/news-bin/wwwnews?", is a list query statement to the specific site you are using, and the "zippo.*" indicates the news hierarchy list to be retrieved. If you substitute "comp.*" for "zippo.*", Direct Read News will generate a list of all groups within the comp hierarchy. After this list is displayed, the page could be bookmarked for future list. Using a variety of symbols, lists can be generated based on many sorts and selections, and each list may be bookmarked. The active symbols as of this writing are: * is a wild card search character. *.sports.* would find news groups that have sports in the group name, but do not start with the word sports. sports.* would find all groups that start with the word sports, and *.sports would find all groups that end with the word sports. | is used to join multiple searches.

Lately, I�m just finding it difficult to generate much enthusiasm over the news. The press seems to be covering the same subjects in boiler plate fashion, Court TV is turning into �Hard Copy� with it�s new Lawyer Vs Lawyer format (is too, is not, is too, is not.....you�re a baby, no - you�re a baby....), and �Men Behaving Badly� is giving me factual content, but no current events. I even tried to jump start a thought process by reading �National Review� and �National Geographic� on alternate days for the past week. Flat line, get the paddles. The local Mercury News led off yesterday with 4� high headlines, �O.J. Must Pay�. I don�t care, I mean I reallllllly don�t care. This story remains what it always has been, a story of interest for polite racists on both sides of the coin. Outside of the principles, what is the other significance? Perhaps the multi-million dollar peripheral industry that spawned as a result of a routine homicide. I didn�t know who Nicole Brown or Ron Goldman were before the murder, and I am sure I have learned nothing of factual content since. I always just thought of O.J. Simpson as a one time good running back, with a career buried under a really bad Buffalo Bill�s team. Not sure how rental car commercials and sports commentaries elevated him to the pre-murder status of a national hero or celebrity. Don�t care. The President gave his State of the Union Address - �Internet access and free money for everyone. Balance the budget, but no binding constitutional amendment. Huge tax breaks, as long as you live in poverty. Internet 2 is needed so sick children can get their homework. Minor problem of more corporations ordered to give away their products so Bill can meet his campaign promises.�. Fortunately the address was preempted by almost everything, including the WB�s sitcoms. Steve Wozniak has rejoined Apple in the role of a non-participating hood ornament, on the heels of (or in the slipstream of) Steve Jobs. Didn�t Wozniak leave Apple not long after the company�s initial climb to fame? Wasn�t Wozniak squeezed into a box, left with nothing to do by Steve Jobs, until Wozniak lost interest and left the company? Wasn�t Jobs squeezed out by Scully when Apple crossed the billion dollar threshold and the company outgrew its founders? Maybe this whole revival effort is more a function of Gil Amelio�s early basic training at Fairchild Semiconductor, where building buffer management committees was standard CYA practice. I think that Apple is suffering from �Howdy Doody� syndrome. A few years after Buffalo Bob was removed from the airwaves, there was a huge public outcry from baby boomers who were still mourning the loss of their childhood keepsake. One by one, the players were recalled to network duty, or Howdy Duty; Buffalo Bob, Howdy and Clarabelle. After two shows, and a lack of viewer momentum, the show�s producers went on to call back: Princes Summer Fall Winter Spring, Mr. Bluster, and Flubadub. Two or three more shows and the network canceled. The ingredients in the original show that could not be recalled were: the innocence of the �50s, the lack of alternative viewing, and an audience with enough imagination to block out Howdy�s strings without the aid of special effects. Outside of the investors and employees of Apple, I believe the question of revival is �why?�. People don't drive around in new Packards, or carry portable Osborn Computers onto airplanes, or have much of a need for another type of hardware platform. Peter Drucker, a long, long time ago, said that strategic decisions a company made today, may not show the results of those decisions for 20 years. Apple is showing the results of several strategic decisions in a more compressed time frame. The first was when they put the lid on the original Apple and introduced the closed platform Apple III and Lisa systems, while IBM went out with the easy open IBM PC. The next point was IBM�s willingness to support clone manufacturers, while Apple sued anybody that came close to making a piece of hardware that could run Apple software. Remember the Ace ? Maybe it was just a moment of indecisiveness, when Apple couldn�t choose between evolving as a hardware company or a software company, and concluded by trying to be both. The result was they couldn�t establish market mass in hardware, or provide continual support and opportunity that software developers need to make the Apple system more useful and progressive. Then it seems like it got worse. Scully, a guy with a background in distribution and channel management, who was doing a commendable job in those respective areas, decided he would take a shot at ego product marketing, which resulted in the Scootin� Newton. Apple planned �Newtons for everyone�. Unfortunately, while the troops were off trying to figure out how to perfect character recognition for their little phone number keeper, they forgot to develop the MAC. Not sure how the organization didn�t hear/see the MS based system steamroller running rampant through the market place. Today the market is left with some Apple system related questions that, after a year of reorganization, are still not being addressed, and none have anything to do with price. Is an Apple faster? Is it cheaper? What can it do that an MS based system can�t do? Nostalgia will only carry a company so far, and I believe Apple is about to join Howdy Doody.

"O.J., the President, Howdy Doody and Apple Computer" HI, Well .. im not writing to flame ya or anything ... but i believethe Mac O.S. is the easiest to use espescially for someone who isnt to familiar withcomputers ... i think it just takes better management to compete with the other guy .... and i really hope its not to late to make a success out of the Mac ... i love my Mac and it seems like even I am tired of waiting for programs to be developed for it ... i really hope Apple comes through with a new O.S. that will do all the tasks that todayscomputer geeks need and at the same time still remain the friendly MacO.S. at the same time ... well .. if thats even possible :-( Ed Note:Be nice to have a balanced market so there actually is a choice and the competition would make for faster product development. Take a lesson in writing... at least seperate your contridictions bymore than a few word. Anyway: have you actually looked into this at all? Yes, Apple's arefaster. Just check out anyone who has done independant benchmarks (e.g.Byte). Even at the same clockspeed a PowerPC chip outstrips a Pentium,and the PowerPC will be available by fall at 500 MHz. That, my friend,is fast. Look into the PowerBook 3400, which will be available soon at 200 MHz.Yes, a 200 MHz portable. For that matter, look at the 4400 (low cost), 9600 (incredible speed),8600 (amazing industrial design and feature set)... clearly sexyhardware is not a problem for Apple. That leaves software. I urge you to take a few moments to catch up onthe latest Apple OS, code-named Rhapsody, that will benefit from Mac OSand OpenStep technology. A dream to develop on, simple and reliable touse... this OS should inherit the benefits that OpenStep/Mach currentlyenjoys (i.e. reboot once every 3 years or so) I don't have the time or the inclination to give you a full Macevangelist rant. (besides, I'm just as qualified in supporting anddeveloping on Windows95 and WinNT, so I don't do the bigot rant well).However, I do want you to at least show that you've thought about andresearched on topics you write about. Ed Note:I'll get myself and the other 94.4% of the PC market on on it right away. "The Winner....and still heavy weight champion" Maybe there is some justice left in this world. Good luck to yourfather. Right on joe! It is people like your dad, that stand up for principle thatmakes combating injustices worth it. If there were more like him,then goverment would be smaller, the companies would not beas arogant, there would be less law suits, because there wouldbe more people who get involved. It is interesting that as a parent, you try to instill in your offspringthe importance of being truthful. This never changes. .Even when you areold, there is no defense against the truth. Congrats to your Dad for doingthe right thing. You must be very proud of him! You can still fight thebig guys. Good for your Dad, Joe! It's about time people start standing up for theirrights. I know from firsthand experience--I've been in litigation forseven years in Florida with lawyers who were supposedly defending me, whohave then turned around to become my adversary--that the civil justicesystem has become a forum to screw good people. I have had to resort tofiling a malpractice action against one of the lawyers--the first of manyto come--"pro se" (i.e., myself without any assistance from attorneys). Ican't wait to get him before a jury. Of course, in my case, the judge wasas crooked as hell, and kept protecting those who had stolen the money. Herefused to force the personal representative of the estate or any of theattorneys to provide an accounting of the money, as required by law, andsaid to appeal it if I didn't like his decision. But then, the attorneyconveniently allowed the appeal time to lapse...smells like conspiracy tome. Anyway, good luck to your Dad...I hope he wins. He sounds like he isin the right frame of mind. Joe-- Usually I start off a note by saying something on the order of 'I agree,but, ...' Not today. I applaud your father's stance and wish him the best luck in the world. Every entity, public or private, needs to be held accountable for it'sactions. I hope that he, via your editorial, gets many letters of support. "Extra ! CA Fed Judge eats too many veggies......and becomes one" I CONCUR. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK JOE. SOMEONE HAS GOT TO KEEP THE PUBLICINFORMED. Isn't it amazing the the great guardians of "constitutional rights" arethe first to fall off the wagon when "constitutional rights" don't agreewith liberal ideology. Where is the media outrage at this infringement of our rights? I haveseen few reports critical of it. in the little city of vallejo where the city officials held closed doormeetings over the future of the white elephant marine world, once againit's voters learn there is no santa claus, and your vote is no good. why?because there have been no way shape or form for the citizens of this cityto vote or have a real say about what goes on in their city. In this land of ours, we are brain washed we have a vote. After the elections, both local and state wide, it appears that our law industry steps in and decide what we, the voters, should be allowed to have, not what we votedto go into effect. In this city, the royal family of "elected" officialshave seen to it that a new broom cannot sweep clean. how you ask? Bysetting the terms of office for it's city concil so there is never acomplete change of members. The majority of concil members are still inpower after election. This is to control and "guide" new commers into theworld of city goverment. This really means "we are going to control you". Now for the real world. Going down to city hall 7 times (different days andtimes), I never found the mayor. there are no offices for city concilmembers. The meeting room for city affairs could never have enough citizensin it to possibly represent the "voice" of the citizens. Going further, saythere is a need for a citizen to reguest a waver or protest an action bythe city. There is a beutification committee for this to file the greevencewith, however, the committee tells you up front that they are an advisorycommittee only and has no authority. Ain't it great? they protect theirbutts from angles. No one to talk to and a committe which meets arequiremeent of a means to "fight" city hall, but a system built in to makesure no one is required to pay any attention to you. Question? is your city setup the same way? to make our vote really count, we need on the ballot in the area for people running for office a box marked "none of the above" . Unbelievable isn't it?I'm 52 years old having a career bad dream!Regards, and again, keep it up Joe Zip, Ed. With the Clinton admistration overiding the clear intent of thevoters, with a federal judge making his own rules, what point isthere in an election? The current system of voting is to insure thatlaws are made peacefully. Now that members of congress, and thepresident have decided to overide the voters, this leaves thesupreme court to make the finale decision. If the courts donot uphold the 10th admendment, then the line has been drawn,the time has come for the people to demand the end of thefederal goverment. Joe Zip, Ed. RIGHT ON man!!...I've had it after 35 years in fruit land and I'mhappily cruising the seven seas. Seems that Serbia and California have the sameproblem. Those in power have ignored the will of the people. Keep up the good work "Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.....rotten kids knocking at your door" whoever you are. I'm writing from Germany and I cantell you - it's bloody cold in this damned country.I would like to saddle down in the states. How isthe situation on the job market? Hope to get my green cardnext year. Maybe I'll hear from you. Bye for now Snow on the holidays isn't all it's cut out to be. Most of us on theEast coast are thanking God that what's been coming down from the sky israin and not snow. You see the last time it snowed for Christmas itdidn't stop until Easter. In fact we skipped Spring all together. Thememories of the 23 storms from last year will keep us for a fewholidays. Where are those rotten kids that knocked at the doors? So manypeople were looking for them last year but they couldn't be found. Thereare just easier ways for kids to make money these days it seems. It's ashame becuase many of the old folks were snowed in for days. Like theweather things change. Ed Note:I heard a rumor, that the kids from the eastcoast took their snow shoveling money west, and used it for first round funding for tech startups. Er..sort of a snowballing effect, if you get my drift,...somebody stop me...I'm becoming a flake. Dear Editor: It looks like you would be happier in central Michigan than you are in California! Since you are self-employed and your work can be done from anywhere in the world that has access to the internet, why not move to Michigan before next Christmas? Of course, living in the deep freeze and driving over snow and ice for up to several months a year are not very pleasant, but it certainly looks a lot more like Christmas here. Or does it maybe really look a lot more like the original Christmas in California? After all, Jesus was born in a warm Mediterranean climate, and not in the Siberian landscape of the upper midwest. Anyway, have a merry Christmas and a happy new year! "Psst. Hey kid. Wanna see pictures of a tree ?" Dear Joe of the Jungle,The real issue here is not the forest but the trees. You see the fee solution came about because otherwise the Republicrats of the 103rd Congress were going to set up a Closure Committee much like the military to decide how to sell off parks to the highest bidder. No Joke, Joe. Your little vacation trips could have been to the Polan WeedEater National Woodlands or the Tropicana Treehugger Park and Recreation Area. I wonder what their fees would be? The original auto fee for Yellowstone was $10 in 1916. Now you pay an additional per person fee. But not your $1000 dollar quote. If inflation were figured in by 1996 dollars you should be paying $83. You won't be. So whatever the fee increase, it's worth it. Only 57 of 368 parks were off the closure consideration list originally proposed by the Republicrats. Maybe some could be closed but really do we want to let the carpetbaggers into the temple? Clinton agreed to the fee plan by insisting that the "Shut Down Your Government Congress" remove the closure plan and provide that all fees go to the parks. There is no free ride the not from me you don't nineties. Go to the park, help pay so you can go again. The trees otherwise will have to make the supreme sacrifice for your freedom to stay home. Thom of the Flatlands Who still takes his son on a trip to see America each summer. To the Editor: While I'm saddened that the cost of vacationing has skyrocketedand entry fees at national parks have quadrupled, the trend of Americangovernment has been to (regardless of admininstration or which party controlsCongress) reduce the burden of spending. What's a few extra bucks to help saveSmokey the Bear from exctinction? Who's got time for a vacation anyway? Wanna see a tree? Try alt.binaries.pictures.trees. Reduce speed ... toll booth 1000 feet ... Welcome to the informationhighway. "They've been getting a free ride long enough!" Hey Joe, ( sounds like a song, bet you never heard that before :>) ) Just read your editorial, great stuff. I also got to travel some withmy Dad/Family. Dosen't seem quite as much as you did. I didn't get to seemost of the lower 48 till I joined the navy, but I hear where your comingfrom. I probably have it a little bit easier than some, have a goodjob (middle management stress, stress, stress, good mate (yea), and 40acres in Kentucky (*BIG YEAAAAhhhhh*) where I'll eventually end up. Thanksfor the message - Hope more people hear it. In your comment to my previous message you said you didn't know the costs of trees and animals had gone up. Very cute. It's the cost of maintaining the roads and the potties and the campgrounds and stuff like that that has gone up!!!! And also the costs for fighting forest fires and clearing up trails after rock slides. (Don't forget that Yosemite has had a few of those lately!) I think the fee increase is great if Congress can keep their money grubbing hands off of the money and not rob it for the general fund and let the individual parks keep the bulk of it. It's still quite a bargain! Just think how much you'll have to pay if the Libertarians ever win a presidential election and sell all the parks off to developers. Joe Read the editorial about the trees and parks and then read some of theresponses you got about it. Good Lord - Gag me with a "misplaced"billing record! Looks like the blinding flashes from the picture takingand all of the back-slapping of election day eve have left a goodpercentage of the population impared. The flashes have them blinded andthe back slapping has apparently caused some type of additional braintrama. They ought to see a doctor and have the doc send the bill totheir other buddy Bill. The only bridge to the future the Clintons andtheir administration are building is one with toll booths at both ends. I like it! Did you forward a copy to The President and Her Husband? Dear Joe I was one of those fortunate individuals able to take my family on campimg trips although we never got out of the eastern states till the kids grew up (our old jalopies wouldn't make it) But my four kids still remember those trips and they still go camping also. It was a wonderful way to take a cheap vacation then. It's still cheaper than motels and better for one's health. There was some good in the good old days Yrs I think you goofed!!! Yes, the fees to enter parks are going up, but the rates are per car, not per person. The old rate for Yosemite was $5 per car for a whole week, which is the same rate charged when the park opened. (Though I guess back then it was per horse drawn buggy or wagon!) The new rate is $20 PER CAR per week, still not per person!!!!!There is a per person rate if you come in by bus, but I think it's only about $10 or so. (Yes, people do take the bus to Yosemite, besides package tours you can take the train to Merced and get a Yosemite Transportation System bus to the park.) BTW, if you took that $5 charge from when the park opened and adjusted it for inflation it would be well over $100 nowadays!! (Per the article in the SJ Murky News.) Ed Note:Didn't realize we were being so badly overcharged those days and I didn't realize that the direct labor and material costs for trees and animals had increased so dramatically.:) I am writing in response to your editorial about the raise in fees fornational parks. I agree that it is unfortunate to make entry fees moreexpensive, but in my opinion it is even worse to allow maintenance andstaffing of the parks to continue to deteriorate. There are stories ofpark rangers living in shipping crates because there is no money to buildthem proper housing. Trails are going unmaintained, trash is uncollected,public facilities such as campgrounds and bathrooms are falling apart. Thegovernment keeps on creating new national parks and monuments withoutadding one cent to the park budget to pay for them! The money *must* comefrom somewhere. Citizens won't accept tax increases, so the only othersource is entry fees. Oh yeah, I can hear what comes next, "what about thezillions of dollars in park concession profits??" Believe me, it isn't"zillions of dollars", and there isn't enough there to run a national parkall by itself, unless visitors are willing to buy $20 hamburgers. Bottom line is, I'm tired of hearing whining about entry fee increases forpublic lands and institutions. There's no point in keeping them at all ifthey don't have the funding to be properly cared for! Might as well sellthe land to the condo builders after all.Subject: "Wanna see a tree" - still affordable I don't know what you're talking about in this editorial! The currententrance fee to the Grand Canyon is $10, which covers everybody in thecar, and is good for a week; the proposed fee increase would raise thatto $20, an increase of only $10. For that matter, buy yourself a GoldenEagle Pass for $25, which gets you unlimited access to all National ParkService fee areas free for a year (they may raise the price of that aswell, but the highest it would go would be $35 for the coming year). Next time, try to get the facts first before fulminating. Ed Note: The info was pulled from a chart appearing in the San Jose Mercury News that broke down per person and per car potential charges. If there was a error in this, I apologize. Personally, I think $35 per truck load is too much for people to pay. The Golden Eagle Pass in the formal press release is listed as "not changed at the moment, but will.." and there are no official projections as to what the increase would be. I think it is a worthwhile bid for the Federal government to now try to manage nature in the form of more bathrooms and visitor centers - clearly enhancing the beauty of nature and cleaning up the environment for Sierra Club members in designer hiking boots. Why is it that the government sees rates at parks excessive for people over 62, and maintains a Golden Age Pass that is less than half the cost to everyone else, yet if you are among the 22% of the people that live in or close to poverty, you get hosed ? The clear message was that there are more future increases on the way. Maybe they will help to pay for making more natural rivers into purified public drinking fountains, and getting rid of all those pesky fish ? Joe--I have noticed that you and I tend to agree on the big picture whiledisagreeing on how to get to the designated milestone and who is goingto drive the tour bus. In the case of the raised fees at the National Parks, I, along with youdeplore the cost impact on the financially challenged. (We used to,when I was there, refer to them as the poor.) I believe that everyoneshould have access to the parks, as I believe that everyone should havethe right to good schools, good medical care, good food, and goodhousing. Unfortunately, as we have seen over the past decades, we don't haveenough money, or an adequate system, to ensure that everyone has goodhousing, food, or medical care. Joe, as I have watched the park budgedget slashed over the past several years, it has also become evident thatwe don't have the money to support the current system. One of thereasons for this is that we have what is probably the lowest tax rate inthe developed nations. When you went to the parks as a kid the total traffic in a year probablydidn't equal the traffic in a month today. Add to that recent cuts inthe number of park personnel, cuts in maintenance dollars, andincreased costs in obtaining both workers and repair parts. What you find out is that we are damned lucky to have parks availablefor anyone, regardless of entrance price! It boils down to one inescapable fact...government services cost money.If you want the government to provide anything, be it national parks, anational highway system, air traffic control, welfare...it is going tocost the taxpayer money. If, at the same time that you are wantingservices you are wanting lower taxes...then you wind up with lyingpoliticians, demoralized government workers, and unhappy voters. Back in his prime Robert Heinlein coined the acronym 'TANSTAAFL.' Itapplied then and it applies now. There Ain't No Such Thing As A FreeLunch!. Just as a mental exercise, next time you're out and around, look at theinfrastructure that the government at all levels has provided for youruse over the past 20-30 years. You'll see buildings, roads, airports,and all of the nice to have things that go with them, such as books inthe libraries, traffic signals and signs, heat, and indoor plumbing. All of that infrastructure takes maintenance, all of that maintenancerequires workers, and all of those buildings that were provided need tobe staffed so that you can use the facilities. Joe, look carefully and I think you'll find that the infrastructure isdeteriorating. There are no longer the libriarians that there used tobe, the books are not being replaced, the roads are cracking and ittakes longer and longer for the maintenance crew...what there is ofit...to show up. Air traffic control is having major problems becausethe computer systems and the radar isn't up to handling todays trafficload. The driver's license bureau has cut back on hours...and driver'straining is no longer an option in many high schools because of the highcost of insurance and the higher cost of getting a good instructor. We, as a nation, have a choice. We can pay the taxes, support theinfrastructure at the level where it needs to be to provide therequisite amount of services, and we can provide all services to allpeople or we can keep the tax rates low, charge user fees to supportthose services that are nice to have and direct fund only those servicesthat are vital to the nation...and let the poorest third continue tobecome even more disadvantaged. Mind you, Joe... This has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats. This has nothingto do with politics at all. This is simple economics. You can't giveanything away unless someone is willing to pay for the acquisition cost. California Votes Dope - Gets two. The 1996 Post Election "Duh" Awards Enjoyed your editorial very much. Being an optimist most of the time, Ifeel that Slick Willy is reshaping the Executive Branch starting with hiscabinet, to a more moderate than "bleeding heart" liberal makeup. We will survivefor four more years. The Republican congress will prevent anything drastic andhopefully Clinton will actually work in a bipartisan effort to balance the budget,save Medicaide, Medicare, Social Security and maybe even do somethingintelligent with the Health Care fiasco. Heaven forbid Gore or any other Democrat makes it the next time.My wife and have cancelling each others vote for 26 years. I agree with most of your editorial Joe, save for your comments on Perot and those who voted for him. Taking a step back, I can see the Perot voters as folks who are sick of the politics of the late 20th century. I'm not saying, mind you, that Perot had a chance in hell... even if someone carpet bombed Dole's rocking chair and Clinton's hot tub. Most of them probably knew this. Perot's presence made a near-zero impact on this year's election, despite the tag-team crack. Four years ago, he had a kind of percentage, stolen from the right places, to have rocked the outcome, possibly. But his numbers this year were unimpressive. My take on the majority of the Perot voters that I know personally is as follows: Your average Perot voter falls into a general catigory. They are either a True-Believer (like that homeless guy on the bus that was yeling the merits of Ross and handing out strange literature...) or a Civic Minded Principalitarian. The True Believers thought he was going to win, that he was God, that he was The Answer. Insane, clearly. No one man is the Answer. These days, your lucky to get the Lesser Of Two Evils. The Civic Minded Principalitarians vote because they feel it is the duty of a loyal American to vote. But they fear the two major candidates. A vote for Perot is, at least, a vote for none of the above. A cop out? Maybe. Or maybe a protest. Is it a cop out to say 'I, at least, am not to blame for putting the President in the White House. Don't come crying to me when the stuff hits the fan'? You did, Joe. In almost as many words. 'Best of all, I won't have to take responsibility for the damage that will done by the Clintons over the next four years.' Looking at the pre-election poles, a vote for Dole was also a wasted vote. Why do it? Because if you didn't vote, you didn't TRY! OK, opinion vented. joe.. you couldn't have a better position. well said. i voted against the dope bill. i also voted against anything which helped any attorney fatten his or her pockets. as for propositions, i feel any law voted in by the population should stand as voted and not be challanged by political correct attornies who get the voted in propositions thrown out. as for the city politions who always ask where will we get funds if not from higher taxes, try this: lower you dam salery you over paid #$%^&! start cutting at the top not the services! look at vallejo and marine wworld. no voter voted on marine world to be financed by the city but the city "fathers" wanted "to better the city and create more jobs" bull.... the x mayor smiles on each trip to the bank for his efforts on that project. city goverments are running wild and need to be "reworked". Seems to me that California got what you deserve in the election. Andnow some lawyer types say that California law probably makes it legal tosmoke marijuana in the workplace, but not tobacco. Is it any wonderthat with three teenagers, I abandoned that misstate like a sinking shipfor a place that gives me freedom to be myself. Live so far off the beaten track that anyone who comes by is eithertotally lost, looking for me or a government agent. I can breath theair, shoot game, and smoke tobacco on my own land (even outdoors). Thepoint is that I don't need a government to tell me how to live my lifeand I won't settle for it. I pity those who do. Just my penny. You ultraconservative types constantly decry the alleged "liberal bias" in the media. So why do you applaud David Brinkley, who completely abandoned any pretense to being an objective journalist when he shot his mouth off about President Clinton on the air? That was an especially egregious and indisputable example of journalistic bias. Is it because in this particular case the bias was very clearly in your favor? In his new job as a commentator, David Brinkley will not have to pretend to be an objective journalist. I would not have been critical of him if he were making those remarks as a commentator who happens to have a particular viewpoint. I am criticizing him only because he made the remarks while serving as the anchor of an "impartial" news program. as a french citizen, i mind my own business and tell you that your'comment' on the vote by Californians on prop 215 is pure bullshit Better Freedom than Hypocrisy and injustice as it is unfortunately still the case here. By the way I too have children So nice to read the comments of one of the few Americans (apparently) who can still THINK! I, too, cannot believe how the 49% of voters who elected Clinton could be mindlessly loyal to a man David Brinkley so aptly pegged in his unplanned, but on-air comments. All I can say is: Thank God enough Congressional districts voted Republican, allowing the Senate and House to keep a reign on this "liberal in conservative's clothing" administration -- at least for the next two years! And Heaven help us if, four years hence, the American public has "dumbed down" sufficiently to elect (I wince to even print it) AL GORE as Clinton's successor. Your editorial claims that California's proposition 215, whichlegalizes medical use of marijuana, was about "peace and love"types pushing drugs. This is simply not true. It is a last resortused to allow physicians to prescribe a substance which they havedetermined is medically effective in counteracting AIDS-relatednausea and glaucoma. A last resort made necessary solely becausethe "politics" of the DEA has thwarted the legitimate medical useof marijuana, despite extensive medical review and court hearings,included the much-quoted case in which the judge declared marijuana"safer than aspirin" in 1988 - only to be ignored. Indeed, despite the DEA's view of politics, the voters passed notonly 215 in California, but Proposition 200 in Arizona, which[to quote David Borden of DRCNet, http://www.drcnet.org/]"legalizes prescription and medical use of marijuana and othercontrolled substances, and replaces prison sentences for drugpossession with probation. The bill is retroactive, which meansthat some number of prisoners will be released. Prop. 200 wasbacked by numerous physicians and by prominent Arizonaconservatives, including recently retired Republican SenatorDennis DeConcini and some former Reagan Administration officials."Are these supporters of this more far-reaching proposal "peace & love ... generation X wanna be's"??? Certainly some of us who support the medicinal use of currentlybanned drugs also would like to see complete legalization. But wenever forced the anti-drug zombies to go so far as to prohibit licensedphysicians, with extensive medical research supporting them, fromadministering the best possible treatment to their patients. If thatdetracts from the anti-drug position in a broader context, and suggeststhat it never was based on logic or concern for anyone's well-beingat all, well, it isn't our fault. I thought I was the only one who thought Perot was working forClinton. Or is Clinton working for Perot? Perot did not get wherehe is by doing stupid things. I believe he knew exactly what he wasdoing. I have read your editorials for a while and have agreedwholeheartedly with all of them, but this is the best one yet. I amalso proud to say I voted for Dole and would do it again. The onlygood thing I can find about this election is that the Clintons willnot be able to pass any legislation to hurt the USA, they willprobably be too tied up in court to have any time... So it passed. The let the ill people have it. BUT why not make its distribution through the police departments? EveryCA City has a department, and the outlying rural areas are serviced by thesheriff's offices. This is a STATE program, and with the computer tie-ins to the lawenforcement, a standard procedure can be established. The Ham or Chicken sandwich phenomena....or using more mustard and less Clinton Joe,Again I like your editorials. Wish I could be more political in mypublication. Actually, I have, but I have to keep it to a minimum.Anyway, my wife and I operate our publishing business our of our home. Boywould it be rough for either of us to become employees again. I think BC is going to wake up Wednesday morning and find out thatethics and morals DO matter. I am not so much a pessimist as anoptimist. I always believe that what goes around comes around and thatyou get your just reward in the end. I still have some faith in thiscountry and it's people and when it comes time to cast their vote,people are going to hear that inner voice speaking loud and clear. Good job on the editorial Joe. Good analogies, good examples. Mayospoils much to quickly - especially in warm conditions. Mustard - youneedn't worry about - it'll still be good when you're ready to partake.Personally, I'm worried about the outcome on Nov. 4. Its not even somuch the part about being stuck with another 4 years of bubba and themess we'll be left with. I'm personally worried that if the slickmeisterdoes get re-elected - what that says about the people that voted forhim. I hope society isn't slipping away into the "quick fix", tell mewhat I want to hear just don't tell me the truth syndrome that appearsto be growing. Where I come from and the upbringing that I had was thatyour word meant everything. People prided themselves on being able toconsumate a deal, large or small, with just a handshake. If you said youwere going to do something people expected and counted on you to do whatyou said. Hell I'd be afraid to shake hands with slick willie. Afraidthat I'd come away with a couple of fingers or something missing. I ambolstered by one thing. Even if loose willie does get re-elected he'llbe a lame duck and he won't be able to screw things up too bad. Hang inthere. We'll all be interested to see what happens in a few days. � 1995 Zippo Dot Com Incorporated All rights reservedWT02-B10-296IA038-000734-B028-68http://zippo.com:80/useweb.htm 205.185.79.4 19970210062700 text/html 5944HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 06:29:01 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 02:04:54 GMTContent-length: 5770 The Daily News - Zippo's News Service Super Zippo Subscriber Web Sites Tom's Hornsby Tapes The Singing Tuscaroras The House of Rufos The Shadow's Place And All That Jazz OffRoad Links Slaymaan's Home Page Twilight Zone Home Page Janeen & Stephen's Bandwidth HOG Hector's House The Fultons Samson Alexae's List Aphex's Page Bob Wood's Page My Ferret's Webpage Teen Views Brooklyn Products Inc.

Zippo News is the product of Zippo Dot Com of Sunnyvale California. Zippo News Services include free public access servers, membership servers, subscription servers, and commercial servers for ISPs and business end users. Original Zippo offers sections for free public access, including an WinSock Apps section, as well as membership services for nntp access and restricted alt.* group access. Details Super Zippo, an expanded service, is available only to subscription users and commercial customers. Details Zippo provides Usenet, and other forms of Internet news, in a range of 180,000 - 220,000 + articles per day. Zippo offers full read and post access to its users and propagates news throughout the Internet every 15 minutes. Zippo receives news through; local posts, and numerous educational and commercial providers of both US and International origin. What are the difference between Super Zippo and Original Zippo ? Super Zippo is a purely commercial subscription service. Original Zippo provides free public access through Direct Read News � , with membership only required for groups requiring restricted access per current US law. The law covers point of origin and we are a US company. Membership also permits nntp news reader access. Super Zippo has multiple sites for users to access. Currently they are on the West Coast and East Coast. This provides less traffic per site, fewer geographic connecting hops, and redundant service in the event of an outage. Super Zippo provides 18,000 + news groups, Zippo provides 5,000+. Super Zippo adds groups constantly, Zippo is static, with the exception of updates. Super Zippo permits users to add local unique news groups, Zippo does not. Super Zippo does not have a time limit on usage, Zippo is limited to a max. of 6 hours in a 24 hour period. Super Zippo provides expanded FTP software selections, approx. 28 Gbytes to approx. 8 Gbytes for Zippo. Super Zippo has binary image archives, Zippo does not Super Zippo provides mailboxes to retail subscribers, Zippo does not. Super Zippo offers user web pages to 6 and 12 month subscribers. Super Zippo systems and lines are faster than Zippo. During periods of light access, the systems may appear to be similar in performance, however, as membership grows on Zippo, the system performance will be slower. Super Zippo runs a ratio of users to systems that is maintained at a lower level. Super Zippo is available at special rates to commercial users, ISPs and Corporate accounts, Zippo is not. I just signed up for the service and I can't connect through nntp, or through Direct Read News. What's wrong ? Did you receive a confirming message from the service or from a Zippo Dot Com representative ? All memberships and subscriptions are automatically processed, 24 hours each day, and then confirmed. If you did not receive a confirmation e-mail within a few minutes of applying, contact us. The typical reson for no confirmation is an incorrect e-mail return address entered on the app. Super Zippo subscriptions and Zippo membership systems are not the same, one does not give access to the other. Frequently, users going to the wrong system is the problem. The home page and nntp system names, respectively, for Super Zippo are: http://super.zippo.com and snews.zippo.com. The home page and nntp system names for Zippo are http:/www.zippo.com and news.zippo.com. Case sensitive related issues are the next greatest cause for an inability to connect to either service. Our systems see uppercase and lower case letters as two distinctly different things. Aazz is not the same as AAZZ, or aazz. We took the approach as a security enhancement for passwords and e-mail addresses. Using upper and lower case distinction greatly decreases the probability of some one getting into a user's account. We entered the password incorrectly for a members account. So far we are running 99.8% accuracy, so the chances for this happening are 2 in 1000. When an e-mail is sent to us in reference to access, the first thing we do is a double test for incorrect entries. Once we have gone through this check, the chances of incorrect password are virtually zero. Incorrect browser or news reader setup where system information has not been entered, or a version of client software does not support password access. Send us an e-mail message, with the name and version of the access software you are using, and we will work through this with you. Attempted multiple connections will cause a disconnect. Both Super Zippo and Zippo memberships and subscriptions are for single user access. If a user id and password are already in use, and attempted second log on will interrupt the first. We are asked why we do this, usually with reference to a provider service where passwords may be used many times, simultaneously. The answer is that they are selling time and we are selling information. Time based services encourage as many people to be on line as possible because their billing is additive, they will charge for every minute a password is in use, so if 10 people are using the service, they will charge for all of them. We are a flat rate subscription service and do not bill for time, so 10 connections under the same user names consumes 10 times the amount of system resources, but the revenue to us remains the same. I have service through an ISP and I cannot access restricted Alt groups. Are you censoring the news ? Each ISP is provided with two sets of passwords. One permits general access, the second provides complete access. The ISP may distribute these passwords in a manner consistent with their local laws and service policies. I've posted to Super Zippo, or Zippo, and my posts aren't showing up, what is happening to them ? Posts through nntp or Direct News, should show up on our servers between 15 minutes and half an hour of being posted. With as many as 220,000 articles coming each day, 15 minute batches of posts are the most efficient way of placing them on the system. If they do not show up within this time frame, and they would not be classified as SPAM, something is wrong, and we would appreciate it if you would let us know. If the article is directed to a newsgroup that has a moderator, it will be directed to the moderator for approval, before it is posted. When approved, it will propagated back to us through the news network, so they will not appear instantly. If the moderator does not approve the post, it may never be posted. We keep a list of moderated newsgroups. If your post was SPAM, it may never show up. Major commercial messages in non-commercial groups are screened, as are articles cross posted to many groups that are not of common interest. If you are not sure if a post is SPAM, as us I've seen posts on other news servers that don't show up on the Zippo Servers ?All news servers are independent. There is not a central hub, or and originating point for all news. Each server also has it's own policies on what groups to carry, what to feed outbound to other news services, and where they will get inbound news from. Generally, because we have many inbound news feeds, we get the bulk of the news that is placed into general circulation. If you consistently see posts on another server, that you do not see on Super Zippo or Zippo, send us a copy of the post header and we'll see if we can track it down, or arrange for a feed from the source. Why does it take so long for articles to show up on Super Zippo, or Zippo, when they are posted on other news servers. ?I think the misleading term is "news". I think it should be called publicly distributed mail. News is not like broadcast news. The news migrates amongst perhaps 10,000 significant servers and, depending where you are in the overall flow, articles will be received in a few hours, or a few days. You may see a post on a server that took three connections to get there and a few hours. The same post may have taken 9 connections to get to us and 4 days. The reverse will also be true, where articles appear on our servers, but do not appear on other servers. I use Agent to count new articles on news servers and sometimes Super Zippo and Zippo have less. ? It would be very easy for us to match or exceed the number of articles on other large news servers. All we would have to do is open the flood gates to SPAM and prevent any external post cancellations. We'd rather not. On a daily bases we remove at least 4,000 posts of "Make Money Fast" , approximately 8,000 posts by the guys that advertise dial-aporn hotlines by putting their number on a picture from alt.binary.pictures.erotica.girlfriends, etc. We hope our net articles are more worthwhile and will encourage people to post, when they see their messages won't be lost in a pile of garbage. � 1995,1996 Zippo Dot Com Incorporated, All rights reservedWT02-B10-301IA038-000734-B028-247http://zippo.com:80/faqnews.htm 205.185.79.4 19970210062818 text/html 12519HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 06:30:19 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sat, 07 Dec 1996 02:15:15 GMTContent-length: 12344 Super Zippo Frequently Asked Questions How do I setup Agent as my newsreader to access Zippo's news server? When initially starting Agent a Setup dialogue box will appear. The following fields need to be specified and are described below: News (NNTP) Server: snews.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo West news server) snews2.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo East news server) news.zippo.com (for the Original Zippo Membership) Mail (SMTP) Server: The SMTP server offered by your ISP, or the SMTP server included with a Super Zippo subscription. Email Address: The Email address provided by your ISP, or the mailbox included with a Super Zippo subscription. Go Online now?: When this dialogue box appears, select NO. At this point you still need to specify your username and password settings, to pass the authentication process, before downloading the newsgroup list. Now go to the Options menu bar and select the Preferences option. Then select the Profile folder to enter the following information: Check the Server requires authorization login options box to enable the User Name field. Once enabled, enter in your username. Check the Remember Password between sessions options box to enable the Password field. Once enabled, enter in your password. The authentication process is case-sensitive, so be sure to use upper-case and lower-case characters when appropriate. Now that your username and password are setup, you can select Refresh Group List from the Online pull-down menu. The newsgroup list will then begin to download. How do I setup WinVN as my newsreader to access Zippo's news server? When initially starting WinVN, create the winvn.ini and newsrc file by selecting OK for each. These are temporary files which eventually get used by the application once you specify your settings and a newsgroup list is downloaded. Within the initial Communications Options dialogue box, specify the following: NNTP Server: snews.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo West news server) snews2.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo East news server) news.zippo.com (for the Original Zippo Membership) Username: Enter your username for access to the services.

Select YES to initiate the download of the newsgroup list. The list should begin to download. How do I setup NewsXpress as my newsreader to access Zippo's news server? For Super Zippo, you would need NewsXpress V2.0 because it supports more than 16,000 newsgroups. Version 1.0 will only handle up to 16,000 so the entire Super Zippo newsgroup list will not download properly through this version. NewsXpress is currently only available in the 32-bit format so an alternative newsreader may be necessary if accessing through Windows 3x. At the initial Options dialogue box, you would enter the following information: Servers and Directory folder - News (NNTP) server: snews.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo West news server) snews2.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo East news server) news.zippo.com (for the Original Zippo Membership) Username: Enter your username to access the services. Password: Enter your password. Your Username and Password settings will be used to pass the authentication process.

SMTP Server: You can use the SMTP server offered by your ISP, or the SMTP server included with a Super Zippo subscription. Personal Information folder - Full Name: your name E-Mail address: You would use the email address offered by your ISP, or the mailbox included with a Super Zippo subscription. After these settings are specified, you would begin to download the newsgroup list by selecting Connect from the File pull-down menu. The newsgroup list should begin to download at this point. How do I setup NewsWatcher as my newsreader to access Zippo's news server? The newest version of NewsWatcher 2.1.2 supports the authentication process, so you would need to get this version. The various preference settings will be described below for setting up NewsWatcher. At the Preferences dialogue box, you would need the following information. The Preference options can be found within the File menu. The necessary Topics are described below: Server Addresses - News Server: snews.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo West news server) snews2.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo East news server) news.zippo.com (for the Original Zippo Membership) Mail Server: The SMTP server offered through your ISP, or the SMTP server included with a Super Zippo subscription.

Authentication - Username: Enter your username to access the services. Password: Enter your password. Your Username and Password settings will be used to pass the authentication process. Be sure to use upper-case and lower-case characters when appropriate because the process is case sensitive. Always authenticate option: select (yes). Zippo's news servers require authentication for reading and posting. Authenticate only when requested option: do not select this option. This option is for servers that require authentication on posting only. How do I setup Internet News as my newsreader to access Zippo's news server? When you initially install MS's Internet News, you will be presented with the Internet News Configuration dialogue box. From here you would enter the following information: News Server: snews.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo West news server) snews2.zippo.com (for the Super Zippo East news server) news.zippo.com (for the Original Zippo Membership) My news server requires me to logon: select (yes) Logon Settings: Account Name: Enter your username to access the services Password: Enter your password.

If Internet News is already install you would select Options from the Message pull-down menu. From here the Options dialogue box will appear. Simply select the Add button and utilize the above information to add a new news server. Can I use rtin to access Zippo's news server? Newer versions of tin support the authentication process and can be used if your system is configured correctly. A few environmental variables need to be specified in order to successfully connect. If you do not have access to the specific files to make changes, you would need to contact your systems or network administrator. For the sake of simplicity, snews.zippo.com will be used to describe below. If Super Zippo East is used instead, be sure to specify snews2.zippo.com as the NNTP server instead. Original Zippo Members would utilize news.zippo.com as the NNTP server. Define Server Name: Have snews.zippo.com specified as the NNTP server in the environment variable NNTPSERVER, or specified as the /etc/nntpserver file. Specify Password: because either of the servers utilizes username/password authentication, a password for the chosen server needs to be specified. Enter as: snews.zippo.com password (newsservername(spacebar)yourpassword) in the $HOME/.newsauth file. Choosing a Zippo Username: The login name to your system has to match your chosen username. When the news server authenticates a user, it will utilize your login name as the Username. Be sure to have both match. If you do not have access to these files, you may need to contact your systems administrator. You would also use rtin or tin -r to access either of the remote nntp servers.
