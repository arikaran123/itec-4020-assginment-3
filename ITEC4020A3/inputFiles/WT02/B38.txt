"The board thinks that anyoneseeking re-financing is potentially a bad debt case," he said,recounting how the bank's board turned down a package he put togetherto re-finance the business of a small property company."The company was paying 17 percent to a finance company for a 700million baht ($16 million) project. They have had a five-year trackrecord of on-time payment," the banker said.There was also a strong fee-based component. He had proposed a 400million baht facility at 15 percent per annum, with a 1 percentup-front fee and a 40 million baht revolving facility at half apercentage maintenance fee per month.The banker reckoned the deal was turned down because of his bank'sstrongly conservative culture. A lack of competitiveness in the Thaibanking industry preclude large and established banks from movingaggressively to capture new businesses away from other banks.Around the region, sustained economic growth averaging 10 percent inmuch of Asia has been creating a strong cohort of well-run smallbusinesses in growth industries.A senior Malaysian banker told Asian Banker, "typically, a smallbusiness that is begun with little more than the wits of theentrepreneur would turn to factoring to manage its cash flow. A low endfinancial institution may also be interested."A Filipino banker admitted: "Often, it's a case of us not understandingtheir business. In the Philippines, we'd rather lend to theco-operatives who, in turn, lend to these small businesses." But evenwith a strong track record, they continue to be viewed suspiciously bybankers.Finance companies in Malaysia and Thailand charge up to 4 percent overpublished prime rates. When Filipino banks do lend directly to smallbusinesses, the rates are exorbitant, at 7 percent-8 percent overprime.The problem is that by the time these small businesses reach a stage ofmaturity to warrant the interest of banks, the competition would havebecome very tough. Competition at a mature stage is not only betweenbanks, but with non-bank financial institutions, the venturecapitalists, merchant banks and even other corporations.Malaysia appears to have the most progressive environment ofcompetitive re-financing in the region. "Nobody advertises it aloud,"the Malaysian banker said,"but it sometimes goes down to the level of abank asking to see the letter-of-offer of the original financier andsimply substituting that with a better offer." He joked that if theoriginal bank had a good reputation, the competitor would not need tobother doing its own due diligence.In Singapore and Hong Kong, government incentives play a critical rolein getting favourable terms for targeted small businesses they want topromote. Singapore banks charge as low as a quarter percent over primefor loans under the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme.While the rates are attractive, such loans come with conditions thatcan be restrictive if a company proves to grow very fast. What isneeded is a banking community that is as nimble as the fast-footedentrepreneurs who are creating the economic miracles in the region.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Monetary Authorityof Singapore, while deciding not to join its members, also set upsimilar arrangements on a bilateral basis with the central banks ofThailand and Indonesia to ameliorate the volatile influence of globalcapital flows on exchange-rates.The bilateral pacts, although not a carte blanc for central banks totap into the reserves of their neighbours, nevertheless allow signatorycountries to borrow from one another to boost their reserves in timesof crisis. This was in reflection of the Mexican peso crisis that ledto speculative assaults on a number of regional currencies.Technically, it formally contracts the parties to raise US dollars fromone another against US Treasury securities.Market watchers, however, are not convinced that these agreements willresult in central banks pooling their foreign exchange reserves.Analysts highlighted the fact that the effectiveness of such measuresagainst potentially disruptive market speculation has never been put tothe test. It would certainly be sensible to think that no currencywould ever be immune to"attacks".Economists say that the soundness of macroeconomic fundamentals andpolicy prudence remain the ultimate guarantors of exchange systemstability. In its weekly economic update, the Union Bank of Switzerlandnoted that even G3 (Japan, Germany and the US) co-ordinatedintervention works best when it aims to support market moves.In a recent speech calling for greater co-operation between Asia'scentral banks, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, said the Mexican episode was a wakening bell to Asiancentral bankers. This, he said, has made central bankers wonder: whathas changed for Asian monetary stability? What has remained the same?What needs to change?Yam believes that with open capital accounts, and significant foreigndirect and portfolio investments pouring into Asia, Asian currencieshave become susceptible to the global ebb and flow of financialresources.Players have also changed. The commercial bankers, who have always hadbranches and offices in Asia, understand the region well. On the otherhand, new actors have appeared on centre stage in the last five years.Securities houses, pension and mutual funds, investment banks and alsohedge funds have appeared in Asian markets.In the face of these developments, central bankers believe that theability of central banks to stabilise exchange rates seems to haveslipped from their grasp. However, Yam noted that the soundfundamentals in the Asian markets still hold.What has also remained the same is that, as lenders of last resort,central banks are in a position to dictate terms when eventually theyare asked to lend domestic currencies directly or indirectly tospeculators shorting their currencies.In the aftermath of the Mexico crisis, an informal meeting of some ofthe region's central banks concluded that it would be useful toexchange information on market activities, to monitor the markets moreclosely, to share knowledge and techniques on overall financial marketsupervision, and to immunise the pain tolerance levels of the economyin case it becomes necessary to inflict pain on the speculators.At present, most Asian economies are keeping their exchange rates at alow level in order to ensure export competitiveness. The most obviousmanifestation of this is reflected in the increase in the reserves ofsome economies as a result of direct central bank intervention to holddown their currencies.Economists point to the fact that in terms of purchasing-powerparities, most Asian currencies, including those of China, India andThailand, are still grossly undervalued.Another factor which impinges on the stability of some of the region'sexchange rates is the fact that most economies in the region aregrowing huge current account deficits. However, current accountdeficits in Asia mostly reflect foreign capital inflows which fueldevelopment.The argument is that if these are mainly short-term portfolio capital,then it is better to allow reserves to grow, as opposed to allowing anincrease in the exchange rate which may later fall when theseshort-term capital flow elsewhere.In the case of more long-term capital inflow, then a stronger exchangerate is not such a bad proposition at all. However, the problem oflosing export competition due to a stronger currency will come back tohaunt the governments.In the aftermath of the peso crisis last year, Indonesian stocks fellto six-month lows amid concern that speculators were going to targetthe rupiah. In the Philippines, the central bank raised rates to defendthe peso.However, some feel that the move suggests inherent weaknesses in theircurrencies. Some say that it only serves to raise more concerns in theminds of investors, making matters worse not better.Exchange rate against US$ (% change as at December 21 1995)Australia           -4.34China               +1.55Hong Kong           +0.5India              -10.4Indonesia           -3.83Japan               -1.97Malaysia            +0.5New Zealand         +2.14Philippines         -6.41Singapore           +3South Korea         +1.95Sri Lanka           -7.59Taiwan              -3.84Thailand            -0.2Source: MMS InternationalCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HONG KONG FIRST TO GO RTGSNearly 30 years after banks in the US have been processing payments ona real time basis, banks in Asia have finally taken the same routeTHE HONG Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is confident that the colony'shigh value transaction payment system will be able to go real time bythe end of this year. Almost all banks in Asia still settle theirinterbank cheques and other payments mostly on a net overnight basis.The system to be used by the HKMA will be similar to that used by theFederal Reserves Board in the US, called FedWire.While the US FedWire System has been settling payments on an Real TimeGross Settlements (RTGS) system since 1968 and the Swiss have beendoing it since 1987, the HKMA began looking into this faster and safersystem to deal with rising interbank exposures only in 1993."The adoption of RTGS will immediately eliminate most of the legalrisks associated with bilateral or multi-lateral netting," Joseph Yam,chief executive of HKMA, said at a payments system seminar organised bythe agency in Hong Kong late last year. "Settlement across the books ofthe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will eliminate any doubt over creditrisks associated with commercial banks acting as settlementinstitutions, however prudently these commercial banks are run."RTGS enables settlements to be made on a payment-versus-payment basis(see definitions box), so that there is virtually no exposure betweeninstitutions at any point in the day. Experts believe that this in turneliminates what is known in large payment systems circles as "HerstattRisk". Coined in reference to the situation that arose from a majorsettlement failure in the past, Herstatt Risk arises in foreignexchange transactions when one counterparty delivers currency in onetime zone and receives value in the other currency in another timezone. The risk arises out of the possibility that the counterparty whodelivers later may fail to settle.According to Yam, Hong Kong adopted a "single tier architecture,instead of the present three tier one, with every bank settlingdirectly across the books". The HKMA also plans to integrate itsCentral Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) service, which is its book entrysecurities system, directly with the RTGS system. So daylightoverdrafts incurred by the banks at the clearing account with the HKMAwill be fully collateralised with the Exchange Fund paper on a repo(sell and buy-back) basis.Yam believes that Hong Kong will be the first to settle its moneymarketdeals on this basis. "As far as I know, our RTGS system is one of thefirst to be engineered with a seamless integration between thesettlement function and the government securities book entry function.We will be happy to share our technical specifications on this andother features with other central banks."In December, it introduced the first of a series of enhancements forits CMU by making it possible for end-of-day delivery versus payment(DvP) facility for private sector debt securities lodged and clearedwith the CMU.In January this year, the CMU announced it is also able to clearforeign currency debt securities. "So far, the CMU only accepts HongKong dollar debt securities because the CMU service is designed and setup to promote the Hong Kong dollar debt market," Yam said. "However,there is no reason why the CMU, which is already linked up withEuroClear and Cedel, cannot widen its coverage to debt securitiesdenominated in foreign currency."The DvP function will be made available to all CMU instruments,including exchange fund bills and notes, private sector debtsecurities, on a real time and end-of-day settlement basis when theentire RTGS system goes live at the end of 1996.Hong Kong chose to build its RTGS settlement system on top of itsexisting large value fund transfer system called CHATS. The decision tobuild on CHATS was taken because it would have taken a long time tobuild a new system from scratch and also because it was possible tobuild on a system that banks in Hong Kong were already familiar with.The new RTGS system would have clocked a mere 24 months in installationtime.Small banks are able to access the HKMA's RTGS using a simple personalcomputer. It is also possible for the larger banks to interface theirown complex systems with RTGS through existing AS400 computer systems.Introducing RTGS was especially tricky in Hong Kong as the colony's 180licensed banks operate on a three tier clearing structure. The toplayer comprises Hong Kong Bank, which plays the role of the managementbank of the clearing house. Hong Kong Bank also owns and runs thecurrent CHATS system. The second layer comprises a number of settlementbanks and the third layer comprises the sub-settlement banks. The RTGSsystem was implemented by a joint venture company called the Hong KongInter-bank Clearing Limited, which is 50:50 owned by the HKMA and theHong Kong Association of Banks.Hong Kong set the end of 1996 as the target to complete its RTGS systemfor two reasons. The first reason being that the Federal Reserve Boardof the United States had already announced that the operating hours ofits own FedWire system was to be extended to 18 hours. As this wouldextend the time into Asian trading hours, the HKMA wanted to have asystem that could complete cross-currency transactions on apayment-versus-payment (PvP) basis.The second reason was to tie in with the targeted completion of theChina National Automated Payment Systems for the renminbi in 1997. Boththe US dollar and the Chinese renminbi are important currencies, as theHong Kong dollar is linked to the US dollar based on a monetary policyobjective and to the renminbi through extensive trade.RTGS on a global basis?While daily inter-bank Hong Kong dollar transactions constitute $15billion, foreign exchange transactions are in the order of $91 billiona day. Although most Asian transactions are currently with US andEuropean counter-parties, the growth in intra-Asian trade is expectedto increase regional transactions tremendously.Between 1990 and 1994, the number of SWIFT messages recording financialflows around the world increased by 9.1 percent, but total messages forthe Asia Pacific region alone grew more than twice that rate at nearly14.6 percent.The question naturally arises if a global RTGS payment system willarise any time soon. "A robust network of global cross-border paymentscan only be built on robust domestic payment systems," Yam said. Healso thinks that some countries are ahead of others in this respect.Yam believes that RTGS linkages between countries should be developedon a bilateral, instead of a multi-lateral, basis. It is not possibleto internationalise or harmonise payment systems even among G10countries because of different agendas in each of them. The legal andstructural constraints will be too many to handle all at once. "It isin the two economies own direct interests to build a bilateral linkagewith each other, and this could be achieved with much greater ease."Furthermore, PvP linkages are better achieved either indirectly viaprivate sector banks or directly with linkages of two RTGS systemstogether. A US payment systems expert, Bruce Summers, recently proposedthat central banks can act as"matching agencies" by examining thepayments originated by users of the service and releasing such paymentsonly when a well-defined set of conditions are met. This method is oneway of reducing Herstatt risks without involving central banks in newtypes of credit risks.How the HKMA's RTGS System will workHONG KONG'S new RTGS system will adopt a Y-shaped flow as indicated inthe diagram above. All banks will have direct access to the system. Theadvantage of this flow method is to keep the system simple and direct.There is no routing of information or value via any other intermediary.A bank will send in its full payment instruction (including the valueand information on the customer) to a Central Transaction Processor.The processor will"strip" the details of the customer. Only thesettlement instruction (i.e the information on the amount, the payeeand recipient banks) on the Settlement Account Processor will be passedon to the Settlement Account Processor and known by the HKMA.All payments will have to be settled on an individual and gross basis.As the system will have no provisions for daylight overdraft, bankswithout sufficient clearing balance (or securities for repos) will bequeued in the system until the bank meets the liquidity requirement.All payments cleared by the HKMA will then be final and irrevocable.Intra-day liquidity is created by the seamless integration with theCentral MoneyMarket Unit book entry securities clearing and settlementsystem. This interface enables banks to develop same day repos.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Rating agencies have flagged caution in dealing with the banksin this country for at least five to seven years. Standard & Poor's(S&P) notes that Indonesia's banking industry is underpinned by apotentially more volatile, albeit developing, economy and shouldattract more caution than the banking system of other countries.At this stage of its economic development, Indonesia is overbanked,said S&P in an assessment report. The industry has 240 commercial bankswith average assets per bank of $500 million. On an internationalcomparison, this implies an excess number of banks and a lack ofoperating efficiency among small to mid-sized banks.Recent data collated by Asian Banker suggest that in spite of the largenumber of banks in Indonesia, the penetration level is still very low.When viewed in the perspective of the archipelago's 17,000 islands and190 million population, there are only 1.3 banks per million people and24.3 branches per million.This branch penetration level compares very poorly even with itsnearest comparison. The Philippines has a penetration of 41.8 branchesper million population. At the other end of the scale, Hong Kong hasthe highest penetration with 261.4 branches per million.The low branch penetration is matched by the extremely low averageasset size for Indonesian banks, which is a mere $0.66 billion per bankbranch as compared to $54.6 billion in Japan and $10.44 billion forThailand. The impression created by this data is that the basis forconcern should not be based on the asset quality of any one smallIndonesian bank but on the knock-on effect that any lack of confidencewould have.It is exactly this concern that the rating agencies talk about.Standard & Poor's believes that undercapitalisation of small banks mayhave a knock-on effect on mid-sized banks. This is because the smallerbanks in Indonesia are in the practice of obtaining funds from thelarger banks on the inter-bank money markets. This gives the largerbanks an arbitrage in the market because of their stronger financialposition.Under a World Bank-assisted "Action Plan", the Indonesian Governmenthelped the state-owned banks to increase their paid-up capitalisationto Rp1 trillion ($455 million). Private sector banks are also in theprocess of building their capital base to meet the new capital adequacyratio (CAR) of 8 percent. In addition, private banks with foreignexchange licences will have to increase their capital to Rp150 billionand CAR of 12 percent by the year 2001.Banks in Indonesia, however, play a greater role in the country'seconomic development as compared to other countries. Viewed from aGross Domestic Product (GDP) perspective, there are 3.6 banks to every$10 billion GDP. Japanese banks account for only 0.56 banks to every$10 billion GDP in that country.While this does imply that Indonesian banks are in a better position tobenefit from the 8 percent-10 percent growth in the GDP in recentyears, the converse is also true. If there is any let up in the growthof the country's economy, the banking industry will suffer more thanthe Japanese banks are experiencing currently.Bank Indonesia issued a directive in September 1995 that commercialbanks holding foreign-exchange licences have to increase their paid upcapital to Rp150 billion by September 2001. This is expected to causesmaller banks to merge in order to meet the higher capitalisationrequirements.Standard & Poor's is also concerned about the banking community'sexposure to finance companies. The number of finance companies hasproliferated in recent years. Finance companies in Indonesia operateoutside the ambit of the central bank and are disallowed from acceptingpublic deposits. They are funded primarily through bank borrowings. S&Pis concerned that banks lending to finance companies are indirectlytaking on finance companies loan portfolio, which is inherently muchweaker than that of the banking industry.But Bank Indonesia has been introducing tighter supervision and aclearer accounting framework to improve the transparency in theindustry. The only concern is that banks generally delay the release ofaudited statements."Many commercial banks still do not disclose non-performing loans,"said S&P in an evaluation of the Indonesian banking industry. Theagency is concerned that loans are concentrated towards affiliates andlarge borrowers. There is also high exposure to office and condominiumprojects. Lippo Bank experienced a crisis situation in late 1995 whenit was unable to manage its own fundings of the large propertydevelopment projects undertaken by its own affiliate propertycompanies.Equities analysts, however, feel that if the government's strengtheningefforts pay off, several Indonesian banks will ride the strong economicgrowth predicted for the country. Analysts predict that loans wouldgrow by 30 percent-40 percent last year, and that average earningswould have grown by about 25 percent. Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia,Panin Bank and Bank Bali have been identified as being fundamentallystrong.However, the lack of depth in the capital market makes it difficult forbanks to meet their obligations in a timely and cost efficient manner.S&P's assessment is that"banks bearing the brunt of problem loans arenot likely to recover, unaided, to full fiscal health for at least fiveto seven years".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ngwill be responsible for the entire institutional banking side of thebusiness while Lau will be in charge of individual banking, which willinclude the retail and private banking businesses.The heads of the bank's retail and private banking divisions,respectively Elsie Foh and Tan Mong Tong, will report directly to Lau.This is expected to give them greater leverage at the top level of thebank's management to respond to changes more quickly.Similarly, Ng Kee Choe will have Tan Soo Nan reporting to him ontreasury and investment management activities, and Soh Kim Soonreporting on international and corporate banking. Oliver Tan, anothersenior executive vice president, will take over special projects fromJanuary 1, reporting directly to the chairman, Ngiam Tong Dow.DBS Bank has been introducing new initiatives in rapid successionlately. On the retail front, it recently extended opening hours to 5pmfrom the traditional 3pm for other banks, as a result of greaterefficiencies in the branch network. This is in addition to theauthorised trading centres and investment centres it set up last year.In investment banking, the bank achieved distinction in becoming theregion's leader in advisory and underwriting portfolios.The bank is also already working out an expansion plan across theregion. It has obtained banking licences in Shanghai (China), SriLanka, Thailand (provincial licence in Rayong) and the Philippines. Thenotable exception is Malaysia, where DBS Bank is the only Big FourSingapore bank without a full banking licence in the neighbouringcountry. However, it has set up representative offices in Bombay,Rangoon, and Labuan (an offshore centre in Malaysia).DBS Bank is particularly active in the securities industries in most ofthe regional markets, particularly Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.DBS has a strong custodian business in its home market as well as inMalaysia. In December, it set up a custodian joint venture in Thailandwith the Thai Danu Bank. Ng announced the bank's plan to expand itsshare custodian services network to South Korea, Indonesia, thePhilippines and India.Singapore banks have had a strong reputation of being adequatelycapitalised. Although profitability has not been one of their strongpoints, things have been improving in the last two years.According to analyst reports, the combined return on equity of the BigFour banks for the year ended 1994 was 13.3 percent, up from 9.9percent the previous year.As the Singapore economy matures and competition for funds becomes moreintense, banks are becoming more cognisant about shareholder value. Thecapital surplus position of Singapore banks and the returns fromnon-bank activities, such as investment and property holdings, alsoputs them in a good position to acquire new businesses.A DBS Bank spokesperson told Asian Banker that there is no overridingmotive in the restructuring exercise. In typical public relationsparlance, she said the move "is part of our ongoing renewal process".The bank did not hire any consultants to advise it on the changes inthe top management line up.This is in contrast with at least two of the other Big Four banks,which have been using consultants quite extensively. The leading edgeretail banking initiatives in UOB Bank, such as its InvestShops, weretreated as special projects, with consultants from Andersen Consultingreporting directly to the president.OCBC Bank, on the other hand, appointed McKinsey & Co as consultants todevelop a new strategic focus for the organisation. One observer toldAsian Banker that as McKinsey specialises in high level strategyissues, OCBC Bank is being forced to speak to other consultancycompanies to propose new implementation initiatives.The overall business and organisational direction, strategies andpolicies of DBS Bank will now be driven by a"Bank Business Committee".It will be chaired by chairman Ngiam Tong Dow, with the deputypresidents and senior executive vice presidents as members. This smalltask force approach is expected to help the management to take decisiveand timely measures to respond to new challenges in the market. It willalso keep management meetings short and sweet.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Both are essentiallybrash, new innovations into a market that has yet to wake up to therealisation that the brave new world has already arrived.PALDirect was designed primarily to give stock market players directcontrol over their trade. Through a dedicated terminal, the bank'scustomers are able to place their trades on-line to Phileo Allied, thebank's broking subsidiary, which then executes it.As the entire transaction is carried out within the group, PhileoAlliedis able to give AlliedBank a rebate of 25 percent of the 1 percentbrokerage commission that was due to it under securities regulations.The bank in turn passes on 20 percent to the customer and keeps 5percent for itself.Any banker looking at the arrangement would recognise the geniusinvolved in running a transaction through several organisations, usingtechnology that enables all parties to be winners - the bank adds valueto its customer services, the stockbroking company gets trade orders,and the customer benefits from lower overall costs and greaterconvenience.But the Malaysian stockbroking community panicked. The immediate fearwas that if the system was perpetuated, brokers would lose their marketshare and remisiers would have become essentially redundant. The KualaLumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), possibly acting on pressure from thestockbroking community, issued a directive to PhileoAllied Securitiesto stop passing down the commission to AlliedBank.The KLSE based its directive on the exchange's Rule 6(7) that specifiesthat rebates can be only given to approved financial institutions. TheKLSE further interpreted the rule as saying that this rebate can onlybe enjoyed by the financial institution and not passed down further toits customers.Tong, true to form, went on the offensive. He applied for a courtruling on the interpretation of the rule against devolving commissionto customers. The financial community was, at best, amused as nobodyhad ever taken the stock exchange to court before.The upshot of the offensive was that Tong was able to call the KLSE'sbluff. The court application was subsequently dropped after anundisclosed out-of-court agreement and PALDirect continued unaffected.The issue that arose out of this skirmish is of a more fundamentalinterest to the financial community and deserves some thinking through.Firstly, does PALDirect enable banks to enter the stockbrokers' tradewithout a licence? Secondly, do these computers in remote locationsbecome de facto "branches" of stockbroking houses? This is significantbecause of the restriction in many countries against stockbrokersexpanding their branch networks, particularly into remote areas.Malaysia does have many remisiers - 5,000 licensed remisiers at thelast count a few months ago. This is almost half the number of peopleworking in the entire banking industry in the labour scarce country.Remisiers come from a variety of backgrounds - from housewives tohighly-qualified professionals. All are lured by the opportunity tomake much more money in passing share certificates around than throughpursuits that could build much needed skills in other areas of thecountry's development.At the height of the stock market's bull run in the early 1990s, thelack of Remisiers called for urgent technological innovations, althoughnone was forthcoming at the time. Small retail customers had to begremisiers to take on their trade. All this turned with the market. Themarket itself became more sophisticated with unit trusts and otherlong-term investment products becoming available and affordable.Remisiers generally fear that PALDirect is setting a precedent. Alreadytwo other Malaysian banks are said to be interested in developingsimilar products. Although the stockbrokers that Asian Banker spoke toare generally dismissive about PALDirect, there is no reason why theytoo cannot go on the offensive.Southern Bank Securities, a small stockbroking company located in theunlikely town of Ipoh 200 kilometres north of the capital city of KualaLumpur, has also recently introduced a system similar to PALDirect.Called Southern Bank Link (SBL), the system sits on any personalcomputer running the Windows operating system (as compared toPALDirect's "dedicated" terminals).Brokers are far from losing their jobs too soon. Both SBL and PALDirectstill require brokers as, in effect, customers actually place theirorders with them to be executed on-line to the stock exchange.Remisiers also remain useful where contra trade is involved. InSingapore, where retail investors can trade using automated tellermachines, transactions have to be settled immediately. This isunfavourable as compared to trading through a broker where customershave a settlement period of T+7 days, during which time they can dealin contra trades.In the case of PALDirect, the entry level for direct trade is set veryhigh. Customers are expected to maintain an interest-earning fixeddeposit of RM198,000 ($79,200) to have the PALDirect link-up for free.Alternatively, they will have to pay RM6138 ($2,455) over 31 months forthe terminal and RM98 every month after that as maintenance fee. SBLcustomers on the other hand pay only RM250 per month, although thisbroking house does not pass on savings to the customer. Thesearrangements could only interest the most liquid and active of retailinvestors.The managers of both products say they hope to attract the"middle tohigh level players" on the stock market.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightASIAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INTERNATIONAL DEBIT MAKES ITS DEBUTAn international consumer debit payment industry is about to take offin Asia, now that the major card organisations and terminalmanufacturers are introducing major initiatives in the regionUNTIL RECENTLY, when bank customers travelled abroad, the onlyeffective card-based payment channel had been the use of a credit card- either at the ATM for cash advances or at point of sale for creditcard sales.The two card organisations, MasterCard International and VISAInternational, are currently at the forefront of major initiatives thatcan see the use of international debit cards (the international versionof the domestic ATM card or the electronic funds transfer at point ofsale) take off in Asia, and around the world.Debit cards provide consumers with an alternative to cash, cheques,travellers cheques or even converting currencies when they travel.Officials from both MasterCard and VISA told Asian Banker they areconvinced that international debit cards are not alternatives to creditcards and will not cannibalise this market.Andre Sekulic, the senior vice president of MasterCard's debit cardprogramme in the region, told Asian Banker that studies in the US showthat well over 60 percent of all payments made in the US are stillbased on cash.The banks benefit by being able to add value to their depositors'lifestyle in a tangible way while earning fees on transactions. Themerchants benefit from the incremental sales generated by impulsebuying. Experts also believe that merchant receipts are higher as aresult.John Hinds, the executive vice president of Verifone, a transactionautomation company, said the debit system is safer, and transactionsare completed on-line, which is faster than cheque and even cashtransactions where money has to be moved around.The safety of a debit card transaction is based on the PIN-basedtechnology introduced by transaction automation companies such asVerifone. Card users are required to key in their personalidentification numbers (PIN) into a "PIN-pad" before a transaction isauthorised. In most instances, the same PIN is used for ATM-relatedtransactions.Market growthIt is likely that the international debit programmes of both cardorganisations will depend largely on the link-ups they make with themajor domestic networks services in the region. This is also becausethe major networks already have in place, or are building, domesticdebit programmes that would be severely disrupted if internationaldebit is introduced alongside them.For example, the Network for Electronic Transfer (NETS) in Singaporewas concerned that non-participating banks would be able to effectivelyaccess these networks if card holders were able to use theirinternational debit cards within the same country. Because of this, thebanking authorities in Singapore disallowed domestic card holders fromusing their international debit cards within the country.Henry Mundt, MasterCard's director for Global Debit Services, estimatesthat by the end of 1995, there would be 750,000 terminals acceptingMaestro cards globally. Out of this number, he expects that 250,000terminals would be operational in co-operation with networks such asNETS.In Taiwan, the Financial Information System Centre (FISC), whichprovided the national domestic debit card network, is stillcontemplating its involvement in international debit. Silvia Lee,FISC's executive vice president, said Maestro is obviously somethingwhich it has a keen interest in, except that right now the organisationis concentrating on its own IC Card-based EFTPOS system.The IC Card is a smart card-based ATM-cum-debit card which FISCintroduced in 1993. Currently, more than 400,000 of the cards have beenissued by its 19 member banks. The system has a merchant base of some4,000.FISC is now in direct competition with the National Credit Card Centre(NCCC) which previously processed only credit card transactions. TheNCCC has announced that it expects to start international debitacquiring activities in early 1996 by signing on with Maestro. NCCCexpects to build its debit programme on its existing credit cardmerchant base exceeding 60,000 organisations.The NCCC has applied to be the switching and settlement centre for alldomestic Maestro transactions. At present, Chinatrust Commercial Bankis the only Maestro acquirer in the country. Sources said that becauseof unresolved issues pertaining to interchange and switching functions,the Ministry of Finance has restricted the other banks from acquiringmerchants. However, the NCCC and FISC have been instructed by theMinistry of Finance to co-operate on a programme that will allow allcard transactions to be settled domestically.The other Maestro issuing banks have understandably pushed for thelifting of the restriction. Observers see the assignment of thetransaction processing function to NCCC as a possible solution to thequestion of who should be responsible for the domestic processing ofMaestro transactions.This will then pave the way for the other institutions to be involvedin merchant acquisition. So far there are an estimated 1,000 merchantlocations that accept the Maestro debit facility in the country. Anestimated 400,000 Maestro cards have been issued.In China, what have been dubbed as MasterCard and VISA credit cards,are actually at best deferred debit transactions - that is, customerspay for their transactions from their salary accounts held with thebank.The controversy over the definition is not as significant as the factthat it means China is potentially the largest debit card market in theworld. The Chinese Government, responding to a World Bank study on thedevelopment of payment systems in the country, has been committed todeveloping a nationwide cashless payment system. This commitment isexpressed in the development of the Golden Card project.In Malaysia, MasterCard launched its Maestro/Cirrus programme throughtwo organisations in 1993. It hopes to issue 500,000 internationaldebit cards in the country by the end of 1995. MasterCard's Mundt toldAsian Banker that there are already 5,000 Maestro acceptance locations,mostly at petrol kiosks, in Malaysia.The banks currently issuing the Maestro/Cirrus cards are MBf CardsServices, a non-bank issuer which pegged the card on its existingVision bank card, and Standard Chartered Bank.Maestro went on-line in the Philippines as an extension of the BPIExpress Payment System debit programme. Link-ups are expected withJetco, the domestic point of sale debit switch provider in Hong Kong.Cost issuesTim Molly, a director with VISA International, said that merchantsaccepting Maestro transactions will have to pay acquirers transactionfees that are similar to fees for credit card transactions.Mei-may Lek Bors, a debit programme director with MasterCard, toldAsian Banker that debit programmes offer profit opportunities toacquiring institutions in the form of higher interchange fees, a newsource of merchant revenue, and the overall lower implementation cost.For issuing members, the profit opportunities arise from interchangefees, transaction fees and annual membership fees.In Australia, where direct debit initiatives were driven by themerchants in the past, it was the banks that paid the merchants toacquire their transactions. This was called the "negative interchangefees" and was thought to be the trend that would develop.However, Jim Culbertson, the VISA country manager for Australia, toldAsian Banker that this situation was unique to Australia and only inthe past when the merchants originally invested in the technology. Thistrend is being reversed in Australia as smaller merchants sign up withbanks that have already got the infrastructure in place. As such, it isthe merchants that now have to pay transaction fees to the acquiringbanks.There are cost benefits also for the customer. MasterCard's Mundt toldAsian Banker in an interview that in 1995 alone, there were 330 millioncredit and debit cross-border transactions around the world. Seventypercent, or 210 million, of those transactions were for cash withdrawalon ATMs.Mundt also pointed out that customers would benefit from the lowerexchange rates used for debit products and save between $5 to $10 pertransaction. He is convinced that the market would welcome a cheaperdebit-based service that would enable them to access cash from theirown home accounts.Transaction equipment manufacturersHypercom, which accounts for 90 percent of the credit card verificationdevices market, and its competitor VeriFone, which accounted for 60percent of all new installations exported from the US in 1994, are bothbelieved to be making major advances in the area of developing commonterminal acceptance for debit as well as credit and smart cards.Other competitors in the market are Taiwanese-based ADI, France-basedIngenico and the Australian company KeyCorp. Domestic competitors  suchas Fuzhou's Star Group are also coming on-stream.Connecting to smart cardsAll debit card players in the market have an eye towards building asmart card capability in their overall cards strategy. Adding a chip ona debit card is beneficial as it enhances the security of transactions,whether they are credit or debit and can be loaded with value. Theseare also called electronic purses.There are other benefits of smart cards, such as the ability to storerelationship data with merchants and the bank. This has beensuccessfully exploited by major retail organisations such asTakashimaya in Singapore which has issued up to 200,000 cards to date.This is why transaction automation players such as Verifone are keen topush terminals in the market that can process smart card as well ascards with the traditional magnetic strip on them. Verifone has alsoset up a joint venture marketing company with the smart cardmanufacturer GemPlus, called VeriGem, to promote the move towards asmart card-based payments system.Which way now?MasterCard's Mundt told Asian Banker that MasterCard will not allowMaestro to be resident on the same card as the MasterCard credit card,at least not in the foreseeable future. He also said that MasterCardwould not allow duality to participating institutions. This means thatissuers would not be allowed to put MasterCard's Maestro and VISA'sInterlink on the same debit card.He is convinced that having a credit and a direct debit facility on onecard will cause confusion to users and merchants, particularly inmarkets where direct debit facilities are not yet available. Mundt toldAsian Banker that MasterCard may reverse this policy if there isworldwide availability of account select between credit and debittransactions at merchant's EFTPOS terminals. This policy is significantas it is different from the relationship card strategy taken by VISA,which allows all facilities to be resident on one card.So which way will the banks and financial institutions go in Asia?Francois Dutray, the group executive vice president of VISAInternational responsible for product development, told Asian Bankerthat "we can't make the members do what they don't want to do".Both organisations will obviously push their international debit cardsas one of the products to member associations. The cards market maywell have enough space for credit and debit products to co-exist sideby side successfully in the near future.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The programme has gone live in 28countries and 168 million cards have been issued for use on 536,271point of sale terminals.In the Asia Pacific region alone, 80 member institutions have signed upfor Maestro involving 29,392 million committed cards and 8,375 millionlive cards. Out of 96,197 point of sale terminals which have beencommitted, 25,920 have gone live. Around the region, 51,778 merchantshave committed to the programme out of which 15,552 have gone live.According to MasterCard, there are 9 million active Maestro cards inthe Asia Pacific region and another 43.5 million cards committed. Thisis supported by more than 24,000 terminals in the region and 505,000terminals worldwide.According to Henry Mundt, MasterCard's director for Global DebitServices, in total there are 110 million debit cards in MasterCard'sMaestro and Cirrus programmes around the world. He expects the AsiaPacific region to be the fastest growing for the organisationworldwide. The region will commit approximately 16 million live cardsby the end of 1995.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

VISAPlus is its ATM access card and VISA Interlink is its debit card foruse at EFTPOS terminals.The Interlink programme is better developed in Australia than othercountries in the region. Fifty-eight banks have signed up to theprogramme in that country. In Asia itself, Singapore is the firstcountry in the region to introduce the VISA Interlink card.Elsewhere, Interlink will be introduced in Korea (going live inNovember), Malaysia (five members issuing), Thailand (working with ThaiFarmers' Bank and Thai Military Bank to acquire Interlink transactions,while four out of the top six banks already issue such cards), HongKong (three projects), Singapore (first full issuing and acquiringproject with UOB Bank) and Taiwan (four banks have signed up).

The task becomes even more tedious when one considersclient/server technology.Although significant cost savings may be available in automating anapplication on a client/server rather than a mainframe system, the costsavings may not be as pronounced when comparing mid-range systems toclient/servers. Many mid-range systems are priced to compete withlarger multi-workstation LANs (local area networks), and thedevelopment tools and the on-line security features available onmid-range systems may be more advanced than the client/servers.Similarly, fully-featured turnkey application software may be generallyavailable on a mid-range system, while client/server-based applicationsoftware may lack the functionality desired by larger financialinstitutions.Organisation-wide application systems are generally less attractivecandidates for downsizing to client/servers than departmentapplications. Departmental applications tend to have a limited numberof users and less sophisticated database and integration requirementsthan organisation-wide systems. Consequently, these systems can bemoved to client/server architecture with less risk and less potentialnegative impact on the organisation as a whole.Moving to a client/server architecture may not be a difficult process.Data extraction tools, file transfer tools, query languages,downloading and uploading tools, and PC interface products allcontribute to the cultural change necessary to implement client/servertechnology. The next step is providing graphical user interfaces to endusers so data can be represented in a more "user friendly" format -with charts, graphs and other pictorial representations.Some productivity gains may be found with client/server technology.Mainframe development time has long been the Achilles' heel ofmainframe computing - and the most significant reason for consideringplatform changes. Lengthy development time equates to high costs, unmetexpectations and dissatisfied end users. Client/server architectureoffers the advantage of quickly addressing minimum systems requirementand providing tools that can be implemented by the end user withlimited technical support involvement.Ideally, the use of client/server technology will help an organisationbetter utilise the equipment already in place. Most organisations havesignificant investments in personal computer-based systems, which areoften used for"resource sharing" - that is, local area networks set upto share hardware resources, which may be under-utilised in theclient/server context.Client/server architecture provides the capability for the front-endportion of major application to be processed on a LAN, while theback-end portion of the application can reside on the mainframe system.Each system should be dependent on the other for the transfer andcommunication of timely information, and together they should form theentire application system.US-based IT magazine Computerworld recently cited a survey by SentryMarket Research, which found 70 percent of IT shops predicting thatclient/server will ultimately be their primary computing model. InAsia, although no similar survey has been carried out, industrywatchers believe that within the next two to five years, large Asianbanks will start to deploy client/servers in the more mission criticaland higher volume back-office applications.While most client/server implementations have occurred in selectedapplications, organisations are now focused on moving mission critical,strategic applications towards client/server technology.As the market moves towards the new paradigm, there are many lessons tobe learned from earlier experiences with the technology. Earlierimplementators of client/server technology found that the costsinvolved far exceeded what was budgeted, especially labour, networkingand training bills. Worse, the expected benefits were hard to measureand quantify. Productivity and improved customer service wereattributes which were simply impossible to be put on the balance sheetand analyse.One of the prime movers behind client/servers technology has been thebusiness unit managers who have profit and loss responsibilities.Tasked and under pressure to realise ever increasing revenues andincome targets, these managers see client/server as the technologicalenabler that will bring about faster and more prolific productdevelopment, improved customer service and decreased costs.Client/server may or may not provide the tool that is needed to achievethese goals. However, the question can only be ultimately answered whensystems are fully deployed.The implementation of client/server systems may improve productivity ofthe organisation's non-technical resources as well as technicalresources. Client/server systems should provide tools for the end userfor data extraction, reporting and graphical interfaces. In some cases,both technical and non-technical personnel will have access to CASE(computer-aided software engineering) tools for developing andenhancing client/server applications.Although mainframe processing work load can be reduced throughclient/server technology, this is not the area of greatest benefit tothe organisation. Data integrity may be improved by providing anenvironment where information is created and maintained closer to theuser department responsible for information ownership. Through goodapplication controls, this information in detailed form can beavailable to many user departments, but controlled through securitypractices and procedures. Duplicate information and dispersedinformation, which may lack consistency and accuracy, could beminimised with proper design of the application.While client/server architecture offers some significant benefits tothe organisation, it also can have disadvantages. Applicationmaintenance when dealing with several platforms, data structure andprogramming languages could increase the complexity of the change.Consequently, CASE tools that embrace departmental and host processingrequirements are important to minimise ongoing support and maintenanceof client/server systems. In addition, the lack of standards forclient/server technology may reduce the consistency of applications.Ultimately, the lack of standards impacts the speed of modification andimplementation when application requirements need to change. Some defacto standards already exist in the industry, such as the UNIX orNovell operating systems for server operating software and SQL(structured query language) for interfacing and accessing variousdatabase systems. However, more specific standards may be needed forthe organisation to ensure proper control over the development andimplementation process. This can be achieved through a standardscommittee, which would be responsible for identifying standards for theorganisation.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

BONDSMoody's explains why it maintains foreign currency bank depositceilings that are distinct from foreign currency sovereign ceilingsIN OUR view, the two ratings (a foreign currency bank deposit ratingand a foreign currency sovereignity rating) are needed to reflectinherent differences in the credit risks of bank deposits versus bonds.As sovereign ceilings, both types of ratings are intended to accountfor foreign currency transfer risk - the risk that no matter howcreditworthy a given borrower domiciled in the nation may be, thatborrower always remains subject to transfer risks.On the basis of both empirical evidence and analytical considerations,we believe that foreign currency transfer risk applies somewhatdifferently to bonds and notes than it does to foreign currency bankdeposits, especially as we move down the ratings scale.Specifically, a review of worldwide sovereign default experience sinceWorld War II shows that when sovereign nations have defaulted on any oftheir foreign currency obligations (in our concept of default weinclude missed or delayed disbursement of interest and/or principal,and/or obligatory credit maintenance arrangements), they have been morelikely to default on bank deposits and commercial loans than onsovereign bonds or notes.Put differently, when sovereigns have come under sufficient financialstress to default on foreign commercial loans, if they have had anysignificant amount of foreign currency bank deposits, they have usuallyalso defaulted on these deposits -but not necessarily on theirsovereign bonds.In fact, we have concluded that the overall risk that a particularcountry will "reschedule" foreign currency deposits comes very close toequalling the overall risk that country will becoming involved in anytype of foreign currency debt rescheduling. The risk of a bond defaulthas been significantly lower.There are several key reasons for this. For one, the consequences ofdefaulting on (ie. rescheduling) bank deposits or loans has been morepredictable and potentially far less detrimental to a nation'sinterests than defaulting on bonds and notes. In addition, it is clearin international law that a foreign currency bank deposit is generallywithin the purview of the country where it is located. Thus, agovernment that forces a rescheduling of foreign currency bank depositsthrough changes in its foreign exchange policy is unlikely to face asuccessful legal challenge to its action from depositors.By contrast, given the erosion of the older concept of sovereignimmunity since World War II, the legal immunity of sovereign whodefaults on foreign currency bonds has become considerably moreproblematical than it once was.Increasingly, defaulting sovereigns will face determined legalchallenges from bond-holders armed and encouraged by such developmentsas the 1992 US Supreme Court case of Argentina v. Weltover, whichsanctioned an action brought against a sovereign borrower in a USCourt, Great Britain's State Immunity Act of 1978, which limited claimsof sovereign immunity, and the European Convention on SovereignImmunity which has also codified limits to claims of sovereignimmunity.Given this risk differential, we are likely to maintain foreigncurrency bank deposit ceilings that are in some cases lower than ourratings for sovereign bonds and notes, While these ratings will tend inpractice to be identical in the case of countries characterised by highcredit quality - due to small differences in the two risks forcountries at the higher end of the ratings scale - they may diverge inthe case of countries in the lower investment grade or below investmentgrade range.The conceptual frameworkIn order to establish foreign currency bank deposit ceilings that aredistinct from currency sovereign ceilings, several preliminary tasksare required, including: 1) an examination of what distinguishessovereign borrowers from other borrowers; 2) an empirical analysis ofsovereign default experience; and 3) an examination of implications ofthe changing legal and economic framework for sovereign borrowing.As indicated in this report, the legal framework surrounding sovereigndefault has evolved considerably since 1945.In the prewar period, countries enjoyed near-total immunity fromlawsuits. That is no longer true in the US, the UK, or throughout mostof Europe.A good way to start a technical discussion is to lay out firstprinciples. By now, although most investors have become comfortablewith the concept of foreign currency sovereign ceiling, it is stillalways worth defining our terms to avoid any misunderstanding.What is sovereignty?The first thing we should ask ourselves here is what is meant by"sovereign"? According to Webster's dictionary, the possession ofsovereignty means having "supreme power, especially over a body politicwhat distinguishes sovereign borrowers from all other creditors.The self-image of sovereign states, and the way that sovereign statesview each other, have changed in many important ways over thecenturies. During various periods in history, sovereignty has lain withvillages, towns, cities and tribes. At some points sovereignty becameassociated with entire empires. In the modern period, sovereignty hasbecome a property almost exclusively of the nation state, a relativelyrecent political development. Since nation states did not appearspontaneously, but rather emerged over time, it should not besurprising that the nature of nation-state sovereignty has evolved andmutated as circumstances have changed.Freedom from a higher authority is clearly an important characteristicof sovereignty. However, as we know from history, powerful states haveoften influenced events in weaker ones through military, economic,and/or diplomatic means.What appears to be relevant since 1945 is that military intervention byone state against another is no longer considered to be an acceptablemodus operandi, except for the gravest of reasons. Prior to 1945,nations often used military force for all sorts of reasons: colonialambitions, ideology, territorial expansion, etc. In some cases,countries resorted to military intervention to insure repayment offoreign debts.To realise how international convention has changed, one need onlyconsider that in today's world no one would ever propose militaryintervention to deal with a sovereign state that was unable to meet itsforeign currency obligations on a timely basis, in contrast to the 19thand early 20th centuries, when such measures were resorted to onseveral occasions.In recent decades we have seen the development of a greater respect fornational sovereignty. For instance, international boundaries are nowgenerally considered inviolate, as is a government's right tonon-interference in its domestic political affairs - except perhapswhen basic human rights are grossly threatened. Ironically, at the sametime, increased international co-operation has in practice tended toreduce actual expressions of sovereignty.Economic co-operation, economic integration, economic interdependenceall are creating a situation in which new limitations upon sovereigntyare evolving. A perfect example of this development is the developmentis the changing relationship between commercial law and sovereignstates.Any credit analysis must take into account not only a debtor's ability- but also its willingness - to repay. Determining a country's abilityto repay is in the end not very difficult task. In all but the mostextreme cases, countries have the ability to repay their debts.This may appear surprising to anyone who lived through the debit crisisof the 1980s, let alone the economic devastation of 1930s. But in fact,no matter what their economic status, countries usually have theresources needed to repay their debts. However, as John Moody pointedin 1933, when discussing depression-era sovereign defaults, "Many[sovereigns] were confronted with the choice between suspension of debtservices or almost complete elimination of imports." As he noted,import reduction could only be taken so far. If imports declined beyonda certain point, governments faced the possibility of politicalunrest.[1] The real question is - what level of resource mobilisationare governments willing to undertake in order to repay their debts? Inthe end, willingness to repay is the key to sovereign credit analysis.And here we do not mean merely the desire to repay, but rather thedesire coupled with willingness to bear the consequences of repayment.Governments may not like the economic and/or political consequences ofpolicies which would enable them to meet payments on their debts. Thereis often a kind of conventional wisdom regarding the degree ofsacrifice which should be required in order for a sovereign to remaincurrent. In the final analysis, the nature of the "willingness issue"is what distinguishes commercial from sovereign borrowers.If a commercial borrower lacks willingness, legal sanctions up to andincluding asset seizure and liquidation are available to creditors.However, in cases where sovereign borrowers refused to pay - or as ismore likely the case, refuse to repay according to original terms -they are immune from most of the legal sanctions available to creditorsvis-a-vis non-sovereign borrowers. Obviously, sovereign borrowerscannot be forced into bankruptcy.Until recently, foreign sovereign borrowers could not even be broughtinto court in the world's major financial centres. Even now, attachingsovereign assets is seldom seen as a viable option. Fortunately forcreditors, however, other less drastic sanctions, which will bediscussed below, appear to preclude frivolous sovereign defaults.More importantly, there are many incentives for sovereigns to maintaintheir creditworthiness. For instance, a creditworthy sovereign borrowerhas much lower borrowing costs than one which has a poor credithistory. Economic conditions which contribute to sovereigncreditworthiness are also often associated with more rapid economicgrowth. The more rapid the rise in income, generally the happier is anational body politic. Unless subject to considerable stress, sovereignborrowers clearly would prefer to meet their financial obligations on atimely basis.Sovereign ceilingsSovereign ceilings for bonds and notes represent the highest foreigncurrency rating an issuer might have where the obligor is subject tothe sovereignty of a particular government. Such ratings are based uponthe default risk for medium and/or long-term debt obligations issued bya national government (denominated in a foreign currency), either inits own name or with a guarantee. Put differently, it represents the"foreign currency transfer risk" associated with investing in aparticular country.In cases where there is no particular debt obligation outstanding, asovereign ceiling rating could still be issued based on an assessmentof risk posed by a national government if it were to issue a foreigncurrency obligation.We consider such obligations to represent the lowest foreign currencydefault risk within a country. The reason: a national government,through its ability to mobilise foreign currency assets within its owndomain, has almost by definition the best ability to obtain foreignexchange of any issuer within the country. For instance, governmentsmay, and often have, imposed foreign exchange controls. Governmentsmay, and often have, instituted foreign currency deposit regulationsaimed at capturing foreign exchange within the country. The toolsavailable to a government to gain access to foreign exchange are wellestablished and clearly recognised under international law.Private issuers often have argued that their obligations posed a lowerrisk than those of their own government in this regard because of theirspecial circumstances. Although we always explore each case on anindividual basis, in the end, if the issuer is subject to the law ofits home government, even if its activities are mainly undertakenoutside the home country, we have found that the issuer is in factstill subject to the foreign currency sovereign ceiling. The foreigncurrency sovereign ceiling does not necessarily represent the risk ofthe establishment of exchange controls.Nor does it necessarily represent the risk of rescheduling bank loans.Rather, it represents simply the assessment of default risk on mediumand long-term debt foreign currency marketable debt obligations ofnational governments, which in our view carry, in almost allcircumstances, the lowest foreign currency default risk in thatparticular country.Sovereign ceilings for foreign currency bank deposits represent thedefault risk of: 1) foreign currency- denominated bank deposits heldwithin a country; 2) deposits with a branch of a foreign bank locatedin the particular country; 3) deposits with a foreign branch of a bankdomiciled in that country. A foreign currency bank deposit in anyforeign-currency-denominated deposit (eg. in Mexico, any depositdenominated in any currency except the peso) in any domestic bank orforeign bank branch located in the country. (A foreign currency depositheld with Citibank's Mexico City branch office would be subject to theMexican foreign currency bank deposit ceiling.)It also includes any foreign-currency denominated deposits in foreignbranches of the country's banks. A Japanese yen deposit in the New Yorkbranch of a Mexican bank would be subject to default risk posed eitherby US or Mexican government.But since the bank is subject to the laws of its home country, in thiscase Mexican, any legal actions taken by the Mexican government mayhave an impact upon the bank's ability to meet its foreign currencyobligations anywhere in the world, despite the deposit being located inthe US. Therefore, the Mexico foreign currency bank deposit ceilingwould apply, despite the deposit's US location.Looked at from a different angle, since the Mexican bank's foreigncurrency deposit rating is limited by the Mexican sovereign ceiling forthe bank deposits, the ratings on deposits by Mexican financialinstitutions anywhere in the world are limited by the rating of foreigncurrency deposits of the bank in its home country.A default on a foreign currency bank deposit would be judged to occurif the government mandated credit maintenance facilities, which meansthat if any depositor withdraws a deposit, the depositor mustimmediately redeposit/relend the same amount as was withdrawn (eg. arequirement whereby a maturing certificate or CD must be replaced bythe purchase of new CD or provide other credit equal to the amount ofmaturing CD).What do we mean by "default"?Moody's defines default as any missed or delayed disbursement ofinterest and/or principal. We include as defaults distressed exchangeswhere: (1) the issuer offers bondholders of depositors a new securityof package of securities the amount to a diminished financialobligation (such as preferred or common stock, debt with a lower couponor par amount, or less liquid deposit either because of a change inmaturity or currency of denomination, or required credit maintenancefacilities) and (2) the exchange has the apparent purpose of helpingthe borrower avoid default.Moody's also classifies as a default when an issuer delays payment evenwhen payment is ultimately made within the grace period provided for inan indenture or deposit agreement. Our rationale for including graceperiod defaults is simply that a contractual payment was not made whendue.It is important to keep this definition in mind, because manycommentators use"default" in a much narrower sense, that is, in thelegal context of creditor actually declaring a debtor in default on aparticular obligation, resulting in a judgment by a court in favour ofthe creditor.Anyone who examines the post-World War II period will quickly recognisethe significant practical difference between what we mean by defaultand what a judge might determine to be a default in a legal proceeding.This analysis will provide some explanations of why creditors, inrecent year, have not declared sovereign debtors in default, even whenthese same sovereigns would have been considered in default using ourcriteria.Empirical evidenceSince the debt crisis of the 1980s, there has been a tremendousresurgence of interest in pre-World War II sovereign defaults. This iscertainly understandable, for analysing the past is always useful inproviding insights into possible future developments. Now that we haveonce again entered a period where sovereign borrowers - in particularmost of the world's significant developing countries - have returned tointernational bond markets in a big way, many observers see the threatof a repeat of the sovereign defaults of the 1930s as an object lessonfor what might lie ahead for creditors.Others see the experience of the 1980s, where sovereign defaults onbonds or other publicly traded securities were relatively rare, as aclear indication that such sovereign securities are now substantiallyimmune from default risk. When we examine the history of both theprewar period and the debt crisis of the 1980s in the light of thestructural changes which have occurred in the financial and legalframework of international capital markets since 1945, a much morecomplex picture emerges. (Editor's Note: Due to space constraint, weare unable to publish the full and interesting examination of thehistory of defaults, but subscribers may request for a full version ofthis comment.)Although in 1980 official creditors still supplied a greater amount ofcredit than commercial banks or bond markets did, the marginal increasein lending in the decade was dramatically higher for commercial banks -from about 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 40 percent in 1980 - thanfor official creditors. The increase in the relative importance ofbonds as a source of funds for the LDC's was modest.The Debt CrisisMexico's debt moratorium began a period where defaulting on sovereigndebt to commercial creditors became a rather commonplace occurrenceboth in the developing world and among the socialist or formersocialist countries, with over the years, several hundred billiondollars worth of credits falling into default.This was due to a combination of economic pressures, including adisinflationary commodity price environment, credit quality problemsemerging in the domestic markets of the major creditor nations (eg. thesavings and load industry's restructuring due to a changing interestrate and regulatory environment in the US), and the emergence ofeconomic bottlenecks in the more advanced socialist economies. Alltold, approximately 50 countries have defaulted on their sovereign andcommercial obligations since August 1982 (vs. 27 countries from 1960 to1982). Many of these countries have had to reschedule more than once.During this time period, we have also seen reschedulings of previouslyrescheduled debt. A number of countries have had a portion of theirdebt forgiven by commercial creditors in recent year. A similar patternemerges when examining official credits.One category of debt which seemed, according to many, to have escapeddefault during the crisis of the 1980s was bonds or other marketablesecurity debt. Unfortunately, on closer examination, this does notprove to be the case - at least not to the degree generally believed.Beyond the Costa Rican, Polish, and Rhodesian (Zimbabwe) defaults,which predate August 1982, after a careful search into the records, wehave found that six additional countries defaulted on foreign currency,marketable securities debt.Changes in the Legal Framework since WWIIWhile changes have been occurring in the structure of world financialmarkets, other important changes have also been taking place whichimpact the whole question of sovereign risk. One of the most importantchanges has been the growth of restrictions on appeals to sovereignimmunity.This development, on the surface, seems counterintuitive, especiallyduring a period when nation-states have increasingly tried to respectthe right of other nation-states. The reasons are quitestraightforward.If sovereign immunity were absolute, then any contract with a companywholly-owned by a foreign government would be unenforceable in a court.This was not only the disadvantage of the non-sovereign participant toa contract, but also would put publicly-owned companies at adisadvantage in international trade. The risk of entering intocontracts with them would be too great in many instances.Therefore, it was to the advantage of both sovereign-owned firms andnon-sovereign firms for sovereign-owned companies not to be consideredfully protected by appeals to sovereign immunity So for the first time,sovereign states had a vested interest in seeing their own sovereignimmunity curtailed in order that their newly acquiredcommercial/industrial activities might prosper.As time passed, more and more activities were felt to be outside thetraditional sovereign immunity sphere. Although these developmentsbegan to emerge gradually through individual legal decisions, some ofthese changes became codified in the US in the Sovereign Immunities Actof 1976, and in the UK in the State Immunity Act of 1978, and byinternational agreement in the European Convention on State Immunity.Despite these relatively recent attempts to codify sovereign immunityquestions, major points of contention still remain, resulting, as onewould expect in this increasingly litigious world, in various lawsuits,some of which helped illuminate certain aspects of the remainingproblems.Medium and Long-Term Debt of the LDC's [12] US$ BillionsOwed to:             1970 (% of total)   1980 (% of total)Official Creditors   32.1   (84.9)       182.7   (53.5)Commercial Banks      3.8   (10.1)       139.5   (40.9)Bond Markets          1.9    (5.0)        19.1    (5.6)                     37.8  (100.0)       341.3  (100.0)Default Experience, 1960-1982Although most observers would not characterise this period asparticularly turbulent in terms of sovereign defaults, on carefulexamination one finds more defaults than conventional wisdom wouldseem to indicate.Debt to official creditors:  During this period, at least 22countries defaulted on debt to official creditors. (As pointed outearlier our definition of default includes reschedulings.)Countries Which Defaulted On Official Creditor Debt,1960-August 1982ArgentinaPakistanBrazilPeruCentral African RepublicPolandChileRomaniaGabonSenegalGhanaSierra LeoneIndiaSudanIndonesiaTogoLiberiaTurkeyMadagascarUgandaNicaraguaZaireCommercial Bank Debt: During this same time period, at least 17countries defaulted on debt owed to commercial banks. There is noevidence that any of these other countries were ever legallydeclared "in default" by a court of law, with one exception. In 1979a major New York bank declared Iran in default and succeeded insetting off deposits against the unpaid loan.[13] This defaultoccurred as a result of sanctions being placed against Iran. Theissue was later settled by negotiation.Countries Which Defaulted On Foreign Currency Marketable Securities1970-1990ArgentinaCosta RicaGuatemalaNigeriaPanamaPolandRhodesia (Zimbabwe)UruguayYugoslaviaArgentina defaulted on bonds (bonods). Guatemala restructured itsstabilisation bond debt. Nigeria defaulted on government-guaranteedpromissory notes. Panama defaulted on both bonds and floating ratenotes. Uruguay defaulted on bearer treasury bonds. Yugoslaviadefaulted on short-term bonds. Therefore, although it is clear thatsince the 1970s, at least, marketable security debt has defaultedless the risk of default of sovereign marketable security debt isnegligible.Countries Which Defaulted On Commercial Bank Debt 1960-August 1982ArgentinaPoland*BoliviaRhodesia*Costa Rica*RomaniaIranSenegalLiberiaSudanMadagascarTogoNicaraguaTurkeyPeruZairePhilippines* Also defaulted on bonds or notes.Bonds and Notes: It was much rarer for governments to default onforeign-currency-denominated bonds or notes between 1960 and August1982. But it did happen. Specifically, Costa Rica, Poland andRhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) all defaulted on international bondsand/or notes. We have found no evidence that either Costa Rica orPoland were legally declared in default on marketable securitiesalthough it has been reported that creditors did go to court inSwitzerland to try to remedy a default by Bank Handlowy (Poland'sofficial foreign trade bank).[14] It is not clear from our search ofthe published records whether there was ever a formal defaultjudgment made against Rhodesia. Rhodesia's default is easilyexplained by the civil war and the burden of internationalsanctions. Costa Rica and Poland's defaults were related to economic/political developments within both countries. Altogether, then,from 1960 to 1982, at least 22 countries defaulted/rescheduledagainst official creditors, 17 countries against commercial banks,with just three defaulting on marketable securities. However, theaggregate amount of credit involved, however, although difficult tomeasure from public sources, was nonetheless small enough so thatthe international financial system was in no way threatened by anyof these defaults/reschedulings. But once Mexico announced itspayments moratorium in August 1982, sovereign credits entered a newphase.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrearstotaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; andit is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the seniornotes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.        Although the document states that an objective is to complete thetransaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "prettytight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completionof any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment ofpending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is thecity's advisor.        A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pendinglegislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city asthe lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes whensomeone falls behind on his property taxes.        The proposed issue will be backed by the higher quality tax liens,mostly commercial real estate with a high likelihood of repayment.        According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizationswill accomplish four things: to increase the cash flow from delinquent taxliens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need forthe city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.        "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficientmethod to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure processthe City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restorefairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improvecollection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieveupward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term saleprogram will be the initial securitization," the request for proposalsstates.Choosing Bankers        The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike atraditional private placement, it will be fully underwritten by theinvestment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital willbe funneled into the city's operations fund.The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was last Friday,and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about two weeks.        The document asks bankers to describe their experience implementingnew products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list of those withspecific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.        Most recently, Smith Barney priced a $19 million issue for the Cityof New Haven, Conn., in the fall. Chemical Securities worked on New YorkCity's securitization of cash flows from delinquent tax liens a couple ofyears ago and CS First Boston has structured deals for Jersey City.--Michael SiskBack to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LATIN AMERICAN ABS SEEN STABILIZING AFTER SURGE IN '95Securitization of future cash flows in Latin America hit an all-time high last year of  almost $3 billion. Although securitization offuture receivables may post a moderate gain in 1996, the market is unlikelyto see the same level of expansion, industry sources said last week.        Duff & Phelps estimates that around $2.8 billion in new future flowtransactions were issued last year, up from around $1.5 billion theprevious year.        "1995 was an extraordinary year," said Michael Moran, assistantvice president. "It won't be that good this year, but we're projectingmoderate growth," he added. New issuers will learn about securitizationthanks to high profile deals from companies like YPF, Moran said. Andinvestment bankers searching for new business in Latin America willcultivate securitized transactions, resulting in slightly greater volumethis year.        Investment bankers note, however, that securitized volume is alwaysdependent on the Eurobond market. If Latin American issuers have access tothat market, many find it more economical.        Following the Mexican peso crisis at the end of 1994, LatinAmerican issuers were essentially shut out of the Euromarket andsecuritized volume grew dramatically as a result in 1995.        This year, the door to the Euromarket may open a crack, noted onebanker active in securitization. Indeed, Mexico already tapped that sectorwith a DM 1 billion bond two weeks ago which was reportedly well-received.        "As conditions improve in the Eurobond market, future receivablesecuritization will inevitably decline," the banker said. But Mexico isstill perceived as risky overall, with BB ratings from Duff & Phelps andStandard & Poor's. "Mexican issuers will still use securitization," hepredicted.        Ultimately, as countries in Latin America reach investment grade,they will switch altogether to Eurobonds from future cash flow deals. Atthat time, these countries will probably be ready to develop their owndomestic asset-backed markets.        However, "this could be a ten-year process," one banker said, andthere may be several more cycles for future flow securitizations in thecoming years as a result.Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996INVESTORS BULLISH ON ABS PROSPECTS IN '96Despite the general tightening of spreads in 1995, fixed-incomeinvestors are inclined to increase their allocations to asset-backedsecurities in the year ahead, according to preliminary results from asurvey conducted by Asset Sales Report and MBIA Insurance Corp.  Finaltallies will be presented next week at the American Banker/Asset SalesReport 11th Annual Asset Securitization Conference in Naples, Fla.        Of the 13 institutional investors responding, 11 said they areready to put still more money into ABS even though 10 of the 13 believethat spreads will at best remain near current levels and could widen out in1996. Only one institution expected to cut its allocation to ABS and onesaid that it was unsure at this point whether it would increase or decreaseits commitment to the area.        Despite near unanimity about their commitment to ABS, investorswere clearly more ambivalent about the prospects for interest rates and theeconomy. Of the 13 respondents, seven predicted higher long-term Treasuryrates and six projected a drop.        An averaged forecast from the group would put the long Treasuryrate at about 6.18% at year-end 1996, or almost exactly where it was atlast Wednesday's close. At the time the first surveys were distributed inlate November, the long Treasury yield was at 6.30%.        Similarly,  seven expected that GDP will rise in 1996 while sixforesaw a decline. An averaged growth forecast from the 13  put GDP at again of just under 1% in 1996. There were no projections at either the highgrowth (above 4%) or sharp decline (-4%) ends of the spectrum.        Among the new asset classes that investors showed some interest inwere home improvement loans and subprime auto loan-backed securities. Ineach case, more investors indicated that they would buy the securities in1996 than actually did participate in 1995.        Other areas mentioned were securities backed by 12b-1 feesgenerated by mutual funds and franchise-backed securities. Asset classesthat elicited caution from the investor group included timeshares, futurereceivables, subprime auto loans (appearing on both lists) and LatinAmerican securitizations. In each case, more than three investors said thatthey would not consider participating in these kinds of deals.        Although not listed as a choice in the survey, three investorswrote in to say they would not consider healthcare receivable-backed issuesin the year ahead, possibly owing to the well-publicized fraud in Towers'deals two years ago as well as the complexity of the asset itself.        Overall, however, investors expect to see even more asset-backedsupply in the year ahead. All 13 respondents said they expect at least $100billion in new issuance this year, while 10 said that volume should exceed$110 billion. Two even projected that issuance would top the $130 billionmark. Interestingly, the investors as a group were more bullish on thisyear's issuance level than investment bankers.        Final details on investors' and others' forecasts for 1996 marketwill appear in next week's issue of ASR.Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FIRST CREDIT CARD ISSUES ENJOY SMOOTH RECEPTIONThree credit card issuers broke the ice in 1996, issuing around$2.5 billion in new securities last week. All of the deals benefited frompent-up investor demand including the first zero coupon asset-backed bondfrom Citibank.        Advanta's $466 million deal was fully sold just after pricing,reportedly purchased with new cash, while Discover's transaction wasupsized by 100% to $1 billion.        In each case, the deals were structured to appeal to more than onesector of the asset-backed market or to bring in new investors entirely.        Citibank's novel transaction was priced late Thursday through leadmanager Goldman Sachs at 37 bps over Treasury strip of February 2001 andwas quoted at around 37-38 bps over the five-year Treasury bond--on top offive-year credit card securities. Priced at a discount of 74.817237, thebonds yield 5.861%.        The offering attracted around a dozen new investors to the asset-backed market, mainly zero coupon buyers, traders said. "The interestingthing is that this is probably the most liquid zero coupon paper in thatmarket," one syndicate official noted. The 6% subordinate tranche, also azero, was priced 15 bps behind the senior securities by lead managerMerrill Lynch. (Full structure and pricing details will follow next week.)        On Wednesday, Discover basked in the limelight with a five-yearfloater; the issuer tapped into two investor bases, according to anofficial at lead manager Dean Witter. Five-years is short enough for U.S.buyers and although European buyers tend to buy longer-term securities, theDiscover bonds appealed to this sector as well, he noted.        "We put in a $500 million deal and went to $1 billion withoutgiving up anything on the pricing," the official said. It was priced at parwith a coupon of 17 basis points over Libor, and once freed to trade, wasbid there.        At the same time, Salomon Brothers sold two seven-year seniorclasses for Advanta, one fixed and one floating-rate, using a structurealmost identical to the issuer's five-year Series 1995-F in November,except for the maturity and the higher credit enhancement level.        The combined fixed and floating-rate structure "allows us to tapinto two different investor bases," explained Mike Coco, director of creditcard securitization at Advanta. Issuing a fixed-rate bond was especiallyattractive with interest rates so low, he added.        The enhancement level was 100 bps higher than Series 1995-F becauseof the longer maturity. Standard & Poor's "raises the enhancement level forcredit card securities with terms longer than five years," explained RayGalkowski, head of the credit card ratings group at S&P. Although he didnot comment on the Advanta deal specifically, Galkowski said the ratingagency holds that there is an increase in risk the longer the maturity, andthat the five-year term marks a natural dividing point.        The additional support was all within the collateral interest whichwas rated BBB by Fitch Investors Service. Because Fitch did not requiremore enhancement for the longer maturity on the deal, it assigned a higherrating of A+ to the subordinate tranche, according to analyst Mike Dean.        Coco anticipated that Advanta's volume for 1996 would be close tolast year's level of $3 billion.Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FASIT CAUGHT IN BUDGET QUAGMIREAs the U.S. budget talks continue, the fate of the Financial AssetSecuritization Investment Trust (FASIT) is hanging in the balance. Whileproponents are optimistic, inclusion of the FASIT in the final legislationis not ensured.        "We're caught in the political crossfire," said Donald B. Susswein,partner at Thacher, Profitt & Wood, who worked on the proposal. The FASITwould extend many of the benefits of the REMIC to non-mortgage assets andwas first proposed as legislation two years ago.        Dampening its chances for passage with the budget package, theFASIT proposal was placed on the Clinton administration's list of"objectionable special interest" provisions in the Budget late last month.However, nine Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committeeresponded quickly with a letter to White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta,arguing the merits of the FASIT proposal.        "In testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, Treasurystated that it did not oppose the FASIT legislation," the letter states."Treasury and the Administration have also consistently supported assetsecuritization, included in the context of the Community Development Bankbill." In addition, it concludes, "FASIT is also a revenue raiser."Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996COMMENTS TO FASB FOCUS ON REPOSAs the deadline to comment on FASB's exposure draft onsecuritization draws near, the Board has received about 25 comments, mostlypertaining to repurchase agreements and requesting to testify at a publichearing in February.        Comments on the proposal, "Accounting for Transfers of FinancialAssets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," are due January 22.        According to the commments received, the new rule woulddramatically limit banks' use of repurchase agreements, a major source offunding, especially in light of the Board's recent tightening of financialaccounting standard 115.        The exposure draft was issued around the same time that FASBprovided banks a window to transfer securities currently classified as heldto maturity into the available-for-sale category without a penalty. Thewindow of opportunity in FAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments inDebt and Equity Securities," closed at the end of 1995, after which suchtransfers are prohibited.        As a result, a number of banking institutions put longer-term reposinto the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealized gains and lossesneedn't be marked to market. However, the proposed statement would requireany repos with a maturity of three months or more to recorded as a sale,and hence marked to market. Banks would thereby be limited to using reposwith maturities of less than three months to avoid increasing volatility intheir capital bases, and any longer transactions existing when the rulecomes into effect would suddenly have to appear in the income statement.FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit on repos is a periodthat was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because the Board believed thatthe vast majority of repo transactions held far shorter maturities. "We'vesince learned that there are more transactions with durations around threemonths than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, the project manager at FASB.The Board will likely reconsider the three-month limit as it continues itsdeliberations.Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CITIBANK'S MASTER TRUST RENAMEDCitibank changed the name of its master trust last week to CitibankCredit Card Master Trust I as part of an effort at the bank to increasename recognition        Since 1991, the trust was known as Standard Credit Card MasterTrust I.

Despite expectations for increased supply, spreads in thesecondary market held ground, with floating-rate securities enjoyingrenewed demand.        "Once the trigger is pulled on the first deal, others will followquickly," said one rating agency analyst. Indeed, three credit card dealswere priced last week in quick succession: Discover, Advanta, and Citibank.        Despite the addition of $1 billion in new five-year floaters fromDiscover, floaters remained well-bid. The deal was priced "aggressively" at17 basis points over Libor and held at that level once it was free to tradelast week, one investment banker noted.        In general, floaters looked inexpensive compared with fixed-ratebonds on a swap basis, and as a result, dealers and investors were takingadvantage of the opportunity last week, traders said.        Fixed-rate securities suffered neglect as a result of thatopportunity. In addition, one trader said that "investors are apathetic toTreasuries right now and the market in general is backing off."        The five-year, fixed-rate sector, which suffered from oversupply inthe fourth quarter and widened a few basis points as a result, was holdingat around 37 bps to 38 bps over Treasuries.        Advanta's seven-year fixed-rate deal, totaling $220 million, waspriced at 46 bps over Treasury, but was softer when freed to trade, sourcessaid. With interest rates so low, investors were apparently not overlyenthused with longer-term, fixed-rate securities; the floating-rate portionof the Advanta deal went very well, traders agreed.        Home equity loan securities, which had also widened significantlyduring the fourth quarter, tightened at the end of the year and have held,said one trader. Three-year pass-through securities were quoted at between105 bps and 115 bps over Treasury depending on the specific issuer. Three-year tranched paper was quoted at around 85-90 bps.Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CREDIT CARD ABS WEAKER: MOODY'SDelinquencies on securitized credit card portfolios rose in Octoberto 4.23% from 4.17% in September.

The Bensalem, Penn. based outfit reached a definitive agreementlast month with Congress Financial Corp.  whereby  Congress will provideCharming with a $157 million asset-based working capital facility for aterm of 2.5 years.        Under this arrangement, Charming has successfully restructured $83million of bank debt with existing lenders and substantially extended thetypical 90-day letter of credit.        Recently estimated with a spread over 80bp for a 3-year term,Jablansky says the ABS is now "priced at a level that still heavily weightsthe likelihood of a bankruptcy--and a subsequent early amortization event--during the next 18 months."        Other analysts are not so sure. "It may be compelling, but I'd haveto see a lot of evidence to be convinced," said one source.        "At this point I'd say it continues to be an outlier, pretty hairyand likely to underperform."        In the first nine months of 1995, Charming experienced a comparablesales decline of 22% in its nationwide chain of Fashion Bug and Fashion BugPlus women's clothing stores as rumors of its fiscal troubles drove spreads40-50 bp wide on its single public credit card securitization.        With the new financing agreement, the retailer is "virtuallyassured" of remaining solvent through the offering's maturity, optimisticsources said.        Jablansky adds: "The likelihood (of insolvency) is arguably nogreater than that of other retailers, whose credit card ABS trade atsignificantly tighter spreads...the actual probabilities of any of theseearly amortization scenarios are well below our arbitrary assumption of50%."        Any potential divergence from this forecast, Jablansky argues,would stem from the fact that "the holiday season was not good forretailers overall.        The performance of the retail sector as it influences the bondmarket is something Charming Shoppes will have to face as would any otherretailer."Back to Headline List CopyrightASSET SALES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NOMURA'S TRAIN DEAL CLOSELY WATCHED AS EURO PIPELINE BUILDSOverseas securitization engines were sputtering back to life last weekafter the traditional new year's lull.  While the flow of deals is expectedto be thin this early in the new quarter and year, a number of deals areheard to be in the pipeline for later months.        The deal garnering the most interest from securitization desks hasbeen Nomura's zero coupon train lease deal. Expected to receive triple-Aratings from Duff & Phelps, the deal totals about $726 million (ASR12/4/96). The transaction is expected to price this week, but participantswere reluctant to discuss details since it carries a private Rule 144atranche for sale in the United States.        The structure of the deal creates securities from a series of smallgovernment payments of about $9 million each over 98 months. Thosepayments, essentially a series of bullets, are to be bought by investorswho will then typically find their own swap counterparties to gain floatingfunding. Securitization experts expressed concern that the deal's failureto include an internal swap counterparty would lead to illiquidity.        Syndicate desks will be eyeing the 144a structure of the deal inthe coming months with a view toward the larger potential rail leasemarkets in Britain and elsewhere.Goldman Loses Three ABS Pros        The struggle for mandates this early in the season has led to somekey horseraces between premier U.K. desks. The Bank of Kuwait was set toaward its mandate late last week for a second deal. The first from Kuwaitoccurred last year, as Goldman Sachs led a deal which was relatively wellreceived. This time around, Goldman appears to have had some competitors.Chief among them was Lehman Brothers, whose proposal appeared to be in therunning.        The chief reasons for Goldman's failure to win the mandate outrightappeared to be its slew of departures in recent weeks, capped by thisweek's news that the head of securitization John Van Deventer had left. VanDeventer's destination is not known, though it appears he will not bejoining another big firm. Van Deventer's departure, coupled with those oftwo junior analysts last week, added to the perception that Goldman'sresources have been depleted. Executive director Roger Barris will assumeVan Deventer's responsibilities.        The UBK deal itself will be sized at about $100 million poundssterling. It will be a floater, with collateral similar to the last deal.The deal will securitize over 35 commercial mortgages on investmentproperties.Scandinavia Active        Elsewhere, Lehman has won the mandate for another securitizationfrom Sweden.  A consortium representing a large group of Swedish municipalhousing firms has been working with Lehman to establish a conduit-likestructure for future deals. Lehman's Jim Clark, who heads up the assetsecuritization group, was in Sweden last week to discuss the plans. A dealfor a municipal housing firm outside Stockholm is slated for this summer.        A second St. Eric transaction is also heard to be on the horizon.This time around, only one of the three housing firms which participated inthe first transaction will be involved.  Collateral for the deal will belimited to the one loan for the housing firm Svenska Bostader on a numberof housing projects. ABN Amro will return to lead the transaction.Back to Headline List WT02-B38-3IA086-000616-B019-385http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi48.html 205.156.212.5 19970122004411 text/html 35023HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:42:07 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:16 GMTContent-length: 34836Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi48.html Sample Issue Copyright BANK AUTOMATION NEWS via NewsNet JANUARY 24, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES THE YEAR AHEAD RETAIL DELIVERY WILL COST YOU IN 1996 (1128 words) STRATEGIES TIPS FOR CONTRACTING TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE (1107 words) MARKETPLACE PROFILE: NETWORK PLATFORM PROVIDER SYNC LINKING LEGACY NETWORKS TO CLIENT-SERVER (502 words) BANK AUTOMATION NEWS BRIEFS BISYS AND BOTTOMLINE PARTNER (102 words) BANK AUTOMATION ON COURSE (69 words) BANK OF AMERICA PICKS ISSC (72 words) BANK OF GRAY AND PROVESA ALLY (81 words) BANK CENTRAL ASIA MOVES TO M&I (69 words) PEOPLE...

But don't expect these channelsto produce profits any time soon.     Almost half of the largest U.S. banks and one-third of thecountry's mid-size banks are operating electronic banking programs ata loss.  The majority cannot determine profitability, the AmericanBankers Association (ABA) said in its "1995 Retail Banking SurveyReport."     The losses were attributed to up-front development costs, whichlikely will continue throughout 1996 as new retail delivery channelsgain consumer acceptance, the report said.     Also in 1996, consultants predict:     *   continued slow adoption of client-server        applications;     *   the call center will become a focal        point of the customer relationship and a        major sales and marketing tool; and      *   continued merging in the bank and vendor markets.Drawbacks of the RDS Boom     Development costs likely will put banks in the red as they try tooffer alternative delivery channels to their customers, consultantssay.  Developing online banking and in-bank connection software isexpensive.  It can cost $300,000 just to get into the newest retaildelivery systems, such as personal computer (PC) home banking andInternet transactions.     In most cases, banks can use some of their existing hardware tooffer new retail delivery channels.  But most of the new applicationsare client-server-based, and the legacy systems cannot provide accessto information in an interactive environment, said David Taylor,executive vice president at the Bank Administration Institute (BAI) inChicago.     These programs must interface with existing business systems,mainframes and each other, said Bob Landry, technology analyst withthe Tower Group in Wellesley, Mass.     Building these platforms so that they can talk to each othermight be expensive but this should be a priority so that banks canmove forward with seamless marketing and accounting efforts, Landrysaid.Security Issues     You need to pay attention to three key security issues as yourbank implements new technology to compete in the retail deliverysystems market, says BAI's 1995 study:  "The Information Superhighwayand Retail Banking:"    *   Authentication.  Can you identify the party requesting a    transaction?    *   Authorization.  If the party is identified, how will the size    and nature of the requested transaction be approved?    *   Security and encryption.  Can you prevent third parties from    improperly accessing private transaction data, such as credit    card numbers? The Client-Server Dilemma    Unexpected implementation and activation problems with client-server technology is adding development and networking problems,analysts told BAN.  It was touted as the technology that could savebanks up to 15 percent in systems development and management costs. But implementation problems have delayed activation and created theneed for extra personnel.    At many banks, expenses related to implementation issues ate upanticipated savings quickly, said David Koto, principal with Brintechin New Smyrna Beach, Fla.  "No savings have been realized yet," hesaid.    But vendors are plugging away with client-server introductions(BAN, Oct. 18, p. 1).  Five companies showed new client-server-basedcore accounting systems at the MicroBanker Expo last year.    An informal BAN poll of about a dozen users and consultants atthe expo revealed that Eastpoint Technologies of Bedford, N.H., andPerot Systems of Dallas are the companies to watch in 1996.    Phoenix International of Maitland, Fla., also is considered oneof the most innovative client-server vendors (BAN, Aug. 9, p. 1), butit has not sold its Retail Banking System outside of the circle ofinstitutions that initially invested in the company.The Growing Importance of Call Centers    Call centers are becoming critical to banks, financialinstitutions and other service-oriented businesses as they work tokeep existing customers, expand their business and save money,consultants said (BAN, Sept. 20, p. 4).  You would be well-advised toupgrade your own call center this year to keep pace with yourcompetitors, consultants said.    Banks selling mature products, such as credit card services, arefinding that keeping existing customers is as important as gaining newones and that having a sophisticated call center is one way ofensuring this happens.  Plus, the call center provides an opportunityto offer both customer service and telemarketing in one swoop.  Savvybanks are using well-trained employees to turn customer servicerequests into opportunities to sell additional products.      Consultants predict the telephone will emerge as a major sellingtool this year.  Merrill Lynch & Co. has 400 branches, $500 billion inassets and a national telephone support system.  "There's a tremendousfocus on call centers" to reduce staff and create better sellingenvironments, Landry added.    Additionally, telephones likely will emerge as the method foraccount creation and verification, says Richard Crone, senior vicepresident at the $50 billion-asset Home Savings of America ofIrwindale, Calif.  Customers may not be going into the branch as muchbut they still need their questions answered.     The emerging importance of having a well-rounded call centerspells growing opportunity for vendors.  For example, Customer Accessof Raleigh, N.C., claims it can manage a bank's call center at asavings of about 20 percent.  The outsourcer was founded in July 1993by four former Citibank managers.  It has two large bank customers inNorth Carolina and plans to open additional offices in other areas ofthe country this year (BAN, Oct. 4, p. 6).    Outsourcing call center management will be attractive to smallerbanks.  But banks also run the risk of losing the bank's customerservice "personality," said Jeff DiFrancesco, with New York-basedPrice Waterhouse.Outsourcing Takes Off    Expect outsourcing to continue its growth in popularity as banksrealize they can't absorb expenses associated with operatingprocessing centers or developing technology, consultants also tell BAN(see related story, p. 4).  Some of the largest outsourcing contractswere signed last year.  Chase Manhattan Bank signed Milwaukee-basedFIserv to a 12-year contract for check processing and check-imagingworth $480 million.  That contract is guaranteed until 1997, but maybe in jeopardy as Chase merges with Chemical Bank, also of New York.    Bank managers are beginning to trust outsourcing more as theywatch these large successful contracts fulfilled, said Arthur Gillisof Computer Based Solutions in New Orleans.  Expect this trend tocontinue in 1996, he said.    It would be surprising if more outsourcing companies merge or goout of business because the most profitable outsourcers are thelargest, Gillis said.    Bank and vendor mergers also are expected to continue in 1996. Columbus, Ohio-based Checkfree, a check processor, already has startedoff the year's mergers with its acquisition of software vendorServantis of Norcross, Ga., to improve its retail delivery service.

Bank-branded software differentiates products from yourcompetitors' but developing software in conjunction with a vendor hasseveral hidden problems that seem to originate before actual sourcecode-writing even begins.  One- quarter of all major software projectsare terminated before completion, experts estimate.  Studies indicatethat 75 percent of completed software projects are "operatingfailures" and a disappointment to users.    The type of contract you want is the first thing to consider whenoutsourcing software development, said Joseph Auer, president ofInternational Computer Negotiations Inc. (ICN) in Winter Park, Fla. Banks basically have two choices -- resources- or results-orientedcontracts.  The key difference between contracting methods lies in whoassumes responsibility for meeting business objectives, he said.    A resources contract entails hiring staff to work inside the bankto develop the software.  In this scenario, the development is managedentirely by the bank and the bank is responsible if the project fails,Auer said.    The software is developed off-site in a results-orientedcontract.  This type of project is managed by the vendor with the bankcontributing a small amount of resources, such as machine time, data,floor space and access to management.  The vendor retainsresponsibility for the end-product, Auer said.    Savvy vendors create results and resources contracts thatstipulate joint responsibility and accountability, which may soundgood to bank managers who are unable to give up control or who thinkit is a cop-out to outsource development.  But demanding control in adevelopment relationship is asking for trouble because vendors aremore than willing to take the bank's money and give it all theresponsibility for failed programs and bugs, Auer said.  "[Banks] aresaying `please can we be a big target.'"    Negotiate provisions that make the vendor responsible for bugsand performance failure.  This likely will produce a need for aresults-oriented contract, which places the project in the vendor'scourt, he said.Drafting the Right Agreement    "A well-constructed contract should give the system buyer someassurance that desired business results will be achieved within areasonable time frame," Auer said.  "One of the most effectivetechniques for providing this type of assurance is to develop adetailed project timetable based on identified tasks, taskinterdependencies and deliverables to be included in the contract."    A carefully drafted software development agreement will promptthe vendor and the bank to consider issues upfront and preventdisaster later.  This type of agreement also will give the bank legalrecourse against the vendor if something goes awry, says technologylegal expert Dan C. Aardal, partner at Brown Raymans & Millstein inLos Angeles.    Success seems to hinge on thoroughly evaluating bank needs priorto jumping into the development phase.  Include user, performance andmaintenance requirements emanating from this evaluation in attachmentsto the development contract, he said.    Aardal's checklist for development agreements includes:    *  user involvement;    *  bimonthly progress reports;     *  request for proposals guidelines;     *  acceptance testing criteria; and more.    Almost any of these elements can be critical, but severalcommonly neglected provisions are often pitfalls for the bank, Aardalsaid.  For example, ownership of the software should be stipulated inthe agreement so that no dispute arises after the fact, Aardal said.    Make sure your bank owns the source code and has licensing rightsto the software in return for the high price you pay to develop it, hesaid.  These terms should be negotiated into the contract because youwon't own the software automatically just because you paid to have itdeveloped.    The developer may charge a higher price for ownership rights thanfor licensing because it will be the developer's only opportunity tomake money on the software, he added.    Pay the higher price: it will give you peace of mind.  No otherbank will be using the same program or, in the case of home bankingsoftware, offering it to customers in competition with the bank thatpaid for its development, Aardal explained.    One of the most useful provisions you can negotiate is a most-favored customer clause.  Such a bank customer is guaranteed toreceive prices and services that are better or equivalent to thosebeing offered to the vendor's other customers.  Additionally, itguarantees that the most-favored bank's contract will be amended toinclude the same services, refunds or credits granted to new customersthat were given a better deal, Aardal said. Bargain for Warranties    Banks can bargain for a multitude of warranties, too, in thesecontracts.  Standard warranties, protecting the bank against copyrightinfringement and defects in the material and workmanship, should notbe controversial during negotiations, Aardal said.  But other types ofwarranties seem more burdensome to the vendor, although they canprotect your bank better.    One such warranty would guarantee that the licensor is aware ofthe user's business requirements and the intended uses for thesoftware, and that the software will satisfy such requirements and isfit for the intended uses.    This warranty works best if the user has made the initialinvestment of time and effort to describe its business requirementsand intended uses in the contract.  Attach that description as aschedule or exhibit to the software license agreement, Aardal said.    Additionally, a bank with the resources will have prepared arequest for proposals describing those requirements and that the usercan give to competing vendors, he said.    Aardal advises bargaining for these additional warranties:*   Acceptance testing.  Ensure that your bank has the right tothoroughly test the software in-house before making final payment onits development. Include testing procedures in the initial developmentagreement. Tests should include a request that the software system runsuccessfully for about 30 days in a live operating environment.*   Performance.  Specify transaction response time, transactioncapacity, and reliability requirements.  Software should perform inaccordance with description, specifications and documentation of thesoftware set forth in exhibits and schedules in the license agreement. It will be difficult to contend later that the software did notperform a particular function unless the license and relatedspecifications indicated the software was supposed to perform thatfunction.*   Maintenance.  Negotiate maintenance provisions at the same time asthe development agreement.  If you wait until after a development andlicensing agreement is signed, your bank will have little leverage. State in the agreement that the vendor must respond immediately toservice calls or you will be entitled to a free one-month extension ofthe warranty period, or credit against future maintenance costs.

Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK AUTOMATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 24, 1996SYNC LINKING LEGACY NETWORKS TO CLIENT-SERVER     Sync Research Inc. wants to capitalize on the financial-institution migration from IBM legacy systems to faster client-servernetworks. (see related story, p. 1).       The Irvine, Calif.-based company believes it can profit fromthese conversions.  Although Sync is not directly targeting banks,company officials said it is aiming to "focus on the IBM-centriccustomer that is looking to migrate to client-server."     Historically, financial institutions have built large IBMnetworks to support their branches.  These networks communicatedthrough numerous leased lines, which are both expensive and limited. With client-server and wide-area-network (WAN) enhancement, such asframe relay; banks can send data at higher speeds.  Data transferbetween legacy systems and client-server networks now can be supportedon one line.    Sync's FrameNode product line is the "translator" that makesvarious communications protocols compatible, including asynchronoustransfer mode (ATM) and ISDN technology.  Depending on the servicesneeded, Sync's FrameNode units can cost from $995 to $5,200 apiece.    FrameNode manages the data that transfers between the old branchterminal equipment and the newer personal computers.    "We provide the glue, so to speak, between the legacy applicationdevice -- the [IBM] 4700 controller or the [automated tellermachine] -- and this new WAN service," said Todd Krautkremer, a vice-president at Sync.  "We connect the old device at the old speed andthe new devices as fast as you want."    Sync, which began as a consulting firm in 1981 and started tobuild products in 1986, began trading on the NASDAQ last fall.  Itwill be releasing its fourth quarter earnings for the first time atthe end of January.    The company's customers include New-York based Chemical Bank andCiticorp., Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank and San Francisco-based WellsFargo Bank.  However, Krautkremer admits "the smaller banks canbenefit more greatly."  One of Sync's newest customers has only 50branches.Market Strategy    Sync is positioning itself to be profitable even when the legacysystems are dead -- although for many smaller institutions that maytake a very long time, according to industry analysts.    Krautkremer said ATM, frame-relay and ISDN essentially run at thesame speed and the only thing that separates the three services areprices, which depend upon the rates charged by the local telephonecompanies.    For example, frame relay may be more expensive than ISDN inCalifornia but ISDN is more expensive than frame-relay in New York. So, as interstate banking takes effect, branches of a national bank inCalifornia may be using different protocols than branches of the samebank in New York.    "[Telecommunications] carriers are stepping up with intelligentnetworks and providing numerous migration paths," said Krautkremer. "We will be developing technologies that will allow frame relay to betranslated to ATM ... The device on the edge of the network needs tobe able to deal with multiple types of services." **********************Sync Research Inc.7 StudebakerIrvine, California 92718714/588-2070Contact:       Todd Krautkremer.Products:      Frame-relay access platforms and protocol translators.Customers:     Chemical Bank, Citicorp. and Mellon Bank.Source:  EFT***********************Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK AUTOMATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 24, 1996BISYS AND BOTTOMLINE PARTNER     Little Falls, N.J.-based BISYS Inc. will use BottomlineTechnologies' BranchGard and CheckGard products in its TotalPlusproduct line.

The start-up software company recently released a product to helplarge banks manage their human resources tasks and small banks tocreate a human resources department.     The Windows-based HR Task Counselor is designed specifically forbanks, with features including 107 financial job descriptions, releaseagreements, on-line databases and on-line regulatory assistance.     Since its release in November, at least five institutions,ranging in size from 30 employees to 150 employees, have purchased thesoftware.     BAN has learned one large banking organization will considerendorsing and distributing the product at its next meeting within thenext two months.Pricing     "For small organizations, [HR Task Counselor] is an affordablealternative to hiring an HR manager.  They can't afford to pay $40,000to $50,000 for someone to manage 50 employees," said Jeff Schmitzpresident of Jam.LOGIC.  "For larger organizations, it is analternative to hiring an HR assistant."     One software license for a bank with less than 50 employees willcost $600 to cover first-year maintenance and regulatory updates.  Theaverage sale in the banking arena has been $3,000, according toSchmitz.     Large organizations will input job descriptions and place them onthe network so the entire institution has one set standard.       In addition, each module is user-defined with passwords.  Forexample, marketing managers only can look at the performance reviewsof their employees, not of the entire company.

Emery v. American GeneralFinanceInc., No. 95-1037 (7th Cir.).The majority found that the plaintiff had sufficiently allegedherpredicate claims of mail fraud so as to survive a motion todismiss.Verna Emery first approached American General Finance for a loaninJuly 1992.  The lender issued her a three-year loan for $1,983;thefinance charges over the term of the loan amounted to $1,327.American General sent Emery a letter the following January,statingthat she was entitled to borrow an additional $750.Seeking an additional $200, Emery responded to the offer;AmericanGeneral's branch manager gave her forms for the refinancing ofheroriginal loan with additional funds advanced.  Emery signed a newnote for $2,399 with a finance charge of $1,641.  Emery's monthlypayments increased by roughly $20, effectively costing her $1,200for the right to get $200 immediately.  (Such disclosure was notrequired by the Truth in Lending Act, the Seventh Circuit noted,asthe statute regards such transactions as a reborrowing of theoriginal loan amount.)Emery filed her action in the Northern District of Illinois,alleging that the lender engaged in a pattern of soliciting itscustomers by mail for the loan of additional funds, withoutinforming them that the costs of refinancing are far greater thanthose connected with taking out a separate loan.The trial court granted the defense's dismissal motion inDecember1994, concluding that the plaintiff failed to identify anyspecificfalse statement of material fact allegedly made by the defendant.The lower court also found that the plaintiff failed to cite toanycase holding a failure to disclose actionable under the federalmail fraud statute.In a review authored by Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Richard A.Posner,the Seventh Circuit stated that "all the [mail fraud] statutepunishes is deliberate fraud."  While having no quibble with theproposition that mere failure to disclose does not constitutemailfraud, the panel stated that "[w]hether a failure to disclose isfraudulent depends on context."Judge Posner wrote that the panel does "not of course know thestate of mind of the employees of American General Finance whodrafted the letter to Emery and its other customers; nor can theplaintiff have more than an inkling until she has an opportunitytoconduct pretrial discovery."  In viewing the letter in thecontextof the complaint's allegations, the court continued, "the letterisseen to be replete with falsehoods and half truths."With respect to the lower court's finding that Emery failed toallege a violation of the Truth in Lending Act, the panel stated,"Suppose Emery were blind.  Or retarded.  Would anyone argue thatshoving a Truth in Lending Act disclosure form in front ofherfacewould be a defense to fraud?  The allegation is that she belongstoa class of borrowers who are not competent interpreters of suchforms and that the defendant knows this and sought to takeadvantage of it," Judge Posner wrote.As to the lower court's finding that Emery failed to plead afiduciary relationship between herself and the defendant, thepanelwrote that "it is not true that if you are not a fiduciaryanythinggoes, short of false statements.  A half truth, or what isusuallythe same thing a misleading omission, is actionable as fraud,including mail fraud if the mails are used to further it, if itisintended to induce a false belief and resulting action to theadvantage of the misleader and the disadvantage of the misled."The panel stated that it was not deeming loan flipping to befraudor that the defendant engaged in fraud.  "All we know is that theallegations of fraud are sufficient to withstand a motion todismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  There is astate of facts consistent with the complaint that if proved wouldestablish a violation of the mail fraud statute, and no more isrequired at this stage for the suit to continue."Judge Posner did find meritorious the defendant's alternativearguments that Emery failed to plead mail fraud with FRCP 9(b)particularity.  The panel found Emery's allegations of the fraudperpetrated upon her sufficient, but that she only generallyaverred that American General did the same to other customers.The panel wrote that a Rule 9(b) dismissal would have beenproper,but that Emery should have been given the opportunity to amendhercomplaint.  The appellate panel then reversed and remanded.Judge William J. Bauer concurred in the judgment.Dissenting, Judge John L. Coffey stated that "[t]he cases inwhichthis court has held that  non-disclosure' may be deemedfraudulentall involved a special circumstance of some kind....  There werenosuch special circumstances in this case.  AGF, as Emery'screditor,was not a fiduciary....  AGF did not engage in a  wide variety ofdeceptive actions,' nor can its conduct vis-a-vis Emery be fairlydescribed as an  elaborate attempt at concealment.'"Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK & LENDER LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 10, 19969TH CIR.: NO CLAIM BYSHAREHOLDERS TO RECOVERRECEIVERSHIP LOSSESA group of bank shareholders, charging the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. with fraud on the court, will not be able torecover funds they lost when the agency took over receivershipfroma failed bank, a panel of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appealsheld Dec. 26.  Herring et al. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,No. CV-93-00127-EHC (9th Cir.).The circuit court affirmed a decision of the U.S. District Courtfor the District of Arizona, stating that a party with nointerestin the litigation generally has no standing.In September 1981, the Arizona Superintendent of Banks placedSouthwestern Bank in receivership.  On May 1, 1990, the FDIC, ascourt-appointed receiver, petitioned the Arizona Superior Courttoenter an order approving payment of a final liquidating dividend,payment of interest on claims, sale of any newly discoveredassets,disposal of Southwestern's books and records and termination ofthereceivership.The shareholders, Morris Herring, Raymond Herring, James N.Corbett, Luis Valenzuela, Armando Alfaro and Sherman Montgomery,who had invested in the Southwestern Bank, filed objections,complaining of faulty accounting and insufficient informationregarding the receivership and alleged $530,124 loss.  Theshareholders requested the court to order a more specificaccounting or allow shareholders leave to examine thereceivership.After hearings and the filing of post-petition briefs, theSuperiorCour overruled the shareholders' objections.  The court held thatthe disputed item of $530,124 consisted of losses sustained ontheliquidation of assets and that the FDIC was not subject tosurcharge for this amount.  The court further held that the FDICwas entitled to interest on its own claim, but that thereceivership funds were insufficient to cover the FDIC's claimevenif the $530,124 was disallowed.  On Aug. 14, 1991, the courtterminated the receivership.After being turned down by the state Supreme Court to reviewtheirpetition that the FDIC perpetrated a fraud on the court, theshareholders filed with the Arizona Superior Court an independentaction pursuant to Rule 60(b) to set aside the judgment for fraudon the court.  The FDIC removed the case to federal districtcourt.The shareholders alleged that the FDIC knowingly submitted falseaccounting figures when it petitioned the court to terminatereceivership and presented perjured testimony to the courtconcerning a bank receivership asset account labeled "otherassets/judgments."The FDIC moved for summary judgment.  Following briefing and oralargument, the district court granted summary judgment on twogrounds: (1) that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred theshareholders' action, and (2) that the FDIC committed no fraud onthe court.The circuit court found that, because the shareholders cannotrecover their funds, they have no standing.  The panel affirmedthedistrict court's finding of summary judgment on their fraud onthecourt claim.The shareholders were represented by Conrad Herring of San Diego.The FDIC was represented by Lawrence G.D. Scarborough of Brown &Bain in Phoenix.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK & LENDER LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996CONVICTION IN ELABORATEREAL ESTATE SCHEME ISUPHELD IN 10TH CIRCUITOver the pleas of the defendants, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals on Jan. 5 upheld their multicount convictions in districtcourt arising from a complex real estate fraud, including mailfraud, wire fraud and making false statements in connection withthe scheme.  United States v. Austin et al., No. 91-CR-147(10th Cir.).Defendants Donald Austin and James Grandgeorge claimed that theU.S. District Court for the District of Colorado-imposedrestitution of $12,618,772 was too high.  Based upon defaultedloans, the district court determined the victims of the schemelostmore than $20 million.  The district court also sentenced Austintoa term of 27 years and Grandgeorge to a term of 23 years.  Eachwasgiven a sentence of five years' probation following release.The essence of the scheme was to purchase properties fromlegitimate sellers.  The defendants recruited numerous people toact as "strawmen buyers," who secured mortgages from U.S.MortgageCo. which were, in turn, insured by the U.S. Department ofHousingand Urban Development (HUD).  Despite HUD's requirement that eachpurchase be funded with a minimum of 15% downpayment by thepurchasers, no such investment was made by the strawmen.Closing documents were drawn, however, which falsely stated thedownpayments were made.  The defendants paid the strawmen $1,000for each of the transactions in which they participated.Althoughthe defendants assured the strawmen the defendants would beresponsible for the payment of loans to the properties, no suchpayments were made, and the properties went into foreclosure.The defendants incorporated Fidelity Escrow Services, which theyused as an independent entity in connection with the salestransaction to give the transactions the appearance oflegitimacy.The use of Fidelity convinced the loan closer on the strawmenpurchases to believe the downpayments were paid by the purchasersin cash or certified funds.The defendantsalso arranged for all loans to be handled throughU.S. Mortgage, which was able to charge high interest ratesbecausethe purchasers had no real interest in the properties.  The highinterest rate and the prospect of HUD insurance made the loansattractive to secondary lenders.  The processing of the loansgranted by U.S. Mortgage to the strawmen was done by three peoplewho were paid kickbacks by the defendants.  Although thedefendants' scheme involved hundreds of properties, 157 wereidentified in the indictment.Austin contended that the district court erred in imposingrestitution upon him because there was no proof of his ability topay.  However, the 10th Circuit concluded that Austin did littletoprove this claim.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK & LENDER LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996ORAL AGREEMENT BETWEENLANDOWNER AND BANK NOTAS BINDING AS WRITTENSince the alleged oral agreement between a landowner and her bankto prevent foreclosure on her properties contradicts the terms ofthe written agreement between the two parties, a Californiaappealscourt on Dec. 22 affirmed a trial court's grant of summaryjudgmentto the bank to foreclose on the property.  Howard v. FirstNationwide Bank, No. A067566 (CA Ct. App., 1st Dist.).The California Court of Appeal, First District, concluded thatsince an alleged oral agreement between Ruth Fairley Howard andKeith G. Becher, a First Nationwide Bank (FNB) liquidationsupervisor, directly contradicted the terms of the writtenagreement between the two parties, Howard's appeal to seek areversal of the summary judgment by the Alameda County SuperiorCourt is without merit.In 1986, Howard and her husband, Mark Howard, a commercial realestate broker who was then in the business of buying and sellingproperties for his own account, borrowed $210,000 from FNB topurchase commercial property in Richmond.  The Howards executed astandard promissory note and deed of trust on the property,agreeing to pay off the loan in monthly installments and givingFNBthe usual right to foreclose on the property if they failed to doso.In 1989, Mark Howard died of cancer.  The plaintiff spent twoyearscaring for him and her mother, who was also terminally ill.Howardalso struggled with her own condition, lupus.  During thisperiod,the Howards' financial properties fell into disarray.  Paymentswere not made to lenders, including FNB.  In June 1988, Howardfiled for bankruptcy.Despite filing for bankruptcy, Howard continued to make paymentsonthe loan to FNB for the next five months.  When the paymentsstopped in November 1988, the bank moved for an order lifting theautomatic stay in the bankruptcy action so that it could beginforeclosure on the loan's collateral.  Howard agreed to thedissolution of the stay in exchange for FNB's agreement to deferforeclosure for two and one-half months.Howard resumed making payments on the loan for almost a year, butagain fell into default.  In November 1989, FNB sent her astandardlate notice, giving her 30 days to bring the loan current.  WhenHoward did not respond, FNB waited more than two months beforeissuing a notice of default and electing to sell the property.Thenotice gave her three months to avoid foreclosure.After the plaintiff did not bring the loan current, FNB scheduledthe trustee's sale for Aug. 8, 1990.  Howard asked for anotherpostponement and brought Fred Mangrum, a real estate broker andfriend, with her to meet with Becher.  They asked him to postponefor sale for one month.Howard said Mangrum would buy the Richmond property, with theproceeds to pay off the loan and put the remainder of herfinancialaffairs in order.  Although Mangrum had expressed an interest inbuying the property since the preceding January, a definitivesaleprice had not been set nor any written sales agreement executed. FNB, through Becher, and Howard agreed that if she paid theescrowarrears by Aug. 7, 1990, FNB would postpone the scheduled salefortwo weeks until Aug. 22.  Also, if Howard would then pay one-halfthe loan arrears by Aug. 22, FNB would postpone the sale anadditional 30 days, until Sept. 21.Howard paid the first installment.  The day before the secondinstallment was due, Mangrum informed FNB that she could not payeven one-half the next installment and needed anotherpostponement.FNB agreed to postpone the trustee's sale if  Howard adhered to apayment schedule.Although the prior extensions had not been memorialized in awriting signed by Howard, Becher at this point insisted that therevised payment schedule must be written and signed by theplaintiff.Contrary to Becher's testimony, Howard testified that, sometimeprior to execution of the written agreement, Becher told herthat,in return for three payments totaling approximately $14,000, FNBwould "cancel" the foreclosure and await the sale of the propertyto Mangrum.On Nov. 19, 1992, Howard filed her complaint against FNB andBecher.  The complaint alleged claims for fraud, breach of oralcontract, intentional interference with contract, unfair businesspractices and intentional infliction of emotional distress.The pivotal allegation of the complaint was the existence andbreach of the oral agreement to "halt the foreclosure" in returnfor partial repayment of the loan balance.The defendants filed an answer on April 6, 1003, denying all oftheplaintiff's allegations and raising numerous affirmativedefenses,including various statutes of limitations.On June 24, 1994, after conducting discovery, defendants movedforsummary judgment on numerous grounds, including the contentionthatplaintiff's claims were barred by the parol evidence rule andapplicable statutes of limitation and were substantively withoutmerit.The court affirmed the judgment.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK & LENDER LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996FIRST NATIONAL BANK OFBOSTON PETITIONS 11TH CIR.FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUSThe 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 30 granted theFirstNational Bank of Boston's petition for a writ of mandamus,instructing the U.S. District Court for the Southern District ofFlorida to recall the remand and reinstate its case against aFlorida man in a dispute over a consumer loan.  In re FirstNational Bank of Boston, No. 95-5008 (11th Cir.).The petition for the writ required the circuit court to decidewhether a district court can remand a case sua sponte within the30-day period following removal notice provided in 28 U.S.C.Section  1447(c) for motions to remand.The district court remanded the case to state court during thistime period.  Because the circuit court concluded that the 1988amendments to Section 1447(c) precluded the district court fromsuasponte remand, the court granted the petition.The origin of the present petition is the related federal casefiled in 1989 by Society for Savings in the U.S. District Courtforthe Southern District of Florida, concerning a consumer loansecured by a motor yacht extended to Jerome H. Rogers (SocietyforSavings v. M/Y "CONJA", No. 89-6167-CIV-PAINE [SD FL]).That case was settled by surrender of the vessel to Society forSavings and the agreed payment of $13,000, representing thedifference in the value of the vessel and the outstanding debt.Thereafter, various credit reporting agencies showed this loan asa bad debt.In 1995, Rogers sued petitioner First National Bank of Boston inthe 15th Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, which he allegedis the successor to Society for Savings with offices in PalmBeachCounty, FL, and claimed damages exceeding $15,000 for Bank ofBoston's failure to correct credt information relating to Rogers(Rogers v. Bank of Boston, No. CL 95 347AB [FL Cir. Ct., PalmBeachCty., filed Jan. 17, 1995]).Subsequently, Rogers filed a settlement demand, requestingcompensatory and punitive damages of $650,000.  Bank of Bostonfiled an amended answer and affirmative defenses that denied thematerial allegations of the complaint, including the allegationthat Bank of Boston maintained an office in Palm Beach County.On June 13, 1995, Bank of Boston removed the case to the U.S.District Court for the Southern District of Florida pursuant to28U.S.C. Section Section 1441 and 1446, and asserted completediversity (Rogers v. Bank of Boston, No. 95--8366--CIV--NESBITT[SD FL, filed June 13, 1995]).Bank of Boston represented that it is a national bankingassociation with its principal place of business inMassachusetts,making it a Massachusetts citizen, and that the amount incontroversy exceeded $50,000 in compliance with 28 U.S.C. Section1332(a).On June 19, 1995, the district court sua sponte remanded the caseto the 11th Judicial Circuit for Dade County.  The district courtdetermined that Bank of Boston's failure to reveal the state inwhich it is incorporated constituted an inadequate showing of itscitizenship for diversity jurisdiction.  The court's order wasfiled on June 22, 1995, and the case was closed.On June 28, 1995, Bank of Boston moved for reconsideration andvacation of the district court's remand order and for leave toamend its notice of removal.  The bank explained that, as anational banking association, it is not incorporated under anystate's law and that its citizenship is determined by itsprincipalplace of business.The bank also filed an amended notice of removal, stating thisexplanation of its citizenship and clarifying that it maintainsnobranch offices in Florida, although its independent subsidiarymortgage corporation maintains at least one branch office inFlorida.On July 21, 1995, the district court entered an order strikingBankof Boston's motion for reconsideration and leave to file anamendednotice of removal because it no longer had jurisdiction over thecase.The bank then petitioned the court for a writ of mandamusdirectingthe district court to recall its remand and to reinstate the caseon its docket.Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 21(b), thecircuitcourt directed the district judge to respond to Bank of Boston'sargument that the district court's remand was unauthorized under28U.S.C.

Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.Harris Trust and Savings Bank et al., No. 95-1884 (7th Cir.).The district court ruled that defendant Kaiser Investments couldrefuse to pay on the grounds that a provision in a "Borrower'sAffidavit" requiring the indemnification of rents before theappointment of a receiver when the trust defaulted was madeunenforceable by the "rents and profits rule."The case was remanded to the district court for furtherproceedingsconsistent with this opinion.In 1986, Fidelity made a $3.6 million loan to an Illinois landtrust that held title to a commercial property.  The trustee wasanIllinois bank and the beneficiary of the partnership, KaiserInvestments.The loan was secured by a mortgage on the property, but iaddition,Kaiser Investments executed a "Borrower's Affidavit" thatcontaineda number of warranties and representations designed to induceFidelity to make a loan.One of the paragraphs of the affidavit states that"notwithstandinganything to the contrary contained in the Loan Papers...Borrower(Kaiser) shall be and remain personally obligated and liable for,and shall indemnify Lender against the Property for any periodsubsequent to an event of default, and shall pay over the same tothe Lender upon receipt, except to the extent that the same havebeen applied in payments of any amounts due Lender under the Noteor other Loan Papers."The trust defaulted on the loan in February 1993, and in July ofthat year, having sent a notice of default the preceding month,Fidelity brought this suit against the bank and KaiserInvestments.The suit asked for foreclosure and other relief, including theappointment of a receiver and indemnification for any rentscollected after the default.  The district court appointed areceiver in September 1993, and the receiver began collecting therents.  Later, the court decreed foreclosure, and the propertywassold at a price that left Fidelity with a loss of more than $1.3million on its loan.U.S. District Judge James B. Moran held the refusal proper on thegrounds that the provision in the affidavit requiredindemnification by the "rents and profits rule."According to Illinois common law, this rule forbids a mortgageetoenforce a provision of a mortgage assigning rents or other incomeof the mortgaged property to him until the mortgagee takespossession of the property.  The judge, therefore, dismissed theclaim and, since other claims in the case had already beenresolved, the dismissal was the final order in the case and wasappealable.However, Chief Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Posner ruled onappeal that the indemnity agreement in the Borrower's Affidavitwas"separate" from the loan papers, and that the borrower, Kaiser,wasnot technically the mortgagor, affects the applicability of therents and profits rule.Judge Posner stated that the rule would be a joke if it could beavoided by designating certain papers involved in the loan "theloan papers" and reciting that the assignment of rents was notamong them.  He said it would also be a joke if, as in this case,that of an Illinois land trust, only the trustee was forbidden tomake an enforceable assignment of rents.In an Illinois land trust, which is becoming a common mode ofownership in Illinois and other states, property that is subjecttoa mortgage is "owned" by a trustee whose only function is to holdtitle, leaving management and control of the property entirely inthe hands of the beneficiary of the trust.The agreement between the two parties was that Kaiser was to payover the rents to Fidelity upon receipt of the rents by Kaiser.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK & LENDER LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 10, 199610TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMSCREDITOR CANNOTEXECUTE UPON MORTGAGESA ruling that a default judgment creditor is not entitled toexecute upon mortgages in Texas owned by the Government NationalMortgage Association (GNMA) as a matter of law was affirmed Dec.18by the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Pipkin v. MortgageCreditcorp, Inc. et al., No. 94-6443 (WD OK).The opinion involves the question of whether a default judgmentcreditor may divest the interest of GNMA in certain Texas realestate mortgages solely because GNMA failed to record itsinterestin the mortgages in adherence to the law.Plaintiff Roger W. Pipkin III appealed the district court's grantof summary judgment in favor of GNMA and its mortgage services,Midland Mortgage, Co., MidFirst Bank and Northwest Bank(collectvely, the Midland Group).  The district court held thatTexas law was superseded by GNMA's enabling stature and thatPipkinwas not entitled to execute upon Texas mortgages because GNMAownedthe mortgages as a matter of law.Pipkin is the judgment creditor of defendants MortgageCreditcorp,Inc. and Westmark Mortgage Corp. (the Westmark Parties), twodefunct mortgage serving companies.  In 1994, Pipkin obtained a$4.8 million default judgment against the Westmark Parties inTexasstate court.  That court then entered the post-judgment orderinstructing the Midland Group, the defendants-in-intervention andthird-party plaintiffs, to turn over to Pipkin several Texas realestate mortgages the court deemed "nonexempt assets of theWestmarkParties.To execute his judgment on the Oklahoma-based Midland Group,Pipkinfiled the post-judgment order in Oklahoma City.  Subsequently,theMidland Group obtained a stay of execution from the state courtandfiled a petition in intervention naming GNMA as third-partydefendant.  GNMA removed the case to the U.S. District Court forthe Western District of Oklahoma.GNMA and the Midland Group then moved for summary judgment,arguingthat the mortgages sought by Pipkin were owned by GNMA, not theWestmark Parties.  Pipkin countered that, under Texas law, theWestmark Parties continued to own the mortgages because GNMAfailedto record its interest in the mortgages.The district court granted GNMA's and the Midland Group's motionson the ground that GNMA's enabling statute, 12 U.S.C. Section1721(g), expressly preempts any Texas law limiting GNMA'sownershiprights in the mortgages.Under Section 1721(g), Congress vested GNMA with broad powers tocarry out the congressional objective of establishing andencouraging a secondary market for home mortgages, the districtcourt said.Pipkin contended, however, by virtue of the Texas recordingstatuteand GNMA's failure to record its interest in the pooledmortgages,the Westmark Parties own those mortgages under Texas law.  As ajudgment creditor of the Westmark Parties, Pipkin argued, he isentitled to execute on those mortgages.The circuit court was not persuaded by Pipkin's argument andaffirmed the district court's decision.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK & LENDER LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996DC COURT SUPPORTS BANK'SMOTION TO STRIKE CLASSACTION ALLEGATIONSIn a memorandum filed Dec. 26, the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Columbia decided in favor of NationsBank Corp. anddenied class action status to a pending fair lending lawsuitagainst the bank.  Lathern et al. v. NationsBank Corp. et al.,No. 95-CV-1805 (NHJ) (D DC).The judge had harsh words for the plaintiffs' counsel, theWashington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs(WLC) for failing to timely move for class certification in aprioraction.The bank asked the court that the class allegations be strickenentirely.This action began Sept. 21, 1995, when plaintiffs filed acomplaintcontaining class action allegations under the Fair Housing Act,theEqual Credit Opportunity Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1866.However, by failing to move for class certification by Dec. 20,1995, which was 90 days from the date on which the classcomplaintwas filed, the plaintiffs violated Local Rule 203(b).Accordingly, the court decided, the plaintiffs' class actionallegations should be stricken in their entirety.John Relman, director of the fair housing project at the WLC,saidhis organization had not missed the deadline, but refused toelaborate.  He did say WLC's position will be explained in afuturecourt filing.Class action status is important to the WLC's case against thebank, which alleges that NationsBank discriminated againstborrowers.  At the heart of theissue is money.  If the classactionis fought in court, NationsBank would have more to lose.  Withoutclass action status, the case involves 13 plaintiffs and nineloanapplications, and the awards would be less.  As a class, the WLCwould ask NationsBank to compensate all affected consumers, whichwould increase the bank's costs.In its memorandum, the court stated that WLC had since Dec. 13,1994, the date of its initial press conference announcing itscampaign to solicit plaintiffs for its class action against thebank, to construct its legal argument.To achieve this goal, the WLC used a variety of methods toattractplaintiffs, including an "800" hotline number, press statementsandconferences, and print and radio interviews.Despite this effort, the court stated that WLC was only able toattract an additional 11 plaintiffs since the suit was filedSept. 21.The court said that if the plaintiffs feel they have individualclaims, they should litigate them as such.  Also, the court heldthat NationsBank should not be subjected to any furtherprejudicialadverse publicity tied to promises of class action litigation.NationsBank is represented by Robert S.

Cousin v. Office of ThriftSupervision, Nos. 94-4206 and 94,6070 (2nd Cir.).Also, Michael Cousin's petition for review of the final decisionand order of Jonathan L. Fiechter, AD for the OTS, prohibitingCousin from further participating in any manner in the conduct ofthe affairs of any banking institution regulated by the OTS.Since the petition for review of the final decision and order isdenied, the circuit court dismissed as moot the appeal of thedenial of declaratory judgment.In August 1990, Cousin, then chairman of the board and chiefexecutive officer of Cross County Federal Savings Bank, waschargedin federal court with several counts of bribery.  The OTS wasinformed of the charges and, two days later, issued a temporarysuspension and prohibition from participation in the affairs ofCounty Federal.Cousin then sought to have the criminal indictment against himdropped in federal court, asserting that he was neitherphysicallynor mentally fit to stand trial.The district court agreed to dismiss the indictment againstCousinbecause he was not physically capable of standing trial; however,included in the order dismissing the charges against Cousin,datedMay 25, 1992, was language -- agreed to by Cousin's attorney --tothe effect that the dismissal of the indictment did not amount toa dismissal on the merits (Cousin v. Office of ThriftSupervision,840 F.Supp. 8,9-10 [ED NY 1993]).The language was specifically included in the order to ensurethatthe dismissal was not construed as requiring the discontinuationofthe OTS's temporary suspension and prohibition  against Cousin.After his physical recovery, Cousin informed the OTS that he wasfit to reenter the banking world.  Despite the explicit languageinthe order dismissing his indictment, Cousin thereafter sought adeclaratory judgment in the district court that his indictmenthadbeen dismissed on its merits and that, as a matter of law, theOTStemporary suspension was required to be lifted.In light of the language in the order dismissing his indictment,the district court dismissed Cousin's suit on waiver grounds.Cousin then appealed the district court's dismissal f his action.On May 13, 1993, the OTS instituted a proceeding to permanentlyprohibit Cousin from further participating in any manner in theconduct of the affairs of any banking institution regulated bytheOTS.  In support of the permanent prohibition, Cousin was chargedwith bribery and aiding and abetting bribery.He responded to the OTS claims, asserting a number of affirmativedefenses that focused primarily on entrapment.A hearing of the claims was held before Administrative Law JudgeWalter J. Alprin in September 1993.  On March 31, 1994, the ALJissued his recommendation, disqualifying Cousin from furtherparticipation in the bankingindustry.OTS was represented by Geraldine R.

Resolution Trust Corp. v.FinancialInstitutions Retirement Fund, No. 95-5016 (10th Cir.).The issue presented by this case is whether the Resolution TrustCorp., as successor to a failed thrift institution, can recoveranactuarial determined sum known as Future Employer ContributionsOffsets (FECO) attributable to the failed thrift as an employerina multiple-employer pension benefit plan under ERISA.The district court treated the FECO as discrete funds and awardedthem to RTC under a common law unjust enrichment theory.Financial Institutions Retirement Fund (FIRF) is amultiple-employer pension benefit plan under ERISA.  The fund isasingle plan, meaning all of its 360 participating employers payinto, and all of its approximately 35,000 employees benefit from,a single fund.Because of favorable market conditions in 1987, FIRF declared theplan had reached "full funding," suspended further employercontributions and advised its overfunded employers, includingSooner Federal Savings and Loan Association, that the FECO wouldbeused to offset the employers' future funding obligations to theplan.When Sooner became insolvent in 1989, the RTC, Sooner's receiver,sold some of its assets to a successor savings association,excepting any interest in, or claims against, FIRF.   Because ofits liquidation, Sooner was deemed to have withdrawn from FIRF.Atthe time of its insolvency, the value of Sooner's FECO credit wasapproximately $4.1 million.RTC brought the instant action against FIRF in 1989 to obtainpayment of the FECO credits, asserting a common law unjustenrichment claim.  In response, FIRF claimed it was prohibited byERISA from distributing the FECO credits to RTC or to anyemployerfor nonpension-related purposes.  Judgment in the amount of $4.6million was entered in favor of RTC, and this appeal ensued.On appeal, FIRF contended ERISA's "exclusive benefit" ruleprohibits the use of FECO balances for nonpension purposes.The 10th Circuit agreed, citing Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S.753(1992), which denied the inclusion of pension benefits in abankruptcy estate.  The court also agreed with FIRF, citing toGuidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365(1990), which reversed the imposition of a constructive trust onaconvicted union official's pension benefits.The circuit court found it evident that the exact amount of theFECO constantly varies in concert with he values of theinvestments comprising the body of the fund.  Yet, the districtcourt found the FECO are neither hypothetical nor theoreticalbecause FIRF itself has stated that FECO assets are fund assets.For this reason, RTC contended, the FECO are tangible assets ofthefund.  The court ruled that RTC's argument missed the mark.  Thequestion of whether the FECO credits are needed for the paymentofbenefits can only be determined once the plan as a whole has beenterminated.Until then, FIRF must anticipate that there could be dramaticchanges on either side, the court held.The court concluded that RTC's removal of the FECO credits couldpotentially destabilize FIRF.  Furthermore, the district court'sdecision leads to the prospect of further diminution of the bodyofthe plan because other employers may be encouraged to leave theplan and remove their FECO credits, the court said.RTC was represented by Thomas C.

The latest official statistics show it has grown tobecome the leading comprehensive motor insurer in the UK - and by along way!The insurer, whose distinctive red telephone logo has become ahousehold name in just ten years thanks to inspired brand management,has seen its market share grow from 4.8 percent four years ago to 11.2percent, according to the latest figures from Datamonitor."This phenomenal growth has been due to the development of a strongbrand image and a policy of undercutting the prices of most of itsclosest rivals by leaving out the middleman - the broker," states thereport from the London-based research and management consultancy.Datamonitor based its research on end-1994 returns filed by insurancecompanies with the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) and,according to Direct Line's Adrian Webb, the gap between it and itscompetitors has further widened since then."We have now attained a figure of 2.2 million motor policies - nearlytwice as many as our nearest rival," Webb told BMI.This rapid rise in market share can be attributed in part to the highlycompetitive rates offered by Direct Line - it claims to have expensesof 11 percent, compared to an industry average of 25 percent, and itpasses much of its economies onto the customer.However, insurers like Eagle Star and Norwich Union have launched theirown direct insurance operations with competitive rates, and Direct Linenow finds itself competing directly with these as well as ChurchillInsurance and others. So, how does it continue to gain ground sorapidly, at the expense of its rivals? Many have attributed its successstory to the memorable brand image, described by one corporate imageconsultant as "a marketing director's dream"."A strong brand is one of the most important elements we have going forus," Webb said. "There is a huge awareness of the Direct Line brand inthe market. I think that when people are thinking of phoning around fora quote, ours is one of the first names that springs to mind."Webb attributes this success to a strong branding strategy, and ongoingbrand advertising on radio, TV, and in the national press. "We haveongoing campaigns to build brand awareness, or rather to build on thebrand awareness that already exists," he said. "Direct Line has been oneither TV or radio almost every day since 1990." The overall marketingbudget for 1995 was #25 million ($38.64 million).Direct Line's foray into the home and contents insurance market hasalso been, to say the least, a great success. It had been offering suchpolicies since 1988, but in quite a"subdued" way until 1992 or 1993when Direct Line put its weight behind the marketing of this section ofthe business.

The launch was preceded andaccompanied by a major marketing campaign, using the slogan"Rivoluzione Inglese" (English Revolution), a play on the initials ofthe UK insurer.Royal declined to disclose the campaign budget "for reasons ofcompetition", but the first phase of the campaign began after Christmasand ran until the launch date, with teaser posters appearing in theMilan Metro, in bus shelters, on buses, and in other outdoor sitesaround the region.The second phase got under way on the launch day, when new postersgiving a direct response number were accompanied by radio spots andadverts in the national dailies."In Italy, it is illegal to refuse motorists insurance," a spokesmantold BMI. "So, basically, we are targeting the 25-60 age group, withbetter risk profiles. The 1.5 million drivers who fit that profile inthe Greater Milan area - that's the pool we will be fishing in."According to Royal, market research undertaken after the liberalisationof the Italian insurance market last year showed that while customerswere generally content to deal with agents, a growing number wanted theoption to deal direct with their insurer.The new operation is closely modelled on Royal's other direct writingoperations in the UK and Spain, and fits into the insurer's strategy ofdeveloping multi-channel distribution of personal lines business.Customers will have a choice between receiving a quote by phone or, fora more personal service, going along to Royal's drive-in basement atits headquarters where they can deal directly with sales people,inspectors and claims assessors.Royal's strategy is to use this initiative as a testing ground, thespokesman said, at least for the short term."When we see how this goes,we may in the future consider further expansion in Italy."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Its findings are numerousand varied."The World Wide Web is doubling in size every three months," saidGeoffrey Chamberlain, chief executive of Durlacher Multimedia."Approaching 100,000 Web sites are forecast by early 1996."The authors concluded from their research that the first wave ofsuccessful Internet-related businesses will include Internet accessservice provision, Internet software applications provision andInternet consultancy. The second wave will be dominated by contentprovision, including provision by the financial services institutions.The study also forecasts that by early 1996, 33.4 million users will beconnected to the Internet, and that by 2002, more than 200 millionpeople worldwide will be connected to at least part of the Internet,with 150 million subscriptions to on-line services.Security comes up again as an issue.

Other banks are offering product informationservices on the Net in Australia.The 300,000 or so customers of Advance's Quickphone service can nowaccess their accounts with their Advance card number and Quickphone PINwhen they enter the bank's World Wide Web site.The bank is not only hoping for a large response from existingcustomers, but hopes also to catch the eye of potential new customerswho will be able to view a demonstration when they call up the AdvanceWeb site.Transfer fundsAt first, the service will just allow business and personal customersto call up account information, but the plan is to enhance the facilityso as to allow customers to transfer funds between accounts, make loanrepayments and see a full month's statement.Australian banks have been cautious about providing Internet bankingbecause of the security issue, and have tended to sit back and wait forthe US to lead the way as regards developing security technology. Withreportedly over 900,000 Australians now regularly surfing the Net,however, many banks have opened sites on the World Wide Web over thepast year.These pages generally contain advertising-type information as opposedto any real banking service. In other words, at present, most banks areusing the Internet mainly as an advertising medium.One of the more high profile initiatives, Priority One, was set up byAMP in October to offer home loans from the World Wide Web. Itreportedly received 7,000 queries in the first six weeks, but itadmitted that the conversion rate of Internet inquiries is lower thanfrom traditional inquiries.Web presenceBack in September, Westpac launched a Web site containing loaninformation. National Australia has its presence on the Web, and theCommonwealth Bank is developing sites both on the Web and on theMicrosoft Network. In December, St George announced its Internet sitewhich it claims is more "interactive" than other bank pages.With the assistance of Techway, a leading Australian informationtechnology company, Advance is confident that security is not aproblem. All customer information is encrypted for transmission in bothdirections over the Internet so the information remains secure, itclaims."[Techway] has studied worldwide trends in all aspects of security onthe Internet and it can confidently claim to have secure Internettransaction software that sets world class standards," a spokesmansaid.Although Advance has beaten its rivals to the post as regards providingan Internet banking service, the initiative will not provide the bankwith an exclusive advantage in the market. Techway is also"talkinginformally" with several others, and seems determined to market itstechnology to two or three of Advance's rival banks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Thanksto this agreement, CCF clients using Quicken can record their bankingoperations onto their respective Quicken documents to facilitate thesupervision and analysis of their spending.CCF plans to add other partners to its initial software agreement.Banco PC Boutiques will give CCF clients the possibility of shoppingdirectly from their PC, much as they are already doing through theMinitel (Bancoscope).The range of Banco PC services are accessible through a PC with awindows environment, equipped with a modem and a telephone connection.Banco PC services cost Fr29 ($5.89) monthly for the first service (anyof the four mentioned), and Fr10 for each additional service, with amaximum monthly charge of Fr49 (tax included). The Banco PC software isfree of charge, as is the service help-line.To aid its clients in equipping themselves, CCF offers an internalhigh-speed modem at a cost of Fr1,000 (the average retail price isFr1,500). For their clients who don't have a computer, the multimediaIBM Aptiva can be obtained with direct delivery from IBM.This evolution of CCF's long-distance banking services demonstrates itswillingness to respond to the changes in consumer demand and,therefore, its clients' needs. Currently, 10 percent of Frenchhouseholds have computers and by the year 2000, it is expected that 40percent will be fully equipped.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The 680,000 clientsconcerned are able to reach a "teleoperator" from Tuesday to Fridayfrom 8am to 9pm, and on Mondays and Saturdays from 9am to 5pm. This isthe first service available following a pilot which was carried outwith the 120,000 clients of six branch groups in the Paris area, andusing different operating times (5pm to 9pm from Tuesday to Friday and9am to 5pm on Saturdays). As of the second quarter of 1996, thisservice will be extended to all 3.5 million Societe Generale clients.The appointed teleoperators belong to the Societe Generale staff.Previous to the launch of the service, most operators worked in thebank's network as client managers and were then trained to work on thephone.A Societe Generale spokeswoman insisted that this new service is theresult of developments predating Compagnie Bancaire's Banque Directeentry onto the market."We launched the first platform with essentially Parisian groups,practically at the same time as Banque Directe was launched," shesaid."It is therefore a fully-developed project in Societe Generale,and not just a reaction to Banque Directe." At present, the serviceonly concerns Paris and the Paris area.The French unions involved have refused to accept any agreementconcerning working on a rota basis. In order to bypass this obstacle,SocGen management decided to have Vocalia Service set up two separateplatforms enabling the service to operate on a timetable of more thaneight hours. Each platform is situated in a different location to avoidhaving to set up any form of relay or rota teamwork. The 1937 decree onbank's working hours is thus respected.Despite this, the CFDT (Confederation Francaise Democratique duTravail, one of the French unions) tried to stop Vocalia Service frombeing launched in this fashion, by going to court.The court, however, dismissed the case, and there was no appeal. Theservice, which had been on hold pending the decision, was launchedimmediately afterwards.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"From the launch of First Direct, we have always set out to be thebest in the world, and customer service has been a key priority."Stott outlined various initiatives which are designed to ensure thatcustomer satisfaction remains high at First Direct. QUEST (QualityUndertake Every Single Time) is a staff suggestion scheme, which allowsmanagement to get feedback from those working directly with thecustomers, and to get ideas from the customers themselves."Action Teams" exist too in every department, where members of staffget together regularly and have "brainstorming" sessions.Regular customer satisfaction surveys are also an important way ofmonitoring consistency, according to Stott. Once new customers havereached the end of their "welcome period", questionnaires areautomatically sent out, so as to catch any problems early on in theprocess. These new arrivals are asked how the account opening processwent; if they had any problems; and, if so, were they dealt withswiftly and effectively. The responses to these questionnaires aremonitored monthly.What is more, each quarter, a survey of established customers iscarried out, involving a mailing of 10,000 or so questionnaires. FirstDirect itself carries out the survey for the first three quarters, andhas the final quarter executed independently by NOP.That said, many banks carry out similar initiatives and yet customersatisfaction is low. Where are they going wrong?"We had the added benefit of starting from scratch, of starting with aclean slate," Stott mused."We carried out extensive market research onthe banking industry, and we were very careful when recruiting.Remember that, as the banks move towards customer service, they arehaving to re-educate their people's thinking."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The magazine criticises the Royal BankTessa because interest is not compounded, but rather is credited to theaccount at the end of the five-year term."What Which? has failed to do is to look at the whole picture," saidFrank Kirwan, UK director of retail banking at the bank. "Theassociation has only looked at one element of our return, and forgottenall about the additional bonuses we offer. What matters to the customeris not the method of calculation, but the total return investorsreceive on their savings."Independent surveys show that the overall return to savers on theRoyal Bank TESSA is one of the best available from a high street bank,and ahead of many of the leading building societies. Indeed, researchby Moneyfacts and Blay's place it second to the TSB and ahead of the`Big Four'."Kirwan pointed out that the TESSA was designed for those investors whoheld them to maturity."It was always meant to be a long-term savingsmedium."He cited the Moneyfacts research, which placed Royal's TESSA second toTSB as regards return. Assuming that the TESSA was opened at launchwith the maximum investment of #3,000 and that maximum contributionshad been made on the anniversary of each year after that, the projectedmaturity value would be #11,870, compared to TSB's figure of #11,904.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Bankinter is one of those to pilot such aninitiative.Although banks have used financial advisers and insurance agents tomarket financial products in the past, no legal framework which definedand regulated the role of financial agents previously existed.The new law defines financial agents as mediators who, without beingemployees of the bank, habitually carry out determined bankingactivities on its behalf. The legal text stresses that financial agentsmust respect the same standards of transparency as banks, and cannotrepresent more than one bank or consolidated financial group, noroperate through sub-agents. That said, it is the bank or financialgroup that will be held responsible for any failure by the agent tocomply to banking standards and regulations.This introduction of the financial agent is as a result of EClegislation which allows banks to operate in other member stateswithout being obliged to have a banking presence there. However, it isthought that tied agents networks might also prove a popular option forthe smaller domestic banks. Combining an agent network with a telephonebanking service could be an effective way for banks to reach a widermarket, at a relatively low cost.Bankinter, one of Spain's most dynamic second-tier banks, has alreadybegun to recruit financial agents on an experimental basis and,according to a bank spokesman, hopes to have drawn up a definitenetwork plan within the next two months.Bankinter, which has a very small network - 253 branches -compared toits rivals, hopes tied agents will help it to expand rapidly in regionswhere it has no branch presence, as well as reinforcing its existingbranch network.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Mundial Confianca is the country's third-largestnon-life insurer and its eighth-biggest life insurer.The basic aim of the company's new image is the portrayal of stability,and at its core is the slogan "Live safely because life is a rollercoaster". The company has also changed its emblem from red and brown toblue and yellow."The old emblem was 15 years old and no longer reflected our corporateidentity," explained Paolo Bracon, Mundial Confianca's head ofmarketing, adding that the new colours are also those used by BancoTotta e Acores (BTA) and Credito Predial Portugues (CPP), both of whichare controlled by the owner of Mundial Confianca, Antonio Champalimaud."We want to show our customers that we are part of a much largerprivate financial grouping."The launch of the new look, at the end of 1995, was accompanied by amajor publicity campaign using all forms of media advertising. Thecampaign, which was designed by marketing company Neovox, is tocontinue throughout 1996 and, according to Bracon, the company will beusing this opportunity to launch a whole range of new productsthroughout the year, aimed principally at the personal lines sector."We are not looking to corner any particular segment of the market,however," he said. "We are a universal insurance company which cancover the needs of the entire market. So, while this year we will beconcentrating on one particular area, we will not be doing so at theexpense of other areas." Indeed, a whole range of Mundial Confiancaproducts will soon be available in all BTA and CPP branches. MundialConfianca already markets its products through another bank owned byChampalimaud, Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor."This will allow us to greatlyincrease the number of clients, which currently stands at about600,000," Bracon said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It also has a backupsystem whereby the client can obtain information without having tospeak directly to the officer, simply by touching the screen."The system allows a client to get up-to-the-minute information on anyof our products: how much it will cost to insure the contents of hishouse or how much his automobile insurance has gone up, etc," saidImperio's marketing director, Eugenia Coimbra. "The client can also useit to make an appointment with one of our agents. However, the realpoint of the new system is not just to complement our existingservices, but rather to introduce a human factor."Pilot trials on the booths revealed that many people initially feltextremely uncomfortable in them, but Imperio said it does not view thisas a real problem, "as the reaction to Multibanco booths was much thesame when they first appeared". Its primary targets are executives andeducated people "who don't like to stand in queues and are not afraidof new technology".Financially, the system has a clear advantage for the company, Coimbrasaid."It allows us to provide a 24-hour customer service with a minimumof staff and reduces the work-load of our staff during office hours."Imperio plans to increase the number of these booths in its branches to80 by the end of 1996 alone, and the long-term strategy is to have themfitted in all its branches. Similar booths are also to be fitted intoBanco Mello branches, which controls Imperio.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

AnnO'Dea analyses some of the findingsAROUND 88 percent of customers are satisfied with the service theyreceive from the German banking industry. This is one of the findingsof a representative study carried out by IPOS (Institute forPractically-oriented Social Research) of Manheim, and commissioned bythe German Bankers Association (Bundesverband deutscher Banken).This represents a rise in satisfaction of 4 percentage points, whencompared to a similar survey carried out by IPOS in the spring of 1995,and will be a relief to banks at a time when many European banks arecoming in for severe criticism from their retail customers.The recently-published results are based on 1,303 interviews, made bytelephone from October 30 to November 2 1995. The total of those whowere questioned is "a representative sample of voting citizens inGermany", the association said.The respondents were questioned on various points: the level of trustin their service providers; analysis of competence; location of theiraccounts; judgment of performance; standard of personal advice;confidentiality; influence of banks on the economy, specifically onpolitics.There was little fluctuation in satisfaction levels between differenttypes of institutions; commercial banks, savings banks and co-operativebanks. According to the association, this general satisfaction suggeststhat the financial service providers take justified criticismseriously, and are making an effort to improve. Those who confirmed inwriting that they are receiving an improved personal service rose from28 percent in the spring, to 33 percent in November.Customers were also asked to comment on the perceived competence of thebanks and, in this area, the commercial banks have the edge. While 57percent were of the opinion that there is no difference betweeninstitutions in this respect, and 19 percent left the questionunanswered, 14 percent believed that commercial banks display thegreatest competence. Only 5.6 percent pointed to savings banks and 4.4percent co-operative banks.As regards the standard of personal advice (see table 2), over half therespondents said the level has "hardly changed", but 32.6 percentbelieved it has improved.The findings on standards of personal advice contrasted significantlywith results of a recent survey by watchdog Finanztest (see BMI 63)which suggests that most retail banking customers are given scanty andill-considered advice.Researchers posed as would-be customers seeking advice, and visited thebranches of 21 different banks. The result? One-third of the 147 advicesessions were rated as "unsatisfactory" or"poor". This of coursesuggests that customers would be less aware of the shortcomings of onebank's investment advice than would be the various financial watchdogs.Customers were also asked if they felt that information on citizens'financial relationships was kept confidential by the banks and savingsbanks in Germany. While 46.5 percent believed it is, a significant 45.8percent did not.Respondents also answered questions on how they perceived the influenceof the banks on the economy and on politics. While 4.1 percent said itis not enough, and 30 percent said it is just right, over 50 percent ofrespondents felt that banks have too great an influence on the economy.Again, a high 44.6 percent of respondents felt their financialinstitutions have too great an influence on politics.TABLE 1: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION (OCTOBER 1995)Question: How satisfied are you with the services provided by your          bank or savings bank?

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightBANK MARKETING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BFG BANK STIRS GERMAN MARKETBfG Bank believes Germany is seeing a trend towards lower bank charges,and has decided to anticipate that trend with free banking. BMI takes alook at the bank's marketing strategyTHE FIRST nationwide German bank to introduce free banking hopes todouble its market share within two years and use cross-selling tocompensate for the lost bank charges.After carrying out extensive market research on a new strategy for itsretail banking business, BfG Bank has come up with a non-traditionalresponse. Rather than reducing its cost base and establishing astand-alone direct bank, the medium-sized institution has decided torely on the strengths of its existing branch network and offer freebanking across the board.Above all, BfG hopes to increase its market share - which is currentlyjust under 1 percent - to 2 percent in just two years. "The savingsbanks [Sparkassen] and co-operative banks have the dominant positionwith an 87 percent market share," said Paul Wieandt, chairman of theboard of managing directors. "Therefore, BfG Bank has to offersomething different from its competitors - and where it counts - inorder to have an impact on the market."Free banking may be old hat in other markets, but BfG's idea hascreated a stir in Germany. Although no-fee accounts have been triedbefore by small regional banks, BfG is the first nationwide institutionto attempt it. Last year, one of the big banks, Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank), offered free banking for an introductoryperiod of six months but had little success, probably because of aflawed marketing strategy (see BMI 61). By contrast, BfG intends tomake its free banking service permanent.Known as BfG plus, the new BfG current account offers an unlimitednumber of free transactions, personal advice in BfG branches, use ofATM machines, Eurocheques, an EC card and a Visa card. Unusually forthe German market, there is no additional charge for telephone bankingservices and no extra fees on overdrawn accounts, as long as thecustomer adheres to the agreed overdraft limit (except creditinterest).BfG admits that free banking will be a loss-maker unless the serviceattracts a substantial number of new customers (60,000 in the firstyear alone) and earns new income from cross-selling. In the past, BfGcurrent account customers have opted for an average of two furtherproducts from the bank and its allfinanz partners.Thus, the success of the venture depends crucially on the selling andadvisory skills of branch-based staff, and, consequently, BfG isplanning to improve its expertise. "Our advantage is the bank's size,"Wieandt said. "As a medium-sized bank . . . we are able to come up withinitiatives and new products which small regional banks could notafford to offer and which would be too expensive, i.e. unprofitable,for our large competitors."BfG has a network of 178 branches, compared with the 1,000 or sobranches run by its largest competitors such as Commerzbank andDeutsche Bank. That network was slimmed down during a restructuringseveral years ago.Free banking is also BfG's long-term response to a range of strategicchallenges, which Wieandt mapped out:- Branch-based banks such as BfG are under threat from non andnear-banks, which already control 10 percent of the retail financialservices market, and from direct banks, which Wieandt believes willgrab 15 percent of the market within five years.- Germany is over-banked and over-branched. It has one branch for every1,500 people, compared with 2,500 in the UK. By the year 2000, BfGexpects less than half of all transactions to be done in a branch,compared with around 60 percent at present.- Customers are increasingly responsive to price and quality. There isa trend towards lower bank charges, and BfG has decided to anticipatethat trend with free banking. "We aren't reducing bank charges, we'rebringing them down to zero," Wieandt said.- It is apparently no longer true that Germans are loath to switchbanks. BfG's market research has indicated that 70 percent of retailcustomers would consider changing to another bank, and around half ofthem would be motivated by lower charges.- Telecommunications are forcing the face of innovation in the Germanbanking market. Customers are increasingly receptive to telephonebanking, direct banking, electronic cash and PC banking.- Many direct banks and credit card issuers now pay interest on creditbalances:- Customers can reduce bank charges by making voucherless paymenttransfers."The transformation of the banking market has not left the retailbanking business untouched. It has long since made the transition fromseller's to buyer's market," Wieandt said.BfG has begun to build an innovative reputation over the past couple ofyears. It was one of the first German banks to introduce telephonebanking, and, in 1993, it successfully launched an account combiningbranch-based services and telephone banking. This month, the bank hasintroduced the mail-order sale and home delivery of traveller's chequesand cash in foreign currency. Furthermore, there are plans to establisha direct broker in the spring.Previously labelled the"trade union" bank and regarded as highlytraditional in strategy and marketing, BfG Bank was owned by aunion-controlled holding before its sale to Credit Lyonnais in 1992.The CL-BfG deal was the first sale of a large German bank to a foreigninstitution.At the time, market observers suggested that many German banks,weakened by low profitability, would have to decide whether they wantto make a serious commitment to universal banking or whether to lookfor a niche strategy. BfG now seems to have decided to focus on retailbanking, which has always been one of its most important businessareas.According to Wieandt, more than half of all claims on non-banks areloans to retail customers. On the liabilities side, 40 percent ofclaims from non-banks are deposits by retail customers. Moreover, theretail banking division contributes more than half of interest andcommission earnings.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

BMI reportsTHE BIG Four retail banks in Australia have all announced the launch ofnew basic "no-frill" accounts in the past few weeks.Banks had been set a December 31 deadline to respond to the - nowdefunct - Prices Surveillance Authority's (PSA) inquiry last summerinto bank fees and charges, which resulted from public disquiet overtheir high level.Among the PSA recommendations resulting from the inquiry is a greateruse of a "user pays principle" rather than fixed account-keeping fees.The authority also called for a "basic" account with no account-keepingfee and a number of "free" debit transactions per month before any feeswere applied.While each of the Big Four abolished the fixed monthly account-keepingfees from their new offers, the other features differed from one bankto another, and were greeted with varying reactions among consumerbodies and the powers that be.The Australian Consumers Association judged National Australia Bank(NAB) to be the only one of the Big Four to have introduced anacceptable basic transaction account. The product efforts from WestpacBanking Corporation, ANZ Banking Group and the Commonwealth Bank wereall judged as "could do better".NAB is pleased with the reception its new fees structure obtained, asit feels that the changes "reflect the views of current customers andthe outcome of government and community consultation"."We have listened to the concerns expressed about affordability, accessand the need for a more equitable approach," said Allan Diplock, chiefgeneral manager of NAB. "The outcome is a range of options that provideflexibility for customers and the opportunity to manage accounts in away that will ensure no fees are paid." This fits in well with the PSAwish to apply the "users pay" principle, thus not penalising those whocarry out a small number of transactions per month.The number of free transactions is one of the major bones ofcontention. NAB is offering eight free transactions monthly tocustomers with the `basic' account, after monitoring customer research,while the other three allow only six."Our records show that in a typical month less than 10 percent of ourcustomers with balances below A$500 would have more than eightwithdrawals," Diplock said. "That is why we've set the free withdrawallevel at eight."A spokeswoman for the association is also critical of the fees ofbetween 40 cents and 65 cents charged by Westpac, ANZ and CBA forexcess electronic transactions, particularly in view of NationalAustralia Bank's modest 25 cent fee.ANZ's basic Access Simplicity account came under pressure from thefederal treasurer who refused to comment on the account the day it wasannounced, whereas he had expressed satisfaction when NAB, CBA andWestpac made their announcements.ANZ is charging a higher than average fee for excess over-the-countertransactions - A$1.25 - but, according to a spokesman, this is designedto encourage customers to use an ATM or other electronic service,rather than branch transactions which cost the bank much more. CBA'seven higher fee of A$1.50 for the same excess came under fiercecriticism from the Consumers Association.However, Allan Fels, chairman of the Australian Competition andConsumer Commission, which took over the functions of both the PSA andthe Trade Practices Commission, recognised that all the Big Four bankshave "made moves in the right direction". The commission must now carryout an assessment of the fees structure and report back to thetreasurer, probably before March next.But how are the banks faring with the loss of revenue from cuttingfixed monthly bank charges? "You need to remember that while we losethe A$2 or so monthly fixed fee, we have also added the 25 cents chargefor excess transactions, which did not previously exist," said aspokesman for NAB."That will help offset the account-keeping fees, andoverall we believe the process will be revenue neutral."Another new charge at NAB is the 75 cents fee for withdrawing cash froman ATM outside the bank's own network. But customers need not fear -the bank is busy sending out explanatory literature to all 3 millioncustomers.Westpac too is going to great lengths to ensure its customers are wellinformed as to the new accounts it is offering. A sum of A$3 millionhas been spent on direct customer communication involving direct mailand advertising, in order to convey the changes to its 1.5 millioncustomers. Westpac had a time limit in that it launched its new rangeof accounts on January 15 - the remaining three will all see start-upin March.AUSTRALIA'S "BIG FOUR" - NEW BANK FEESThe `Basic' Account                        NAB   Westpac CBA   ANZCheque book                                Yes   No      No    NoAccount-keeping fee                        No    No      No    NoFree withdrawals/month                     8     6       6     6Charge per excess electronic transaction   25c   65c     45c   40cCharge per excess branch transaction       $1    $1      $1.50 $1.25Comes into force 1995                      March Jan 15  March MarchSource: Lafferty Group/The banksCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This isone of the conclusions of the study."In all likelihood an individual bank's strategy will be a hybrid ofthese three primary options," says Richard Hartnack, vice-chairman ofUnion Bank, and chairman of the Centre for Banking Issues andStrategies at BAI. "In addition, alliances among banks to aggregatetheir collective capabilities and scale will play an important role."When volume I of the report was published in the summer of 1995 (seeBMI 62), many banks still showed little interest or activity in on-linedelivery. However, as predicted by the authors at that time, the use ofon-line services and the Internet has grown significantly.The following are some of the more significant developments since thefirst part of the report was published, according to the authors:- A marked increase in the number of banks that have signed agreementswith entities focused on on-line delivery, such as Microsoft, Intuit,Visa Interactive and MasterBanking;- A significant increase in the number of banks that are staking outpositions as content providers on the major on-line services;- An explosion in Internet Web sites, by bank and non-bank playersalike;- The joint purchase of Meca Software by BankAmerica and Nationsbank;and- The aggressive development of strategic payments alliances, such asVisa and Microsoft; and MasterCard, IBM and Netscape.The report also draws attention to the rapid growth in the number ofusers of commercial on-line services and the Internet. At November1995, there were approximately 8 million subscribers to commercialon-line services, and about 10 million users of the World Wide Web partof the Internet.The result of this has been an increasing awareness of the necessityfor the banking industry to act now or be left behind, as well as arealisation of the threats and opportunities facing banks over the nextfew years."The task at hand for banks now shifts from deciding whether to takeaction to deciding how, in what form, and at what speed," the reportstates.Two issues dealt with in detail by the study are how electronic bankingwill affect customer behaviour and how banks are to determine thedesign of the product offering. A segmentation analysis is used toevaluate which customers are likely to be early adopters of on-linedelivery, and to assess likely future customer behaviour.The conclusions suggest that the barriers to on-line delivery are lowerthan might be anticipated, and that some of the most attractivecustomer segments for banks seem likely to be early adopters.KEY DESIGN ISSUES BY SEGMENTNew enthusiastsDescription:  Upscale, above-average income, secure about financial              future              Desire to learn new things              Usually married              Higher level of education,Issues:       Looking for convenience and time savings              Will use technology when offeredImplications: Attractive segment              May be retained by electronic bankingSurfersDescription:  Mostly young and single              Lower income; temporary for some within segment              Above average ability to use technologyIssues:       Will use technology              Concerned with security and privacyImplications: Many transaction accounts; cost-saving opportunities              May stop often with technology              May increase income in futureOld linersDescription:  Usually older and less wealthy              Capital depleting              Do not use new technologyIssues:       Like current system, comfortable              Probably will continue to use branch and teller              Some migration to ATM and phoneImplications: Least likely to move on-line              Some may move to screenphones, etc.              Lower prioritySource: BCG/BAIBut how does one forecast how customers will respond to on-linebanking? The study points to research which indicates that almost 70percent of current financial transactions are conducted using methodsother than branches and ATMs - phones, mail and AVRUs (Automated VoiceResponse Units). Almost half the remaining 30 percent are interactionswith ATMs. It concludes that customers who currently bank by phone orATM will migrate more rapidly to on-line banking."In many ways, the move from a branch to an ATM was a bigger shift forsome customer segments than the move from telephone to PC will be," theauthors say. "The first move required new behaviour; the second shiftrequires a more modest change in behaviour and is accompanied by asignificant increase in functionality."The study also makes an interesting point as regards thecannibalisation debate. It claims that rather than rendering the branchnetwork obsolete, as on-line banking takes hold it will cannibaliseexisting electronic bank delivery systems - "those used by the affluent`early adopters' of technology".There is also a feeling that the millions of dollars invested inelectronic projects, including screen-phones, may have been betterspent elsewhere. "Near term, only the PC is really viable," claims TomWurster, vice-president of the Boston Consulting Group. "The slowdownin the deployment of broadband services says to us that the PC willdominate on-line banking for the near to medium term."The study cites research which supports this thinking. PC with modemswill be in 40 percent of US households by the year 2000, it claims, andone of the most attractive segments of the banking community (under 30years, over $50,000 income) already has a PC/modem penetration of 43percent - four to five times higher than that in households withincomes below $30,000 (see figure 1).The principal "roadblocks" for these key customer segments is "the lackof compelling on-line content, easy ways to gain access to thatcontent, and a secure on-line payments system", the authors say, addingrather ominously that non-bank financial services players are currentlyfocused on providing these latter, particularly for these attractivecustomer groups.Because the different customer segments differ radically in theiropenness to on-line delivery, and use of banking products, the designof the on-line offering necessitates a close analysis of customersegments and product use. BCG uses a lifestyle segmentation format,developed by US market research firm Odyssey L.P., to make generalobservations on how different offerings will need to be designed toappeal to different segments, dividing customers into three possibletarget segments (see figure 2):- New enthusiasts: upscale, typically between the ages of 30 and 60,largely white collar;- Surfers: a subsegment of younger households, typically more highlyeducated with upscale potential; and- Old liners: retired customers with moderate or fixed incomes,typically below $50,000.These three segments, the study says, constitute a significantpercentage of the overall market, and are useful starting points whenlooking at the key considerations in the design of the offering bysegment.Banks have traditionally had a lower share of wallet with the wealthiercustomers between the ages of 30 and 60 - similar to the newenthusiasts. These potentially profitable customers typically haverelationships with several financial institutions, tending to usespecialist providers for some of the larger investments, like mortgagesor mutual funds. What is more, these are likely to constitute a veryattractive on-line segment.Attitudinal research, according to the study, would suggest that thissegment is often looking for convenience and time saving, and willoften opt for technology when offered.An on-line offering for these customers will need to address both thedesire for convenience and their specific life cycle product needs, theBCG concludes. A focus on the role of investment products, financialplanning, mortgages and so on may be necessary, as well as theinteractive on-line environment. The study offers the example of"integrated information, such as an on-line net worth statement, linkedto both bank holdings and other holdings" as a core informationoffering. Above all, it insists on the importance of being early withan on-line offering to this segment, so as to gain usage and loyalty,at a time when competing non-bank institutions are targeting this samesegment.Another key group for which to design an on-line offering may be thesurfer-type subsegment of under-30 households. Unfortunately, thissegment is typically unprofitable for the banks. "They keep smallbalances, use only a few products and generate many transactions."However, many of these households will become attractive customers asthey grow older and more successful.The authors suggest a streamlined offering, with lower delivery costswhile improving access and convenience, in this way increasingprofitability and retention. The on-line offering should take intoaccount the attitudinal and behavioural characteristics of thissegment. These customers are generally comfortable using technology andmay value the convenience of on-line delivery of statements and e-mailinquiries. It is also a segment associated with loans and creditfacilities so an offering which includes on-line credit applicationswith quick response could have particular appeal, for example.Retired customers with fixed incomes, similar to the old liners,represent one of those segments which are low priority when designingon-line offerings, in the short or medium term. These latter are oftenthe most frequent users of the branch, and lowest users of ATMs.Attitudinal research suggests these may be one of the hardest to switchto on-line delivery.In designing their on-line offerings, it is essential that the banksconsider the actions of the non-bank players who are busy designingtheir own, the report insists. "Financial services has many attributesthat make it a logical and attractive candidate for on-line delivery,"it points out. "Recent events have confirmed this view." The followingare laid out as some of the principal considerations in relation to thedesign of on-line offerings:The most innovative non-bank players have a significantly lowerdelivery cost structure than banks, in part because they do not havethe investments in brick and mortar that banks do. The possibility ofon-line delivery will probably cause them to see opportunities tofurther expand their customer relationships at the expense of banks.Some of these players have strong brand positions, national presences,and high shares of the early adopter segments of the market (e.g.surfers, new enthusiasts).Some of these players may also take advantage of their current brandpositions by expanding the range of products and information offerings.These offerings can easily be outsourced.Only by evaluating the differing motivations of the non-bank playerscan the banks come to understand the likely competitive threat from thedifferent on-line offerings, the report warns.The authors suggest a return to analysis of customer needs and productcharacteristics. Many of the surfers and new enthusiasts, for example,will prefer to shop for products, as opposed to having products sold tothem, and will thus react positively to an offering that includescomparison shopping. "If banks are hesitant to promote the products ofothers, their offerings will have less appeal to these customers," theauthors claim.Banks are also reminded of their own competitive advantages -owningcurrent customer relations with a high level of trust, wide range ofdelivery channels for customer convenience, payment systems access andaccess to customer data. The report concludes that transforming thisdata into customer information is one of the greatest challenges forbanks today, and will be crucial for an effective on-line presence.The platform options available to banks are numerous and prioritieswill have to be established from the start, the report says. Banks needto decide whether to develop their service on commercial OLS (on-lineservices), the Internet or both. Another option would be for banks todevelop a proprietary banking platform.The choice of a commercial OLS provider, like Microsoft's MicrosoftNetwork, has advantages like access to new customers and standardinterfaces for customers to use when carrying out their on-linetransactions. The report cites the example of Fidelity Investments inthe US which has a "strategy of ubiquity", aiming to get on the maximumnumber of OLS platforms as possible, while others prefer to be moreselective.Before choosing a platform provider, the report says, it is essentialto consider the following: the on-line service's customer base; on-linedelivery development, including software skills; brand visibility andpositioning; and ownership of customer information. It will also benecessary to look at the OLS's customer base and how it overlaps withthe bank's existing and target customer segments.While the Internet has been the subject of much hype, and we haverecently seen the creation of an Internet-based bank, Security FirstNetwork Bank, the report notes that it is far from certain how thisplatform will develop. Despite its huge popularity, the report pointsout that it is accessed by anyone, but controlled by no one, andquestions whether security on the Internet will ever be sufficient totransact financial services.Proprietary platforms, on the other hand, offer three principaladvantages: lack of an intermediary between the bank and the customer;complete control over content, navigation as well as the "look" and the"feel" of the service; and the lack of other financial serviceproviders vying for customers on the same platform. However, manycustomers have previously demonstrated their lack of interest inprovider-specific platforms."Each institution must map its objectives against the alternatives andthe uncertainties before deciding where and how to participate."Above all, BCG concludes that the banks must be alert to thecompetitive threats closing in on all sides and respond effectively."The banking industry stands at the crossroads," says David Taylor,executive vice-president of the BAI and co-director of the study."Theon-line services, software giants, global entertainment companies,telcos and utilities have the pipelines and the navigational tools. Ifbanks don't act with foresight and firm purpose, the prognosis is for acontinuing erosion of their core retail business."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

With 1997 rapidlyapproaching, Andrew Moody reports from a market where productdevelopment takes precedence over slick marketing campaignsFEW WORLD markets are now as attractive for marketing banking servicesas Asia, where there have been dramatic increases in personal wealthfor more than a decade. Per capita incomes in many of the so-called`Tiger' economies now exceed those in Europe and the rest of thewestern world.The region's banks face a tough challenge to develop new products andoffer ever improved services to capture this new wealth against abackground of fierce competition.Despite the spectre of 1997, nowhere is this more true than in HongKong, one of Asia's largest financial centres with more than 400domestic and foreign banks, although only 180 of them are licensed.Over recent months, in particular, all of the leading banks have beenlaunching products, hoping that a particular extra specification willbe enough to attract elusive customers.Like western banks, they have been trying to segment the market to makesure they do not fail to properly target the territory's burgeoningmiddle class population, the result of a decade or more of GDP growthof between 5 percent and 8 percent.The partial collapse of the so-called Hong Kong interest rate cartel,which made it difficult for the banks to compete on loan and depositrates, has also led recently to very aggressive price-driven marketingstrategies.Despite the competition, Hong Kong banks, unlike their westerncounterparts, meet with very little consumer resistance. The territoryis one of those rare places where banking and bankers are popular. Theaverage Hong Kong citizen has 2.4 bank accounts in 1.9 banks.Newspapers, both Chinese and English, are scoured for anyadvertisements signalling changes in deposit rates.Talking about banking and finance over dinner would not necessarilysingle you out as a crashing bore but just as someone talking about oneof the most interesting subjects around.The challenge for the banks is therefore not to come up with slicksubliminal advertising campaigns to make banking seem exciting because,in the minds of the consumer, it already is. Much of the marketingliterature is, therefore, matter of fact and very much to the point.Instead, what the banks have to do is not so much to work on the imagebut rather on the real products, a much more difficult exercise.All the banks spend considerable resources on product development sothey might have that added feature which influences a consumer's finaldecision.Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, one of the leading foreignbanks in the territory, which has just moved to luxurious new officesnear Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Quarry Bay, said the marketingchallenges for the bank are very different from those in the US."It is a unique market in many ways. People here are veryentrepreneurial and they have that mentality," he said. "If you go tothe US, nobody in the street is going to know what the dollar exchangerate is for the German mark but they would here."As a result, we have, to some extent, to launch aggressive productswhich are ahead of the competition."The leading product innovators in the market are, by common agreement,the Hong Kong Bank, the Hang Seng Bank (62 percent owned by the HongKong Bank but autonomous and independently listed), Standard Chartered,Citibank and Bank of East Asia.There has been much recent emphasis on packaged products in the market.Hong Kong Bank has launched Asset Vantage which gives those that haveaccess to it gold trading and the ability to hold deposits in differentcurrencies.And last July, Hang Seng Bank, the second-largest locally-incorporatedbank, launched its Bank-in-One account which consolidates a number offeatures including flexible overdraft and 24-hour automated phonebanking to the mass market customer. This was one of 17 new productslaunched by the bank last year.Despite the risks, foreign currency accounts are traditionally verypopular, even among mid-range customers, perhaps largely because ofHong Kong's trading nature.Other very popular products are tax loans which people take out becausethere is no PAYE or pay-as-you-go tax system in the colony.The key products, however, are deposit accounts and mortgages. Theseand not the cheque account - as in the west - are regarded as the coathanger product on which to build a long-term relationship.Alex Au, managing director of the Hang Seng Bank, said the importantthing is to establish a long-term relationship with a customer."This is what you have to do in banking everywhere, and probably thebest way to do it is through the deposit account or mortgage," he said."One can read too much into this as a cultural difference between usand the west since people here often use their deposit accounts thesame as a cheque account."Once you have got the customer, you can cross-sell other products,which enables you to build your competitive strategy and market share."The growing middle class has encouraged the banks to target their moreaffluent customers.It has even brought banks into the retail sector which weren'tpreviously there. One of these is ABN-AMRO which, although in theregion for 90 years, only decided to offer retail products three yearsago. These now bring in an incredible 30 percent of its Hong Kongprofits."We saw the middle and upper sectors of the market as a realopportunity and we have come in with a mortgage product which has aninterest rate 0.5 percent cheaper than most of our rivals," said SergioRial, ABN AMRO's general manager in Hong Kong."We are still very much building up our retail side but it is certainlya marketing strategy which has already paid off."Citibank too makes no bones about targeting the well off."The Hong Kong affluent are very much our target market and our minimumto open an account is $HK50,000 ($6,465)," Citibank's Wong said.Hong Kong Bank has gone further than most by developing new Selectbranches for its upper segment customers, leaving other customers toslum it in standard and automated branches.But Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing and planning withHong Kong Bank, insisted it is not ignoring other customers."Although we segment the market, banking is banking is banking isbanking," he said. "We can't really offer a significantly differentservice to one customer compared to another."Branch design has come to be a key element of any marketing strategy ofHong Kong banks.The banks are reluctant to reveal their expenditure on branches, butwith few exceptions they are among the most splendid examples of bothinterior and exterior banking architecture anywhere in the world.Branches are not just about getting customers inside, but about makinguse of the time customers spend within them. Customers very often usetheir local branches as meeting places for colleagues and friends.So, after they finish their business they often stand around engagingin long conversations, perhaps about the day's currency movements orthe latest rate of interest in the bank around the corner.Creating the right ambience in the banking hall is therefore important.The Bank of East Asia deploys music, ranging from light tunes in themorning to heavier up-beat music in the evening.HONG KONG FACTSPopulation                   6.15mLife expectancy              Males 75.4, Females 81GDP                          $HK151.0 billionPer capita income            $HK24,361Growth rate                  4.5%Inflation                    9%Prime interest rate          9%Money supply (M2) increase   18%Unemployment rate            3.5%The branches do, however, represent greater opportunities for marketingthan in Europe. Many of the banks have installed computer displayswhich give customers up-to-date information on products and markets.As Au said: "I think in terms of branches we are very much ahead ofbanks in the west. We place great emphasis on giving our customersfirst class service within the branches."Pricing in terms of interest rates on deposits and loans has become amuch more fundamental part of the marketing strategy since therelaxation of the cartel began in October 1994.Instead of being fixed by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, interestrates on deposit accounts held longer than seven days are now freelyfloating.This has led to a lot of market buying with banks trying to gain marketshare in new product areas by taking a loss lead position.Some of the bigger banks are concerned about this added uncertainty inthe market, particularly in the run-up to 1997 which creates more thana few uncertainties of its own.The Dah Sing Bank, a new entrant to retail, has been accused ofdeliberate market buying.It launched a credit card 18 months ago with a bonus scheme which gaveit an effective interest rate 25 percent below the competition. DerekWong, Dah Sing's head of retail, defended the strategy."I think the competition is now open and fair," Wong told BMI. "It isnow a matter of how you operate your business strategy which willdetermine how successful you are."Those marketing banking products in Hong Kong are as preoccupied withage targeting as their counterparts in the west.Most of the banks are keen to attract students, not only because theymay prove to be lifelong customers but because they are likely to bemonogamous in their banking habits - a rare quality in Hong Kong.They do this by offering discount credit cards and air miles, lessgimmicky offers than the record token and free gift offers of somewestern banks."The competition for students is driven partly because of this," saidDavid K.P. Li, deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of EastAsia. "The student does not have much money so he is unlikely to bankwith anyone else, which makes him or her a better all-round customer.You do, however, hope to hang on to them for the rest of their lives."Older people are also becoming increasingly a target market for thebanks. The average life expectancy for males in Hong Kong is 75.4 andfemales 81, compared to 73 years for men in the US and 79 for women.Hong Kong is therefore moving more rapidly to an ageing population thanmany countries in the west.The banks are responding by providing products geared specifically toolder customers.W.K. Mok, deputy general manager and head of retail in Hang Seng Bank,said investment and protection products are particularly attractive tothis market."We have specifically developed a greater array of insurance productsand wealth accumulation investment products to cater for this veryimportant market," he said. Citibank's Wong said banks are having tothink more and more of the life cycle in their product offer tocustomers."I think you have to look at taking the customer over, for example, at25 years. When he or she is younger, the credit card might be thedriving product, then the mortgage, then the savings account, thenforeign exchange and then insurance products," he said.Although Asia is becoming an increasingly attractive market for banks,it remains very difficult for outsiders to penetrate.Banks such as Standard Chartered and Hong Kong Bank have their roots in19th century colonisation and to all intents and purposes are localbanks rather than British ones.Across Asia, the US and European banks which have a presence have along association with the region. They also have a regionalinfrastructure with a network of branches across the key capitals andfinancial centres.It would, therefore, be difficult for a carpet-bagging bank just totarget, for example, Hong Kong, because it would be at an immediatecompetitive disadvantage with other banks which could offer regionalservices."I think if you were going to set up in Asia it would be very difficultjust to set up in Hong Kong. You really need a presence across theregion. You could get lost," said ABN-AMRO's Rial.A key element of future marketing strategies will undoubtedly be China.The branches that banks have there tend to be there to facilitatebusiness between the mainland and Hong Kong and for the Chinesebusinessman. But, as the Chinese market liberalises and a retailbanking demand emerges, the Hong Kong banks will be in a betterposition than most to take advantage."While Hong Kong is likely to remain a key component of the HSBCGroup's business well into the foreseeable future, our mainlandoperations will grow increasingly important," said Hong Kong Bank'sTai."Foreign banks are unable to deal in the renminbi, the local currency,at present. But this will eventually change and when it does we will beready to take the initiative."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightBANK MARKETING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWSThe way in which banks market their electronic banking services isoften fundamentally flawed, according to Richard G Lyons of InternetInc.WHILE MOST retail bankers see their electronic banking services as apriority, they are making some common mistakes in the way they marketthem to their customers. This is the claim made by Richard G Lyons Jr,executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Internet Inc.,which operates the Most ATM network in the US.Many retail bankers have not yet made clear the message they wish toconvey to those customers who might be interested in electronicbanking, he said at the BAI (Bank Administration Institute) RetailDelivery Systems conference last month.While almost 63 percent of retail bankers believe their electronicbanking services save money, only 17 percent feel their institution is"where it needs to be in its electronic banking programme". These aresome of the results of recent research that Lyons shared with thedelegates. Only 42 percent believe their institutes "have a clearstrategy for where we're going with EFT [Electronic Funds Transfers]".Internet's research involved extensive interviews with retail bankingmanagers, marketing managers and branch managers from 140 differentfinancial institutions. A large majority agreed that electronic bankingis a priority. Yet, many admitted they are not spending enough time ormoney on it, and are not investing enough in training for staff.Only 18 percent of interviewees agreed that "we spend enough time andmoney promoting electronic banking". While 87 percent agreed thatelectronic banking transactions at their institutions are increasingevery month, 73 percent admitted "Our branch personnel probably have alower understanding of EFT than I.""Consumers' antennae are up higher when they need what you're selling,"Lyons stated, insisting that banks would have a far greater degree ofsuccess marketing their electronic services if customers were madeaware that it allows them a hassle-free lifestyle. Yet, he said, 65percent of bankers agreed that "at account opening, we spend more timewith cheque choices than explaining electronic banking options".Indeed, the research found that a mere 27 percent of retail bankersagreed that their customers are "well aware of all our electronicbanking services".Over half of the bankers interviewed felt customers are not yet readyfor many EFT programmes, but Lyons suggested this might be a falsepresumption and pointed to a recent survey in which 64 percent of totalhouseholds agreed "using electronic banking services is more convenientthan going to a branch". He claimed that consumers are much morewilling to use alternative delivery channels than banks realise, andthat banks need to communicate the availability of such channels inorder to compete.There seemed, from the research, to be a realisation among financialinstitutions of the threat from non-bank institutions. While only 18percent agreed that banks are in control of the emerging consumerelectronic delivery channels, 70 percent agreed that"Microsoft andregional telephone companies could someday [soon] threaten to siphondeposits away from financial institutions". Indeed, 87 percent ofinterviewees felt that non-banks are in a position to compete with theelectronic banking delivery systems owned and operated by banks.Lyons suggested that many changes in attitude are needed to be made inorder that bankers make a success of their electronic bankingstrategies. What are needed are clear marketing objectives, customerfocus, effective brand management and good investment, he said.FIGURE 1AS THE POPULATION AGES, ELECTRONICS USERS BECOME THE MAJORITY              Total households         Electronic users (%)              1995     2005            1995     2005Under 25       5,156     5,314         45       6025-34         19,229    16,949         60       7535-49         31,660    34,121         51       7050-64         21,024    28,403         37       5165+           21,664    24,451         17       27Total         98,733   109,238         42       5620 million more "electronics" users over the next decadeSource: InternetCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might become thenation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEO ofRaymond James bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically andelectronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial servicesso all their financial services can be received from our firm," she said.     The bank's initial target market will be the company's hefty customerbase of some 300,000 securities clients. Raymond James actually has400,000, but some of the accounts are linked and Schefstad preferred themore conservative estimate of 300,000 to describe her potential customerbase.     "We'll be able to offer our clients several product choices. We havethe FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweep account) option, andthe third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstad explained. The Heritagefunds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.     The company will continue its tradition of not incenting brokers tosell proprietary products. "The compensation for our three options isconsistent for all three product options," Schefstad pointed out. In fact,this compensation practice has worked to the detriment of the Heritage fundfamily. Growth of its individual funds hasn't even come close to otherbrokerage houses proprietary funds despite the company's nationwide branchnetwork.     Schefstad claims that James is the only broker/dealer to wholly own afull-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, which must resort tothe "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the banking business, Jamespurchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of $12 million fromthe Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the company chartered the RaymondJames Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate in all 50 states. Thebank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million in assets and $136 millionin deposits.     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has been wrestlingwith regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies and integratingthe bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.     "Because of who owns us for everything we have done we obtainedregulatory approval. For example, when we developed our consolidatedstatement we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosure policy andseparation of accounts," Schefstad said.     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near its headquartersin Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank's efforts to takeplace electronically, particularly through the nationwide automated tellermachine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATM isn't yet possiblebut Schefstad said the firm's brokerage clients are sophisticated enough tounderstand and use direct-deposit options available through the automatedclearing house system.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK MUTUAL FUND REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996OCC READIES INSURANCE EXAM ACTIVITIESThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is preparing for the daywhen national banks receive insurance powers. The Washington-basedregulator has created a task force to consider how a national bank'sinsurance activities should be supervised. The Comptroller has created thetask force in anticipation of Barnett Banks winning its landmark casescheduled for this month in the U.S. Supreme Court. A win for Barnett isgenerally interpreted as blanket permission for national banks to sellinsurance.     "They (the OCC) are laying the groundwork for determining quickly hownational bank insurance activities should be supervised," said one bankerfamiliar with the OCC's secret task-force meetings. He said similarmeetings were held several years ago to discuss how the OCC should regulatethe sale of mutual funds by banks -- well before the OCC published itsguidelines.     Under examination, sources said, are the issues of licensing for bankemployees and the development of either regulations or guidelines governinginsurance sales but not both. The difference is crucial. Violatingguidelines usually brings little more than a wrist-slapping to theoffending bank. Violating regulations brings down the whole panoply offines, dismissals, and bank takeovers.     For example, violating an OCC cease-and-desist order can bring finesup to $1 million daily against the banks as well as their officers anddirectors.     The Comptroller's Office decided to go ahead with the insuranceexamination task force after meeting with representatives of the AmericanBankers Association and the Bankers Roundtable. Attending the task forcesessions, sources said, were Konrad Alt, chief assistant to ComptrollerEugene A. Ludwig, and General Counsel Julie Williams. The task forcereportedly is expected to decide its next steps -- still unclear -- bytoday.     The OCC task force is apparently a reaction to rumblings on CapitolHill where, reportedly, insurance industry lobbyists are telling members ofCongress that the Supreme Court ruling will not address the issues ofsupervising and licensing bank insurance activities.     Banking industry officials charge the insurance lobbyists areindulging in "scare tactics" to influence Congress to answer the courtruling with legislation that will brunt the effect of a win for Barnett.The banking officials characterize the insurance lobbyists' concerns asunwarranted. They further say the OCC is trying to be proactive to reassureCongress that the OCC will continue to monitor, examine, and regulate allnational bank activities.     "Indeed, this oversight would be considered suffocating by regularinsurance agents," a banking industry lobbyist said.     Among the questions raised during the task force meetings, accordingto a banker who attended, was the issue of whom the agency should consultbefore putting the final touches on its insurance rules. Among thosesuggested were state insurance commissioners and the banking and insuranceindustry trade groups.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK MUTUAL FUND REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FED ALLOWS ANNUITY SALES IN SECTION 20 SUBSIDIARIESThe Federal Reserve Board will allow banks to consolidate theirannuity sales and brokerage activities under the terms of a no-actionletter the Fed published last month. The regulatory agency declined to namethe bank holding company receiving the permission.     The newly permitted activity allows a bank to use its employees of anonbank subsidiary of the holding company, i.e., a Section 20 subsidiary,to also sell annuities. The Fed's general counsel, Virgil Mattingly, signedthe letter which is an indication of the importance the letter had taken inthe eyes of the Fed staff and the Board of Governors.     The no-action letter, dated December 6, establishes a format thatcontemplates two forms of contracts. The first is a contract between athird-party vendor and the Section 20 subsidiary. The other involves acontractual lease of space between a vendor and the bank. The assumption ofthe no-action letter is that the banking subsidiary of the holding companycan either engage in annuity sales under state law or can sell annuitiesbecause it is a national bank.     The particular format approved by the Fed works only if the bankholding company uses a vendor offering brokerage services through theSection 20, and the employees selling the annuities work for both theSection 20 subsidiary and the third-party vendor.     Some critics of the Fed's action charge that the arrangement isconvoluted and not as simple as the authority granted freely by theComptroller of the Currency. This is true. And a 14-year-old banking law isthe reason. There is a specific reference in the Garn-St Germain Act of1982 barring annuity sales by holding companies. So, the Fed created theconvoluted annuity sales structure to accommodate the Garn-St Germainrestrictions.     The Comptroller has already allowed dual employee relations fornational bank annuity sales. The structure is simpler for two reasons.First, the Valic decision gives national banks the power to sell annuitiesand, second, the incidental powers authority of the Comptroller makes iteasier for the regulator to authorize annuity sales.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK MUTUAL FUND REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996KEYCORP PURSUES SMALL BUSINESS 401(K) PLANSAdd Cleveland's KeyCorp to the list of banks eyeing the hotlycontested small-business market for defined contribution plans.

This has clearly changed.     For example, 40% of the survey's respondents said that sale of mutualfunds in the supermarket branches was important. Only a few banks operatingin-store branches offer investment products but this is likely to change asthe number of in-store branches continues to grow.

The rules are circulating among the council's 38members and will be released to the public by March.  Recommended rulesinclude:* Printing balances on receipts.  Terminal drivers must print a recipient'saccount balance on the transaction receipt for approved food stamp purchases,food stamp refunds and when a food stamp purchase is denied due toinsufficient funds.  Printing a balance is optional for cash benefits at thepoint-of-sale.  Terminal drivers aren't required to print balances undercommercial rules.* Record retention.  Operating rules should reflect commercial standards andrequire issuing or acquiring financial institutions to keep transactionrecords for at least two years.  Food stamp records must be kept three yearsby issuing institutions.* ATM transactions.  Recipients should be able to download at least $20 and amaximum of no less than $200 from ATMs.  Most EFT networks currently provideminimum and maximum withdrawal requirements.* Technical specifications.  Participating cards must comply with IndependentSales Organization and American National Standard Institute operatingstandards.  Primary account numbers must be displayed on the face of thecards, and a signature panel or signature image is required.* Settlement procedures.  Settlement procedures will mirror commercialstandards where settlement takes place on a daily basis.* Scrip machines (under review).  Scrip machines can be used for dispensingbenefits as long as they're treated as point-of-sale terminals and not ATMs.With scrip machines, recipients get vouchers that can be redeemed for cashfrom a store clerk.Tom McLaughlin, vice president with Milwaukee-based Deluxe Data, takes issuewith several rules, including the option of printing account balances onreceipts for cash benefits at the point-of-sale.

Theprice is clearly marked, and if it's too high the grocer will soon knowbecause his shelves will remain full.That's not been the case for the price of using an ATM in most areas, asnetworks rules have prevented ATM owners from charging the consumer directlyfor getting cash.  But the industry appears poised on the brink of afundamental shift in the pricing of ATMs as major networks relax theirsurcharging bans and allow market forces to determine the price of a servicemany consumers have come to view as a necessity.And early returns from markets that allow surcharging suggest consumers mayvalue the convenience of ATMs more than many in the industry believed.The momentum toward surcharging has grown in recent years as 14 states passedlaws that allowed surcharging, overriding the restrictions of both theVisa/Plus and MasterCard/Cirrus national ATM networks.  While surchargingspread rapidly in those states, many of them heavily touristed areas in theSouth and West, the Plus and Cirrus rules effectively prevented the practicefrom spreading to the major population centers of the Northeast, Midwest andWest Coast.The big breakthrough came last fall when Plus announced it would allowsurcharging at ATMs bearing its logo beginning April 1.  Last month, thelargest of the regional networks that still banned surcharging, Delaware-basedMAC, announced it, too, would allow the practice on April 1.Industry participants now expect Cirrus and other major regional networks tofall into line.  "I would imagine it would be a foregone conclusion," saysCharles Raphael, first vice president of electronic banking at First ChicagoNBD.  "In order to hold their members, and obviously the big deployers ofATMs, I don't think they would have a choice."  A Cirrus spokesperson says,"It is very likely the Cirrus board will take up this issue at its nextmeeting, which probably will be in March."With Plus and many of the larger regionals allowing surcharging, the holdoutsare left in a position many view as untenable.  If Cirrus were to maintain itsban, an ATM deployer in California, for instance, could place a machine withthe logos of Star System, which allows surcharging, and Plus, and serve thebig majority of consumers.Regionals Feel the HeatAnd if Cirrus does allow surcharging, the pressure will shift to regionalnetworks like Virginia-based Most that maintain the ban.  Because a Mostmember must put its ATMs into the network, it would not be able to surcharge,while a competitor that did not belong to the network could surcharge on amachine bearing the Plus and Cirrus logos and accept most ATM cards.Rather than put its members at a disadvantage, the Most board will reconsiderits policy at a meeting later this month, says David A.  O'Connor, presidentof the network.  "We see the pattern," he says.  "The forces of themarketplace seem to be driving the industry towards surcharges.  I thinkthat's a fairly strong movement that we probably won't resist."  Executives atMichigan-based Magic Line, the seventh-largest network, and Missouri-basedBankMate, the ninth-largest, say they, too, may have to reconsider theirsurcharging bans.New RulesSome networks whose owners oppose surcharging, such as Chicago-based CashStation, may hold the line for a while, says George Albright, president of theAtlanta-based Speer & Associates consulting firm.  "But, over time, as theownership changes as a result of mergers, and banks come in that aresurcharging in other regions, you're not going to just be able to say, 'Ourrules don't allow it.' They'll say, 'Let's change the rules,'" Albright says.Why are more banks anxious to surcharge now?  Industry participants offer manyexplanations, but among the most common is the growing pressure on banks togenerate increased non-interest income.  "People see a lot of untappedpotential in ATMs," says Raphael.  "The hardware and the switching system arethere, so the additional revenue you can produce off that network is almostpure profit."  Another banker who requested anonymity observes, "For ATMdeployers, this is a Christmas present of enormous potential."Off-Premise RivalryAt the same time, non-banking companies, such as Texas-based Electronic DataSystems, and Affiliated Computer Services, have been moving aggressively intooff-premise locations.  Banks, which enjoy low maintenance costs and no rentalfees when placing ATMs in their own lobbies, have moved more slowly becausethey were not certain they could generate enough revenue from off-premiselocations to justify the investment, observes David Baker, director ofmarketing at Fujitsu-ICL Systems Inc., an ATM manufacturer."But," Baker adds, "they don't want to see all the locations snapped up bynonbank deployers.  Bigger banks are saying, 'Give us the opportunity tosurcharge, lower the transaction volume needed for profitability, and we'regoing to go head-to-head with ACS and EDS.'" As an example of that approach,Baker points to NationsBank's outbidding EDS and ACS in August for thecontract to place ATMs in 661 Stop-N-Go convenience stores owned by NationalConvenience Stores in Texas, a state that allows surcharging.The successful implementation of surcharging by some major banks also hasinfluenced their peers, says Albright.  Among large banks, he says, thepioneer was Bank One of Texas, which began the practice in 1993, and led theway in raising the typical surcharge in the state from 25 cents to 50 cents."They showed they could do it and not get hurt in the marketplace," he says."All of a sudden the whole state of Texas was charging and the price went upto 50 cents."Many Will PayAlbright says developments in Texas and other states suggest consumers arewilling to pay more for ATM convenience than they were being charged.  Hepoints out that at the same time as surcharges were being imposed in Texas,issuing banks raised the foreign fees they charge their customers who use ATMsnot owned by the bank.  "The typical foreign fee went from 50 cents to $1.25,and some banks are charging $1.50," Albright says.  With Bank One and otherTexas institutions raising their surcharges to $1 in recent months, manyconsumers now are paying more than $2 to use an ATM, counting both foreignfees and surcharges.  "And exactly the same thing has happened in the state ofGeorgia just from March 1995 to the end of the year," says Albright.Is the price too high?  Apparently not for many consumers, based on networkreports of only temporary declines in transaction volumes.  Network officialsin Alabama reported an initial drop in volume of 8% and in Texas of 15%,Albright says, "but everyone tells me after six to nine months it comes back."And that occurs despite the spread of surcharging in most cases to includemany machines on bank premises as well as off.  Network executives say 75% ofATMs surcharge in Alabama, 60% in Texas and more than half in Utah.Ultimate TestNonetheless, some believe surcharging will spread more slowly in the majorNorthern cities.  Lynch says some NYCE members may not surcharge at all inhopes of pressuring competitors to refrain from the practice.  "There are manylarge organizations that have the point of view the revenue isn't worth therisk to the customer relationship," he says.Albright and Lynch both warn that consumer advocates and regulators are morelikely to raise objections in the Northeast than elsewhere.  And, Albrightadds, "the New York press will jump on it, whether the rest of the country isdoing it or not."With all those factors, he says, the Big Apple may be the ultimate test forsurcharging.  "If the same thing happens in New York that has happened inGeorgia and Texas," he says, "then surcharging will have become the norm."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996Deluxe Corp.

Adds Yanak,Benton's interim role "may signal there isn't anyone inside the company that'slikely to get the job."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996The Quest Begins For A National EBT NetworkIn the early days of ATMs, customers could only use their cards in machinesowned by their own bank.  To give the ATMs more value, financial institutionsformed shared EFT networks so that customers could use their cards in machinesowned by other banks, including those in different parts of the country.  Thenetworks then teamed up with retailers to let customers use their cards tomake purchases at the point-of-sale.Now a second electronic payment evolution is underway.  But rather than createmore national ATM and POS networks, coalitions are forming for interstate EBT.State governments involved in electronic benefits transfer programs areteaming up with other industry participants to let welfare recipients receivebenefits at ATMs and POS terminals across state lines.  While some states havealready rolled out EBT programs, recipients from one state usually can'treceive benefits in other states because the programs don't have commonoperating rules.  The National Automated Clearing House Association'selectronic benefits council is trying to change that by developing commonrules.The electronic benefits council, a multi-industry trade group that includesstate governments, retailers, third-party processors and EFT networks, adopteda set of standards in principle late last year (see sidebar).  The rulesrepresent the first major action of the council created in September incollaboration with the U.S.  Department of Treasury and the Federal EBT TaskForce, a federal agency that oversees EBT implementation.  The council also isnegotiating with the board of directors of the Quest shared EFT network to usethe Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards.Common Rules"Rather than have 50 states develop their own systems individually, we'retrying to lay the framework in advance so everyone knows what to expect," saysHelena Sims, senior director of the council.  While states with current EBTprojects can negotiate with EBT contractors in other states to let recipientsreceive benefits across state lines, the process is often burdensome andtime-consuming, she says.  And because most EBT contracts have a five-yearlimit, the agreements have to be constantly renegotiated with new contractors.Some industry participants, however, believe the council faces a tough task increating national operating rules that all EBT participants can agree on."The effort is noble, but it's as unattainable as worldwide peace," saysStephen Cole, president of the Chicago-based Cash Station EFT network.  "EveryATM network has different rules depending on state and local laws, and comingup with one set is very difficult.  They said they're going to have the rulesready by March, but I'd be surprised if they have them out by December."Skeptics say rules developed by shared EFT networks and state and federalgovernments already do the job.  The contradiction of existing rules is onearea of concern.  If an ATM overdispenses $10, for example, a network and bankare permitted under network rules to reconcile the transaction without theconsumer's knowledge.  With food stamps, however, it is considered an adverseaction under federal law to debit a recipient's account without notice."The council is addressing issues that are covered by network, state andfederal regulations, and we're concerned about duplication and conflict," saysThomas McLaughlin, vice president of Milwaukee-based Deluxe Data Systems.  "Ifthere are EBT policies that are contrary, who will arbitrate the disputes?"James McCarthy, executive vice president with the San Diego-based Star SystemEFT network and chairman of the electronic benefits council, says the issue ofaccount adjustments can be resolved.  "As a network, I operate a lot ofgateways with people who have different rules than me.  They're notconflicting, just different.  We're working with state and federal personnel,as well as networks and financial institutions, to come up with procedures."Advantage To RetailersRetailers stand to gain from the electronic benefits council's efforts."Retailers who participate in EBT programs should benefit from the efforts ofthe EBT council," says David Bragin, treasurer of Florida-based Winn Dixiesupermarkets.  "If the states adopt these national operating rules, any EBTcardholder or authorized retailer will be able to conduct EBT transactions nomatter which government entity issued the benefits or in which state theretailer operates."  Winn Dixie has approximately 1,175 stores in 14 states.While each state has the option to follow the operating rules, the eight-stateSouthern Alliance of States and seven-state Northeast Coalition areincorporating the rules into their contracts.  The two programs comprisenearly 50% of all welfare recipients in the U.S.  The rules must comply withfederal requirements that EBT programs not be more expensive to run thancurrent paper-based systems, says Dan Berry, program manager with New YorkState.  "The bottom line is these systems have to be cost-effective," he says.Although welfare benefits-such as food stamps and Aid to Families withDependent Children-are usually redeemed in the state where the recipientlives, the U.S.  government also plans to use EBT programs to distributebenefits to a population that is more likely to travel, such as SocialSecurity recipients.  "These programs will eventually deliver much more thanjust welfare benefits," Berry says.  Additional benefits may include militaryand railroad pensions and unemployment insurance.To let consumers know where they can receive their benefits, the council isnegotiating with the owners of the Kentucky-based Quest shared EFT network touse the Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards.  The mark would bedisplayed on cards, ATM and POS terminals and at merchant locations.  TheQuest network dissolved in July, 1995, after its members migrated to theDelaware-based MAC regional EFT network.Buying A LogoUsing an existing logo is cheaper than developing a new logo, Sims says.  "Ifyou start from scratch, there's a lot of paperwork and forms you must fill outin developing a logo," she says.  The council hopes to complete thenegotiations by the end of January, she adds.  The logo would be purchasedwith funds collected from member dues.  Terms of the deal, including what thecouncil will pay to use the logo, were not revealed.In the event the deal does go through, the Quest EBT network would be similarto the Plus and Cirrus national ATM networks, McCarthy says.  If a recipientfrom New York uses his card at a Quest ATM in Florida, for example, thetransaction would be sent to the government-designated issuer in the SouthernAlliance of States who would route the transaction to the Northeast Coalitionfor authorization.  The transaction would then be switched by a regionalnetwork or other entity designated by the prime contractor in the SouthernAlliance of States.  Supermarket chains with a presence in both EBT programsmay opt to switch transactions themselves, McCarthy adds.  "We're trying toallow as much flexibility as possible," he says.And the state coalitions should bring sizeable volume to regional EFTnetworks.  That's particularly true with the Northeast Coalition.  "Bybringing welfare recipients into the EFT networks, we're bringing a hugevolume to the market that was never there before," says William Kilmartin,Massachusetts comptroller and vice chairman of the electronic benefitscouncil.  The Northeast coalition, for example, will bring approximately twomillion new cardholders into the New Jersey-based NYCE shared EFT network, hesays.  By providing each cardholder with four transactions per month, thecoalition could bring NYCE at least 96 million new transactions each year."If [NYCE] is paid per transaction, and we double their volume, it's extremelysignificant for them," he says.  The Northeast Coalition plans to announce thewinning bidder later this month.Some industry participants are concerned the council could impose a licensingfee on financial institutions and merchants who use the logo.  Elliot McEntee,NACHA president, says some form of fee may be imposed, but it won't be largeenough to inhibit participation.  "There may be a charge to cover the costs ofdistributing the logo, but it's not a money-making venture," he says.While the electronic benefits council faces a tough task developing rules thateveryone can agree on, most industry participants believe there should be anational set of operating rules as EBT takes on a national flavor.  "If wetake on a national approach, instead of each state building its own EBTsystem, it'll be much easier to bring on additional benefits," Kilmartin says."Once we figure out a common ground, it'll be cheaper and better foreveryone."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996Visa Aims For Debit Summit From Plus' Denver BaseHis first priority after taking the helm of the Plus System, says David A.Brooks, was to calm fears of wholesale changes at Visa's national ATM network.But the rest of his to-do list includes plenty of change, including a broaderrole for Visa in debit processing and more prominent use of the Visa name atATMs.Much will stay the same, however, says Brooks, 55, who was named actingpresident and CEO last month.  He replaces Denny D.  Dumler who resigned tohead up TransAlliance, a new joint venture between Electronic Data Systems andthe owners of the Washington-based Exchange regional ATM network.  The Plusboard is expected to ratify Brooks' appointment later this month.For one thing, he has assured Plus members, the team running the network willremain in place.  "They were concerned Visa not do anything that would givepeople concern for their futures and disrupt operations by having defections,"says Brooks.  Nor are there plans to move the network out of Denver, Brookssays.Remote ControlBrooks' own home base and responsibilities also change little.  He remains atVisa headquarters in San Francisco and retains the title of executive vicepresident of market development at Visa U.S.A., a job he took two years agoafter holding retail banking and administrative posts at First National Bankof Chicago, Crocker Bank and Citicorp.Some observers wonder how effectively Brooks can guide Plus from afar, as wellas about his limited EFT experience.  "He's a very capable man, but he's notan EFT guy," says one regional network executive.  "And Brooks remaining inSan Francisco doesn't sound like a strong management move for Plus."Brooks emphasizes the experience of the Plus team resident in Denver, led byRon Reed, senior vice president, as well as the benefit of his remaining inSan Francisco.  "My value is integrating Plus into the mainstream of Visa," hesays.  And, he adds, a major focus of Plus will remain a project that is wellunderway:  the deployment of a new debit processing platform of TandemHimalaya computers and Deluxe Data Systems software that Visa has installed inDenver at a cost of "multiple millions of dollars."The new platform will ultimately support all of Visa's debit products,including Plus, the Interlink point-of-sale network and the Visa checkoff-line debit card.  While Plus is not scheduled to move to the new platformuntil 1997, the first Visa check customer will go live by February, accordingto Reed.That will put the Visa/Plus data center into competition with third partiesthat handle the bulk of processing for Visa check, as well as for MasterCard'sMasterMoney off-line debit card.  And that's just the beginning of thecompetition they'll be getting from Visa, as Brooks says the new platform hasthe capacity to offer processing services to regional networks, which wouldpit Visa against major processors such as Deluxe Data and EDS, as well as someof the regional networks themselves.Brooks calls this a step towards greater EFT efficiency.  "As an industry," hesays, "we have to get rid of redundancies in systems and networks.  Ourstrategy will be to offer this functionality to our customers at the lowestpossible cost."Some network executives applaud the effort.  "The financial industry needs torespond with processing capability that's superior to what nonbanks canoffer," says Richard Lyons, chief operating officer of Virginia-based Most.Others point out competition is keen in EFT processing.  "How successfulthey'll be depends a great deal on what they offer and at what price," saysRichard P.  Yanak, president of New Jersey-based NYCE.  "That's become a verylow-margin business because competition has driven down the price."While Visa tried unsuccessfully to enter the processing arena in the early'90s, several observers say they're not surprised by Visa's new foray into EFTprocessing or MasterCard's decision last year to acquire the BankMate regionalnetwork and bring in-house processing for its Cirrus national ATM network"MasterCard and Visa have got a lock on the credit card side of electronicpayments, but not on debit," says a regional network executive.  "If they canget a lot of transactions running through their computers they'll have atoehold that would be difficult to pry loose."While the battle for transaction volume rages behind the scenes, Brooks saysthere may be more visible changes in the Plus logo at the ATM.  He says Visais "about 75% of the way through a major brand study" that indicates Plus isincreasingly known by its target audience of people who travel, but still hasnowhere near the recognition of Visa.  While he does not anticipate droppingthe Plus logo, he says he could envision a brand name such as "Plus by Visa"that would emphasize the connection.A final change Brooks foresees is the completion in November of Visa'sacquisition of Plus, a deal announced in 1993.  The price was not disclosed.While some insiders have wondered whether Visa, with its credit card emphasis,would make the final payment, Brooks says the sale will go through.  "We'vegot a total debit strategy, and I don't know why we would want to back awayfrom that," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996When It Comes To ATM Deposits, Money TalksFor many consumers, withdrawing cash from an ATM is as commonplace as buying apack of gum from a convenience store.  By swiping a debit card and entering apersonal identification number, consumers can access funds and be on theirway.But while financial institutions have succeeded in getting people to use ATMsto make withdrawals, convincing them to make deposits is another story.According to a national survey in late 1994 by Atlanta-based SynergisticsResearch Corp., 92% of 613 ATM users made cash withdrawals at ATMs, while only32% of the consumers used ATMs to make deposits.Industry insiders point to several factors discouraging consumers from makingATM deposits, ranging from fears a check will collect dust in the bottom of aterminal to safety concerns about filling out a deposit envelope at a poorlylit machine.  Worries that a deposit won't be promptly credited-or credited atall-also contributes to consumer unease.  The ATM deposit slip does little tocalm those fears, they say."Many consumers have a fear of the unknown-depositing checks at ATMs issomething they haven't done," says Anne Morgan Moore, Synergistics ResearchCorp.  president.Financial institutions have used a number of strategies to overcome thosefears, ranging from financial incentives that reward ATM deposits to $3 feesfor each teller transaction.  Other institutions have deployedadvanced-function terminals that lift an image of a deposited check onto theATM screen to let consumers know their check isn't falling into a bottomlesspit.Financial IncentivesCleveland-based KeyCorp is using both financial incentives and penalties toencourage ATM deposits.  KeyCorp introduced a checking account late last yearthat pays consumers 25 cents for each ATM deposit.  The KeyMoney Accessaccount pays consumers up to $1 a month, requires no minimum balance andcarries no fees.  Consumers are charged $1.50 for in-branch deposits.  Theaccount is available in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana and will be rolled out toall KeyCorp branches by March.Larry Peterson, KeyCorp senior vice president, says the bank savesapproximately 50 cents on each ATM deposit, excluding the price of themachines.  Consumers that make four ATM deposits per month are paid a maximumof $1, netting the bank around $1 in profit.  "This is not a tremendous moneymaker," he says.  "We're paying customers to learn about the functionality ofATMs and get comfortable with the machines."The KeyMoney Access account isn't the first time KeyCorp has used incentivesto change consumer behavior.  The bank launched three 60-day marketingcampaigns in the fall of 1994 that rewarded a consumer with $5 if three out offive monthly ATM transactions were deposits.  The bank also enrolled consumersin a $10,000 sweepstakes for every ATM transaction and gave consumers $10 tosign up for various direct-deposit accounts.  The promotions took place inSyracuse, N.Y; Columbus, Ohio; and Seattle, Wash.Easy To UseAlthough Peterson was unable to reveal how many deposits were migrated fromtellers to ATMs, the bank issued eight times more ATM cards during the marketlaunch in Columbus than the comparable 60 days in 1994, he says.  KeyCorp alsoopened eight times more new direct-deposit accounts, he adds.But while KeyCorp was successful with its campaigns, other banks haven't beenso lucky.  First Chicago ran a two-month promotion in late 1994 whereconsumers were given $2 tokens they could redeem by making ATM deposits.While the bank saw a modest increase in ATM deposits during the promotion,those deposits gradually subsided during the following four months.  "Peopleeventually went back to the old way of doing things," says Tom Tremain, FirstChicago vice president.First Chicago has since introduced a plan in which consumers with accountsrequiring no minimum balance are charged $3 for each teller visit.  Customerswith a $250 minimum balance or more have one free teller visit per week, andcustomers with a $250 minimum balance and direct deposit have six free tellervisits per month.Positive ResultsAnd the results have been impressive.  First Chicago witnessed a 125% increasein ATM deposits during the first four months after the changes were made.  "Wesaw a huge increase in deposits, and a corresponding decrease in tellertransactions," Tremain says.  The bank saw a net loss of customers for a fewmonths, but now is signing up more new customers than it is losing, he says.But some banks, including Florida-based Barnett Banks, prefer education andincentives to penalties.  The bank is considering several strategies at itsTampa and Ft.  Lauderdale branches over the next few months, includingin-branch demonstrations on how to make ATM deposits and $1 coupons thatcustomers can redeem by making ATM deposits."I don't like First Chicago's and KeyCorp's negative approach-you don't take acustomer and slap them on the hand," says Len Ferman, Barnett Banks' directorof self-service banking.  Such pricing structures can give the impression abank is only concerned about its bottom line, he adds.  "No one knows what thelong-term ramifications are for charging customers for things they expect tobe free," he says.Other institutions have opted for high-technology hardware to encourage ATMdeposits.  InterBold and AT&T Global Information Solutions both offercheck-imaging ATMs that display checks on the ATM screen.  InterBold alsooffers an ATM that images a copy of the check onto the ATM receipt to giveconsumers an extra layer of comfort."The ATMs have eliminated the black-hole syndrome," says Robert Morris, vicepresident of electronic banking with Bank of America Arizona, which ispiloting six check-imaging machines in Phoenix.  The terminals have made amodest impact on increasing ATM deposits, he says.  The machines have onedrawback, however.  Because the ATMs can accept checks without envelopes,checks that are wrinkled are sometimes rejected.  "In some situations, theteller will have to cash the check," he says.Some bankers, however, say check-imaging ATMs are too costly.  The ATMs costup to $50,000, well above the $25,000 price tag on standard deposit-acceptingATMs.  "With the results we've seen [from price incentives], the imagingtechnology is way too expensive for the added value you get," Tremain says.Other bankers believe direct deposit is the way to go.  Joseph Pendleton,senior vice president with Reading, Pa.-based Meridian Bank, says processingdirect-deposit checks via the automated clearing house is less expensive thanprocessing deposits through ATMs and tellers.  It costs around two cents toprocess direct-deposit checks versus 85 cents for an ATM deposit and $1 for abranch deposit, Pendleton says."People are resistant to making deposits at ATMs, and you can spend a lot ofmoney trying to change their ways," Pendleton says.  "The returns aren't asgreat as spending money to convince people to use direct deposit."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996First Fidelity Gets A Charge Out Of Balance InquiriesWhile financial institutions are trying to get consumers to make deposits atATMs, one bank is focusing on moving balance inquiries to machines.Beginning Feb.  1, New Jersey-based First Fidelity Bancorp will chargecustomers whose deposits fall below minimum balance requirements 75 cents forbalance inquiries from tellers and 50 cents for balance inquiries on atoll-free number.  Customers receive two free inquiries per month from tellersand two from the voice response number.  Senior citizen accounts and accountswith high minimum balances will not be affected.The aim is to migrate branch inquiries to ATMs and get customers to maintainlarger balances, a First Fidelity spokesman says.  First Fidelity has 715 ATMsin New Jersey and surrounding states.  The fees are not related to the bank'smerger with First Union Corp.  earlier this year, he adds.While several banks offer checking accounts that encourage ATM usage bycharging low monthly fees-and for teller transactions-First Fidelity appearsto be a pioneer in imposing fees solely on balance inquiries.  And industryobservers expect other institutions to follow suit.  "There's certainly atrend in channeling consumers to lower cost services," says Anne Morgan Moore,president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based bankingconsultancy.  "Customers who want face-to-face contact should be willing topay more," she says.Some industry participants, however, are surprised the bank plans to chargecustomers for balance inquiries using its voice response system.  Such systemsare usually less expensive than ATMs, they say.  The First Fidelityspokesperson says a small number of customers were calling the bank up to fourtimes a day to check balances.  "The fees are focused on a very small numberof people who are making excessive calls," he says.  He predicts less than 10percent of the bank's 2.5 million customers will be affected by the change.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996What's An ATM?  'Just A Vending Machine That Dispenses Cash'Many expect the spread of surcharging to attract new nonbank ATM deployers.They may look a lot like Nationwide Money Services.Based in Calabasas, Calif., Nationwide has 1,100 orders to place ATMs and cashdispensers that do not accept deposits, including a contract for 400 Pantryconvenience stores in the Southeast.  Robert Peisner, the company's chiefoperating officer, says most of those machines will be deployed by June, whichwould make it one of the 20 largest ATM owners in the U.S.That's fast work for a company that was founded in 1993 by card-processingveterans Peisner and Jack O'Toole and only owned about 20 ATMs a year ago,when it got an infusion of capital from California-based CardserviceInternational, an independent sales organization that processes credit anddebit transactions.  CSI subsequently acquired a controlling interest inNationwide.Surcharging is central to the company's business plan, and its deployments areconcentrated in surcharging states.  Nationwide charges up to $1 for awithdrawal, Peisner says.But the real secret to its fast growth, says Peisner, is lowoverhead-processing and other services are outsourced-combined with using thecash-dispensing terminals to generate revenue in as many ways as possible."In essence these are just vending machines," he says.  "One of the productsthey dispense happens to be cash."  Nationwide machines also offer postagestamps, prepaid telephone cards and coupons.  The company charges $50 a monthto issue coupons for up to 12 vendors per machine.Promotion also is key, Peisner says.  As part of the seven-year contract withNationwide, merchants agree to place signs announcing the terminals and toinclude in their advertising that the store has an ATM that dispenses couponsas well as cash.  Peisner says consumers walk away with coupons that, if used,more than repay them for both the surcharge and the foreign fee charged by theconsumer's bank.And while the company's original five-year plan called for the deployment of1,500 machines, Peisner says that's been revised to between 5,000 and 7,000 bythe year 2000.Such high hopes on the part of new ATM deployers may be dashed by the realitythat the best ATM locations are taken and retailers are expecting a largershare of revenues, says Tommy Rouse, senior vice president of Dallas-basedAffiliated Computer Services, a leading third-party deployer.  "Over the nextyear, we expect 50% of the new players installing ATMs will file forbankruptcy," Rouse says.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996EFTA Tries Again To Accelerate Into The Fast LaneAs the EFT industry has matured, competition has grown sharper, profit marginshave grown smaller and the responsibilities of executives have grown heavier.That makes it harder to lure busy executives away from their desks toparticipate in trade associations.At the same time, the issues have grown more complex, creating a greater needfor trade groups that can help sort them out.  If the agenda is compellingenough, people will come, as evidenced by the record turnout at last month'sBank Administration Institute Retail Delivery Conference in Atlanta.By the admission of its own leadership, the Electronic Funds TransferAssociation hasn't done a good enough job in recent years of convincing EFTparticipants that they can't afford to miss an EFTA meeting.  But it's goingto give it another try.The association has announced its second management shakeup in just over ayear, this one featuring a multi-year agreement with the Benton Internationalconsulting firm, which will provide consultants to help plan meetings andwrite reports about them for the association's membership of bankers,processors, hardware and software vendors and government officials.Help WantedThe other major move is the promotion of H.  Kurt Helwig, the association'sdirector of government relations, to the post of executive director.  Hereplaces Wayne Boucher, who resigned in September, less than a year aftertaking the post as part of a new management team that included Robert P.Barone, the retired president of Diebold Inc.  Barone remains at EFTA aschairman and chief executive officer.Barone admits to disappointing results in his first year on the job.  "We'vehad some success in terms of new membership, but frankly weren't as successfulas I would have liked in terms of increasing the importance of the associationto the industry," he says.  "We couldn't get our hands around good,content-oriented material, and we weren't following up very well on ourspecial interest groups and councils and reporting their activities.  Wedecided we had to get some people involved who can help us do this."That's where the Benton firm comes in.  A Benton consultant will be assignedto each of the EFTA's committees to help chairmen develop strategy, planmeeting agendas and prepare reports.Free AdviceJohn B.  Benton, the CEO of Benton International and a long-time EFTA boardmember, says his staff will work for free until the association's revenuescover budgeted EFTA expenses for the year.  If revenues exceed that budget,his staff will bill at cost; in future years, he says, any dramatic growth inrevenues would be shared with the Benton firm.  Benton says he does not seethe deal as an income generator as much as an opportunity to revitalize theassociation while offering his staff a chance to network with industryleaders.  "If our people build some new relationships, we'll get out of itwhat I want to get," he says.Helwig says EFTA considered other consulting firms, but "Jack's been on ourboard and been very active and that tipped the balance toward BentonInternational."  Several EFT insiders applauded the choice.  "Benton'sextremely well-regarded and he's done a lot of high-level work in the EFTbusiness, so that should help," says Charles Raphael, first vice president ofFirst Chicago NBD.Benton's staff will be working with the EFTA's councils and special interestgroups.  There are two councils, which are empowered to take positions withoutgetting approval of the EFTA board, whose diverse composition makes itdifficult to reach a common stance.  One council focuses on electronicbenefits transfer; the other is a council of regional EFT network executivesformed last year after the Shared Network Executives Association merged withthe EFTA.Revitalized Board MeetingsThe three special interest groups are designed to be educational, and don'tadopt positions.  One focuses on electronic commerce and home banking, anotheron point-of-sale and a third on EBT.  The association plans to form a fourthdealing with regulatory and legislative issues this year, Helwig says.In addition to upgrading the meetings of these committees, Barone says theassociation will change the character of board meetings.  "They've beenbasically business meetings, taking up such things as finances," he says.  "Wereally need to focus on industry issues and that's what we'll do from thispoint forward."  And, in an effort to broaden participation, the size of theboard has been increased from 33 to 50.The association, which has a membership of nearly 1,300 individuals from 175companies, also plans a recruitment drive.  As part of that effort, a newindividual category of membership has been created, costing $1,000 a year.Corporate memberships range from $6,000 to $15,000 annually.Bankers WantedHelwig says there will be an emphasis on increasing participation fromfinancial institutions, which observers say has been a weakness of theorganization.  In particular, he says, it is hoped the work of Benton and hisstaff will help attract more senior bankers.  But Richard Speer, anAtlanta-based consultant, says that, as a result of bank mergers and thegrowth of the EFT business, many high-level managers just don't have the timefor industry meetings.  "It's very difficult right now to get senior bankersinvolved in any of these industry forums, it's not just the EFTA," he says.And it's not just bankers who are busy, says Donald Mauer, senior vicepresident of the Pennsylvania-based Gensar processing company, and someone whohas skipped recent EFTA meetings.  Speaking of Benton, Mauer says, "Jack hasto make it more striking and relevant.  I have to believe I'll learn more inthree days at a meeting than I could learn in three months, and that it willmove my business."Back to Headline List WT02-B38-8IA086-000616-B020-98http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi70.html 205.156.212.5 19970122004642 text/html 139987HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:44:03 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:14 GMTContent-length: 139799Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi70.html Sample Issue Copyright BANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNet JANUARY, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Check Fraud: A Problem That Just Won't Go Away (995 words) IBOS Expands Its Ranks (966 words) When Servicing Customers, Every Minute Counts (345 words) Microsoft Shifts Gears (1062 words) Answering The High-Tech Call (2275 words) Solving Chicken-And-Egg Dilemmas In Electronic Bill Pay (2074 words) Wrap-up ...

That's more than the combined yearly totalsfor automated teller machine, credit card and wire transfer fraud, accordingto industry sources.Indeed, while the headlines of the business press for years have heralded thethreat of computer hackers accessing and pillaging the bank accounts ofcorporate America, a small army of criminals has been amassing wealth byforging and doctoring corporate America's old standby payment method:  thecheck.  Anyone with a few thousand dollars to invest in desktop publishingsoftware, some scanning equipment and a laser printer, and who has the desireto commit check fraud can print bogus checks that fool even the most astutebankers.  (Color copiers are another option, although the bogus checks theyproduce typically are not as sophisticated as the desktop variety.)"The amount of money involved in computer fraud is minimal compared to checkfraud," says Dan McGurl, president, Bottomline Technologies, Inc., aPortsmouth, NH, company that markets automated disbursement systems tocorporations and banks.  "The ease with which an individual inclined to dothis kind of thing can now rip off corporate checking accounts is astounding."In a backhanded way, that's good news for McGurl.  His firm is part of anoffensive that has emerged to counter check fraud using a concept known aspositive pay.  A company using positive pay provides its bank each day with anelectronic list of checks issued that day.  The bank then uses the list toverify the authenticity of checks presented against the company's account.Bottomline sells software, dubbed Positive PayLink, that lets companies createthese files and transmit the information to banks.  At a cost of about$10,000, just under 100 companies have purchased the system since itsintroduction in mid-1995, according to McGurl.Tough sellMcGurl sees great promise in Positive PayLink, and in the general trend towardpositive pay services.  "Every check-issuing organization is going to want toget into positive pay as long as the check system is the way it is today," heinsists.But it isn't that easy to sell corporations on positive pay.  Most bankers aredoing well if they can convince 10 to 20 percent of their corporate customersto use positive pay, says Bruce Brett, senior vice president, Signet Bank,Richmond, VA.  "I guess check fraud just isn't bad enough yet," gripes Brett,who chairs the American Bankers Association's check fraud task force.Or, suggests Richard Poje, partner, Treasury Strategies Inc., a Chicago-basedcash management consulting firm, check fraud losses just haven't hit enoughcorporate issuers of checks.  "The best time to be selling a positive payproduct is the morning after a fraud has occurred," Poje suggests.In the meantime, bankers are beginning to shop around for other check fraudweapons, like online verification services.  Dan Fisher, senior vicepresident, Victoria Bank and Trust, Victoria, TX, says a case can be made forcreating an electronic positive file of checks that operates akin to creditcard authorization systems.  "If you can set up a negative file for badchecks, why can't you set up a positive file of good checks?"  he asks.Some banks are doing that now through a company known as Primary PaymentSystems Inc., which was founded by Star System Inc., a bank-owned EFT networkbased in California.  The company maintains a database of information onchecking accounts at participating financial institutions.  Banks, or checkverification companies, use the information to decide whether checks should behonored.  As of last fall, the Primary Payment database contained informationon 22 million checking accounts at 20 financial institutions in California andsurrounding states.  Participation is poised to expand, however, as PrimaryPayment goes national.  "By the end of 1996, we'll definitely haveparticipation beyond the western states," says Nikki Waters, Star senior vicepresident.The daily process of uploading account updates and verifying check depositsagainst the Primary Payment database takes about five hours for a bank tocomplete, start to finish, according to Waters.Waters says Primary Payment participation makes good sense for banks.  "Forevery $1 spent participating in deposit check [the Primary Payment servicethat banks use to check on deposited checks], they can realize $9 to $10 insavings," she relates.  The savings figures, Waters says, are based upon dataprovided by some of the larger banks participating in Primary Payment.  Theseparticipants include Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank and First InterstateBank.Fee opportunityBankers and others involved with Primary Payment say it, or similar services,can help retailers, too, and create new revenue opportunities for banks byproviding a venue for the sale of checking account information to firms thatsell check verification services to the merchant community.  ElectronicTransaction Corp., the Deluxe Corp.  unit that runs the Shared CheckAuthorization Network (SCAN), and Telecheck, Houston, have already beguntesting the idea.Representatives of the merchant community say they like the idea of bolsteringthe data available on checking accounts and potential bad checks at the pointof sale.  But they say banks also need to do more to thwart consumers who passbad checks at the point of sale.  "These are shared problems," says Judy Cook,president, Minnesota Retail Merchants Association.  "Trying to identify theseindividuals at the outset and not letting them open checking accounts is wherethe banks should be focusing their attention."Cook says the merchant community in Minnesota has been successful in forcingbanks to more closely scrutinize individuals opening checking accounts.  Butthe battle against check fraud is far from over, she concedes."No matter what you do, it seems the crooks always find another way to getyou," laments Cook.  "Cooperation is the real key."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996IBOS Expands Its RanksChase Manhattan Corp.  has tipped the scales of IBOS (Inter-Bank OnlineSystem), the technology-savvy international payments network, toward the U.S.Chase's recent purchase of a 24.05 percent stake in IBOS ratchets U.S.ownership to a majority, rounding out the 24.05 percent held by ElectronicData Systems, Plano, TX, and the 3.8 percent held by Goldman Sachs.  Thefounding institutions, Banco Santander of Spain and The Royal Bank ofScotland, both also own 24.05 percent of the company.IBOS is an electronic network that links accounts within all participatingbanks, allowing end-to-end international payments at both the retail andwholesale level.  The network was created about four years ago, inanticipation of increased cross-border transactions with the formation of theEuropean Community.  Indeed, increased global commerce has caused IBOS'volumes to "more than double in the last 12 months," according to Thomas Metz,director of global business development at IBOS and divisional vice presidentof EDS in Dallas, although he would not reveal IBOS' exact volumes.IBOS basically simplifies international banking for commercial and retailcustomers.  Commercial customers who use IBOS-participating banks benefit bynot having to go through agent banks in foreign countries in order to getcertain cash management, securities and corporate banking services.  Andindividuals benefit by being able to use foreign branches as if they werebranches in their own country.  For example, Chase customers vacationing inScotland could stop in at The Royal Bank of Scotland, identify themselves ascustomers of an IBOS-participating bank and conduct their banking as if theywere at their home branch in the U.S.Seal of approval"Because Chase is the largest correspondent bank in the world and one of theleading banks in international payments, they bring a tremendous amount ofcredibility to IBOS," notes Metz.  "It's kind of like the Good HousekeepingSeal of Approval.  Chase has indicated that it wants to create other virtualbanking alliances using its correspondent banks and add the IBOS paymentcapability to Chase's broad range of corporate cash management products."The global virtual bank of IBOS is racking up a bevy of new participants,including Denmark's Unibank; ING Bank and Instituto Bancario San Paolo duTorino-the largest banks in the Netherlands and Italy, respectively.  Othernon-equity members are Banco Comercio e Industria of Portugal, CreditCommercial de France and Belgium's Kredietbank and Credit General de Banque.Other banks are likely to sign on soon.  The EC Investment Services Directiverequires that all member countries' financial institutions and markets be opento all EC participants.  When that law goes into effect, there could be alandslide of banks joining IBOS, says Metz.And, now that the largest U.S.  bank is in on the deal, others will likelywant to keep up with the Joneses.  "We hope other banks in the U.S.  willfollow suit," says Chuck Mallis, global marketing and strategic positioningexecutive at Chase in New York City, who also sits on the Board of Directorsof the Society for Worldwide Financial Interbank Telecommunications(S.W.I.F.T.).  "We do not believe in exclusivity.  Open access networks arethe way to go."For 30 years, S.W.I.F.T.  has been smoothing out the cross-cultural kinks andlanguage barriers that would otherwise impede international transactionsamongst its member banks, which now total 3,000.  "There's been a lot ofconfusion over what S.W.I.F.T.  and IBOS are," notes Barry Morse, vicepresident of marketing at S.W.I.F.T.  in Lahoulpe, Belgium.  "The two servicesare very complementary," he explains.  "When two banks send payments to eachother there's a lot of communications required as intermediate steps.  That isthe S.W.I.F.T component-standardized communications using correspondentbanks."However, S.W.I.F.T.  is closing in on some of the services offered by IBOS.S.W.I.F.T.  has arranged to offer foreign institutions access to the U.S.Depository Trust Company's services, which include securities transfers;kicked off an end-to-end cross-border account payment service calledS.W.I.F.T.Pay, and launched a service called Accord, which performscross-border matching and bilateral netting.If banks want to conduct multilateral international netting, they can useS.W.I.F.T.  to access the foreign exchange clearing houses that have beensprouting up this summer.  "We do communications for Eccho [the London StockExchange's foreign exchange clearinghouse]," Morse says.  "We do not have arelationship with the U.S.'s [foreign exchange clearinghouses] F/XNet andMultinet.  But we're all trying to solve the same problems in the industry:the costs and risks associated with cross border payments and foreignexchange.  Eventually, we will all be doing much of the same things andpotentially working together."On a similar note, if S.W.I.F.T.  and IBOS were to pool their resources, "itwould open up opportunities in things like imaging and smart cardtechnologies," says Mallis.  "IBOS ultimately provides a virtual bank networkcapability through multiple associations."  IBOS is currently talking withofficials in Russia and other eastern European countries about helping themset up payment vehicles for their national clearing systems.  The group isalso discussing setting up a Web service, although that is not considered animmediate concern.  "There is also potential for industries and their banks todevelop information networks on IBOS because of its broad bandwidthcapabilities," says Mallis.Both IBOS and S.W.I.F.T.  have seen increasing activity.  "With these newbanks coming online, our volume is going to increase significantly," from thedoubling that just occurred over the past year, says Metz of IBOS.  "That isallowing us to lower our prices to make it more proportionate to S.W.I.F.T.pricing."S.W.I.F.T.  volumes, meanwhile, have risen only 17 percent over last year, butthat represents a larger base number.  Notes Morse of S.W.I.F.T., "The valueof payments that go through the network is about [U.S.] $2.5 trillion everyday, half the annual GNP of America."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996When Servicing Customers, Every Minute CountsCost-justifying a call center is getting easier by the minute, according toSprint Business.  By mimicking the pay system of an 800 number service, theDallas-based corporation has created a call center solution that offers acreative way to finance customer service requirements-it's a price-per-minutecall center.With this call center solution, there are no added costs or unexpected fees,says Kay Jain, Sprint's manager of customer programs.  The package is designedto ensure operating costs get offset by new revenue.  Total cost to thefinancial institutions are a direct result of the activity in its call center.Sprint's Call Center Connection includes all the equipment needed to outfit acall center, from the automated call distributor, to the phones, along withthe network services needed to connect it to customers and prospects.  Sprintteamed up with suppliers Rockwell Telecommunications, Downers Grove, IL, andNorthern Telecom, Chapel Hill, NC, to make the offering.Each customized per-minute deal includes turnkey installation, on-goingmaintenance and full warranty service, plus specialized training and systemupgrades.  Once installed on the bank's premises, bank management takes overfull control of the center to run its day-to-day operations.  If operationswarrant expansion, banks may add agents, equipment or services as needed.The price-per-minute cost for the call center service is determined by how thesystem is configured, the minimal annual usage commitment and the length ofthe contract.  The customer's anticipated call volumes provide the basis for aminimum annual usage commitment, which equals the minimum number of minutesthat agents will be handling calls in the course of a year.According to Jain, after the number of minutes-per-year is established and thecustomer decides on the equipment, the price can be determined for theduration of a contract.  "We recommend a two to five year contract but thereis no set limit."To help make it easier to track automated call distributor performance permonth, Sprint sends out two monthly billing statements, indicating longdistance usage and call center costs separately.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Microsoft Shifts GearsBill Gates quickly made amends for calling banks dinosaurs back in 1994,during his keynote address at Bank Administration Institution's RetailDelivery Systems conference.  Without skipping a beat, he then launched into asales pitch for Microsoft's latest offering to facilitate interactive banking.This time around, bankers were more impressed than threatened."I never said banks are dinosaurs," he clarified during his speech, referringto a quote that appeared in Newsweek.  "I actually said many banking systemsare dinosaurs."The original dinosaur comment surfaced before Microsoft signed on about adozen banks to offer to their customers Microsoft's personal financialmanagement software, Money.  To many observers, distributing the powerfulMicrosoft brand in such a way obscures and undermines the relationships bankshave with their customers.  Others also fear the set-up allows Microsoft tosomehow skim a small percent of fee revenue off transactions that occurthrough Money.Gates's latest interactive banking appeal, unveiled during his speech, is morein keeping with the type of relationships banks are accustomed to having withtheir vendors.  With high-tech fanfare, including a tongue-in-cheek video thatpoked fun at the Internet as a "Web of Wealth," Gates introduced a suite oftools and technologies for building profitable bank applications on Internetand e-mail platforms.  "The Internet will be the primary connection betweenbanks and their customers," predicted Gates.The December 5 speech actually was a preview to an announcement made two dayslater in Seattle of a wide-ranging Microsoft commitment to the Internet.  Atthat briefing, Microsoft introduced more than 20 products and tools to createapplications that encompass both Windows technology and the Internet.  "Ithink most people are going to be surprised at the depth and breadth of ourcommitment to integrate the Internet into our products," said Gates at thatbriefing.Just like old timesIn exploiting this new delivery channel, Microsoft will follow a businessmodel of partnering with others, a practice it has taken since its origins,when it relied on Intel to provide the microprocessors for its systems, Gatessaid.  "Over the next five years, we will partner with more companies than wehave in the last 20.  And Microsoft will continue to do exactly what it doestoday, which is write software."Like any off-the-shelf software package, the new Internet tools arelicensable.  Banks will be able to use them to create what Gates terms"virtual branches," which will be bank-branded and customizable.Chief among the new tools will be Internet Studio (code-named Blackbird), anauthoring tool for developing Internet interfaces that incorporate multimedia,such as sound and video.  Also available will be an Internet InformationServer, based on Windows NT.  These products will be available over the courseof 1996, and will join Microsoft's Internet browser, Explorer.  Thecombination will support authentication and also embed secure protocols forpayments over the Internet.Microsoft also has plans to jazz up e-mail.  New tools will make it possibleto transfer more than just text over e-mail connections.  For example, bankscould transmit formatted statements-complete with logos-via e-mail.  "Thiswill be a key element of what we provide," noted Gates.During the presentation, Linda Parker, vice president, US Bancorp, was invitedto demonstrate how the bank built a direct link between e-mail and a loanapproval center it created on its Internet site.  US Bank is an early adopterof Microsoft Money, as well as the new Internet tools.  The bank is well intothe process of using Microsoft's Internet Studio tools to build abank-branded, sales and service delivery channel over the Internet that linksto back-office data.With Microsoft's new Internet-centric approach, the role of Money changes.According to Gates, Money will become a "core database" or "file cabinet" thatbanks will be able to customize and extend by adding, say, a third-partyretirement planning software package to it.  In the near term, Money willreceive various upgrades, including additional back-end processing optionsbeyond the current one from Intuit Processing Services, and the ability toconnect users to banks' Internet sites via hot links.KudosFor the most part, banks put aside their typical skepticism of Microsoft'sintentions and applauded the company's efforts.  "He [Gates] has done a greatjob," says Tom Kitrick, vice president, First Union National Bank.  "He'sadded more value to the customer interface, and that's the most importantthing."Robert Hedges, executive vice president, Shawmut National Corp., brought upthe same two words:  customer interface.  "The future world is going torevolve around the quality of the customer interface," he says.  "We have tobe in the business of knowing how to create a good one."Shawmut will soon be folded into Fleet Financial Group, which is a part-ownerof Meca Software, Inc., a Fairfield, CT-based outfit that prides itself on itsbank-focused approach to distributing its Managing Your Money personalfinancial software.  Hedges says that although the bank is now a part-owner ofMeca, it would be open to working with Microsoft on other projects.  "But onlyon an open-systems basis, and only if we retain the customer interface."In adopting an approach more amenable to banks, Microsoft has, at the sametime, shifted its position relative to its own competition.  Prior toMicrosoft's announcement of its Internet intentions, Intuit Inc.  and itsQuicken program occupied the same competitive terrain as Microsoft and Money.Now that Microsoft has broadened its approach, it faces a new set ofcompetitors, namely Sun Microsystems.Sun's Java, a tool that adds dynamics-such as multimedia-to Web browsers,squares off against Microsoft's new Internet Studio.  Introduced in August,Java allows small applications (called applets) to be transported from serversover the Internet.  These applets latch on to client computers and liven up,say with animation, Internet interactions of that client computer.  Forexample, a client computer viewing the Web server of a bank that uses suchapplets might let users to perform dynamic what-if analyses on loan options,not just apply for a loan.How the competition will pan out in this next stage of the interactive worldremains to be seen.  "Everything's changing," notes Kitrick of First Union,who says he wants to see what happens with Java before he decides aboutInternet Studio.  "Nothing is staying the same."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Answering The High-Tech CallThere's no doubt call centers are emerging as a popular way to reduceoperating costs while improving service to customers.  To wit, this technologyentrant placed first out of 12 in BTN's annual survey of the Best Of TheNewest banking technologies (see BTN, December 1995).  Today, the question formany banks-especially medium- to small-sized ones-is deciding at what point,if ever, they should move from standard voice response systems to full fledgedstate-of-the-art call centers.Most banks already have some type of voice response system in place to allowfor automated responses to routine customer service inquiries.  Thesesystems-once known for handling only simple inquiries such as savings orchecking account balances-are now equipped with a variety of increasedcapabilities.  Integrated voice response applications can now processvirtually any information exchange including account balances, portfolioinformation, bill payment, interest rates and mortgage pre-qualifications.A fully customized, turnkey voice response solution can start at $30,000, andquickly increases with advanced programming applications.  But despite all theenhancements with voice response technology, it still has many limitationscompared to a full-blown call center solution.  Most notably missing is thehuman interaction with customers.Making the moveAdvanced call centers employ customer service workstations backed bycomputer-telephone integration.  Using computer-telephone integration to makeinformation that's locked away in computer databases available to telephonesystems is an act that's easier said than done.The basic hardware for incoming call management is a standard set-up comprisedof private branch exchanges, automated call distributors and voice responseunits.  The real feature that differentiates one bank's call center fromanother's is in its use of middleware.  The middleware provides the connectivedata integration link between a customer service representative's workstationand an incoming call."The key to implementing a state-of-the-art call center is integration," saysJulie Fitzpatrick, product marketing manager at Early, Cloud & Co., Newport,RI.  "Integrating customer information files allows a customer servicerepresentative to access a wealth of information that assists in a variety ofcapabilities and increases cross-selling opportunities."Middleware is actually the doorway to accessing information, managing call anddata information, routing the information, managing workflow and monitoringthe system.  In addition to basic call management and data managementcapabilities, more advanced services such as identifying numbers dialed bycallers, a process known as Designated Number Identification Service, as wellas identifying callers' telephone numbers, known as Automated NumberIdentification, are available.The more integration there is between computer and telephone systems, thelonger the list of services that a bank can offer through the phone.  Beyondretrieving account balances, customers can authorize funds transfers, openchecking and savings accounts, apply for loans, pay off credit card balancesand the list goes on-directly over the phone.Sky's the limitExperts say the absolute minimum investment for a fully integrated call centeris $10,000 per seat, with $20,000 per seat not an unreasonable price forhigher configurations.  Basically, there is no definite price cap on theinvestment because of all the different options and equipment available.  Inessence, stepping up from standard voice response to call-centercomputer-telephone integration requires a significant investment, but it canalso be one with limitless possibilities.A number of packaged call center automation software applications areavailable.  One such package, scheduled for general release next quarter, isEarly Cloud's Call Flow Client.  The new desktop software environment letsinstitutions automate telephone-based customer service operations withcomputer-telephone integration, message-based data access and enterprise-widebusiness workflow within a distributed client/server environment.Call Flow Client helps retail banks tackle the project of buildingcomprehensive, completely integrated call centers, all the way from back-endsystems to customer service desktops, and eliminates the need to build everycall center application from scratch.  With its graphical interfaceenvironment, developers can graphically define workflow processing andindividually design their call center environments.  The software packageoffers a number of options ranging from historical transaction information;new account openings for savings, checking, loans, CDs and IRAs; billpayments, to an ATM locator feature with scanned map retrieval.Although the costs associated with a full-blown call center versus a standardvoice response system vary, experts say cost is only one of many issuesrelevant to the decision to plunge into call-center technology.  "Ultimately,the decision is one that should be based on your marketing strategy and whatmessage your bank is trying to convey," says Lisa Stockburger, vice presidentat Vanguard Communications Corp., Morris Plains, NJ.  "You have to determine,'Do I want to be like the big boys or do I want to maintain my face-to-faceimage associated with smaller banks?'"Meeting challengesFor Bank United of Texas, $12 billion in assets, the decision to create anadvanced call center was strategic-the result of a long string ofacquisitions.  In 1990, Houston-based Bank United acquired six financialinstitutions that had retail, mortgage and wholesale banking divisions.Consolidating the different banks into one entity resulted in multipleoperating systems and a very confused customer base.  In addition, the bankwas further challenged by inadequate marketing of its telephone-basedservices.At the time, Bank United had only two small customer service centers locatedin Houston and Dallas.  The centers operated during normal business hours andoffered very limited services.  And since they were scarcely promoted, manycustomers were unaware of their existence at all.The need for an improved customer service system was apparent.  According toPat Moretti, assistant vice president, the bank redefined is strategy and itscustomer service mission statement to its current definition:  to enhancevalue by providing an efficient, cost effective sales and service alternativefor existing and prospective Bank United customers on a national level.Through its acquisitions, the bank had inherited a Syntellect voice responsesystem, which it is now considering upgrading, and it purchased an Aspectswitch from Aspect Telecommunications, San Jose, CA, for about $225,000 forthe new call center.  In addition, it is working on cost-justifying futurepurchases of a TCS Forecaster Scheduler from TCS Management Group, Inc.,Nashville, TN, which will run about $38,000, as well as an Alltel CustomerService Platform Workstation from Alltel Information Services, Inc.  LittleRock, AR, which will cost around $500,000.Bank United's technology allows calls to be routed among five units within thecall center, including:  loan-by-phone; customer service; deposit sales;support functions, and a systems administrator.  The bank is also introducinga financial markets unit as an alternative service for annuities andsecurities customers.  The bank maximizes the capability of its voice responseunit whenever applicable but always has a customer service representativeready to respond.Before implementing its full-blown call center, the bank's customer servicecenters averaged about 126,000 calls received per month, of which 32,000 wereanswered by live representatives.  With the telephone banking center, thenumber of calls answered has increased to an average of 210,000 calls permonth with about 47,000 answered by representatives.The call center also has had success with new-account openings, which were notpossible through the original customer service centers.  The current callcenter averages about 400 new-account openings per month.  That rate is on parwith the number of accounts opened monthly at the largest of the 67 branchesBank United operates throughout Texas, according to Moretti."We went from nothing to something," says Moretti, describing the call center,which grew from eight to 41 employees.  At the same time, "we broadened ourcustomer base by catering to all types of customers."For some banks, investing in a call center is tantamount to using technologyas a weapon to remain independent.  "Call centers are a major investment forsmaller banks, but one that is necessary if you wish to remain independent,"says Pat Mackesey, vice president of telephone banking at Dauphin DepositBank.  "And, it can be easily cost-justified if done correctly."Mackesey was instrumental in the creation of Dauphin Deposit's telephonebanking center, introduced in November.  The Hanover, PA-based bank, with $5.5billion in assets, owns and operates Farmers Bank, ValleysBank and Bank ofPennsylvania, and now handles customer service for all those banks through asingle call center.  Dauphin Deposit's telephone banking center, whichcurrently employs a staff of 17, is projected to employ 50 people by April.The bank also plans to offer underwriting services through the call center.According to Mackesey, performance is the turning point in making a callcenter a profit center.  He points out that the center creates a myriad ofopportunities for pro-active cross selling.  "There is a major positivecontribution in covering bank expense in a call center," he says.  "You areable to take advantage of a customer service situation and turn it into asales opportunity."Local flavor"We took a basic customer service center and turned it into a multi-facetedservice and sales center with an expanded level of service," he says.  "It hasbecome an alternate delivery channel opportunity to service customers moreefficiently with more cost-effective means of banking."With the installation of an Argo Platform system developed by Dallas-basedArgo Data Resource Corp., Dauphin Deposit succeeded in centralizing the callcenter function, while still retaining the local flavor of each of the threebanks that comprise the institution.  The telephone number listed for all ofthe banks is one centralized number.  When calls are received by the front-endnetwork, they are recognized and routed to the customer service representativewho will then answer with the appropriate branch name.Mackesey said that the new call center is viewed as a "superbranch" and isexpected to enhance traditional branch production, not replace it.  Beforeimplementing the new call center, Dauphin Deposit had only one customerservice unit, which was not able to open any type of account.  The new callcenter, which he says is already experiencing "encouraging" responses prior toany advertising efforts has already proven to be effective in cross-sellingnew accounts for the bank.The right numberSimilar telephone banking success was found at Oakland, MD-based First UnitedNational Bank & Trust, $500 million in assets.  Its implementation of a newcall center increased efficiencies while offering cross-selling and outboundtelemarketing opportunities.  The bank's call center, which runs the CustomerService and Correspondence system (CSCS) from Milwaukee-based Fiserv, handlesall transactions, customer needs and inquiries, and allows the bank toautomatically track calls, trends and sales.  Outbound telemarketing calls arealso documented on the system to record the number of sales produced.Fiserv's CSCS system, with a starting cost of about $10,000 (and up, dependingupon the number of users and feature applications), provides a complete casehistory of calls by automatically time- and date-stamping every commententered by customer service representatives.  It tracks the effectiveness ofindividuals and departments in responding to customer requests.  The systemalso provides online instructions and prompts to help solve problems, aidcross-selling efforts and ensure consistent responses are communicated onspecific inquiries.First United's call center, now staffed by four people, is expected to tripleby the end of this year.  Introduced last August, the number of calls actuallyserviced increased immediately.  Prior to the new call center, calls weredistributed among various departments, which inevitably led to lost or missedcalls.  With the new call center, all calls are centralized and handled in astandardized manner, increasing the number of calls serviced.Robin Murray, customer service manager, adds that the telephone banking centeris viewed as a high growth area for the bank because it lets the bank expandits customer base without having to expand its brick and mortar."The telephone banking center allows our in-branch sales force to do moreprospecting and less service-oriented transactions," says Murray.  "Our longterm strategy places a strong focus on our telephone center because of theflexibility and convenience it provides combined with the personal touch thatsatisfies customers."Customizing your call center will essentially determine its cost.  Accordingto Jeanne Michelson, marketing representative at Telcom Technologies, PomonaCA, the size of a call center is one important criteria in pricing it.  Butother variables weigh just as heavily.  These factors include the expectedvalue of your incoming calls, the general level of competition your businessfaces and the experience level of your call center supervisors and managers.Start-up and small call centers often opt for a private branch exchange, whichis a basic telephone switching system, because it can be inexpensive and isusually already in place within the company.  Many of the more popular privatebranch exchange systems can be purchased for less than $600 per station or$1,200 to $2,800, along with an automated call distributor hardware/softwarepackage.A stand-alone automated call distributor, according to Telcom, typically costs$2,200 to $3,000 per position, depending on the particular application andconfiguration requirements.  Therefore, for a cost effective automated calldistributor, expect to see the following price ranges:  $35,000 to $45,000 fora 15-agent system; $120,000 to $150,000 for a 50-agent system; $170,000 to$225,000 for a 75-agent system.Cost justifying a standalone automated call distributor comes down to avariety of factors.  By determining caller demand, identifying salesopportunities, calculating revenue losses (i.e., missed calls) and totaloperational cost savings-personnel and telephone service usage-a bank can costjustify its system on paper.  By adding revenue savings, personnel savings andphone usage savings, a bank can determine eventual paybank in years bydividing the total system cost by the total savings.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Solving Chicken-And-Egg Dilemmas In Electronic Bill PayTrying to get more consumers and merchants interested in electronic billpayments is like trying to answer the question, "Which came first, the chickenor the egg?"The chicken:  many consumers are balking when asked to sign up for electronicbill payment services because, to a large extent, associated fees still aregreater than or equal to the cost of mailing checks through the tried and trueU.S.  Postal Service.The egg:  banks won't be able to drop fees any further until more merchantsare able to receive such bill payments electronically.  The irony of mostbanks' electronic bill payment programs is that the bulk of payments made tomerchants are actually in the form of paper checks.  The only thing electronicabout them is that they were initiated electronically by consumers usingscreenphones, PCs or telephones.The vast majority of merchants lack the computer capabilities to handleelectronic payments.  Visa International estimates that nearly 60 percent of"electronic" bill payments actually are converted to paper before they arepassed to merchants.  Bill Burchfield, CEO of Intuit Services Corp., whichhandles bill payments for users of Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money homebanking products, similarly estimates that 70 percent of the payments it makesto merchants are in paper form.Yet another egg (or would that be a chicken?):  Merchants as a whole areunenthusiastic about electronic bill payment services.  Those not able toaccept electronic payments get a raw deal, because they end up receiving frombanks cumbersome lists of names and account numbers, accompanied by a singlecheck that represents many payors.  Generally known as a check-and-list, thepayment represents an exception item for the biller.Merchants also are dragging their feet because they don't see enough consumersusing bill payment services.  Larger volumes, among other factors, would makeit worth their while to go electronic.  "Every merchant is interested inmoving to electronic payments, but most need to make [systems] changes to dothat," says Mark Johnson, executive vice president of Columbus, OH-basedCheckfree Corp., a leading electronic bill payment processor.  "We need to getas much [consumer] volume as possible, so that the merchants see it'sworthwhile" to invest in the necessary systems upgrades.Here's the good news:  Leading payment processors are aggressively pursuingvarious strategies that should make electronic bill payments more palatable toboth billers and consumers.  Visa, for example, is tackling the back-end withits introduction last month of an end-to-end electronic payment and remittancesystem.  The Visa system will let billers easily accept more types ofelectronic payments, without having to make large investments in new systems.The bi-directional system even will make it possible for billers to deliverbills electronically to consumers who want them.Checkfree is also making major moves to increase the electronic element ofbill payments.  Checkfree's efforts focus on volume-specifically, boosting thevolume of consumers and small businesses using electronic bill paymentservices.  With increased customer volumes, large billers should deem it allthe more worthwhile to invest in automated payment receptors.Even smaller outfits are getting into the act.  An outsourcing service thatspecializes in delivering bills electronically to biller endpoints is gettinga higher profile than ever these days.  Princeton TeleCom Corp., Princeton,NJ, just signed on to provide $68-billion, Cleveland-based KeyCorp with billsettlement and disbursement services for KeyCorp's newly introduced homebanking services.Visa adds missing linkVisa collaborated with Dallas-based Sterling Software, a leading vendor ofelectronic commerce and electronic data interchage software, in its attempt toget more merchants into the electronic arena.  Sterling's financial EDIproduct, Vector:Connexion, is a key element of Visa's ability to create afully electronic, paperless pathway from consumers, through their banks and onto billing companies via billers' banks.Sterling's Vector product has been available independent of Visa for a goodeight years, and is now installed at 41 banks.  To accommodate the increasingflow of electronic consumer-to-biller payments, Sterling simply built a newmodule to its Vector:Connexion product, which adds Visa's EDI format, TC09, tothe list of electronic payments it can make, such as ANSI X.12, 820, BAIlockbox, flat file or customized formats.  The Vector:Connexion for Visamodule communicates payment information from billers' banks to billers viadirect connections, value-added networks, or the Internet."Now the huge Visa network, which so many banks are connected to, can feedtransactions to merchant banks," says M.A.  Hancook, manager, marketingcommunications at Sterling.  "Merchant banks know that their paper-basedlockbox operations are going to go electronic someday.  What they're doing isprotecting their lockbox businesses, plus saving a lot of money becausethey're not processing paper."Visa also is striving to fill in yet another missing electronic link of theelectronic bill payment process.  Through Visa Interactive, a company formedby Visa last year to offer PC- and screenphone-based banking, Visa willprovide electronic bill presentment.  In other words, no more envelopes.Consumers will be able to receive their bills electronically via Visa's homebanking software.  Merchants will be able to transmit bills in a customizedformat, complete with logos and marketing information, and also send returnsand corrections electronically to consumers.Visa already is working with a number of banks, including Banc One, BarnettBanks and Chase Manhattan, to take advantage of the commercial relationshipsthese banks have with billers, and get the electronic remittance product,dubbed ePay, out in the market.  Financial institutions will do the honor ofdistributing the application to their biller customers, giving them theopportunity to add value-and sales revenue-to biller relationships.NationsBank, for example, is using ePay to add to the cash management serviceit already offers its biller customers.  "The biggest benefit is in the way wecan meet our customers' needs," says Ken Wood, vice president of emergingtechnologies, NationsBank.  "Our biller customers are seeing an onslaught ofelectronic payments coming [from front-end electronic connections tocustomers], and they are fearing more paper payments coming through the backend.  We expect this service to eliminate the chore of having to go throughthe long lists of netted payments."The $170 billion NationsBank signed up for the entire Visa package, includingVector:Connexion.  Banks are not required to have Vector:Connexion to runVisa's ePay; however, the set-up makes for more seamless interactions.  Wooddid not disclose how much the bank paid for the package, but said the price ofePay is "competitive" with the automated clearinghouse and other back-endsystems.  "We have to be under the ball, ready to catch it for our clients,"Wood says.  "By joining Visa, we're covering more of the outfield.  There areother parts of the outfield, like ACH or [MasterCard's] Remittance ProcessingService, with whom we'll retain our relationships."Bills, bills, billsCheckfree is hoping to sweet talk more merchants into electronic commerce byfocusing on increasing volumes.  In one effort, Checkfree, like Visa, isstriving to electronically present bills to consumers.  In this respect, thebill payment processor is potentially one step ahead of Visa, since it alreadyis involved in piloting electronic bill delivery to 500 consumers across thecountry.  Participating billers include various telephone and utilitycompanies.  All of the participating billers are already equipped to receiveelectronic payments from Checkfree.  Eventually, Checkfree will diversify itstrial to include credit card, insurance, newspaper and cellular phonecompanies.  The goal is a controlled test of some 2,800 households, a fractionof the customer bases of the participating companies.  When the service goeslive in the third quarter, it could extend to the companies' millions ofcustomers.Checkfree sees electronic bill presentment as an important first ingredientfor more electronic bill payments.  "A lot of consumers aren't interested inpaying bills electronically until they can receive them electronically," saysBill Kitchen, director of product development at Checkfree.  And formerchants, electronic bill presentment cuts costs, and is more accurate andtimely.Once the service goes full tilt, Kitchen expects the rest of Checkfree'selectronic merchants will want to get in on the action.  While the service isde gratis during the trial, Checkfree might impose a per item charge tomerchants when it goes live.Checkfree is just as busily mounting other efforts to build up the volume ofusers of electronic bill pay services.  Recently, it teamed up with AutomaticData Processing, Inc., Roseland, NJ, to launch a joint marketing program thatwill target to small businesses PC banking and bill payment, payrollprocessing, direct deposit and other services.  With only one percent of the12 billion checks cut every year by U.S.  corporations processedelectronically, the potential to spur new waves of electronic bill payments ishuge.  "Small business owners use personal financial management packages athome, and they want them for their businesses," notes Pete Kight, presidentand CEO of Checkfree.  "It's almost criminal that we haven't delivered suchsolutions to small businesses."All in oneThe emergence of companies like Princeton TeleCom is yet another hopefulsignal that electronic bill payment volumes are well on their way.  Theprivately held company was founded in 1983 by a group of Princeton Universityprofessors.  Originally organized to introduce a PC banking product, the firmchanged its direction in 1987 to focus on bill payments only.The company specializes in addressing the needs of billers that receiveelectronic bill payments.  A number of banks, the latest being KeyCorp, hirePrinceton TeleCom as an outsourcing service for settling and disbursingelectronic bill payments to billers."Princeton TeleCom is the only outsource that specifically concentrates onelectronic delivery to the biller endpoints," says Paul Ayres, Key Corp's vicepresident for consumer electronic payments.  "We were searching for a partnerwho fully understood the need for timely and accurate postings," to billerremittance centers.Princton TeleCom accomplishes this task through its flagship els ElectronicLockbox Service.  With full electronic links to more than 450 billers,Princeton TeleCom captures the overwhelming majority of payment items banksnow mail out to biller endpoints in the form of nettlesome "check-and-list"disbursements.At a set time each day, a file of all the day's transactions is sent intoPrinceton TeleCom's main system.  "We go through that file and edit it basedon each biller's specifications about which account numbers are acceptable.Once files have been cleaned, we sort them into files for each payee.  At thatpoint, each file is reformatted according to each payee's file specs," saysMartha Davis, marketing manager of Princeton TeleCom.  This process "givesbanks the ability to do customer service, to show their customers that theyare on the ball."If a payee is not equipped to receive electronic payments, Princeton's RemoteDisbursement Facility prints out individual checks for each consumer payment,rather than sending out net payments accompanied with a list of payers.  Netpayments "are very labor intensive.  If one of the payments on a bulk list iswrong, they'll hold the whole list.  It's one payment per check with us.  Thisway the quality of the check meets or exceeds the standards of the remittancestub," says Davis.The company encourages merchants to go electronic once payments reach acritical mass, she notes.  Otherwise, the vendor can meet some non-electronicmerchants halfway if they have MICR scanners in their remittance centers.  Inthat case, Princeton TeleCom can send payments to a scanning workstation atthe remittance center.  From there, payments are uploaded to accountsreceivable systems, processed and posted.  This is also the option forelectronic merchants not comfortable with the idea of an outsider sendingitems directly into their accounts receivable systems, the method PrincetonTeleCom uses for merchants so equipped.The whole electronic process takes place in a maximum of 48 hours:  two hoursfor editing and sorting, and then it's just a matter of catching the billers'15-minute "payment acceptance window."Princeton's 2,000 bill payment originators include KeyCorp, Bank of America,Wells Fargo, Boatmen's Bancshares, Fleet Financial Group, CoreStates, PremierBancorp Inc., Washington Mutual, Barnett Banks Inc.  and Union Bank.Princeton charges billers 10 cents per transaction, while originators, such asbanks, pay 15 cents or less per transaction, based on volume.The more that ideas to increase electronic bill payments get hatched, the morethat chicken-and-egg problems associated with the task will get smashed.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Wrap-up ...ACQUISITIONS + AGREEMENTS CFI ProServices, Inc.  of Portland, OR, is acquiringDayton, OH-based Culverin Corp., a provider of branch automation andremittance processing software products and services.

Minute amendments aside, the most recent round of electronicfunds transfer rules were written at least ten years ago.  Today, new paymenttechnologies are stirring up a whole new set of regulatory dilemmas to bedealt with, not to mention potential fraud pitfalls.Industry experts and regulators are examining whether existing rules fit thenew environment, whether amendments must be written or altogether newregulations drafted, and even more fundamentally, which entities have thejurisdiction to regulate each of the new payment vehicles and write the lawsin the first place.Fast action neededGovernment higher-ups concede that swift action is necessary.  Recently,Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder told the House Subcommittee onDomestic and International Monetary Policy, "Clarifying the legal andregulatory structure that will govern electronic money products is one areathat may need prompt attention from both policymakers and the industry.  Inthis case, failure of the government to act may, ironically, impede ratherthan facilitate private-sector developments."In the mind of at least one banker, one aspect of the coming regulatoryplaying field is clear.  "Regulation should take place at the national level,"says Robert Egan, vice president in Chemical Bank's legal department and a keyplayer in the Financial Services Technology Consortium, a national squadron ofbanks, technology firms, consultants and universities working on varioustechnology projects.  "If you have to deal with local state laws on cards, itbecomes impossible to market a product that can go across state lines."  Thatdynamic is especially important for Internet transactions, where buyer,seller, bank, issuer and online server could all be in different states orcountries.Egan raises another issue.  Cards jointly issued by groups of companies andthat carry multiple functions "result in an overlap of regulators."  Shouldstored-value calling cards, for example, be regulated by the Federal Reserveor the Federal Communications Commission?  "There needs to be some effort tocoordinate [who governs what]."Few wheels in motionSo far, the only concrete action taken in this rocky regulatory arena is aSenate proposal in October to exempt smart cards from Regulation E of theElectronic Funds Transfer Act.  Led by Senators Robert Bennet (R., Utah) andRichard Shelby (R., Alabama), the exemption would free card issuers fromhaving to replace funds on lost or stolen cards and from having to printreceipts for transactions, as stipulated by Reg E."With the new technologies, paper receipt generation is not always feasible,"says Mike Shade, vice president of smart cards at VeriFone, Redwood City, CA.The company is a key player in the SmartCash venture, a group of 11 banks andvarious card technology providers creating the first stored-value cardbusiness that will extend nationwide.  "Electronic receipts may be possible,but certainly not in the form Reg E asks for.  One of the niches smart cardsare supposed to fill is the vending machine, and purchases of that nature.  Itwould be difficult to generate receipts [for purchases of such small amounts]in a manner that complies with Reg E."One alternative to producing paper receipts for small-dollar, stored-valuetransactions is to generate receipts only when loading value onto a card.Ending the paper trail at that point would avoid the burdensome expense ofconstantly generating paper for small-value purchases.What about lost or stolen funds on smart cards?  "If I were to go to my bankand withdraw $100 in $20 bills and then lose one of the bills, I can't go backto the bank for a refund," notes Paul Seader, an attorney affiliated with thelaw firm of Hughes, Hubbard & Reed, and who advises the electronic-cash vendorDigiCash in New York City.  "But what's the status of an electronic cashwithdrawal in this regard, either via a smart card or the Internet?  Theseissues need to be addressed in the contractual arrangements that underlie theissuance of smart cards or electronic cash."You say tomato, I say tomahtoeMuch of the regulatory discourse revolves around whether the new technologieswill be seen as resembling their physical world look-alikes, or as entirelydifferent from their predecessors.  Do Internet credit-card payments, forexample, fit into the current mold of rules for card transactions over thephone and in retail outlets?  "I think regulators are beginning to changetheir approach, to form new categories instead of forcing new technologiesinto old categories," says Magdalena Yesil, director of marketing at Reston,VA-based CyberCash, which is already shooting out encrypted credit-cardpayments on the Internet.  "The Internet itself is going to be a whole newcategory."One innovation that appears to diverge sharply from its real-world counterpartis ecash, Amsterdam-based DigiCash's Internet currency, which made its U.S.debut on the Internet in October (see December BTN).Dan Schutzer, vice president and director of advanced technology at Citibankand director of the Financial Services Technology Consortium, throws out someinteresting questions:  "Will banks exchange ecash for currency, or will it bethe equivalent of currency?  If not, the value of ecash could fluctuaterelative to other companies' electronic money, to the dollar itself and toother currencies."  And then Wall Streeters would start placing bets on ecashexchange rates!An oft-cited concern about ecash is whether a consumer has recourse if a harddrive crashes, the ecash disappears, and it just so happens the owner did notmake a backup copy on disk.  Would Digicash or the issuing bank be held liableto replace the ecash, or is the consumer out of luck?  In this case, if ecashis equated with regular cash, the consumer is out of luck.  But if anamendment declares ecash to be electronic funds, reimbursement would be inorder.Digicash currently doesn't have a policy providing for reimbursement, althoughit's working on one.  On its Web site (http://www.digicash.com), Digicashprovides this nebulous assurance:  "In case your computer were ever to breakdown, if you had written down the secret random seed number you choseinitially when opening your account, future versions would let you use it torecreate the coins and thereby obtain a free re-issue of the signed coins thatwere lost."  St.  Louis-based Mark Twain Bank, the first U.S.  insitution toissue ecash, notes on its Web site that losing ecash is like losing cash outof a real-world wallet.  The bank advises consumers to only stash as muchmoney in the hard drive as one would in the wallet.Square peg in a round hole?Unspent funds on smart cards are the subject of numerous regulatory questions.The funds could be subject to Federal Reserve requirements that 10 percent ofthe floating amount be maintained in a non-interest bearing account againstthe unspent funds, says Bob Ballen, partner at the law firm of Schwartz &Ballen in Washington D.C.For banks involved in smart-card initiatives, such a ruling "would certainlyhave an impact on the earning power of those dollars," says W.  Doug King,executive vice president of consumer credit services at Wachovia Corp., whichis participating in both the Visa stored-value pilot and the SmartCash pilot."But we have been faced with Reserve requirements on deposits forever."In addition, floating funds on smart cards could affect the Fed's ability tomonitor monetary supply by distorting the perception of the amount incirculation.  This could spur a call for disclosure regulation in the future."Having to disclose [floating funds on smart cards] would hinder our desire togo into smart cards," King says.  In his view, however, disclosure isunnecessary.  The Visa system, for example "is fully auditable," he says."All transactions are routed through a single settlement unit."Unspent funds on stored-value cards could also fit into current laws governingescheatment, or abandoned property, although these vary from state to state.William Keenan, senior vice president of marketing and business development atNatWest Bank in Delaware and chair of the legal and public policy subcommitteeof the Smart Card Forum, suggests that cards be confiscated if their value isnot used up after two years.  "But who would regulate that?"  Keenan asks."The Fed would argue that it should be the one.  Stolen cards, on the otherhand, can be deactivated through card readers."The Mondex mystiqueOnce the industry settles all the regulatory issues related to unspent fundson stored-value cards, it still will have to grapple with Mondex.  Thisstored-value card, the brainchild of London-based National Westminster Bank,is currently being piloted in Swindon, U.K.  If all goes well, the cards willhit the U.S., Canada and Hong Kong next year.Mondex cards work just like cash.  Card owners-be they two friends or acustomer and merchant-can transfer funds to one another without going througha middleman.  Because Mondex does not have a central settlement mechanism,many argue that it would be difficult to track how much money is changinghands.But Mondex's chief executive officer, Tim Jones, asserts, "Point-of-saleterminals can remember everything they do, making Mondex more auditable thancash.  It's not a fully accountable system [like some stored-value programs],but still more so than [cash].  We are in discussions with U.S.  regulators.They are doing a good job so far."However, unspent Mondex funds may pose other problems.  "Somewhere, Mondexdollars, either in a reserve amount or actual dollars representing it, is ondeposit and a bank is making lots of money on the float.  From the FederalReserve's standpoint, how do you keep an eye on the currency flow?"  asksHenry Polmer, a partner at Bell, Boyd & Lloyd in Washington D.C., and legalcounsel to Electronic Funds Transfer Association.Auditability is a key component of levying taxes, as well as curbing criminalactivity.  "Taxation is not at all difficult with stored-value transactions atthe point of sale," says Bernard David, director of marketing and planning forthe Smart Card Enterprise at DE-based Electronic Payment Services, aparticipant in the Smart Cash enterprise.  "But with the anonymity oftransactions on the Internet, will taxable transactions be able to be traced,as well as enforced by taxing authorities?"A price for privacyAt the same time that banks face auditability issues with electronic money,they also must deal with requirements of protecting customer information underthe Bank Secrecy Act.  The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions toreport cash transactions of more than $10,000, as well as "suspicioustransactions," to federal law enforcement agencies.  "The cost of auditabilityis a loss of privacy," notes William Binzel, vice president of governmentrelations at MasterCard in Washington D.C.  "Conversely, the cost ofprotecting privacy is not being able to catch people who are doing launderingor other illegal activities."When larger chunks of money start changing hands on the Internet, rules andsystems may have to be set up to act as financial police.  For example,digital signatures and other technologies could authenticate the parties to atransaction.  Currently, Internet transactions veer toward the $10 to $100range, which makes money laundering over the Internet as yet inconvenient.That doesn't mean money-laundering Internet schemes and other crimes won'tcrop up.  Stanley Morris, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network(FinCEN) of the Treasury, described the maladies that could plague theInternet, in a recent hearing of the House Subcommittee on Domestic andInternational Monetary Policy:"Suppose my Internet user is a narcotics trafficker.  Consider the invoicesthe trafficker might pay, the supplies he might order and the transactions hemight accomplish if, for instance, he could download an unlimited amount ofcash from a smart card to a computer, and then transmit those funds to othersmart cards in locations around the world-all anonymously, all without anaudit trail, and all without the need to resort to a traditional financialinsitution."A scary proposition, indeed.  But unlike the woeful circumstances thatultimately resulted in the formation of the Securities and Exchange Commissionand other regulatory agencies, industry experts say a Depression-like crisiswill not be a necessary impetus to establish electronic-money laws.  Says Eganof Chemical Bank, "You hope the regulators will be sufficiently on top ofthings so that when something [bad] happens they can have the tools to dealwith it."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Find The Bank:Wachovia Bank recently unveiled the handsome design of the stored-value Visacards it will issue during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games.

Want to know which bank issued this bank card?You'll have to turn the card over to find, finally, Wachovia's name at thebottom.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996A Card By Any Other Name...It's all in the cards, or is it the name?  Major players in the bank-cardarena are realizing that the skillful naming of new card products has a handin their success.  The barrage of new bank-card options-from stored-valuecards, to debit cards, to multi-function smart cards-is increasing theimportance of effective naming.Hence, Visa U.S.A.  has officially adopted the name "Visa Cash" for itsstored-value cards issued in the U.S., which are currently serving as cashsubstitutes for purchases under $10.  The Visa Cash name and logo wereintroduced last November in Atlanta, prior to its usage at this year's SummerOlympic Games.  The prepaid bank cards operate with embedded computer chipsthat store money as electronic data.Visa's competitors have also opted for simplicity in naming their stored-valuecards.  MasterCard International has chosen "MastercardCash," while SmartCash,the stored value card venture spearheaded by Electronic Payment Services Inc.,will offer SmartCash cards.While the naming of these "cash" cards is straightforward, consumers stillhave to be sure not to confuse them with MasterMoney or VisaCheck cards.Known by bankers as debit cards-since transaction amounts are automaticallywithdrawn from accounts rather than prepaid-both companies nixed using "debit"to describe such cards, due to its negative connotation with consumers.MasterCard surveyed more than 5,000 customers before deciding on theMasterMoney moniker for debit cards, further proof that the name can say itall.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996The Changing Physics Of CheckingQuiz those individuals with a stake in the business on their attitudes towardchecking and you're apt to receive a nearly universal response:  Checking is abusiness undergoing colossal change."It's the new physics of banking," observes Dan Fisher, senior vice presidentand cashier, Victoria Bank and Trust, Victoria, TX.  Industry consolidation isthe leading cause of change for the checking business today.  Fisher mustunderstand this fact first hand:  Victoria Bank, a $2 billion-asset bank,situated in southeast Texas, about midway between Houston and Corpus Christi,will soon become part of the Norwest Corp.  family of banks.  Norwest, amulti-bank holding company headquartered in Minneapolis, tendered a bid forVictoria Bank in November; the acquisition is expected to be finalized earlythis year.What is to become of Fisher's check processing shop once the acquisition byNorwest is completed epitomizes the $64,000 question confronting bankers ofevery ilk involved in the current consolidation frenzy.  No matter howefficient a bank's check operation, experts note, it's difficult for anacquiring bank to justify redundant check processing facilities because theydetract too much from the economies bank consolidations offer.  It's only amatter of time before merged banks begin consolidating check shops.  "With allof the merger activity we saw in 1995, we can expect to see consolidation ofgreater check volumes into single check shops in 1996," predicts Stanley (Ned)Miltko, senior vice president, Littlewood, Shain and Co., Exton, PA.Miltko speculates that, at merging institutions, consolidation will throttlethe processes that support widescale implementation of new technologies, likeelectronic check presentment (ECP) and image check processing.  "Technologyinitiatives are going to have to wait to some degree for the consolidationprocess to shake out," he says.ECP, the equalizerClearly, there is a case to be made for ECP.  In the vernacular of many bankoperations executives, ECP is the great equalizer.  "ECP puts everyone on anequal footing," explains Fisher.  "Distances don't matter anymore when you'reclearing checks electronically."  Nor does size; a small bank can presentchecks with the same ease as its big bank competitor, provided each bank inthe exchange process is ECP-compatible.  "It levels the playing field," saysFisher.But there are many issues that must be resolved before ECP can begin tofulfill its promise of widescale improvements in the efficiency of the checkclearing process.  For example, notes Miltko, in moving away from paperpresentment to a check clearing system that relies more on the exchange ofelectronic files, banks will need to develop techniques for the integration ofback office systems, like accounting and statement rendering, with this newcheck clearing model.  "It's not as simple as installing ECP receive software;it's a whole reengineering of the back office that's required," says Miltko."That's really a tall order."Today, ECP is almost always the electronic transmission of check paymentinformation in advance of the physical exchange of checks.  The idea is to geta jump start on the processing of paper in hopes of identifying early in theprocessing cycle items to be returned.  Clearly, if the paper check never hadto move-if it were truncated at the point of purchase or the bank of firstdeposit-the hassles of reconciling paper and electronic presentments woulddisappear.Truncation woesBut check truncation brings with it an assortment of other problems.  Many ofthe legal assurances that make the check a preferred method of payment inAmerica today simply don't translate into the world of the electronic check.Banks need timely access to truncated checks, or at least to the images ofthose items, to mitigate risks such as return item risk.And then there is the matter of storage-where do banks stow all the checks, orimages of checks, that are truncated and converted to electronic items?  Theseimportant questions must be answered before electronic check processes candisplace a significant share of paper check exchanges.The Federal Reserve organized a panel of bankers and Fed officials late lastyear in an effort to try and address these and related issues.  But before theFed's Advisory Group on ECP can begin to make headway, members will need toagree upon a "common vision" for ECP, notes Paul Connolly, first vicepresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and director of retail paymentproducts for the Federal Reserve Bank System.  "I think all of us wouldbenefit from developing a common vision for ECP:  ideally, a vision ofpaperless collection of checks, and certainly of reduced reliance on paper; avision in which checks could be written by businesses and consumers, and thencollected electronically instead of by processing and delivering the paperchecks themselves," Connolly said in a speech to bankers last fall.Not everyone is optimistic about ECP and truncation, however, even with theFed leading the charge.  One of the real sticking points, says Richard Ercole,Huntington Treasury Management Co., Columbus, OH, is how you supporttruncation at the point of sale.  The model most industry executives point torelies upon the automated clearing house (ACH) to clear the electronic itemscreated from truncated checks.  And the National Automated Clearing HouseAssociation (NACHA) has gone so far as to create a multi-industry panel, theElectronic Check Council, to promote this approach to truncation.But Ercole, who participates on the NACHA panel, says there are many legal andregulatory issues that get in the way of truncation.  For example, once acheck is converted to an ACH debit, in today's world at least, it becomessubject to Regulation E, the Fed's consumer electronic funds transferregulation.  Reg E, among other things, provides consumers with a 60-dayopportunity to rescind contested EFT transactions.There also have been questions raised about whether or not consumers should berequired to authorize the truncation of checks tendered at the point of sale.An initial test plan for POS truncation, involving only return checks, alreadyhas been placed on the back burner because of questions such as these, Ercolenotes.  Any widespread implementation of check truncation at the point of saleis probably a long way off, he suggests.Trading in efficiency?"Quite frankly, I'm not sure we can truncate checks at the point of receiptwithout making the payment system less efficient," says Ercole.  "I thinkeither legislation or regulations are going to have to be changed, at least asfar as forward presentment is concerned."Another contentious issue raised by truncation is storage.  Truncation oflockbox items illustrates the situation aptly.  As image technology makesinroads in lockbox operations, experts say the case for truncating checkscollected through lockboxes becomes even more compelling.  "What do you needthe check copy for if you can have the image of the check?"  asks RichardPoje, a partner at Treasury Strategies Inc., a Chicago cash managementconsulting firm.  But, then, who is to retain the images of those checks forthose situations when a payor or payee needs a copy of an item?"The absence of an accessible, economic archive is a major impediment totruncation on a broad-scale basis," says Poje.  To overcome this impediment,Poje suggests bankers turn to the Fed.  "I think the Fed is the naturalprovider" of check image archive services.  "They are the honest broker in thebusiness; the one party everybody trusts."But how will the Fed get the images?  Today, only about one-third of theestimated 63 billion checks written that are tendered for payment each yearclear though the Fed.  "The concept of a repository needs to be developedaround the whole clearing structure," says Jay Simmons, vice president,Citibank.  "The Fed should be doing it for the items that clear through them."But to forward to the Fed for storage those check images that are not clearedthrough the Fed, would diminish many of the economies promised by truncation,Simmons suggests.The more appropriate role for the Fed in the evolution of electronic checkprocesses, Simmons says, is in rule writing.  As a regulator, the Fed canimplement rules that provide the assurances banks need to overcome theshortcomings of ECP and truncation.  "I think that's their role in life," hesays.Putting imaging in its placeAnd, what about imaging?  After years of promise, imaging has yet to makemajor inroads into the labor-intensive proof-of-deposit function.  But imagingis gaining favor for specialized applications, such as lockbox and return itemprocessing.  "To me, an imaging system focused on returns makes a great dealof sense," says Simmons.  "It takes a lot of the risk out of the process."During the course of a typical month, Simmons notes, a major cash managementbank might return between 4,000 and 5,000 checks that have been presentedagainst controlled disbursement accounts.  Sending those checks back throughthe paper return cycle can take upwards of five days; transmitting images ofthe items is a far quicker alternative.One potential obstacle, Simmons concedes, is the current lack of imagingstandards.  Differences in the way the two major brands of check imagingequipment-Unisys Corp.  and IBM Corp.-convert paper checks to electronicimages makes broad-scale image interchange an iffy proposition.At least two groups-the New York Clearing House (NYCH) and the FinancialServices Technology Consortium (FSTC)-are working on projects to perfect theuse of images to support the check return process and check image interchange,Simmons notes.  (Citibank is a member of both groups.)  If the FSTC and NYCHprojects prove successful, imaging could help the private sector chip away atthe Fed's return item processing business.Today, the vast majority of check returns are routed through the Fed.  It'slargely a matter of convenience, explains Huntington's Ercole.  The Fed'sprices are such that it is often cheaper to send the Fed a mixed cashletterthan it is for a bank to sort the items itself.  Imaging, Ercole suggests,makes it worthwhile for a third party, like a clearing house, to fine sort andcapture the images of checks for its members (or clients), thereby enabling itto compete head-to-head with the Fed.Online access to check images, he believes, could expedite the return processby at least a day.  Ercole's parent bank, Huntington, is a founding member ofthe National Clearing House Association (NCHA), which competes with the Fedfor nationwide check clearing business.  It's all in keeping with what bankerslike Victoria Bank's Fisher like to refer to as the "changing physics" ofbanking, where the evolution of check products and services draws upon theunlimited power of electronics rather than the physical limitations of paper."We have a system that is designed to deal with exceptions," explains Fisher."So why not create an image-based infrastructure for return items?"The conversion of other paper-based check processes to electronics, suggestFisher and others, will just follow naturally.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996INTERACTIVE BEATWill New Service Send Customers Out The Door?  Whether the newest feature tobe added to the interactive banking package from Online Resources &Communications, Inc., McLean, VA, will be a boom or bust to banks is entirelydebatable.Online's Interbank Transfer Service gives consumers an easy way to shop aroundfor the most competitive banking rates and electronically transfer money intobanks that offer the most attractive options.  At the same time, however,consumers also have the ability to take money out of their banks more quicklyand easily than ever.  Whether a bank is on the winning or losing end of thatequation will determine just how much value they find in Online's newoffering."It seems absurd that banks would want to offer this service," says DavidStewart, consultant at Global Concepts, Inc., Atlanta.  "Obviously, it ispotentially damaging for banks that are looking to maintain and strengthen arelationship with the customer."  In essence, banks are encouraging a "shoparound" attitude, Stewart says.  The only benefit may be if banks believe itadvantageous to offer as many options as possible, even at the risk of losingbusiness, he adds.To use the interbank transfer feature, a consumer need only sign up (at noadded cost) for the service through an Online Resources client financialinstitution that is marketing the feature.  Consumers can then access funds invirtually any U.S.  institution from their home- or office-based PCs orscreenphones.  Three banks that are currently using the service includeNationsbank, Comstar Federal Credit Union, Gaithersburg, MD, and Richmond,CA-based Mechanics Bank."I'm not sure there's any way to ensure that funds won't leave your bank,"says Alex Hart, vice president of customer access at NationsBank.  "But, thebest way to keep funds in your bank is to offer customers the services theywant."  As a service provider, Hart concludes that a bank needs to be focusedon offering the type of functionality and services desired by customers.  "Youshould not be so proprietary to deny customers the conveniences they wantpurely for defensive reasons," he says.Online Resources contends that its new service feature is as beneficial forbanks as it is for consumers.  Says Lori Stewart, Online Resource's seniorvice president of marketing, the service is a "big benefit" for banks becauseit is the first interactive way to transfer new funds into the bank.12 Merchants Get Smart With First UnionFirst Union Corp.  is the first to announce merchant commitments toparticipate in a smart-card trial during this year's Summer Olympics inAtlanta.  The First Union Visa Cash card will be accepted by most of themerchants as early as first quarter of the year.  Two other banks scheduled toissue Visa Cash cards-NationsBank and Wachovia-had not announced any merchantagreements as of November.The 12 merchants signed up with First Union for the test launch includeBaskin-Robbins, BellSouth, Blimpie, Chick-fil-A, Communications Central, CrownCentral Petroleum, Domino's Pizza, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid TransitAuthority, Pollo Tropical, Star Enterprise, Taco Bell and United ArtistTheaters.  According to First Union officials, several other merchants havealready signed letters of intent for participation.The prepaid stored-value cards are available in $10, $20, $50 and eventually$100 values, and may be obtained by anyone regardless of their bankaffiliation or credit history.  There is no fee to buy or use the cards, whichcan be purchased with cash, credit or debit cards.  Omaha, NE-based AppliedCommunications, Inc.  is providing the BASE24 software needed to load cashvalue onto the First Union cards, which can be used wherever the Visa Cashlogo appears.Visa is officially leading the smart card race in North America, withLondon-based Mondex running close behind.  Mondex just announced a 12-monthpilot in the city of Guelph, Ontario scheduled for the latter half of thisyear.  Mondex began piloting the system last July in Swindon, England andreports usage by more than 8,000 consumers.  Plans are also underway foradditional pilots in the U.S., Asia and Europe.Other competitors include Electronic Payment System's SmartCash (11participants in this), which is expected to hit the U.S.  market sometimelater this year along with Mastercard International's MastercardCash, alreadyin circulation in Australia.  Even American Express is making sure it is notleft behind in the dust.  Teaming up with MCI, American Express Special Teamsis planning to market "integrated service" cards for stored-value applicationsto college campuses in the U.S.  and abroad for a 1996 release.All-in-one cards comingBy mid 1996, First Union will introduce reloadable stored-value cards.Customers will be able to add cash value to the cards by using a First UnionATM machine to access their checking or savings accounts.  The eventual goalis an all-in-one card that will function as stored-value, debit and/or creditcard.Next year, First Union plans to expand Visa Cash cards to other cities,including the greater Washington, D.C.  area, Richmond, VA, and major Floridametropolitan areas.  Major cities in North Carolina, South Carolina andTennessee are planned for 1998.MasterCard Bounces Checkfree For ServantisMasterCard International announced an alliance with Norcross, GA-basedServantis Systems, Inc.  as part of several enhancements being made to itsMasterBanking program.  The Servantis alliance will eventually override theexisting agreement between Checkfree Corp., the Columbus, OH-based billpayment processor, and MasterCard that began three years ago with the launchof the MasterBanking program.  The enhanced MasterBanking program will beavailable during the first quarter of this year.  MasterCard contends thatunder a mutually modified agreement, the 50,000 MasterBanking customers whosetransactions are currently passed on to Checkfree will be converted over tothe Servantis system.  Full conversion is expected by mid 1996.Dual role"There is no problem with Checkfree, it's just a different choice of atechnology partner," says A.  Christian Frederick, MasterCard senior vicepresident of remote banking and strategic planning.  "We wanted the dualfunctionality offered by Servantis rather than just the bill payment optionoffered by Checkfree."The dual functionality Frederick refers to is Servantis' ability to offer bothhome banking and bill payment capabilities.  The Servantis software allowscustomers looking for simple, quick access to their finances to checkbalances, transfer funds, pay bills and send and receive email messages to andfrom their financial institution through Windows- and Macintosh-basedcomputers.  Servantis will market these products and services as Bank StreetPlatinum.US Order Delivers Smarter Phones At Lower CostAvailable at a cost of about $200 (down from $250), U.S.  Order's smart phonesnot only got cheaper, they got smarter.  The Herndon, VA-based companyannounced three new interactive features for its PhonePlus line of smarttelephones.With the introduction of three features-EZPage text paging, EZPost emailservice and FastFind visual directory assistance-PhonePlus smart phones nowhave the capability to type and send full text messages directly to pagers,send email messages via the Internet and receive nationwide directoryassistance information visually on the phone's display screen.  These threeapplications add to its established functionality, which includes an interfacewith Visa's electronic banking and bill payment service.  The screenphonesalso provide a personal phone directory, visual caller ID and visual messageretrieval features.Banc One, headquartered in Columbus, OH, and Memphis-based First TennesseeBank have both begun deployment of the Phone Plus Smart Phone while 18 otherfinancial institutions are planning to deploy the phones for technicalevaluation and trials.  Current PhonePlus customers will be able to downloadthe new applications directly from the US Order host computer.  New customerscan purchase the new smart phones through GTE and Sprint.IRE Helps Secure Quicken OnlineBaltimore-based Information Engineering Resources is providing Intuit ServiceCorp.  with secure remote access products to protect electronic commercetransactions.  The encryption equipment, now available through Intuit'sQuicken software, is packaged in a small, portable case designed forconvenient use in home banking.Banks have been up and running with Quicken since Oct.  26, 1995.  The onlineQuicken service enables consumers to bank, pay bills and perform otherfinancial tasks by dialing up their bank and downloading data directly intothe software, which then organizes consumers' records.Founded in the early 1980's, Information Engineering Resources is a publiccompany that designs, manufactures and markets secure, encryption-basedcommunications systems.  The company reported revenues in excess of $4 millionlast year, up 60 percent from the previous year, according to companyspokesperson Jill Leukhardt.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996PRODUCT OF THE MONTH:  Shaping A Competitive ImageShortly after First Commerce Bank of Georgia, $120 million in assets,installed the PrimeImage Check Imaging System, bank officials had proof theymade the right decision.  With PrimeImage, the bank was able to detect afraudulent-check situation that would have resulted in a loss of $160,000."Since the system allows instant retrieval of the previous day's deposits, wewere able to substantiate a suspected kite, therefore saving us from asubstantial loss," says Randy Whitehead, group vice president.  "Withmicrofilm, there is no way we would have been able access our records as fastto move on the situation."The PrimeImage Check Imaging System from Carrollton, GA-based Greenway Corp.is a Windows-NT based check and document imaging software system.  One uniqueaspect of PrimeImage is that it utilizes a Redundant Array of Independent Disk(RAID) system for online, magnetic storage of images.  The online RAID systemreduces statement preparation time by 90 percent over optical storage systems.With PrimeImage, the front and back of each check and deposit slip is capturedby electronic cameras mounted on an image-enabled check reader/sorter andtransferred to a RAID system for high capacity, online magnetic storage withfault tolerant safety.  The software system has the capability to assemble theimages and print up to 33 double-sided check-statement pages per minute incheck-number order.  Thus, it streamlines operations by simplifying thecheck-sorting process and reducing the number of employees involved.First Commerce Bank served as the beta site for PrimeImage.  Fully implementedin June 1995, the system processes all checks for more than 10,000 FirstCommerce accounts.  Whitehead points out that the bank has also prevented fouror five other potential losses since installing the complete system in August.He concludes, "It really has been an excellent overall move for the bank interms of time, accuracy, staff productivity and customer service."Banks using the PrimeImage software report that customers find the newtechnology improves the way they balance their checkbooks.  First Commerce'sWhitehead says "customers love it" and reports a 99.5 percent satisfactionrate with the new laser printed statements.First National Bank of Griffin, $150 million in assets, installed thePrimeImage system in November.  Prior to the system's implementation, theGeorgia-based bank conducted focus groups comprised of a variety ofprofessional and lay people to determine consumer opinion on the newtechnology.  The overwhelming majority agreed the system was a quicker andeasier alternative to the "old" checking system.Elderly customers, in particular, were especially appreciative of the easy tounderstand statements, says Bill Homes, senior vice president at FirstNational Bank of Griffin.  With PrimeImage, checks are reduced to print-outsthat can be stored in a three-ring notebook provided by the bank.  "Ourcustomers are very comfortable and extremely pleased with our new system," hesays.Other banks using the PrimeImage software include Moultre, GA-based ABCBancorp ($314 million in assets), which installed the system in December, andNorthwest Georgia Bank in Ringgould, GA ($180 million in assets), which willbe up and running with the system in February.-Joanna KolorPrimeImageGreenway Corp.  1340 North Park Street Carrollton, GA 30117 Price:  $258,000to $475,000 Release Date:  August 1995 Number of Bank Users:  4Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996An Unbalanced Budget BurdenIt's not easy being a medium-sized institution these days.  That's at leastone of the findings of an annual survey of bank and thriftinformation-technology expenditures from Mentis Corp., Durham, NC.The amount of money banks and thrifts of all sizes spent to purchase newinformation systems, hardware and software reached $4.3 billion in 1995, upfrom $3.7 billion in 1994, a 17-percent increase.  In addition to the $4.3billion of capital invested in new technology, the industry spent more than$20 billion on personnel, facilities, external services and other expensecategories associated with running existing systems and equipment.Interestingly, the extent to which banks increased their capital investment intechnology differed greatly depending on the deposit size of the bank, thesurvey found.  With consolidations roiling and churning the industrypractically weekly, such size-based spending suggests banks are usingtechnology as a tool to either defend, expand or control their turf.Medium-sized institutions were the most aggressive investors in new technologyin 1995.  For many of them, potent technology-based strategies were the key tomaintaining their independence against ever-bigger banks encroaching on theirterritory.  Mentis found that the segment with between $1 billion and $4billion in deposits experienced an increase in capital IT spending of 41percent, from $413 million to $582 million.  That hefty increase occurred evenas the number of branches these institutions own and operate went down (from11,278 in 1994 to 10,765 in 1995).  By the same token, the segment ofinstitutions with between $500 million and $1 billion in deposits boosted ITcapital spending by 29 percent, from $184 million to $238 million, even thoughthey too, had fewer branches to maintain (5,765 in 1994 versus 5,107 in 1995).When examined by branch, average technology spending for institutions withbetween $1 billion and $4 billion in deposits increased by 48 percent perbranch between 1994 and 1995 (from $36,620 to $54,064 per branch).  For thesegment with between $500 million and $1 billion, such spending per branchincreased a 46 percent (from $31,917 to $46,603).  These stats lead to thesummary that medium-sized institutions may well be feeling the heat to competemore effectively-either to keep up with large banks, or at least avoid beingtaken over by them.  Clearly, banks and thrifts of this size are usingtechnology to pursue aggressive business strategies toward those ends.Aggressive goalsOne case in point, among many, is Centura Bank, Rocky Mount, NC.  The $5billion institution is surrounded on all sides by some formidable big-bankcompetition, including NationsBank, First Union and Wachovia.  Over the pastyear, Centura has geared the bulk of its bank technology spending toward avery specific, aggressive goal:  toward becoming the "money manager" of itscustomers, says Tom Rogers, executive vice president.  Investing in technologywas virtually the only way to ensure the success of that strategy.A month or two from now, Centura will wrap up a branch automation project thatshould facilitate the bank's goal of better understanding customers' financialsituations, their needs and their profitability profiles.  Centura'sinstallation of Windows-based SellStation software from Ampersand Corp.  (nowowned by EDS Corp.)  at the teller and platform lines hooks into a customerinformation system, from Customer Insight Co., Denver.  Customer Insight'sAnalytix Software delivers customer information, including profitability,directly to salespeople at the platform, helping them to gear product pitchesto the appropriate customers.All of these systems and features at the platform are helping to buildbusiness in the bank's new brokerage unit, which offers insurance andinvestment accounts.  Rogers was not specific about revenues or new accountsgenerated in this area, but relates that "from a business plan standpoint, thenew units are making very good progress."For Centura, technology was the "tool chest" that helped make it possible.Quite simply, Rogers says, "we need those [technology] tools to compete, andto achieve our objective of being money managers."Big banks reign inCompared to medium-sized banks and thrifts, the biggest institutions spent farless on acquiring new technology in 1995.  Banks and thrifts with more than $4billion in deposits increased capital IT investments by only 17 percent, from$2.3 billion to $2.6 billion.  The increase is even more modest in light ofthe fact that the number of branches these institutions own and operate alsoincreased, from 33,942 to 35,222.Many large banks and thrifts, having merged recently, are being sidetrackedfrom new-investment initiatives as they grapple with the huge jobs ofeliminating multiple information systems and paring overlapped branchnetworks.  Of course, there's light at the end of the tunnel for these banksand thrifts.  As these large institutions succeed in eliminating redundancies,they should be able to redirect future IT expenditures toward capitalinvestments in new strategic initiatives.Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, to be officially combined as the largestbank in the land come March, are in that limbo stage right now.  But with theexpectation of eliminating 12,000 positions, consolidating back-office systemswithin three years, and saving $1.5 billion in expenses, the combined bankshould be in a position to invest in new technology before long.  The newChase is predicting a revenue fall within the first year of merged operation,a year of break-even growth after that, and finally, revenue gains by 1998.The objectives and experiences of small banks and thrifts turned out to bealtogether different from those of larger institutions in 1995, when it cameto investments in technology.  According to the Mentis survey, banks andthrifts with less than $500 million showed a much lower growth rate in theiracquisition of new technology.  Those with between $250 million and $500million in deposits spent 15 percent less investing in new technology (from$229 million to $195 million) while those under $250 million increased theirtechnology expenditures by only 10 percent (from $598 million to $657million).These lagging trends in technology budgets make sense in light of the decreasein the number of branches owned and operated by this segment of the bank andthrift population.  Institutions with between $250 million and $500 million indeposits now operate 728 fewer branches (6,767 in 1994 versus 6,039 in 1995),while those with less than $250 million are dealing with 2,834 fewer branches(28,425 in 1994 versus 25,591 in 1995).Despite the overall decrease in technology investment for small banks andthrifts, the Mentis study shows small institutions are nonetheless beginningto invest in technology at a level that's on par with their larger brethren.Mentis examined how capital technology expenditures compare to institutions'non-interest expenditures-all those expenditures that support a bank'soperations and facilities, such as personnel and technology.For banks and thrifts with deposits of more than $1 billion in deposits, 1995capital technology expenditures amounted to 2.5 percent of total non-interestexpenditures.  For those institutions between $250 million and $1 billion,capital technology spending was 1.9 percent of non-interest expenditures, andfor those with less than $250 million in deposits, it was 2.0 percent.According to Dr.  James Moore, president and CEO of Mentis, the slightlyhigher technology investments of larger banks as a percent of non-interestexpenditures is not a surprise.  "Economies of scale and consolidation in thelarge bank segment allow a greater proportion of total dollars to go towardacquiring new technology," he says, as opposed to managing the currentinfrastructure.The good news is that small banks and thrifts seem to be taking the challengeof a lack of scale economies in stride, especially as advanced technologybecomes more affordable to them.  If small institutions can't spend asaggressively as large ones, they at least seem to be spending wisely.  Taketiny State National Bank of Big Spring, TX.  With $130 million in assets, thebank has not let its small size get in the way of innovative ideas and astutetechnology investments.Busy, busy, busyIts list of technology credits include just completing installation of a checkimaging system, developing a debit-card program through MasterCard'sMasterMoney offering, launching an electronic data interchange (EDI)translation service and offering voice-response access to account balances.Prior to these projects-most of which occurred in 1995-the bank was busyinstalling a fully loaded local area network that runs Windows-basedapplications for lending, account openings and other platform functions.  Onthe agenda for 1996 is home banking.Decisive movesRobert Buckner, first vice president, can't yet quantify the payback the bankhas received, since most of the projects are just starting to have an effecton customers now.  But State National is moving decisively to ensure itsinvestments pay off.In just one example of moving swiftly to offer a service most large banks areonly now just dreaming of, State National will be delivering check images toits fleet of networked PCs to aid customer service efforts.  Bankers will beable to print out the front and back of checks in response to customerrequests.  And in a move that some institutions might think radical, StateNational will charge a fee to customers who want paper checks returned, butwill offer imaged checking-account statements for free.State National is not only thinking big, but is thinking creatively about howto get good returns on technology investments.  Recently, it instituted whatcould be a first:  a wake-up service brought to you by a bank.  Through itsvoice response system, supplied by Regency Voice Systems, Inc., Dallas, StateNational has rigged a wake-up service that sends out ring-a-lings to about 100people every morning.  The message offers the time, the temperature and afriendly "Good morning from State National Bank!"The bank does not feel a need to charge a fee for such calls.  "We figure thatif the first thing you hear every morning is the name of our bank, then prettysoon that's the only name that comes to mind when banking comes up," notesBrunckner.Flexible, free-form thinking like that, in addition to the ever-declining costof PC-based banking applications, will help small banks bring much-neededefficiency gains to technology expenditures.And once a much-needed calm to the industry's current consolidation frenzysettles in, perhaps operating budgets will begin following a more steady,consistent pattern across banks of all sizesBack to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996PRODUCT INTROSFor An Encore, Culverin Promotes Self-ServiceImagine customers who act as tellers for themselves.  Dayton, OH-basedCulverin Corp.  is doing just that, as it positions the self-service packagefor its Encore!  for Windows application system as a labor-saving tool.Recently, Culverin was acquired by CFI ProServices, Portland, OR.The self-service package runs on a touchscreen-equipped PC.  With a cardreader and laser printer, customers can get account and product information,print instant statements and run simple, non-cash transactions.  PINs maintaincustomer security.Although the self-service package can run independently of the Encore!system, Culverin doesn't plan to market it as such, says Robert Feaganes,marketing director.  The software package will probably cost $5,000 to $7,000per workstation, he says.  Add the hardware required to run it, and the systemcomes in priced at less than $10,000.

With the ID-007, Atlanta-based Cadix International, Inc., bringssignature verification into the electronic age.  A pressure sensitive writingtablet and Windows-based driver software make up the ID-007 system.The ID-007 documents not only the shape of a signature, but also the pressureand speed with which a person signs.  When first registering with the system,a customer signs three to five times to give a large enough sample.  TheID-007 software normalizes the signature and creates a 1.5 KB template.Future signatures are compared to the template.  The system continues toupdate the template with each genuine signature, as the template, like aperson's signature, changes gradually over time.The system operates on either a local computer or over a network.

The first is a fingerprint scanner"about the size of four average mice," says Anna Stockel, Identix's directorof fingerprint identification products.  The scanner connects to a standardPC-mounted card.The company using the system creates a database by scanning the fingerprintsof people it will wish to later identify.  The Identix system creates andstores digital templates for these fingerprints.  To positively identify aperson, the system creates a second template from a new scan and compares itwith the old template.Stockel emphasizes that unless the system is specially ordered, fingerprintimages cannot be generated from templates.  This lack, she says, helps calmcustomers or users who fear their fingerprints, after they are scanned, willbe compared to law agency records.Stockel declined to give price information on the Touchsafe II system.Identix, Inc., (408) 739-2000.Budgeting Service For Check CustomersFor businesses and families on a budget, every check written is important.Banks using Budget Master software, a product of Wausau Financial Systems,Inc., can deliver to their budget-conscious customers statements thatcategorize cashed checks into various budget areas.Banks with Budget Master software issue special budget checking accounts.Checks for these accounts are imprinted with 21 to 35 special symbols, createdby OnTRACK Management Systems, Inc., Downey, CA.  When writing a check, acustomer marks one or more symbols for budget categories into which thepayment falls.  At the bank, these check categories are keyed in along withthe other check information required to process a check.Wausau, based in Mosinee, WI, also plans to release an image capture versionof the software, says Joe Gregory, product development manager.

Visa U.S.A.sure seems to think so.  Recently, the bank card association staked out astrikingly bold claim in the still-developing world of Web commerce.Visa announced it will collaborate with Sony Corp.  of America to build aslick entertainment- and information-rich Web site-one that will takeadvantage of Sony's multiple strengths in filmmaking, music, television,radio, consumer electronics and video games, among others.  The site, dubbedSony Station, will be available for access in spring 1996.  Web surfers willbe able to access loads of new content that Sony is developing for thismedium, such as interactive tours with bands, live dating games andinformation sessions with audio experts.Visa's role in this venture is to act as the exclusive processor of securepayments and micropayments for those who purchase entertainment or otherproducts from the Web site.  Visa's bold move excludes other brands of debit,credit and chip cards for use on the Web site.  In other words, consumers willnot be able to use MasterCard or other card brands to make Sony Stationpurchases.  In essence, Visa is attempting to create a new model for Internetpayments where duality-the accepted practice of having issuers and merchantsoffer and accept multiple brands of bank cards-is a no go."Visa's going in the wrong direction," says David Weisman, analyst atForrester Research, Cambridge, MA.  "It's an attempt to say Visa has the onlysecure payment system for the Internet, which it doesn't.  Now is not the timeto be staking territory."Visa's attempt to create a non-dual world on the Internet harks back to itsannouncement last September that it had established a secure transactionprotocol for Internet payments.  The announcement caught the industry bysurprise because Microsoft, not MasterCard, shared the podium with Visa.Prior to the unexpected revelation, Visa and MasterCard had said publicly thatthey were collaborating on a single standard for secure Internet transactions.During the press conference announcing Sony Station, Carl Pascarella, Visa'spresident and CEO, said that the differences between the Visa- andMasterCard-led secure Internet protocols were "minimal."

The list of high-profileinstitutions to sign up with Microsoft toward the end of 1995 includesCiticorp, Merrill Lynch & Co.  Inc., Charles Schwab & Co., KeyCorp, CrestarBank and Sanford C.  Bernstein & Co.  Inc.Most of these firms are employing Microsoft Back Office, a set ofnext-generation business applications for NT servers.  According to Microsoft,shipments of the Windows NT Server increased 70 percent between the first andsecond quarters of 1995.  Even so, Windows NT, which hit the market in 1993,still has a long way to go to catch up to the financial-services market shareof server operating-systems currently owned by Novell's NetWare networkoperating system, according to a 1995 survey by The Tower Group, Wellesley,MA.  Windows NT represented only 18 percent of new server operating-systempurchases by banks in 1995, compared to the whopping 52 percent represented byNovell NetWare.However, that 52 percent represents a harsh loss of share for Novell, becauseit is down significantly from 1994's 72 percent, according to Tower.  NT's18-percent share, meanwhile, represents dramatic momentum, up from only twopercent in 1994.  Through all this, IBM Corp.'s OS/2 LAN Server maintained aneven 20-percent market share in 1994 and 1995, according to Tower.Many of the applications being put on Windows NT these days are consideredmission-critical.  New York-based Citibank, with more than $250 billion inassets, will be rolling out more than 10,000 machines grounded in NT over thenext three years.  The bank will develop its future line of ATMs, in-branchkiosks and staff workstations on Windows NT.The $14 billion Crestar Bank, Richmond, VA, also is putting NT to work inbranch automation.  Crestar had been using Bankpro branch automation softwarefrom Dallas-based Argo Data on OS/2 operating systems at all of its branches.When Argo announced that it would make Bankpro available on Windows NT,Crestar agreed to be one of the beta test sites for the NT version."Many of the other local area networks operating within the organization arepredominantly Microsoft and Novell-based solutions," explains David Holman,senior vice president and manager of branch operations at Crestar.  "If we areable to run the mission-critical branch automation on Microsoft, we will havemade a significant step forward in achieving increased compatibility betweenoperating systems across corporate LANs."Cleveland-based KeyCorp, with $68 billion in assets, began piloting Windows NTfor branch automation at four branches in Columbus, OH, last September.  Bythe end of October, the Columbus branches had a total of about 18 workstationsequipped with NT running Olivetti Corp.'s Mosaic OA branch managementsoftware.By the end of 1996, full functionality will be realized in 200 KeyCorpbranches.  Ultimately, the NT system will run database marketing programs,interactive video banking kiosks, telephone banking services, enhanced ATMfunctionality and smart card services.  Says Janet Malecki, vice president ofKey Services Corp., the move is part of the institution's "First Choice 2000Strategic Initiative," a set of goals for the turn of the century.Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, will implement Windows NT on all its 700 branchservers and 25,000 desktops.  Sanford Bernstein & Co.  already has migrated 25servers and 400 workstations to Microsoft Back Office and plans to migrate itsremaining mainframe-based applications, such as portfolio accounting andanalytical modeling, to the Windows NT Server.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HP Dresses Up Teller Windows At WachoviaMicrosoft's Windows NT is not the only high-powered operating system makingits way into bank branches.  At Wachovia Bank, Winston-Salem, NC, HewlettPackard computers will automate teller windows at some 500 branches in Northand South Carolina and Georgia.  Wachovia plunked down $30 million on theintelligent HP workstations and the AT&T GIS servers that will feed them.  Onthe platform side of branch operations, Wachovia uses IBM workstations runningOS/2.  Previously, the bank used an IBM 4700 configuration in its branches andin other areas.William Scales, Wachovia's manager of computing and network services justifiesthe huge investment as part of a long-term strategy.  "We've put in a baseplatform that will give us a lot of flexibility in the future," he says.  Theterminals could soup up customer service and rev up cross selling at theteller location, for example.The HP implementation is also an extension of an ongoing relationship with thePalo Alto, CA-based computer vendor.

At a time whenIntuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money are the bulls in the PC home bankingmarket, these three banks have bought ownership stakes in Meca Software, whoseManaging Your Money application holds, at best, about 10 percent of themarket."The banks that invested in Meca want to be able to offer a full-featurepersonal financial management package that's bank-branded, so the relationshipis with the bank rather than with the software package itself," says DavidWeisman, analyst at the Forrester Group, Cambridge, MA.  "With Quicken orMoney, the customer relationship is with the package, not the bank."Besides displaying only bank logos, the Meca software allows banks todetermine which financial services to offer.  Banks also can choose fromvarious back-end payment systems processors.  "The cornerstone of the bank'srelationship with its customers has been the payment system.  And if youbelieve that there's an opportunity to merge the payment system with Internetcommerce, then you would want to make sure that you were in control of thatpayment system," says Paul Harrison, president and CEO of Meca."Canadianizing" home bankingMeca's flexibility has special appeal for Toronto-based Royal Bank, becausewith Meca, it can easily "Canadianize" PC home banking.  Canada's currency andfinancial regulations are not fully accommodated by US-oriented packages likeQuicken and Money, points out Dan Maceluch, a spokesman for the bank.  Forexample, Canadian retirement plans are called Registered Retirement SavingsPlans, rather than 401(K)s, as denoted on US-made software, and are controlledby a different set of laws.  Similarly, tax filings are conducted differentlyand need to be molded within the software accordingly."We would also like to offer the software to the different subsidiaries ofRoyal Bank, like Royal Trust, Royal Mutual Funds, RBCDS Dominion Securitiesand Action Direct, our discount brokerage," notes Maceluch.  "You have tocreate all of those interfaces.  It's not a matter of handing out boxes ofsoftware to customers."  Royal plans on distributing the package for free, andcharging an as-yet undetermined monthly fee.The three new Meca banks join San Francisco-based Bank of America, with morethan $215 billion in assets, and Charlotte-based NationsBank, with $169billion in assets, which collaborated to buy the Fairfield, CT-based Meca lastspring.  Each of the five banks now owns 20 percent of Meca.  The ownershipring is potentially open to a few more bidders-although Harrison asserts hedoesn't want too many owners.Others cluing inUltimately, Meca will offer and tailor the product for non-owner banks.  Otherplans include rolling a wider range of services onto the application, such asbrokerage, loan origination, insurance, and even travel tickets and catalogs.The three banks' versions of the application will begin appearing on themarket the first half of this year.These banks are "not the only ones" cluing in to the importance of brandingfinancial software, says William Randle, director of marketing and strategicplanning at Huntingon Bancshares, Columbus, OH.  "Our view of the future is anelectronic gateway that says 'Huntington.' Microsoft and Intuit have differentviews," he asserts.  Randle has faith that "most banks will take action toprotect their customer relationships, so the brand in front of the customer istheir own.  The advantage banks have is they currently own the customerrelationships."Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996AOL, Intuit Pave Yet Another Electronic PathNow that Intuit, Inc.  and America Online, Inc.  have joined forces to provideonline electronic banking services, consumers have one more entry into theevolving world of home banking.  The strategic alliance between the twoindustry leaders opens the door to electronic banking for the millions ofAmerica Online members.  At the same time, it creates yet another productdetour for consumers en route to banks.AOL subscribers will have point-and-click access to financial servicesincluding checking, savings, money market and credit card accounts-as long asthese accounts are located at banks participating in the new AOL service.These banks will charge fees independent of the AOL subscriber fee.Providing AOL access will be easiest for banks already offering electronicbanking services via Intuit's Quicken.  For these banks, no additionalequipment or programming will be necessary-a single connection to IntuitServices Corp.  will give these banks the ability to communicateelectronically with the eight million Quicken users and the four million AOLmembers alike.However, experts caution the potential hazards of banks engaging in such anoffering.  "It's a double-edged sword," points out David Weisman, an analystat Forrester Research, Cambridge, MA.  "It's a tempting place to be becauseIntuit and AOL have such great target customer bases."  But, as more bankssign on to offer their products through AOL, "you run the risk of becomingjust another computer icon within someone else's financial powerhouse."Will banks go for it?  "We won't be jumping on this," says Doug Haynes, seniorvice president at $5.1 billion Centura Bank, Rocky Mount, NC, which offersboth Quicken and Microsoft Money to its customers.  "Obviously AOL is one ofthe more popular online service providers.  So it's certainly something we'llbe looking into down the road."  Haynes adds that the bank is too busy rightnow focusing efforts on its recent rollouts of Quicken and Money.One more optionFirst National Bank of Chicago, another adopter of both Quicken and Money, isinvestigating the AOL/Intuit service.  "Right now, we can say to ourcustomers, 'If you don't like Quicken, you can use Microsoft Money' or viceversa," says Tom Kelly, spokesperson.  "If we were to sign on with AOL, wewould then be able to provide one more option to our customers."According to Linda Parker, senior vice president at US Bancorp, Portland, OR,the AOL/Intuit product description is "very attractive."  The real advantagefor banks, she says, is the potential to tap into a customer segmentunreachable through personal finance software.The collaborative electronic banking service is expected to be launched duringthe first half of this year for Windows users and by the end of the year forMacintosh users.  Nevertheless, no financial institutions had committedthemselves as of press time.Prior to the alliance, the Vienna, VA-based online service provider had onlyone other online banking service agreement, with Bank of America, which hadestablished a site on AOL's Personal Finance channel last year.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996New Directions EDS, The Exchange Create New NetworkEDS and The Exchange regional network are splitting ownership of a newenterprise, TransAlliance, that will offer electronic funds transfer servicesto institutions in the western U.S.  and western Canada.

The card lets employeesaccess compensation and incentive funds from special accounts whenever theyfeel like it.  And, it reduces costs for employers, as it replaces paperchecks or certificates, and leaves the processing of ATM and debittransactions to Mellon.  The Pittsburgh-based bank will custom design thecards according to firms' specifications.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Going Where No Card Reader Has Gone BeforeGamblers beware.  Off-track betting could end up in consumers' living roomsthrough a pilot combining at-home point-of-sale terminals and interactivetelevision simulcasts of horse races.  This project is one of many that MorrisPlains, NJ-based ISED (International Secure Encryption Devices) is pursuing,as it attempts to establish applications for a new low-cost point-of-saleterminal that secures debit and credit card transactions initiated in the homeor small office.ISED's horse-betting venture with Tulsa, OK-based On Demand Services, apartner of Churchill Downs, organizer of the Kentucky Derby, typifies the sortof in-home POS service that ISED is hoping to make mainstream.  Gamblers willbe able to place bets on interactive-TV race simulcasts by swiping cardsthrough ISED's Secure Encryption Devices and making online or offline debits.Other ultimate uses for the devices will be to facilitate the $40 billionworth of home-shopping purchases currently made by consumers via telephoneeach year.  Using the secure terminals to transmit home-shopping orders offersfar more privacy and security than reciting one's credit card number over thephone to a customer sales representative.$75 a pop"The little box replicates an ATM in every sense of the word except that itdoesn't dispense cash," says Joseph Favole, vice president of ISED.  At $75 apop, ISED is hoping to become the first company to make secure card paymentsvia telephones and PCs a reality for consumers at home.  The terminals useregular phone jacks to plug into telephones and modems.  Another version ofthe gizmo fits into the keyboard port on a PC.  From these easy access points,ISED taps into the might of the ATM and credit card networks, allowing secureonline and offline debit and credit transactions to occur from home.Before reaching the mass consumer market, however, ISED is first targeting thesmall merchant market.  ISED estimates six to seven million small merchantsstill accept only cash or checks because they deem the POS terminals availabletoday as expensive barriers to electronic transactions.  Not only are the lessexpensive Secure Encryption Devices an inducement for such merchants, but bygetting rid of paper, the typical 2.18 percent interchange rate and $.10per-transaction fee drop to an interchange rate of 1.3 percent and no fee.  Atleast 800 Secure Encryption Devices are already in action at merchant sites,and there's a huge back order on the little machines, according to HilaryThomas, president of ISED.  Thomas hails from a prior post as president ofMinitel USA, a subsidiary of France Telecom, which distributed screenphonesthroughout France a few years ago.Rutland, VT-based Chittenden Bank, $1.2 billion in assets, is the first bankto test the Secure Encryption Devices.  Daniel Alcorn, senior vice presidentof Chittenden's retail credit division, expects the terminal "will enable usto get more merchants, independent sales organizations and agent banks ascustomers.  It's a low-cost solution to paper processing, and a low-costentrance into electronic processing, including debit."Alcorn predicts a surge in merchant processing revenues, thanks to thelow-cost competitive edge the Secure Encryption Devices provide.  "If webrought in merchants each with an average transaction rate of $10,000 a month,and we signed on a thousand merchants, that's $10 million a month.  The marginon that business is usually .0025.  You make $25,000 a month in net pretaxmargin, which is $300,000 a year before taxes.  We think we'll be able toattract at least that many new customers in one year," Alcorn says.Merchant to supplierOnce the Secure Encryption Devices make headway in the small-merchant marketas low-cost POS terminals, ISED plans to market them as devices merchants canuse to facilitate purchases from their suppliers.  "These first two phases arehappening now," notes Favole.  Finally, the devices will enter into consumerhomes, supplied by merchants through customer loyalty programs, and ultimatelysold to consumers by software companies.ISED is adopting a different terminal deployment strategy from that ofVeriFone, which recently announced a plan to enable consumers to make paymentsfrom home using PC-based software called Pay Window.  Under VeriFone's scheme,a device will marry point-of-sale terminals, called Payports, to consumers' PCterminals.  The solution will let consumers use credit and debit cards,electronic cash and electronic checks to make Internet purchases.  The planincludes payment software for merchants and acquirers, and Gateway software totap into existing payment and clearing infrastructures.To pull this off, the Redwood City, CA-based vendor is tapping the resourcesof its recent acquisition, Enterprise Integration Technologies of Menlo Park,CA, which specializes in software and consulting to get companies rolling withelectronic commerce, and Cybercash, Reston, VA, a key player in paymentsystems on the Internet.  VeriFone's Internet payment architecture isscheduled to hit the market in six to nine months.Flawed strategy?In the view of VeriFone, ISED's strategy of reaching out to small merchantsmay well be flawed.  "Eighty percent of merchants who can afford debittransactions are well equipped at this point," says Mohammad Khan, director ofmarketing at VeriFone's Internet Commerce Division.  "There are only a fewmerchants left who don't have electronic card readers, and that merchantsegment is not interested in debit cards at this point."ISED, nonetheless, is forging right ahead.  "Right now, we're encrypting thePIN" for ATM and debit card activity, says Favole.  "We can also encrypt themagnetic stripe information, but we're not doing it yet.  Regulations don'trequire encryption for credit card transactions yet.  But in the event thatVisa and Mastercard start offering banks lower rates for encryptedtransactions, we are ready."A further security measure waiting in ISED's wings is the creation ofone-of-a-kind public and private keys for every missive.  Processors of theSecure Encryption Devices will be called upon to create and maintain masterkeys for security purposes.  Processors of the banks and merchants that deploydevices to the consumer will have the ability to recognize transactions from"foreign" Secure Encryption Devices, much like bank ATM processors todayrecognize and route foreign ATM transactions between banks.  For example, amerchant or bank's Secure Encryption Device processor will request a workingkey from the processor of the consumer's deployer.  A single-use-only workingkey, encrypted under the master key, will be sent back directly to theconsumer's Secure Encryption Device within seconds.Backed by Electronic Data Systems, ISED congealed some three years ago withthe goal of bringing the Secure Encryption Device to market.  EDS' involvementin the privately held ISED is strictly financial, and the monetary stake hasnot resulted in the Dallas-based company becoming the sole processor for theISED terminals.Back to Headline List WT02-B38-9IA086-000616-B020-167http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi32.html 205.156.212.5 19970122004739 text/html 265173HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:45:04 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:21 GMTContent-length: 264985Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi32.html Sample Issue Copyright THE BANKER via NewsNet February 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NOTES: FIRST INTERSTATE GIVES IN TO WELLS FARGO (359 words) NOTES: NEW LOOK FOR FIRST UNION (511 words) NOTES: GANGLAND GAMBLE (563 words) NEWS NOTES: FLAK-FIGHTER STEPS DOWN (135 words) NOTES: NCB TAKES ITS PARTNERS (297 words) NOTES: A TRULY BRITISH IDENTITY (109 words) NOTES: PRIVATE CASH HEADS EAST (395 words) NOTES: EMERGING MARKETS (952 words) FOREIGN BANKS IN LONDON: THE SECRET COST OF TAX (1560 words) VIEWPOINT: SHAPE UP FOR EUROPE (1469 words) INVESTMENT BANKING: A PURSE IN A WALLET (780 words) INVESTMENT BANKING: CATS THAT GOT THE CREAM (3302 words) INVESTMENT BANKING: DIG DEEP FOR DEBT (2153 words) INVESTMENT BANKING: GO FOR THE GILT (1752 words) INVESTMENT BANKING: MOVE OVER (334 words) ITALY: LOSERS NOT CHOOSERS (1237 words) FRANCE: PROFIT - OR LOSS (630 words) AUSTRIA: POST-UNION BLUES (2070 words) CZECH REPUBLIC: THE SECOND TIME AROUND (2212 words) GLOBAL BANKING: HOME AND AWAY (1203 words) JAPAN: HASHIMOTO TO THE RESCUE (1476 words) TAIWAN: GIVE US A SMILE (2120 words) TAIWAN: STORM DAMAGE (1267 words) TAIWAN: SIX FOR THE HIGH JUMP (257 words) ASIA NOTES: CHINA'S MARKET LAUNCH (383 words) ASIA NOTES: INDONESIA WIDENS BAND (249 words) ASIA NOTES: WELCOME TO BURMA (314 words) MACAU: BEIJING BOUNTY (1614 words) LATIN NOTES: ZEDILLO'S BIG BAILOUT (536 words) LATIN NOTES: BANESPA GOOD HEALTH RECIPE (271 words) LATIN NOTES: NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

The resultingmerger, valued at dollars 11.6 billion, is the biggest in US bankhistory and a rare example of a successful hostile bid.After several months of fighting, when the end came for FirstInterstate it came quickly. On Monday 22 January the bank announcedthat it had started talking to Wells. By Wednesday, the deal wasagreed.The agreement left First Interstate's rival suitor, First Bank System(FBS) of Minneapolis, on the shelf.FBS had come in as a white knight to rescue First Interstate. Ascompensation, the Minneapolis bank receives a dollars 200 milliontermination fee.Two developments appeared to have prompted First Interstate's volteface.The potential benefits of the FBS merger had been undermined by aSecurities and Exchange Commission ruling that, because the deal wasstructured as a 'pooling of interests' the group would not be able toundertake any substantial stock repurchases for two years afterwards.Meanwhile, the strength of the Wells stock price had boosted the valueof its bid and the gap over the alternative. The terms of the offer -two-thirds of a Wells share for each First Interstate - have notchanged since Wells upped its first bid (The Banker, 12/95, p4), butits worth has.At the time of the announcement, in contrast, the FBS offer was worthsome dollars 10.1 billion.The get-together is expected to lead to some substantial cuts instaffing and branch networks as Wells gets to grips with theconsiderable overlaps between the two groups and creates a new major tochallenge the strengths of BankAmerica in California.Wells, based in San Francisco, has 983 banking locations in the state,increasingly focused on supermarket outlets rather than traditionalbranches. First Interstate, Los Angeles-based, has a total of 1,140offices in 13 western states; 406 are in California. The network willbe reduced. So will staff levels; Wells has indicated that around 7,500jobs would go as part of an dollars 800 million cost cutting programme.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: NEW LOOK FOR FIRST UNIONFirst Union Corporation of North Carolina has acquired a new dimensionas a result of its merger with New Jersey's First Fidelity. As well ascreating the sixth largest US bank holding company, with assets of somedollars 126 billion and covering 12 eastern states plus Washington DC,the deal has brought a substantial addition to First Union'sinternational armoury.First Fidelity has had a significant presence in London since 1973. Thebranch, where Richard Morley remains as general manager, has now beenre-labelled with the First Union logo.Until recently, the North Carolina bank's international involvement hadbeen minimal. Andrew Oleksiw, US-based managing director, internationaldivision, explains that the group has focused over the last 10 years ongrowing internally and being 'a high performance bank in the US'.Until the latest merger, First Union's growth to its present positionhad been in a rather lower key than that of its immediate neighbour inCharlotte, NationsBank.Daniel Mathis, US-based managing director of First Union's capitalmarkets group, says that over a period of 10 years the group has madesome 60 acquisitions, many of them small and designed to fill in thecoverage. They often produced significant cost savings.With the First Fidelity deal, he says, there is no overlap andtherefore no great economies. But with the extended branch network inthe US, he sees opportunities to sell existing products to newcustomers.Oleksiw explains that in the home market the group had focused on fourmain areas. First, international corporate banking, particularly for USsubsidiaries of foreign companies in its region. Second, trade finance,where he argues that with its technology the group can offer lowerprocessing costs on letters of credit, for example, than the moneycentre banks.Third, correspondent banking. And fourth, something of a specialitybecause of its acquired presence in Washington, banking for embassies,which often have procurement and economic development agencies there.Now the group is looking at a new horizon, supporting US corporationsabroad. Oleksiw says Latin America, which is in the same time zone andeasily accessible, does not require a physical presence; not having onecan boost correspondent banking business.In the far East, the group established a joint venture company inHongkong with the Hong Kong Chinese Bank to support US companies withtrade in Asia.The company, First Union HKCB Asia, 'is expected to process overdollars 1 billion annually in trade transactions by the end of thedecade'. First Union has also opened a representative office in SouthAfrica.Says Oleksiw: 'That left us with Europe. We were looking here beforethe acquisition. The preference would have been to buy a small bank andtweak it to fit; we weren't able to find the right opportunities. It isfortuitous that we bought First Fidelity which had an operation with aLondon focus.' First Union has identified more than 2,500 companiesbased in its home market area with UK subsidiaries. Morley could havehis work cut out.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: GANGLAND GAMBLEBig names on a little list? So it would appear from the furore that haserupted in Japan with the revelation that a relative few big borrowersaccount for over 40% of total loans from the country's seven bankrupthousing loan corporations (Jusen). The sixty four thousand dollar (orrather Yen 628 billion) question is, who are these people? It has beenwidely believed that the Jusen collapsed because they got in way overtheir heads during the orgy of real-estate lending that occured duringJapan's bubble economy. Once asset values collapsed their loans wentbad and that was that.A more sinister interpretation is emerging, however, that seems certainto show up prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Partyin an unfavourable light - assuming that the full details ever comeout.The picture that is coming slowly into focus is one of a corruptalliance among Japanese bankers, bureaucrats and organised crime(Yakuza) syndicates to exploit the profits of the bubble economy.The government has released lists of the leading 50 borrowers at eachJusen, though no names as yet. There is strong public interest inknowing who they are because of the growing realisation that in thecase of many big borrowers from the Jusen they are simply refusing torepay debts rather than being unable to do so. And yet taxpayers arebeing asked to cough up Yen 628 billion (dollars 598 million) towardthe clean-up of the Jusen mess.It has been assumed, too, that the Jusen's Yakuza debtors, nasty enoughas they are to have shot dead one bank manager who tried to collectdebts and to have stabbed another, were on the fringe of the Jusenproblem.However, the figures show that debts held by major borrowers at theJusen amounted in total to Yen 4.4 trillion or 41% of the total loansoutstanding.In the case of four of the Jusen, the top 50 borrowers include(anonymous) individuals.'Public servants are bound by law not to disclose secrets,' declaredprime minister Hashimoto, although the finance ministry said it wouldconsider releasing names to a closed session of Japan's national Diet(parliament) upon request.What makes the affair even more intriguing is that no fewer than 473 ofthe total 532 senior executives of the Jusen were supposedlyrespectable Japanese bankers.Banks founded and funded the Jusen, along with hundreds of Japaneseagricultural co-operatives, but they also played a large part inmanaging them. A dozen of their executives were also former seniorofficials of the Ministry of Finance.The Jusen affair has an almost uncanny resonance with the great'compensation' deal scandal that embroiled most of Japan's leadingsecurities houses in 1991.At that time, news leaked out that the big brokerages had paid some oftheir biggest clients huge sums to compensate them for losses theysuffered when the great Tokyo bull market of the late 1980s collapsed.The legions of small investors who had to take their knocks in themarket were not delighted to learn of this, though it was assumed thatthe favoured few were so big that the brokers wanted to stay on theright side of them at any cost.The question now is - were they also gangsters whom the brokers wereterrified of confronting?Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: FLAK-FIGHTER STEPS DOWNBrian Quinn, who is stepping down at the end of this month as Bank ofEngland executive director responsible for banking supervision, haslived in interesting times.During his tenure, two dramatic bank crashes have brought the Bank'srole under the spotlight and created a good deal of flak aimed at thesupervisors, including suggestions that the supervisory role should beremoved from the central bank.The 1991 closure of the fraud-ridden Bank of Credit & CommerceInternational (BCCI), where the Bank played a leading role, led to theBingham report and in turn to significant developments in the Bank'soperations. Last year's collapse of Barings brought further criticismand more reports to be followed up.That task falls to Michael Foot, deputy in the supervisory department,who will take Quinn's place.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: NCB TAKES ITS PARTNERSPartnerships may still be in fashion at Goldman Sachs but elsewhere,from accountancy firms to banks, incorporation is preferred. In SaudiArabia, the largest bank in the Arab world, National Commercial Bank(NCB), has been a partnership since it was established in 1951. Buttimes may be changing.In the late 1980s and early 1990s NCB went through a difficult periodwhere it was forced for various reasons, including involvements withBank of Credit & Commerce International (BCCI), to withdraw from manyof its international operations. In recent years, however, the bank hasundergone a reorganisation and last month chairman Mohammed bin Mahfouzannounced another year of record profits with NCB's net income in 1995up 20% over the SR579 million(dollars 154 million) achieved in 1994 andan improvement in the net return on partners' equity from 8.3% to 9.9%.The improved performance is not all that has changed. Early last yearthe bank's founder Salim bin Mahfouz died, which focused attention onthe ownership of the bank which was known to be spread among theMahfouz and Kaki families.While the partnership form has been maintained it is understood thatthe entire ownership of the bank is now in the hands of former chiefexecutive Khalid bin Mahfouz, who is no longer involved in the bank'smanagement.With Khalid bin Mahfouz now owning 100%, the bank's ownership structurehas been streamlined. But NCB remains unincorporated and not listed onthe local stock exchange like other banks.Bankers suggest that if NCB wants to expand abroad again and utilisethe growing domestic capital markets then it would need to beincorporated.The question now is whether Khalid bin Mahfouz's sole partnership willgo the way of Goldman Sachs or seek incorporation.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: A TRULY BRITISH IDENTITYUBAF Bank, the majority Arab-owned institution founded in London in1972, is to change its name in early March to British Arab CommercialBank (BACB).The purpose of the change, according to chief executive Peter Taplin,is to reinforce the bank's identity as a British-based institutionlicensed and supervised by the Bank of England.The bank has six Arab shareholders, including Libyan Arab Foreign Bank(36.5%), Central Bank of Egypt (7.9%) and Rafidain Bank (4.9%) as wellas a major British shareholder, Midland Bank (24.8%).The new name will reflect the bank's prime role of conducting businesswith banks and other customers in the Arab world.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: PRIVATE CASH HEADS EASTTotal capital flows to leading emerging markets in 1995 were aroundrecord levels of about dollars 216 billion despite the Mexican pesocrisis. Total private capital flows to these markets in 1996 areprojected to be robust, demonstrating the substantial continuinginvestor interest in emerging economies, says the Washington-basedInstitute of International Finance (IIF).In its 1996 capital flows forecasts the IIF says that private financialflows to the leading 30 emerging economies may total around dollars 175billion, much the same as the totals in 1994 and 1995 and comparable tothe 1993 record flow of dollars 192 billion.Official flows, which increased substantially in 1995 after the Mexicancrisis and reached dollars 41 billion, are expected to decline toaround dollars 11 billion in 1996.Developments in markets in leading industrial countries are expected tohave a profound impact on flows to emerging economies.'The continuation of relatively low world interest rates during 1996,and improving economic fundamentals in many developing countries,suggest that there will be strong investor interest in emerging marketsthis year,' says Charles Dallara, IIF managing director. 'We anticipatea substantial rebound in bond financing and increased directinvestment, offset by a reduction in short-term lending by banks fromthe high levels seen last year.'Latin America and Asia-Pacific have been the prime areas of capitalflows to emerging markets. The IIF predicts that private flows to LatinAmerica will reach about dollars 52 billion in 1996 after dropping todollars 37 billion in 1995, while private flows to Asia-Pacific willamount to dollars 87 billion in 1996 compared to dollars 94 billion in1995. The IIF also forecasts that real GDP growth will average 2.7 % inLatin America in 1996 after 0.4% growth in 1995 while Asia-Pacific willagain be the powerhouse with expected growth this year of 8.4% afterreaching 9.0% in 1995.Financial flows to main borrowing countries(dollars bn)                          1993      1994    1995(e)   1996(f)Private flows:Major borrowers          192.5     174.7     174.9     175.3of which:Latin America             75.0      60.5      36.9      51.7Asia/Pacific              76.8      87.5      93.8      86.9C/E Europe                13.3      13.4      21.2      12.8Official flows:Major borrowers           22.3      23.2      41.2      10.9of which:Latin America              1.7       0.0      27.4      -3.7Asia/Pacific              11.9      13.8       6.9       8.5C/E Europe                 9.7       3.9       3.6       3.3(e)= estimate, (f)= forecastSource:  IIF, WashingtonBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NOTES: EMERGING MARKETSIt was a year to forget for emerging markets investors and fundmanagers. Many are choosing to bury memories by focusing on a brighter1996. The markets suffered from foreign investors' confidence crisisfollowing the Mexican devaluation in late 1994 and early 1995. US fundmanagers, in particular, found little incentive to venture beyond thecomforts of home into riskier markets, thanks to the strong performanceof the US equity market, which rose 34.7% in dollars, according to theMorgan Stanley Capital International US Index.In 1995, the IFC Investable Composite Index fell 10.3% in dollar terms,after a 13.8% fall in the index in 1994, in contrast with the MSCIWorld Index, which rose 18.7% in dollar terms. Among regional IFCindices, Latin America dropped 18.7% and Asia 6.9%.Europe/Mideast/Africa provided a ray of light, with its 19.5% increase,although the region ex-South Africa registered a fall of 6.9%.The best performers among the IFC Investable Indices in 1995 wereheaded by Jordan, which rose 23.1% in dollar terms, followed by SouthAfrica with a 14.8% increase and Zimbabwe with 12.3%. The runners-upwere Peru, up 10.6% and Indonesia, which climbed 9.9%.Jordan was seen as a play on the Middle East peace process by foreigninvestors. It also received a boost from a 1995 investment law, whichlifted restrictions on the entry of foreign capital.South Africa enjoyed an inflow of around dollars 1.4 billion of foreignmoney into equities in 1995, says Vikas Nath, emerging marketstrategist of UBS, after entrance into several indices, including theIFC Investable Indices, and return to the international investmentscene.Macro-economic fundamentals improved and falling inflation, among otherfactors, spurred a huge bond rally in the last four months of the year.South Africa's good performance also boosted Zimbabwe, explains Nath.Zimbabwe's rise also reflects a slight recovery from the impact of adrought in late 1994 and 1995, says Nigel Rendell, emerging marketsstrategist at James Capel.Worst performers were Sri Lanka, with a fall of 39.5% in 1995; Hungarywith 35.1%; and India with 34.9%. Pakistan, with a fall of 33.7%, wasclose behind.Foreigners were scared off from Sri Lanka by the civil war andterrorism; Pakistan was also hit by political turmoil. India came offthe boil after the 1994 euphoria. 'A lot of people are tipping India asa key market for 1996 after such a disastrous 1995,' says Rendell.Hungary was tarnished in the eyes of foreign investors by big budgetand current account deficits at the start of 1995, but a stabilisationplan announced in March 1995 has been quite successful in reducingthem.Michael Howell, head strategist at ING Barings, projects about dollars50 billion of cross-border equity flows to emerging markets in 1996(including Hongkong, China and Singapore), from dollars 15 billion in1995.He expects foreign buying in 1996 will be felt strongly by two regions:Asia-Pacific, specifically Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand andIndonesia; and the 'embryo' emerging markets, notably Eastern Europeand Russia.He forecasts these regions, which comprise around 25% of the emergingstock market capitalisation, will receive around dollars 20 billion. Headds that more cash will also go into sub-Saharan Africa: 'This indeedcould be the region to surprise investors in 1996'.Jane Hakham, investment director of Beta Funds, picks Argentina andPoland as her favourites for 1996. She believes Argentina did notdeserve the pasting it received in the wake of the Mexican crisis andis 'definitely due for a recovery'. With 1996 price/earnings ratios ofabout 10 times or less for some stocks, the market is 'really verycheap', she says. She also finds Poland, on a P/E of about 7 for 1996,good value.Of new markets, Hakham likes Egypt, which has 1995 P/Es of about 8-8.5.The market is a 'turnaround story', which will benefit indirectly fromthe Middle East peace process. China, Pakistan and Turkey could also beturnaround stories for 1996, she thinks.Nath of UBS, for the first half of 1996, recommends overweightingTurkey, South Korea, Chile, Israel and Thailand; and 'neutral plus'positions for Brazil and South Africa.Rendell also favours Poland for 1996 and Brazil, if it can engineercrucial reforms of the tax system and public sector pensions.IFC investable indicesPrice (in US dollar terms)                                   % change    % change                       29 Dec '95   30 Nov      Dec '94Latin AmericaArgentina (30)           800.94       8.2          9.1Brazil (71)              305.30      -2.1        -20.6Chile (36)               748.49       7.1         -4.6Colombia (16)            598.06       8.0        -26.3Mexico (67)              453.19       1.7        -25.5Peru (19)                197.23       4.3         10.6Venezuela (12)           334.36      17.2        -32.4East AsiaChina (20)                54.10      -5.3        -28.7Korea (159)              125.93      -5.0         -7.9Philippines (25)         259.55       6.8        -12.9Taiwan (93)              112.77       8.2        -31.5South AsiaIndia (101)               80.36       3.8        -34.9Indonesia (42)           109.68       4.0          9.9Malaysia (114)           271.16       4.7          0.9Pakistan (36)            242.64      11.2        -33.7Sri Lanka (19)           104.07       0.9        -39.5Thailand (68)            375.83       6.1         -2.0Europe/Mideast/AfricaCzech Rep (5)             60.01        1.9       -25.2Greece (40)              241.55        3.8         7.0Hungary (5)               98.42      -10.8       -35.1Jordan (8)               184.68        6.0        23.1Poland (16)              426.35       -1.2        -9.2Portugal (26)            115.76        3.8        -4.4S.

A branch bank operating in the UK has its ownUK corporation tax liability as well as responsibilities for thecollection of tax from its employees and the people with whom it doesbusiness. The Inland Revenue has taken an increasing interest in banks'proper application of the rules for deduction of tax at source inrecent years, and this has been expensive for banks which were notaware of their obligations.Few banks in London have not had to face detailed questioning by theInland Revenue before their accounts are agreed. This is due to thecomplexity of banking business and the fact that banking business isoften carried out by a branch; branch accounts seldom carry a statutoryaudit opinion.A bank operating in the UK through a branch must pay corporation tax onthe profits attributable to the business carried out in the UK. TheInland Revenue is concerned that the UK branch accounts accuratelyreflect those profits. Recently it has looked in great depth at theextent to which loans booked in the UK branch are genuinely Londonbusiness.It was initially concerned that loans were being booked in London totake advantage of the UK's generous tax credit rules. However, in 1987these were changed and its concern in recent years has been that loanson which large losses have been made do not belong in London. Loanlosses have wiped out many branch bank profits over the last few yearsso it is clearly beneficial for the Inland Revenue to be able to arguethat these losses do not belong in the UK branch accounts.In deciding where a loan belongs the Inland Revenue uses Organisationfor Economic Co-operation & Development criteria, which look at wherethe following took place:* the offer of the new business;* establishing the borrower's credit rating and the risk involved inthe loan;* negotiation of the terms;* the decision to make the loan;* conclusion of the contract and disbursement of the funds; and* administration of the loan.Of these the first four are the most important. Where a bank makeslarge provisions it is likely to face questions from the Inland Revenueabout which country the above functions took place in. The InlandRevenue does not carry out audits, in the way that the tax authoritiesof some countries do, but it may ask to see loan files or loandocumentation in order to establish that loans belong in the UK.It will not usually accept that the transfer of loans from one branchto another is effective for tax purposes. If a loan was initiallybooked in the London branch its view is that the profits associatedwith it cannot be transferred to another branch even if all the riskand administration of the loan is transferred as well.Another area of Inland Revenue interest is ensuring that a UK branchreceives adequate reward for work done for other parts of the bank.This includes the raising of funds on the London markets for otherparts of the bank when the London branch is expected to make a marginon the transaction.The other side of the coin is the amounts paid to other parts of thebank for work done for the UK branch. Here the Inland Revenue wants tobe sure that profits are not shifted out of the UK by the use ofcharges for work performed outside the UK. A bank must be able tojustify its intra-group charges by reference to the amounts which wouldbe charged by third parties.Two particular deductions claimed by most branch banks operating inLondon have been scrutinised by the Inland Revenue in recent years. Thefirst is the deduction for head office charges relating to the UKbranch.Under the terms of many tax treaties entered into by the UK, a UKbranch can deduct a proportion of head office expenses, but it has tobe able to demonstrate that the proportion is reasonable by referenceto the functions performed at head office for the UK branch.The second is the deduction for interest payable to other parts of thebank on funds advanced to the UK branch. The Inland Revenue view isthat an element of this interest should not be deductible, representingthe interest on the capital which the branch would have needed if itwas a subsidiary.Many banks have argued vigorously against this disallowance but,unfortunately, a test case has not been taken to clarify the legalissue.To settle their tax affairs, many banks have accepted a disallowance ofinterest deduction based on a notional capital amount, often equal tothe cost of funding the branch's fixed assets.The Inland Revenue has been criticised in recent years for thecomplexity of its tax legislation. The 1993 legislation on the taxationof foreign exchange transactions was a case in point, and this has abig impact on banks due to the international nature of their business.Particular features of this legislation which will be of interest tobanks are the election for accounts to be prepared in a non-sterlingcurrency for tax purposes, the deferral provisions for tax onunrealised exchange gains on long-term capital assets and liabilitiesand the transitional rules which take certain balances outside the newrules for six years.These new rules have become applicable to many banks from 1 January1996 and important elections have to be made before 2 April 1996.The UK banking community has been increasingly complaining that it isbeing used as a tax collection agency for the government. This ispartly due to the vigorous approach of the Inland Revenue in recentyears in checking that banks are fully carrying out all theirwithholding tax obligations.Except in restricted circumstances, banks operating in London need towithhold tax:* from interest paid to individuals;* from interest which is not paid in the ordinary course of bankingbusiness;* from interest on quoted Eurobonds, foreign interest or foreigndividends collected as agent for UK residents (individuals orcompanies);* from foreign interest or foreign dividends where the bank is a payingagent; and* from salary payments.The main area to which the Inland Revenue has devoted resources inrecent years is in checking the first of these; that banks arecorrectly deducting income tax from interest paid to individuals.Broadly, income tax must be deducted from payments of interest toindividuals unless it is on a qualifying certificate of deposit or aqualifying time deposit of at least pounds 50,000 or the beneficialowner of the interest has notified the bank in writing that he is notusually resident in the UK.In many cases the Inland Revenue has found the documentation in respectof not ordinarily resident accounts to be inadequate and largesettlements of tax have had to be paid.The Inland Revenue is now turning its attention and audit resources toensuring that the paying and collecting agent rules, items three andfour in the list above, are being correctly applied by banks.The current legislation on this is outdated and new legislation will beincluded in the 1996 Finance Bill. The indications are that, althoughit has been announced as a deregulatory measure, it will more clearlydefine the scope of the rules and set out the practicalities ofapplying them, rather than greatly restricting the number oftransactions which fall within them.The position is broadly that a bank must deduct tax from interest onquoted Eurobonds, foreign interest or dividends where it obtainspayment of these amounts. This is particularly relevant to custodialand private client business.The main exception to the rules is where the person entitled to theproceeds is not resident in the UK, and it is here that Inland Revenueaudits have brought problems in the banks to light.The documentation supporting gross payment to non-residents has oftenbeen inadequate or out of date. It is likely that the new legislationwill set out more clearly the documents which must be kept to supportgross payment but banks need to be sure that they do not have exposuresunder the old rules as well.Many banks in London employ expatriate staff and the Inland Revenue isincreasingly looking at their salary packages to ensure that the rulesfor deduction of tax at source are fully complied with. A common areafor error is payments made in the home country. If these payments arefor work carried out in the UK tax should be deducted at source even ifpayment is made outside the UK.In a competitive environment, where cutting the cost base is paramount,tax must be given due consideration to ensure that it does not become alarge cost.Emma Lubbock is the lead tax partner in Price Waterhouse's Banking,Capital Markets and Treasury group in London and jointly leads theEuropean Financial Services Tax Practice.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996VIEWPOINT: SHAPE UP FOR EUROPEEurope has embarked on a historic endeavour of economic integration,with the final goal of a political European Union. One important stepis the Maastricht Treaty and European economic and monetary union(EMU).No one should be surprised that the debate has become more noisy andintense as deadlines draw closer. Important issues should be discussedpublicly and open dialogue and fair debate can only help this process.There are two demands on European economic and monetary union: itshould be a union of stability, and it should not become a transferunion. Only if these two preconditions are met can members reap thebenefits of a single currency in Europe. Only then will the newEurocurrency have a chance to gain broad acceptance.There is a clear European consensus, formalised in the MaastrichtTreaty, that EMU can only be based on stability. Stability must notonly be created after the union begins, it must be brought into theunion by every country wishing to become a member. To ensure this, theMaastricht Treaty contains a set of entry criteria in the areas ofinflation, interest and exchange rates as well as fiscal performance.In our opinion all entry criteria, including the fiscal referencelevels, should be strictly met. Hence, there is a growing likelihoodthat we will have to consider a small stability union comprising aboutone half of EU members, for example Germany and its neighbours which,however, account for a substantial share of total EU product.The UK, with its stability and its economic role in Europe, would be anatural part of EMU from the beginning. We hope that politicalobstacles can be removed by the time the decisions have to be taken in1998.Stability from the outset is more important than initial all-inclusivemembership. We think of European integration as an ongoing process.Each EU member country must be part of this process, but we have neverthought that entry at a later date should carry the outsider's stigma.As long as the rules are the same for each member country and as longas they are clear, we are all (the word may be allowed in this context)insiders.This has nothing to do with German 'power play' or with monetary union'on German terms'. The issue is much simpler: the Deutschmark is one ofthe world's three key currencies. Stability on world financial marketsis only possible if the issuers of the key currencies - US, Germany,Japan - ensure responsible monetary policy and low government deficits.The new European currency will be the successor to the Deutschmark andmust satisfy the same quality standards if the world financial systemis not to suffer.Hence, each country joining EMU must realise that it is assuming therights and duties of a key currency country. The prime requirement inthis respect is financial discipline, not only when joining EMU, but inthe long run as well.How successfully the European Central Bank can preserve the stabilityof money will depend a great deal on the choice of monetary policyinstruments.Instruments and operating procedures must be efficient and convincing,in particular in the starting phase, when the European Central Bankwill not have any monetary policy record. It is essential that it canrapidly prove its ability to contain inflation. This will be decisivefor the financial markets' view that the new currency is a 'high-quality currency'.In respect to the mechanics of the monetary changeover, financialmarkets need to know which steps of the conversion are regulated byadministrative measures and which are left up to the market itself.Competition between banks will help advance the process of monetaryunion.The banks will pay close attention to the interests of their customersand respond to demand for products in the Eurocurrency by makingavailable an appropriate range. In offering Europroducts, all bankswithin the monetary area will compete with each other. The emergingsingle EU financial market will no longer be hampered by nationalborders. Regulations and market entry barriers are being removed.Intense competition will compel banks to act and react rapidly.Deadlines drawing closer have a special meaning for banks since it willbe up to them to actually and practically handle first the transitionand then the new money. As banks, we will have to explain to ourcustomers that, at least, their economic future will not be jeopardisedby European monetary union and that we will be able to handle alltechnical matters competently.This means preparations have to start now, though there remainsconsiderable uncertainly about exactly what we must prepare for. In awider sense, this is not unusual, because dealing with an uncertainfuture is just another expression of risk-taking. This is the banks'business.Banks must prepare themselves well and in good time for monetary union.They must review their place in a monetary area that is caught up in aprocess of convergence and explore the strategic options offered by alarge economic area with a single currency. Now that the singleEuropean market has prompted them to reshape their business strategiesfor Europe, financial institutions have to work out the implications ofthe single currency for their own houses.First, banks must adjust to a new authority in the field of monetarypolicy - the European Central Bank - and to a different set of monetarypolicy instruments. The heterogeneous national instruments we haveknown are being unified and will be subject to unified handling aswell. Many familiar national monetary policy instruments may nowdecline in importance.Again, banks will have to examine the possible impact on their businesspolicies, specifically in the areas of liabilities management, currencytrading and securities.The range of money market products is likely to converge EU-wide. Here,banks will have to do some thinking, above all about the associatedrise in the costs of refunding as markets become more transparent.Currency trading in future will centre round three main currencies (theEurocurrency, dollar and yen), and this reduction in the number ofcurrencies and the cessation of currency risks will mean a loss ofbusiness for banks in the areas of money changing, hedging, swap dealsand arbitrage operations.Monetary union will also have an impact on the securities business,involving a far-reaching convergence of interest rates in the membercountries. This effect is already leading to portfolio shake-up in therun-up to monetary union, and that is adding considerably to thecounselling needs of private and corporate customers.Credit institutions must also adjust to meet technical requirements,most of all in the areas of organisation and data processing, paymentsand accounting. The introduction of a common European currency willinevitably entail converting all accounts and all balance sheet itemsto the new currency unit. Banks' software, too, must be converted - allthe way from their own accounting systems, via customer databases, toelectronic cash and voucher dispensing systems. All systems in theareas of deposits, credit and securities must be adjusted.The transition to new bank notes and coins will call for a hugelogistic effort. In payments, too, customers and banks must tackle theconversion of all systems: from SWIFT and inter-bank payment systems,automatic bulk transfers and payments, all the way to the electroniclinks between banks and their corporate customers.Banks would be adopting too shortsighted an approach if they only sawthe costs and drawbacks of monetary union. We must not lose sight ofthe opportunities and the earnings potential for an agile institutionthat is being created.The best practical example is the US. Americans use one currency in acountry, which is in some ways more heterogeneous than the group ofEuropean countries that will form EMU. No-one in the US would eventhink of using more than one currency when travelling from New York toMiami or to Los Angeles or doing business there.Demands that transition to monetary union be managed without so-called'competitive distortions' in the financial sector have entered thedebate with little challenge. Europe is all about competition, andcompetition does not become distorted if some are seen as likely toperform better than others.The field of competition among banks will be service for customers whowill require products in the new Eurocurrency. Should some banks beable to offer their new products better, faster and cheaper than theircompetitors, then this is the kind of competition which is designed tomake Europe more productive. It is the mainstay of the single market.Jurgen Sarrazin is chairman of Dresdner Bank, Frankfurt.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996INVESTMENT BANKING: A PURSE IN A WALLETThe cashless society may be some years away, but an increasing numberof schemes are trying to bring it closer.In Europe, one of the most interesting is Mondex, based on a smart cardwhich is being tested in the UK town of Swindon by two clearing banks,National Westminster and the Midland Bank. The CSFI recently invitedthe project managers to describe its progress and discuss theimplications.The heart of Mondex is a silicon chip embedded in a plastic card whichcan be loaded with electronic cash from the holder's bank account via aspecial terminal attached to a conventional telephone. It thus becomesa 'purse' whose contents can be spent through terminals in shops (oreven transferred to other cards).The transaction is authorised by the holder's PIN and takes only a fewseconds. Each card has an 'originator', which would have to be aninstitution approved by the banking authorities, to bring the cardwithin the bounds of monetary control.According to Mondex's promoters, the advantages of the card for theconsumer are its convenience, control and security (cards are'lockable'), though anyone who loses their card would also lose themoney on it if they were uninsured. It also enables the holder towithdraw 'cash' from his or her bank account from the comfort of theirhome - something that home banking cannot do. For the retailer, thebenefits are better cost management, security, and the possibility forvalue-added functions such as customer loyalty schemes.The Swindon experiment went live in July with 1,000 consumers. Thereare now over 8,000. More than 700 retailers, or 70 % of the total, hadsigned up, car parks had been added, and buses would join soon. Mondexpayphones have now been installed on most street corners, andcardholders can obtain cash through them 24 hours a day. This providesthe 'missing link' of home banking. There are now 50 payphones, risingto 300, plus 1,000 in private homes.About pounds 500,000 changed hands over Mondex in the first fivemonths, or some pounds 25,000 a week, which the promoters said was verysatisfactory even though it only amounts to pounds 3 per cardholder aweek.The aim behind Mondex is to make it practical for everydaytransactions, even buying a bus ticket or a newspaper, which meansdriving down the cost of producing it and running the system.The aim was also to make Mondex 'democratic' - or separate it fromconsiderations of credit standing. Anyone should be able to have aMondex because it need not even be linked to a bank account. You couldbuy a fully charged card in a store and give it to someone as a gift.However, the facility to charge the card from your bank account wouldbe subject to status, and would cost money, about pounds 1.50 a month.The sense of the CSFI meeting was that Mondex could bring clearadvantages to the retailer through improved cash management, but it wasless obvious how the consumer would benefit. They would have the costand bother of managing their cards, essentially to make transactionswhich could more easily be done with cash. Unless it replaced cashcompletely, Mondex would become yet another piece of plastic to keep inan already crowded wallet.Also, for larger purchases, the consumers would still do better to usetheir credit card and enjoy the interest-free credit period, so ifMondex had a future, it would have to be in the small transaction endof the market.Some participants were worried about the potential for money launderingon Mondex cards. Could they not be used to spirit money out of shadyaccounts? The money could not be 'tagged' in the way that numberedbanknotes are.The scheme also has potentially profound implications for banks if'originators' can be non-banks. This means that a whole sector of thecash economy could operate without the help of banks. And there is noreason why originators should be banks, though Mondex is in close touchwith the Bank of England over how 'originators' should be defined andauthorised.Mondex's backers intend to run the Swindon experiment for another yearor two before deciding on a national roll-out. NatWest will not say howmany customers it will need to turn Mondex into a profit-makingproposition. What is important, it says, is to see if Mondex works, andhow it can be turned into a money spinner.The Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation. 18 Curzon Street,London WIY 7D. Tel : (0171) 493 0173.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996INVESTMENT BANKING: CATS THAT GOT THE CREAMThe right people, the right place, the right time - that sums up theexperience of the leading players in international mergers andacquisitions work based in London in 1995.It was the year when the big investment in M&A professionals made inparticular by the US investment banks over the last five years paiddividends - and bonuses.The boom in cross-border and other international M&A was only part ofthe story: the volume of domestic transactions in the US and the UKalso soared.As a result, fees from M&A received uncharacteristically prominentmentions in the year-end statements of a number of the investmentbanks.At Lehman Brothers, chairman and chief executive Richard S. Fuld Jrreported that fourth quarter 'merger and aquisition fees increased 50%'compared with the same period of 1994. At both Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, merger advisory work got more than a passing reference.Some idea of the scale of the increase in international work can begleaned from our tables. In 1994, the top 10 firms in cross-border workracked up a combined dollars 104 billion worth of deals. In 1995, theequivalent figure was dollars 215 billion. In both cases the figuresinclude some double counting, since as many as four or five advisersmay get credit for the same deal. Nevertheless, the trend is sharplyupwards.For confirmation, look no further than the table of cross-border dealsworth dollars 1 billion or more (see page 18).In 1994, The Banker tracked 27 such deals (either announced orcompleted during the year) worth a combined dollars 52 billion. Lastyear there were 39 deals in the same category, worth more than dollars95 billion.The big question is: can the boom last? Are there fundamental factorsat work that will continue to drive the world's big corporates intoeach others' arms? Is the consolidation ongoing, or has it run itscourse? Is the merger boom just a by-product of falling world interestrates combined with the extended bull run in US and, to a lesserextent, UK equities? The surge in takeover volumes in 1995 provokestempting comparisons with the previous boom at the end of the 1980s.In the UK, according to figures from stockbrokers James Capel, thevalue of deals announced or completed topped the pounds 41 billion marklast year - or roughly twice the previous record year, 1989.A similar pattern is apparent in the US, thanks mainly to an explosionin multi-billion dollar bank mergers last year.One leading investment banker in London points out that the barestatistics reflect accidents of timing. 'If you look at UK transactionslast year the numbers are influenced by a couple of very largetransactions. I tend to think of deals happening on a much moreconsistent basis. If you plot the activity over the longer term, thetrend is a lot smoother than the data suggests.'That said, he also confirms that current business levels are way up onthose for the same period a year ago. 'If you look at our existingbacklog of transactions - projects on which terms are either agreed orwhere there is a better than 50% chance of success - the total today isalready equivalent to about 60% of what we completed in 1995.' Thenormal backlog is between 20% and 30% of a year's business.One thing is certain. The deals done in 1995 were of a different orderto those done in the last boom.In the peak year of 1989 the name of the game was leverage. The two bigdeals of the year were the dollars 29.6 billion takeover of RJR Nabiscoby Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Sir James Goldsmith's unsuccessfuldollars 21 billion offer for Britain's tobacco giant BAT Industries.There was unlimited cash available to fund almost any big proposition -or there was until the banks turned their backs on the proposed buyoutat United Airlines, Washington and the US courts got obstructive, andthe junk bond boom collapsed.'Compared to the last boom cycle, this one is a lot less financiallymotivated and much more strategically driven,' says Ed Annunziato, headof international M&A at Merrill Lynch (whose cross-border deal volumesplaced the firm just outside the top ten in The Banker's league tableslast year).'The strategic push is coming as a result of big changes in a handfulof industries. Regulatory change, technological change and costpressures associated with one or both - these have been importantdrivers in the growth of M&A activity.'But not the only ones. As important has been the need to squeeze outthe scale economies necessary if a business is to compete globally.'We saw unprecedented levels of activity last year - almost a feedingfrenzy,' says Jim Downing, managing director and co-head of corporatefinance at Lehman Brothers in London. 'That was partly driven by thedesire to create global positioning on the part of big businesses. Butthere was also a defensive quality to it: if your competitor takes outone of the few remaining targets you can't afford to sit back andwatch.'Having spent the first half of the 1990s streamlining their operations,many big corporates are having to live with the prospect of limitedgrowth, he argues.The answer is to acquire it. For those acquisitions, 'companies havebeen focusing on those sectors where they're choosing to be globalbusinesses,' says Downing. 'And, in contrast to the 1980s, they'redoing it in a very targeted and surgical way.'The ready availability of cheap money has played its part, too, heaccepts.But, again, comparisons with 1989 would be misleading. Having rebuilttheir balance sheets over the course of the 1990s, UK companies, forinstance, are funding deals not from funny money but from internallygenerated cash, or from justifiable bank borrowing.According to the James Capel analysis, two-thirds of the considerationpaid in UK takeovers last year was in the form of cash. Buying otherbusinesses is a better bet than sticking the cash on deposit.So long as interest rates remain low by historical standards, activityon the part of UK companies will remain high, predicts Piers vonSimson, a managing director at SBC Warburg.'Our projections envisage the generation of very substantial cashsurpluses in corporate UK this year,' he says, 'particularly in whatmight broadly be defined as the consumer and service groups.'Companies such as Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Reuters are generatinghuge amounts of cash, he points out. 'The combined Glaxo Wellcome maybe highly geared at present, but the potential cash generation over thenext couple of years tops pounds 2 billion.'The importance of the UK's contribution to Europe-wide M&A activitycannot be overstated, says Klaus Diederichs, co-head of M&A for JPMorgan in Europe. 'Eight out of every 10 big deals had a UK componentlast year.France was in second place, but a long way behind.'Diederichs sees a number of risks in predicting another record year forthe international M&A business.'First, if equity markets take a tumble, that will dent confidence.When confidence goes, deals don't close. Second, there is a danger thatprices get driven too high. Third, there is a limit as to how many moredeals can be done in the most active sectors.'For instance, a year ago there were 12 independent regionalelectricity companies (RECs) in Britain; now there are just five.' Forthese reasons, Morgan's team is working on the assumption that totalmarket volumes in the UK could fall by anything up to 20% in 1996.CSFB professes itself similarly cautious. Stephen Hester, co-head ofinvestment banking in London, says 'our internal budgets suggest a 15%decline in the market as a whole - but that would still leave 1996 thesecond most active year in history.'His concern is that M&A activity tends to peak when the economic cycleis at or just past its peak. With the cycle turning down across much ofEurope, it is more than possible that M&A activity will turn down withit.One thing is certain: the outlook hangs crucially on three keyindustries which generated a disproportionate amount of work for M&Aspecialists in 1995. They are finance, pharmaceuticals and the world oftelecommunications and media.No fewer than 23 of our 39 dollars 1 billion-plus deals fit into thesethese sectors. 'In terms of those industries,' says Merrill'sAnnunziato, 'there is going to be a lot more of the same - though inpharmaceuticals the restructuring is clearly further advanced than inthe other two sectors. As far as financial institutions and thetelecoms/media sectors are concerned, the restructuring could lastanother ten years. Certainly, in US banking, it's not remotely close tobeing over.'The deal lists of the leading investment banks bear testimony to thefrenetic activity in those three sectors over the past year.In US banking, the size and value of deals expanded sharply,culminating in the first big hostile takeover bid - Wells Fargo'sdollars 10 billion offer for First Interstate.There are still 11,000 banks in the US, and plenty of scope for thedeal-makers to be creative. But the process is not confined to the US.In Europe, for instance, CSFB was involved in 27 banking or insurance-related deals last year (either completed or pending) and acted forfinancial institutions in France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Italy,Germany, Austria, Spain and the UK. The consolidation of banks in Italyand Scandinavia is proving a fruitful source of income for several ofthe M&A specialists.So too is the gradual sell-off of Credit Lyonnais' peripheral assets,some of them banking outposts, others non-bank assets.Neither of the two investment banks responsible for putting togetherthe restructuring of some dollars 26 billion worth of CL assets - nowplaced into the Consortium de Realisations (CDR) - gets credit in ourleague tables for a deal that will take 20 years to complete: Paribasacted for the French government, Lazard Freres Paris for CL.But hunting down buyers for the various assets is proving a lucrativeoccupation for most of the players in our tables. CSFB sold off BanqueColbert's regional operations in France to Financiere Meeschaert, itsParis-based asset management operations to NatWest and its Luxembourgoffshoot to Staal Bankiers, an offshoot of the Dutch Achmea Holding.Merrill sold CL's Peruvian and Chilean operations (to Banca CommercialeItaliana and Dresdner respectively) and JP Morgan advised CL BankNederland on its sale to Generale de Banque. Warburg found buyers forthe CL-owned MGM cinema chains in Britain and the Netherlands.The prospect of more big banking takeovers in the US looks a racingcertainty. But what about Europe?Morgan Stanley's head of European investment banking operations, JohnStudzinski, comments: 'If you look at the UK, there is bothdemutualisation and the consolidation of retail services in progress.'There is also plenty of scope for deals around Europe. 'The conclusionmust be that the process of integration will continue.'Much the same can be said about the pharmaceuticals industry, whereMorgan Stanley had a hand in the year's two biggest cross-border deals(acting for Marion Merrell Dow in its takeover by Hoechst of Germanyand for Sweden's Pharmacia in its dollars 13 billion merger with Upjohnof the US).It also acted for Chiron of the US in its dollars 2 billion tie-up withSwitzerland's Ciba-Geigy. Says Studzinski: 'There are at least three orfour more consolidations of a similar size to take place in theindustry. The only question is when they will happen.'In the telecoms and media sectors it was the Lazard houses that put inthe most impressive performance, racking up a string of big deals. Thefour it did for MCI Communications Corporation and the one for Seagrams(the takeover of Hollywood studios group MCA) were alone worth acombined dollars 10 billion.Goldman, which acted for the Japanese vendor in the MCA sale, also didits share of big deals in this area and Reimers is in no doubt there ismore to come.Lehman's Downing points out the bulk of the media and telecoms dealshave been in the US: 'There is scope for a lot more consolidation inEurope.' One-off factors were nonetheless apparent in one sector lastyear. That was UK utilities, and especially the RECs.Again Goldman did well, thanks to its acknowledged role as a defenceadviser, picking up four advisory mandates. While there may still besome unfinished business, there is a finite number of deals to be done.'There may be more consolidation to come, though lots of companiesappear to be running into domestic monopoly constraints,' says SBCWarburg's von Simson. The firm acted for America's Southern Electric inits successful bid for SWEB.One counterbalancing factor that could sustain UK takeover activity -particularly in the utility sector - is the threat of a Labour electionvictory in a year or so's time.'If you are an international strategist, the pressure is probably onyou to slip a UK deal in before the election,' says von Simson. 'UnderLabour, the onus is likely to be on the buyer to prove that a deal is agood thing, rather than on the regulator to show there is nothingdamaging to it.' Be that as it may, M&A specialists expect to seecontinental Europe pick up the baton. 'In 1996 you're more likely tosee a restructuring among utilities in Germany, Spain and Italy,'predicts Morgan Stanley's Studzinski. Merrill's Annunziato agrees.'German utilities have traditionally been conglomerate-owned. Deals arelikely as part of the refocusing of industry generally.' Or soinvestment bankers would like to believe. The trouble is, the longmooted 'deconglomeratisation' of Germany is proving a patchy affair.Hoechst and Viag have both shown a willingness to prune peripheralbusinesses, but few other German corporates have followed them.One reason for this is that anti-avoidance provisions in the German taxstatutes could penalise a vendor if 10% or more of a demerged company'sshares subsequently change hands within a short space of time -something that is highly likely if the demerged company is publiclyfloated.Von Simson argues that this ruling tends to be used as an excuse forinaction by German industrialists.'European Union members have all signed up to the concept of tax-freedemergers. I suspect that, if enough pressure were applied, thelegislation might be clarified or the tax authorities might give aruling that the anti-avoidance provisions did not apply.'Pressure from the international investment community will translateinto action sooner or later. There will be disposals that have theeffect of deconglomeratising German industry - though perhaps not adirect demerger along the lines of ICI/Zeneca.'CSFB's Hester agrees. It is all part of what he sees as a long-termtrend: the 'Anglo-Saxonisation of continental Europe'. The impact ofnew takeover codes, the harmonisation of accounting standards, theappearance of international investors on local share registers - all ofthis is helping to cement a change of attitude. The upturn in EuropeanM&A activity last year looks no fluke.But it will still take an enormous acceleration in the process tocompensate for a slowdown in UK merger activity - were that to happenthis year.Morgan's Diederichs points to the fact that the value of French andGerman deals combined last year was no more than a quarter of the totalrecorded in the UK. 'If the pace of activity in the UK falters,continental Europe cannot take up the slack,' he argues.The caveat is well taken; and few of the main players in this game areprepared to look beyond the next three months. But, right now, theysimply cannot believe their luck.Top cross-border advisers                        1995                        No of      dollars bn                        dealsMorgan Stanley           41          32.51Goldman Sachs            40          28.97CSFB                     50          28.82SBC Warburg              66          23.61Lazard                   46          23.42JP Morgan                34          20.96Rothschild               32          18.00Lehman                   36          15.09Schroders                34          12.68Deutsche MG              58          10.84All deals(ex UK and US domestics)                        1995                        No of      dollars bn                        dealsGoldman Sachs            52          37.66Morgan Stanley           44          35.84CSFB                     58          30.32Lazard                   57          28.49JP Morgan                42          25.48SBC Warburg              79          24.20Rothschild               50          21.96Deutsche MG              70          17.78Lehman                   36          15.09Salomon                  43          15.06Only deals completed by 31/12/95 are counted.

31.12.95.Source:  The BankerBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996INVESTMENT BANKING: DIG DEEP FOR DEBTIn January, in what looked like a last act of desperation, Eurotunnel,the crisis-stricken operator of the Channel tunnel, called on the UKand French governments to guarantee a substantial bond issue to helprefinance its pounds 7.8 billion (dollars 11.8 billion) debt. The planproposed that the bond issue would involve a 'zero coupon' structure inwhich there would be low or no interest payments for about 10 years.But, far from being a miracle cure for the Chunnel operator's financialdifficulties, a closer look at the proposal showed it would merelydelay the pain and add to the company's bulging interest bill. Both theFrench and the UK governments swiftly ruled out the plan.The move follows Eurotunnel's announcement in September that it hadsuspended interest payments on its debt mountain and was startingnegotiations with its banks to rearrange its finances. Eurotunnel'sfour agent banks - National Westminster, Midland Bank, Banque Nationalede Paris and Credit Lyonnais - were to report to the rest of thebanking syndicate, comprising 225 members, mainly UK, French andJapanese banks, by 17 March.Until then, both sides were bound by a pact of secrecy from commentingpublicly on the negotiations.Traders and brokers in the UK and European corporate debt market willhave been watching keenly. Promising a record-breaking restructuring,Eurotunnel's plight could provide a feast for the UK distressed debtmarket.The crisis comes when the UK market is facing a famine in the supply ofnew names to trade, as the recovery of the UK economy continues. ManyUK companies which have been big debt trading situations are havingtheir difficulties resolved or recovering, for example, GPA andCordiant (Saatchi and Saatchi), while prospects for resolution forothers in the coming year are brightening, for example, Signet andSomerfield.While traders have been talking for some time about the possibilities,and hindrances, for a market to develop in continental Europeancountries, the dwindling supply in the UK, barring Eurotunnel, may giveextra impetus to their efforts there and in trading of UK near-par,good quality loans. Some are looking further afield, to the Far Eastand Latin America.But while Eurotunnel debt and derivatives of debt could prove to be abonanza for the corporate debt trading market, some traders admit to aworry that the market could be swamped by big pieces of debt lookingfor a home, which would depress the price. Few banks are willing tosell at the mid-January price of around 37 pence in the pound, but anupward move in the price is likely to provoke more trading.Tony Tucker, senior director of Bank of America in London, argues thatEurotunnel is big enough and diverse enough that the 'primaryprinciples of demand and sources of supply could work,' bringing aboutan equilibrium in supply and demand.Despite the uncertain outlook for the UK market, in 1995 volumes in UKand European distressed and impaired loans appear to have continued toincrease, but estimates vary widely.Bank of America estimates dollars 10 billion for 1995, up from aboutdollars 6.5 billion in 1994. Of this dollars 10 billion, Tuckerexplains that debt sales by original lenders in regularly quoted namessuch as GPA account for about one third; other original sales accountfor about another one third; while retrades among participants accountfor the remaining third.Other estimates are more modest. Don Pollard and David Newport, vice-presidents of Citibank, estimate around dollars 8 billion was traded in1995, including retrades.Richard Brennan, director of international loan sales and trading atMerrill Lynch, estimates only about dollars 2 billion of original debtwas traded in 1995, and says the original debt can trade as much as 10to 15 times.The increased volume reflects the greater number of traders andinvestors in the market. There are now at least 10-12 seriousparticipants which have each committed capital of around dollars 100-250 million and people to the market, points out Tucker. These havebrought more liquidity and competition to the market, and spreads inthe more liquid names have narrowed.Besides these new players, two inter-dealer brokers have also enteredin the last year to 18 months, Patriot Securities in New York andCanter Fitzgerald, which only deal with dealers, enabling them toretain their anonymity until the deal is done. Pollard and Newportobserve that longer term local investors, mostly foreign banks in theUK, have moved into the UK market, such as Standard Bank, BancoSantander, West Merchant Bank and ING Bank, as well as some of the UKclearing banks.They have seen a flow from the US 'vulture' type high-yield investors,to these local investors, which are looking for less risky plays andare willing to make more moderate returns. This trend has provided US-based investors with buyers for debt bought earlier in therestructuring cycle.'We probably do about half of our trades into local buyers, whereas theyear before we probably did about 80% of our trades back into USbuyers,' says Pollard.In 1995, Brennan of Merrill Lynch noticed a growing acceptance of themarket as a viable way of managing the risk contained in a bank'sportfolio of assets by a number of UK clearing banks, which have becomeactively involved both on the buy and sell side. Tucker adds thatportfolio analysis is exerting a growing influence on banks' managementof loans.A notable exception is Barclays Bank, which has not bought or sold anyof its impaired debt. Terry Bond, lending services director, explainsthat the bank has been a strong supporter of the Bank of England'sinformal philosophy on financial workouts, the London Approach, whichaims to create and maintain stability during a workout. Barclays hasbeen anxious to continue to give a lead in stability, says Bond.On the effect of debt trading on a standstill and financialreconstruction, he says: 'We still have a sense of nervousness'. Thebank would also like to see how the market develops before it positionsitself as a player.However, given the right circumstances, it might in the future considerdebt trading as an option. 'We have seen the emergence of a largenumber of responsible players in the market. There isn't necessarily afree for all which some people feared might happen; and if you have aresponsible market then it's something that you can actually learn tolive with,' Bond comments.A fertile source of original distressed debt has been the debt-riddenJapanese banks, which have been coming into the market more in 1995,driven by a need and desire politically and commercially to clean uptheir balance sheets, says Tucker. Pressure from the Ministry ofFinance (MoF) and the Bank of Japan (central bank) for more realism ontheir balance sheets, along with the Daiwa scandal and the admissionthat some of the housing loan subsidiaries were under water, is forcingthe Japanese banks to look to write off as much of their bad debts aspossible at their fiscal year end in March 1996.Many of the Japanese banks have sold out of GPA, Signet, Somerfield andIsosceles, says Tucker, but not yet out of Eurotunnel. Leading Japanesebanks, which have almost dollars 2 billion in outstanding loans toEurotunnel, were reported in January to have said that they had noplans for an early disposal of them.It is estimated that the Japanese banks have sold more than half oftheir European distressed debt, excluding Eurotunnel, over the pastthree years.In October, a series of damaging revelations, including the Daiwascandal, led to a premium being put on lending to Japanese banks, whichincreased their cost of capital and was the catalyst for some of themto sell thinner-priced, near par loans.Traders have had mixed success at tackling the potential of continentalEurope. Bank of America sees France as a growing area: it opened anadjunct office in France in 1995 and has traded the debt of all but oneof the French companies named in its price list.These include: Air France Partners Leasing; Aluminium Dunkerque, thealuminium smelting company partly owned by Pechiney; Groupe Bull, thepartially privatised computer company; and Orlyval, the tunnel betweenOrly and Paris. There are plenty of obstacles to trading in Frenchloans, however, particularly when real estate or secured mortgage orsecurity of assets are involved, which are difficult and expensive totransfer under French law. Bank of America has traded a Spanish credit,but has not done any trading in German company debt.Large syndicate deals such as Aluminium Dunkerque are unusual on theContinent; 'club deals', involving a smaller number of banks than in asyndication, are more common in continental Europe than in the UK.There are also many bilateral deals, where a company has a separatecontract with each bank, for example, in Germany, which accounts forthe difficulty of trading there, says Tucker.Pollard and Newport of Citibank observe that the UK and European markethas followed their expectations in all respects except one: trading hasbeen slower to take off in Europe than they envisaged. 'The market hasnot performed as expected with respect to geographic diversity,' theycomment.While France seems to be the next area, they admit that they have notseen the holders of French loans prepared to accept what they think isfair price. Of Germany, Pollard comments: 'The German banks seem to bereluctant to let the loans go'.Traders have also been eyeing with a certain relish recent bankingdebacles for debt trading opportunities, such as Credit Lyonnais, DaiwaBank and Banco di Napoli of Italy, which are under pressure to reducetheir size.But, so far, the few deals done have been to other members of thelending syndicates in these names, rather than through intermediaries,because of a reluctance to sell loans at less than par. Tucker of BankAmerica admits: 'There is a frustration because we have put a hugeamount of effort into it.' The hope is that new management or strongerdirectives from government will force these banks to take the hit andto sell the loans at a discount.Looking ahead to 1996, Tucker expects distressed volumes to flatten outnext year, while Pollard and Newport expect the volumes to be flat oreven down.Besides Eurotunnel, a rare potential new big name at the start of 1996was Trafalgar House, the troubled property company, but the jury wasstill out on whether it would go into a restructuring.Brennan of Merrill Lynch still sees plenty of opportunities, forexample, in convertibles and pure bonds: 'It may not be bank debt; itmay be other portions of the capital structure that will be traded.'Pollard and Newport are planning to spend more of their time this yeartrying to buy into situations on the Continent and are also hopefulthat the near-par market will continue to develop.Some traders, undaunted by limited opportunities closer to home, arelooking even further afield to the Far East and Latin America. Bank ofAmerica, for example, has been looking around Hongkong and Singapore.In these countries bank debt is still quite healthy at the moment,because yields are high and maturities are short, but Tucker believesthat sooner or later there is bound to be an oversupply.He also sees potential in Thai, Korean and Indonesian debt. At themoment he thinks Asian convertibles are interesting. He predicts that'South East Asia could be half again the size of the UK and Europeanmarket in the next three to five years.'For the more fearless, China is also potentially an enormous, butcomplicated, market. In Latin America, Mexico holds potential becauseof the numbers of defaults, but again is only for the more aggressivebrokers and traders with a high risk to return profile. It promises tobe a challenging ride for traders and investors.Loans for sale                                             Indicative                                             Bid/offer*Borrower                                     11 Jan '96Air France Partners Leasing                     70-83Aluminium Dunkerque                             80-90Anglo Cold Storage/Union                        50-75Brent Walker (3rd Pref)                         32-36Chancery                                         8-10Cordiant (Saatchi and Saatchi)                  95-97Euro Disney - Theme Park                        70-74              Hotels                            67-72Eurotunnel                                      37-42GPA-CCF                                   98.25-99.25Groupe Bull                                     93-98Isosceles Strip                                 60-62Landhurst Leasing                               5.5-7LEP                                              5-10Maxwell                                      8.5-9.25National Home Loans                             95-97Omnicorp (guaranteed)                             7-9Orlyval                                         12-20Polly Peck Int.

The fund isinvested in a diversified portfolio of high-grade short-terminstruments with the objective of protecting the principal value ofinvestor capital while providing liquidity and a reasonable level ofcurrent income.Money market funds are typically subject to regulatory controlsdesigned to protect principal value, including minimum qualitythresholds for investment, minimum diversification requirements andmaximum maturity levels both for instruments held by a fund and for thefund's portfolio as a whole.There are important differences between money market funds andtraditional bank deposits. A money market fund's assets are investedsolely for the benefit of its investors. Management is provided by anoutside investment adviser which is paid a fee for this service but thefund receives the full benefit of the income earned net of this fee.Banks, by comparison, are in the business of re-investing theircustomers' deposits. A bank may charge a fee for specific cashmanagement services but this fee is in addition to the favourablespread which the bank earns on the deposits themselves.A second difference between a money market fund and a bank deposit isthat the fund is structured to separate completely asset managementfrom asset custody. Unlike a bank which accepts deposits from itscustomers, the manager of a money market fund does not itself receiveor hold investor funds. All of the fund's assets are separately held ina segregated account at a custodian bank where they are 'ring-fenced'against claims of the bank's creditors.The manager's job is to direct the day-to-day investment of theseassets in accordance with the investment objectives and policies setforth in the fund's prospectus furnished to investors.The most important distinction between money market funds and bankdeposits is that investors in a money fund receive the benefits of anactively managed portfolio.A bank deposit requires the commitment of investor monies for a setperiod of time in order to earn a quoted rate of return. By contrast, amoney market fund pools investor subscriptions and actively manages thepool to provide both daily liquidity and a market rate of return. Anactively managed portfolio is continuously invested in a variety ofhigh-grade short-term instruments selected by the manager to achievethe fund's objectives. Through active management a money market fund ineffect 'securitises' its investors' cash.In the US money market funds have achieved broad acceptance as avaluable cash management tool for both institutional and individualinvestors. Total net assets of money funds are now more than dollars750 billion, with annual sales in excess of dollars 2 trillion.Approximately 48% of money market fund assets are held for benefit ofinstitutions such as retirement plans, corporations, foundations andcharities, and a variety of fiduciary accounts.In the US banks are major investors in money market funds and oftenserve, through non-bank affiliates, as sponsors and advisers to funds.Money market funds have also become accepted cash management vehiclesin other countries, notably France, where money market fund assets nowtotal in excess of dollars 250 billion, and Germany, where money fundswere first permitted in 1994 and have already attracted considerableinterest.A money market fund industry has not developed in the UK quite simplybecause, until now, there has been no need for one.The establishment and growth of money funds in the US was in directresponse to a series of developments within the banking community inthe 1970s and early 1980s when regulatory limits on the level ofinterest that could be paid by banks prevented them from givingdepositors market rates of return.This period also witnessed the failure of a number of prominent bankingand savings institutions. Money market funds were created in responseto investor demand for a safe alternative that could providecompetitive returns.Recent developments in the UK financial markets, though perhaps not asdramatic as the events giving rise to the US money fund industry, arenevertheless significant and could fuel a demand for money market fundsin the UK. The increased acceptance of such funds in major Europeanmarkets should also stimulate the use of money market funds by UKinstitutions.The collapse of Barings needs to be placed in context. It is importantto emphasise that Barings did nothing fundamentally wrong in the way ithandled its investors' overnight cash. Barings' decision to placeapproximately pounds 500 million of such cash on deposit with itsaffiliate bank conformed to the cash management practices of otherasset managers.The problem was more systemic. Unlike securities held for itscustomers, which were properly 'ring-fenced', overnight cash depositedwith the bank was reflected on its balance sheet as an unsecured assetsubject to the claims of creditors. When Barings failed it was only byvirtue of the ING acquisition that investors avoided a total loss oftheir overnight cash then on deposit with the bank.In the wake of Barings' collapse market participants have searched foralternative solutions. As a 'stopgap' remedy UK asset managers andother fiduciaries early last year began diversifying their deposits bytaking cash balances away from single institutions with which theyenjoyed an affiliation or other longstanding relationship and byspreading those assets among a number of high quality banks.Diversification clearly reduces the extent of exposure but it does notaddress the core credit risk issues. There is also the problem oflocating a sufficient number of high-grade institutions to ensure anadequate level of diversification.Money market funds take a different approach to diversification and inthe process substantially reduce credit risk exposure. By investingassets in a range of money market securities such as repos andcommercial paper, investor cash is 'securitised' and therebyeffectively protected against any potential creditor claims that mightotherwise be asserted.Within a money fund credit risk is addressed as an investment matterthrough proper portfolio diversification and compliance with minimumquality guidelines. By carefully managing its portfolio maturities amoney market fund provides its investors with both overnight cashliquidity and a market rate of return. In this way the fund serves asan effective substitute for traditional bank deposit arrangementswithout exposing investors to any significant degree of credit risk.To work effectively money market funds must have access to a range ofinvestment vehicles that will enable them to achieve their safety,liquidity and yield objectives. A key issue for a money market fund isthe ability to obtain overnight liquidity for a significant portion ofits assets in order to meet redemption requests of its investors.In the US, as well as in France and Germany, liquidity has beenprovided to market participants through a broad-based and highly liquid'repo' market. A repo, or repurchase agreement, involves the short-term(including overnight) sale of securities to a cash provider such as amoney market fund, coupled with a commitment to repurchase thesecurities at an agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining theyield during the purchaser's holding period.Repos constitute among the lowest risk means of improving short-termyields as the lender or buyer of repo can take advantage of both thecredit worthiness of its counterparties (the sellers of repo) and theavailability of high quality 'collateral,' which are the repo-edsecurities. In the US more than dollars 1trillion of repos is tradedeach day. In the European repo markets, centred in London, annual netpurchases of repos had increased to a level of over dollars 7.3 billionby the end of 1994.From 2 January of this year there are no longer any officialrestrictions on anyone repoing or lending and borrowing gilts, eitherdirectly or indirectly through intermediaries. The removal of theserestrictions means that investors may now freely use gilt repo toinvest their cash balances.As of mid-January, open market trading in gilt repos had not yetresulted in a fully liquid repo market as participants and theiradvisers were still working to resolve some lingering systems anddocumentation issues. Yet it is probably safe to say at this early datethat there is widespread interest in the development of the repo marketas a short-term investment alternative.If money market funds are to achieve the safe and liquid goals of theirshareholders it will be essential that a broad-based gilt repo marketbecomes established. In advance of this development the alternativesfor money fund portfolios are to hold time deposits of a number ofhighly rated banks, to invest in commercial paper of high-gradecorporate issuers and to engage in other strategies such as short-termfully hedged swaps into liquid instruments denominated in othercurrencies.Thus far only a handful of sterling denominated money market funds havebeen launched, and these have endeavoured to preserve maximumflexibility in their investment programmes. Most have not been able toassure investors of absolute liquidity, or 'same day' settlement onredemption of their fund shares. The advent of gilt repo, therefore, isan important step in the future development of actively managed moneymarket funds designed for UK institutional investors.William Kleh is Managing Director of AIM Global Advisors Limited(London)Total US money market assets(1)(dollars bn)Year1974                              21979                             461984                            2341989                            4281990                            4981991                            5431992                            5461993                            5651994                            6111995 (Nov)                      750(1) incl. taxable & tax-exempt fundsSource:  ICI (Investment Company Institute)Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996INVESTMENT BANKING: MOVE OVERInternational bankers remain concerned about competition from the WorldBank's government-funded private sector finance arm, the InternationalFinance Corporation (IFC), for business which they consider could behandled by private sector banks.A report(1) last month from the Institute of International Finance(IIF), the Washington-based group representing nearly 200 privatefinancial institutions from around the world, acknowledges that IFC hastaken on board the criticisms. But it argues that it should go further.Last year IFC issued new guidelines on Collaboration with PrivateInternational Financial Institutions. This is welcomed by IIF, whichemphasises the continuing 'strong interest of most private banks inworking in partnership with IFC'.Nonetheless, IIF stresses the substantial change in the emergingeconomies which, previously dependent on official financing, nowincreasingly have access to commercial sources.'Most of the private flows are .. concentrated in the more advanceddeveloping countries. These are the same countries where IFC is doingmost of its business. As a consequence, the potential for IFCactivities to displace services provided by private banks has increasedmeasurably.' Among nine recommendations for further action by IFC, thereport argues: 'IFC should adopt an active and transparent graduationpolicy as part of a basic reorientation away from countries that haveaccess to international capital markets toward those that do not.Generally, there should be a presumption that IFC will not supporttransactions in countries designated as having substantial access tointernational capital markets, especially transactions involving large,well-known companies.' On underwriting; 'IFC should continue to limitits underwriting of international securities to exceptional cases whereit is clear that the transaction cannot be completed without IFC'spresence.'Pointing out that IFC has adopted a policy of not competing forprivatisation mandates awarded through bidding procedures, it arguesthat a further step should be taken to 'adopt a policy of not competingfor any advisory mandates awarded through a bidding procedure.'(1)Strengthening Collaboration Between the International FinanceCorporation and the Private Financial Community.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ITALY: LOSERS NOT CHOOSERSWhen Banco di Napoli declared a 1995 half-year loss of L1,561 billion(about dollars 1 billion) last autumn, it confirmed its capacity forexploring the financial outer reaches. It had shocked markets earlierin the year by declaring a loss of almost L1,000 billion for 1994, thenrevised upwards to L1,147 billion.Yet Banco di Napoli's awful performance should not have been asurprise.Other large southern banks had extended loss-making frontiers overrecent years, and Banco di Napoli operates in the same difficultenvironment of the mezzogiorno's almost comatose economy and thetenacious grip of politicial interference for which the south isnotorious.The truth about the dismal quality of its loanbook could not be hiddenforever.On its beam ends, the Neapolitan bank started 1996 in search of rescue.It was thrown a line at the end of November, when the treasury ministryand a group of banks agreed a L2,500 billion loan at market rates, amove suggesting that the bank was suffering an awkward liquidityshortage.The loan only allows temporary respite, however, when what is needed isradical restructuring both of its capital base and operations.Indeed, a drastic re-shaping has been sought by Federico Pepe since hisappointment to the chief executive's hot seat last summer.Heavy cuts are needed in the branch network, both to reduce losses andslim assets. But this will not be enough, and a massive injection offresh capital, upwards of L3,000 billion, is also needed to put ratiosin order.Though believed to enjoy central bank support, Pepe's plans have notbeen taken on board by all fellow directors, some of whom havevigorously opposed disposal of branches.There is opposition also to dilution of the equity owned by the bank'sfoundation. Seemingly unaware of the adage that losers cannot bechoosers, Neapolitan politicians want to continue controlling the bankand calling the shots, and imagine that there are gullible whiteknights ready to put their cash into a southern Italian bank that hasgiven no satisfaction to investors.Banco di Napoli's shares were traded at L658 on 15 January, against a1995/1996 high of L1,480.A big headache for the supervisory authorities, as well as itsshareholders, Banco di Napoli is far from being the only problem inItalian banking, however.Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI, the Italian banking association)published a review of the 1995 half-year results of a sample of 91commercial banks, including all the major institutions, at the end oflast year.The overall picture was gloomy. Although there was a slight increase ininterest margin for banks with nationwide operations, from 1.09% oftotal assets in the first half of 1994 to 1.12% in the January to Juneperiod last year, this is considered to have resulted from transitoryimprovements in conditions.Reviewing 1995's first-half results, Stefano Preda, professor ofeconomics at Milan's Bocconi University, noted that, faced bydifficulties in maintaining interest margins, many banks have tried toboost earnings from services.'Diversification is the typical strategic response to crisis in corebusiness. However, results do not at the moment seem comforting.' Predanoted that Italy's banks have until now diversifed into sectors thatare similar to banking, mature and offering low margins and high risks.He pointed to asset management where commissions of only L250 billionwere earned on more than L115,000 billion under management.Preda considered that while Italy's banks must improve revenues, theymust also cut costs further. At more than L110 million, the averageannual cost per employee is far higher than in other sectors. The ratioof operating costs to deposits and loans has been declining since 1991,but this is not enough.Fragmentation of the banking system prevents economies of scale.'Concentration is the right path, and is obligatory in many cases wheresize is insufficiently competitive,' said Preda.ABI's figures show that while there was a general improvement in grossoperating results, and improvements in net profit for regional andprovincial banks, the large national banks' aggregate bottom line waswritten in deep red.Thanks to increased provisions and lower extraordinary gains, Italy'slarge national banks showed an aggregate post-tax loss of L866 billionin the first half of last year, compared with a profit of L445 billionin the same period of 1994. Clearly Banco di Napoli's awesome losseswere influential, but other big banks hardly shone.Even after booking L44 billion extraordinary gains, Credito Italianocould report a post-tax end-of-June profit of only L91 billion (lessthan dollars 60 million).And while Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino showed a bottom linesurplus of L214 billion, it fell short of past achievements and whatmight be expected of Italy's biggest bank.Troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), whose former general managerVincenzo Pennarola is appealing through legal channels against hisdismissal in November, is another of Italy's faded banking glories.It was able to report a half-year net profit of L77 billion (on totalassets of L100,174 billion) only thanks to booking L152 billion ofextraordinary gains.And Milan's Cariplo, apparently still hopeful about making an initialpublic offering of its shares, returned a half-year profit of L135billion (on total assets of L131,271 billion) that is unlikely toencourage queues of eager prospective shareholders.There are no signs of joy at Banca di Roma either. Formed from themerger of three unsparkling institutions (Banco di Roma, Banco di SantoSpirito and Cassa di Risparmio di Roma) in the late 1980s and early1990s, the bank has yet to shine.Half-year profit of the bank (total assets of L153,665 billion) was ameagre L53 billion. Moreove, the recent acquisitions of BancaMediterranea (L2 billion profit at 30 June) and Banca Nazionaledell'Agricoltura (L17 billion loss) have done nothing to strengthen theRome bank.Notwithstanding disappointing results and dodgy loan books, Italy's bigbanks nevertheless seem to seek problems.Perhaps it is because most (Cariplo, MPS, San Paolo, Banca di Roma andthe large southerners Banco di Napoli and Banco di Sicilia) stillbelong firmly in the public sector.That may also explain the apparent enthusiasm with which IMI (theinvestment bank and financial services conglomerate), its threecontrolling shareholders (Cariplo, San Paolo and MPS) and Banca di Romabought into the equity of the Mediaset television company owned byformer prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , in spite of enormous andevident conflicts of interest.At least Banco di Napoli was not among the banks which put up L400billion to take a 6% stake in Mediaset at the end of December, thoughits name does appear among the shareholders of Italy's TAV high speedtrain project.But that investment was made when the bank was reporting profits.Survival is now the issue, rather than the collection of politicalpoints that still seems to preoccupy many banks.Professor Preda sees a trend that presents ample risks and a difficultfuture if decisive structural intervention is not undertaken both inindividual banks and the system overall. Indeed, some bankers refer toa crisis situation.As Italian banking enters 1996, many questions remain unanswered, notleast, which of its members might go the way of Banco di Napoli.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996FRANCE: PROFIT - OR LOSSAs expected, Paribas chief executive Andre Levy-Lang was officiallyified last December that he is under investigation by a Frenchmagistrate looking into a case of falsified accounts at a Paribassubsidiary, Ciments Francais.This procedure, on which Paribas refuses to comment, allows themagistrate to interrogate Levy-Lang. The magistrate is obviously tryingto determine if Paribas and its chief executive knew about thefalsified accounts, something that Paribas, which has instituted acivil action in the case, has always denied.Given the circumstances of the case it would seem highly unlikely thatParibas was aware of the problem at Ciments Francais.Perhaps the bigger question raised by the case is the degree to which aholding company, like Paribas, can control its subsidiaries. Andwhether a French holding company can control a French subsidiary - evenwith five representatives on the board of directors of the subsidiary -given the passive nature of boards in France vis a vis the executivechairman. Ciments Francais' executive chairman, Pierre Conso, was arespected member of the business community.The case dates back to 1991 when one of Paribas' major shareholders,the AXA insurance group, decided to get rid of its shares in CimentsFrancais, a cement group. After a bid Paribas ended up with 86% of thegroup headed by Pierre Conso. Ciments Francais reported profits ofFF401 million (dollars 77.4 million) for 1991, a year when Paribasposted a loss of FF200 million, the first in its history.In April 1992, after trying unsuccessfully to fit the new activities inwith another industrial group, Paribas announced it was selling acontrolling shareholding of 54.7% of Ciments Francais to Italcementi,part of the Pesenti family group, one of the most important family-heldgroups in Italy.The FF6.6 billion deal, arranged for the Pesenti by Mediobanca, madeItalcementi the largest cement company in Europe and the second largestin the world.In July 1992 Ciments Francais raised FF500 million in equity on themarket, guaranteed by Mediobanca and Paribas, both of which reportedlyended up stuck with the paper.At first this looked like hard luck but in the light of followingevents was perhaps a stroke of good fortune since no big internationalinvestors became mired in the deal.In October 1992 an audit of Ciments Francais commissioned byItalcementi uncovered FF2.7 billion in off balance-sheet activitiesthat had gone unreported in its official balance sheet and whichaccounted for FF655 million of the FF740 million in losses for thefirst semester of 1992. Conso was fired and later arrested.Mediobanca, which has a small shareholding in Paribas, was infuriated.Paribas deducted FF500 million from the purchase price and later tookoff another FF325 million. It also took over some of the off balance-sheet activities of Ciments Francais.The FF800 million capital gain originally announced turned into a lossfor Paribas. A report ordered by the investigating magistrate concludedthat in 1991 Ciments Francais should have posted a FF120 million lossinstead of a profit.One of the ironies in the story is that Giampiero Pesenti, head ofItalcementi, is also chairman of Gemina, the investment and financialservices group of Fiat, in which the Pesenti group as well asMediobanca also have shares.The recent Mediobanca-concocted plan to merge the activities of Geminawith the financial and industrial activities of the Ferruzzi group tocreate a super-Gemina foundered, due to surprise losses at a Geminasubsidiary, Rizzoli. This would have created the second largest groupin Italy after Fiat.Now Gemina executives are under investigation for falsified accountsand false corporate reporting. Paribas was to have taken a 5% stake inthe super-Gemina deal.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996AUSTRIA: POST-UNION BLUESAustria has a headache, or several. Sobered up after the excitementwhich accompanied the overwhelming vote in the 1994 referendum infavour of joining the European Union, the country is now coming toterms with the implications of membership, a year after joining.After the second election in just over a year, the once stablepolitical structure is in disarray.The government still badly needs to tackle the budget deficit, theissue which caused last year's breakdown of the ruling left/rightcoalition.The point has been made more urgent by commitment to meeting theMaastricht criteria for membership of economic and monetary union(EMU).Rather than being marginalised as just a small country on the easternfringes of the EU, Austria aims to be a senior player in the bigleague, while at the same time retaining a role as a gateway to theemerging economies of central and eastern Europe. That objective is indoubt.A slowdown in economic growth is not helping. Nor is it providing apromising background for the banks, already suffering in their homemarket from slow loan growth and pressure on margins in a seriouslyoverbanked country.Meanwhile, the political shenanigans have yet again put into abeyanceplans for privatisation of the government's stakes in the two biggestbanks. First in line is Creditanstalt, where the voting majority hasbeen up for grabs for nearly five years now; but the biggest, BankAustria, could also be affected.That is one of the problems facing the new finance minister. ViktorKlima, a Social Democrat (red) and former minister of transport, wasappointed by chancellor Franz Vranitzky (red) after Andreas Staribacherresigned.The move was widely welcomed in the banking sector as clearing the wayfor another attempt at the planned privatisations and, possibly, forsorting out the problems with the budget.Staribacher, a tax consultant, had been brought in last April toreplace longserving (red) finance minister Ferdinand Lacina, whostepped down after problems in negotiating the 1995 budget. (Last monthLacina was named to succeed Herbert Lugmayr, who is retiring, aschariman of GiroCredit, central clearing organisation for the savingsbanks.)Now the new finance minister faces the same problems as hispredecessors in 1996; the junior coalition partner, the People's Party(black), has been pushing for cuts in the generous spending on socialsecurity rather than tax increases.The election in December had been brought on by the collapse of thecoalition over the budget argument after the People's Party's newleader, Wolfgang Schussel, took a chance on improving the party'srepresentation in Parliament.His gamble failed; the reds increased their seats from 65 to 72, theblacks edged up from 52 to 53. The far right Freedom Party headed bythe populist Jorg Haider, which had previously been gaining ground andchallenging the established political set-up, stood still with 41 seatsagainst 42.That leaves the government where it started. At the time of writing,talks were still going on to renew the coalition.Whatever agreement is reached between the parties, they have to tacklethe budget issue. The deficit was expected to reach 5.3% of grossdomestic product (GDP) last year. It needs to be cut to 3% to meet theMaastricht convergence criteria. Until a budget is agreed for this yearpredictions further ahead are shaky.Some contribution is expected from the proceeds of privatisation ofextensive state holdings in industrial and commercial companies -including the banks. But the fundamentals, which caused the previoussplit, need to be sorted out.Getting the deficit under control is not being helped by the economicslowdown. The latest forecasts from GiroCredit indicate that GDPgrowth, which hit 3.0% in 1994, slipped to 2.0% last year and couldfall to 1.7% this year.The bank results have reflected the slowdown in the economy.Preliminary indications for the full year from the biggest banks showthat, while business at home was quiet, international activities helpedto produce reasonably good results.Bank Austria reported in late December that operating results for 1995should be up by 16.8% at about S4.9 billion (dollars 485 million). Thebank has been working on cutting costs: 'The domestic branch networkwas further streamlined through the closure or merger of branches.'The number of branches and business units fell from 320 to 306, andthe bank plans to merge 20 more branches in 1996.'In the home market: 'Demand for personal loans remains depressed due toslow growth in disposable income, but is stronger than in 1994.Business loans experienced growth, especially those granted to smalland medium-sized companies.'Outside Austria 'international business has surpassed expectations. In1995, the performance of all the bank's foreign offices was either goodor outstanding based on a comparison of the results posted for 1994'.Bank Austria has been working to take advantage of the fact that it isnow under the same holding company which holds a majority of GiroCredit(which is however fighting to avoid losing its its separate identity).The asset management activities of the two banks have been merged. And'agreement was reached with GiroCredit to direct external publicaccountants to examine the possibilities for merging some of theforeign offices of Bank Austria and GiroCredit'.The bank has also been developing its external links. Cariplo of Italyhas agreed to increase its holding from 4.3% to 5.6% this year.And last year Bank Austria formed a strategic link with Germany'sWestdeutsche Landesbank.'The co-operation agreement .. foresees a participation of WestLB inBank Austria in the order of about 9.1% in Bank Austria's share capitalthrough a capital increase. The two banks moreover mutually declarethemselves to be preferred partners for cross-border financialtransactions.'Creditanstalt has been particularly helped by foreign business.Chairman Guido Schmidt-Chiari reported a rise of 16% in the CA Group'safter-tax surplus to about S2.2 billion.'One dominant characteristic of the 1995 business year was thefavourable earnings situation in international business. Whileaccounting for some 50% of the consolidated balance sheet, foreignbusiness generated about two-thirds of the group's surplus for theyear.'In contrast: 'Domestic business was under heavy pressure in 1995.'The reasons for this development are to be seen in the extremely weakcredit demand during much of the year, the shift to short-term loanswith low interest rates and a general squeeze on the interest margin.'GiroCredit, which as well as being the central institution for thesavings banks is a commercial bank in its own right, had a good yearwith operating profit up 56% at S1.53 billion. The year was eventful,including a reorganisation of risk management, restructuring the equityinvestment portfolio and 'going public'.To achieve this, the bank converted the whole of its outstandingparticipating capital, with a nominal value of S300 million, intopreference shares which were offered to the public. 'Despite theunfavourable market climate at the time, the issue was oversubscribed.The preference stock is widely held, having been placed with privateand institutional investors in Austria and abroad.'The problems of the banks were highlighted by rating agency Moody's inits December 1995 review. The agency pointed to five challenges:* Widespread overcapacity within the domestic banking system;* Aggressive retail fund pricing coupled with relentless pressure onloan margins which, together, continue to define the generally poorprofitability of Austrian banks;* Slack loan demand for the foreseeable future as the Austrian economyitself shows renewed signs of slowing down;* High overhead ratios that are the product not only of underlying thincore operating revenues but also of relatively high cost structures;* The need, at least for some of the major banks, to rebuild their trueeconomic capital that, to an extent, had been impacted by the releaseof hidden reserves (either through the sale of assets or reductions inoverprovisioning) during the recession.'Moody's added: 'Looking ahead, the Austrian banking system as a wholemay have difficulties in pursuing any further far-reaching and morepainful restructuring after a number of years of targeted andmoderately successful cost containment measures.'The agency highlighted the excessive number of banks. 'From a retailbanking point of view, Austria remains overbranched. With the exceptionof Belgium, its banking system is the most overbanked in the EuropeanUnion with any one bank or bank branch serving, on average, a mere1,384 people. Germany comes relatively close with 1,533 people served.'Consolidation and restructuring within the banking system are needed.Some progress has been made in the savings sector. But at the end ofthe day developments depend on political influence and convincingentrenched interests of the need to adapt to the new open environmentof EU membership.Sorting out the privatisation programme would be a good starting point.It would help to shape the future direction of the banks, as well asmaking a significant, if one-off, contribution to cutting the budgetdeficit.Bank Austria is majority owned by the (historically red) City ofVienna; but the Federal government has indicated its intention ofselling off its 22.8% voting stake. That has not prevented chiefexecutive Gerhard Randa from making long-term plans.The greatest uncertainty is over Creditanstalt, where the long-runningsaga of the sale has made it difficult for the management to planahead.While he was finance minister, Staribacher had called in JP Morgan toput a value on the Federal government's stake - just under half thecapital but holding 70.5% of the votes.Morgan determined that, while the bank was worth some S28-30 billion intotal, the government's controlling stake should command a premium.That implied a valuation of some S18 billion, a useful contribution tocutting the deficit (The Banker, 8/95, p31).The coalition's collapse and the election meant that the sale was againput off (The Banker, 11/95, p4). Now Klima has the chance to start theprocess again. As usual, politics intervenes.The sale offer had progressed as far as inviting indicative offers forthe Creditanstalt stake. It is believed that the consortium includingFirst Austrian Bank and Italy's Generali insurance group (known as the'Austrian solution'), which has been showing interest for some time,put down a marker. It is not known whether there were any other firmapproaches.The nub of the issue is whether Austria will be prepared to allow atraditionally black bank which goes back to the old Habsburg empire topass out of Austrian control.Germany's Allianz insurance group had shown an interest, but backedoff; Switzerland's CS Holding group pulled out of a firm offer when itmet an increasingly xenophobic reaction.Lacina, finance minister at the time, is believed to have at leastinitially favoured the CS Holding approach. Klima is understood to haveopposed the deal, believing that the bank should stay in Austrianhands.Now he is in the driving seat. The problem will be to reconcilenational pride with giving value to the purchaser(s) of theCreditanstalt stake and at the same time realising as much benefit aspossible to help cut the budget deficit.There is a strong belief that the sales of the Federal government'sbank stakes will go ahead this year. That will be some relief toeverybody.Austrian banks' interim results June 1995(schillings million)                           Capital &  % change    Total   % change                           reserves    (12/94)    assets   (12/94)Creditanstalt-Bankverein     25,778     -1.5     637,159     3.2Bank Austria                 22,965      0.0     670,243     5.3GiroCredit                   16,740      0.0     328,550     0.4Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich                  11,700      1.7     224,300     3.4Bank fur Arbeit & Wirtschaft  9,376      2.2     225,258     0.9PSK Banking Group             8,770      3.4     250,156    16.5First Austrian Bank           8,532(1)   0.0     210,896     2.2                              Net-      Non-                   %                            interest  interest   Operating   change                             income    income      resultCreditanstalt-Bankverein      4,544     3,211      2,237      -6.6Bank Austria                  5,778     2,345      1,966      17.4GiroCredit                    1,445       766        678     227.5Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich                     763       519      1,282      25.2Bank fur Arbeit & Wirtschaft  1,575       407        620      12.5PSK Banking Group             1,517       853        847      20.3First Austrian Bank           2,014     1,082        744      -1.2(1) excludes supplementary capitalUSdollars = 9.7337 schillings (6/95)Source:  The BankerBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996CZECH REPUBLIC: THE SECOND TIME AROUNDParliamentary elections at the end of June are already casting ashadow. Not that anyone expects the present coalition government led byprime minister Vaclav Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party to lose. Noris there likely to be any disruption of the economic and politicalstability which has characterised the Czech transition to a marketeconomy, easily the smoothest and most successful in post-communistcentral and east Europe.As Klaus has recently observed, his government, in office since June1992, is already the longest serving since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918 led to the creation of an independentCzechoslovakia - and ultimately to the emergence of the Czech republicin 1992, when Slovakia split away.This does not mean that this year's elections for the 200-seat chamberof deputies (and later in the year for the newly-created 81-membersenate, or upper house) is likely to see another Klaus walkover.According to the opinion polls, the main opposition group, the SocialDemocratic Party, led by Milos Zeman, has moved up from 6.5% of thevote at the 1992 election to around 20% support against 25-27% forVaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party.By contrast, the two junior partners in the present coalition, theCivic Democratic Alliance and Christian Democratic Union/Czech People'sParty, look like mustering around 6-8% of the vote, just aboutsufficient to satisfy the 5% minimum to secure representation in thenew house. So do the communists, which makes the Czech republic theonly country in the region where former communists (reformed orunreformed) have no prospect of being voted back into power.But, while the elections are unlikely to see an upset, they arenonetheless having an influence on the local political debate. Issues,such as reform of the health service, education, pensions, and publictransport, which have tended to be neglected amid the broad politicalconsensus about the reform process, have been moving up the peckingorder.So have questions arising from what prime minister Klaus has himselfdescribed as the 'early post-transformation stage' to which 'Czechsociety has now progressed'.Longer-term questions about industrial policy, financial sectorregulation, and the role of banks and investment funds in corporategovernance have been prompted by a series of takeovers of companies andinvestment funds and by several bank failures.Last year's yawning trade deficit has underlined a growing debate aboutCzech competitiveness. Can a country of 10 million people offer a homemarket large enough to support industrial companies and financialservices groups capable of competing successfully in today's globalmarket place? Differences between the government and the central bankover exchange rate policy have become increasingly public. The tradedeficit appears to strengthen the case for the Czech crown to bedevalued: the heavy, continuing inflow of foreign capital creates astrong argument for revaluation.The investment inflow is one measure of the international recognitionthe so far successful transformation of the Czech economy has beenreceiving.Foreign direct and portfolio investment has been flooding in, bringingthe cumulative total since the transition began in 1990 to well overdollars 5 billion.In October the government fully liberalised all current accounttransactions and also freed many capital account transactions, thusachieving convertibility in terms of the International Monetary Fund'sArticle VIII.Then, in November, the Czech republic chalked up a notable double. Thecountry became the first in post-communist central and east Europe tobe accepted for membership of the industrial nations' club, theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation & Development.In the same month, the country was the first in the region to beawarded an 'A-stable' investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's, theUS credit rating agency.The Czech economy, meanwhile, is expected to grow by another 4-5% thisyear, for the third year running. Prime minister Klaus prefers to callthe downturn in the early 1990s not a recession but 'a transformationshake-out' - a 'shake-out of the non-viable economic activities whichcould exist only in protected Comecon markets, with distorted pricestructures and huge subsidies'.Unemployment never rose by very much, and is now less than 3% and stillfalling. Productivity is rising. Inflation has fallen to singlefigures, and is still declining. The Czech crown has been holdingsteady on the world's exchanges. And, as Klaus is keen to point out,Czech living standards (using purchasing power parity) are already backto or above the level of the poorer member countries in the EuropeanUnion.The only possibly worrying feature in an otherwise impressive record isthe trade deficit. Last year it looked set to reach dollars 3.5billion, up sharply from dollars 470 million in 1994. But here, too,Klaus sees this as natural in the early post-transformation stage ofthe Czech economy.Not only are imports likely to increase as the pace of industrialoutput and construction quickens. Exports are also likely to bediverted to the home market as the growth of investment and consumptionaccelerates. With the country's overall international credibilitystanding high, and investment pouring in, financing the trade deficitposes no problem, at least for the present.Vaclav Klaus goes further. He sees no reason to change the exchangerate, unlike Josef Tosovsky, the able central bank governor, who hasbeen worried by the impact of heavy monetary inflows, especially short-term speculative capital, upon the domestic money supply, and thus uponinflationary pressure. According to Klaus, a devaluation would notsolve, at least in the short run, the balance of trade deficit, while arevaluation - especially a small revaluation - would not discouragemonetary inflows.Instead, the two may settle for a more modest change in exchange ratepolicy. This would be to widen the band within which the Czech crowntrades against the dollars/DM currency basket. At present the band islimited to 0.5% either side of parity.Changing the band to as much as 3%, or possibly even 5%, either side ofparity could help to deter speculative flows as well as provide somescope to promote competitiveness.Competitiveness has already been improving to some extent. Industrialproductivity has risen. The low level of unemployment, despite large,continuing lay-offs, indicates that the manpower shake-out in somesectors has been absorbed by the fast growing small business andservices sectors.'The low level of unemployment is a bottleneck to higher growth,' saysJosef Tosovsky of the National Bank; 'manpower and other resources arestill being hoarded by inefficient firms'.Lubomir Soudek, chairman and chief executive of Skoda Plzen, thecountry's largest heavy engineering firm, makes a similar point.'Czech industry faces several competitive disadvantages. We still lagbehind in technology. There are still big problems over working methodsand ethics, including lower labour productivity because of outdatedmanagement methods.The general lack of capital is a major hindrance.'Short-term loans from local Czech banks are not on as good terms asthose offered by western banks to their clients. Finally, a drawbackthat cannot be overlooked is the relatively low level of directgovernment support for Czech industry.'As Soudek indicates, prime minister Klaus is inclined to leave thingsto the market. But, for a long while, banks and other creditorsappeared reluctant to enforce the bankruptcy laws.These were considerably strengthened in 1993 and another amendment toquicken liquidation proceedings is in preparation now. It is onlyrecently, however, that the rate of enforcement has picked up. Betweenlate 1992 and May 1995 a total of 4,500 bankruptcy petitions werefiled, but only 600 bankruptcies were declared.There are other indications that the pace of restructuring in Czechindustry may be about to quicken. Last year the second and final waveof the Czech republic's voucher privatisation programme was completed,raising the share of the country's gross domestic product generated bythe private sector to more than 70%. The flow of foreign directinvestment also boomed in 1995, in part boosted by the partialprivatisation sale of SPT Telecom to the Swiss and Dutchtelecommunications groups.As Lubomir Soudek of Skoda Plzen says, many Czech companies are toosmall to compete with the largest multinationals.In October Stratton, a US investment company owned by Michael Dingman,a Bahamas-based industrialist, announced that it had bought stakes ineight leading Czech companies (in shipping, glass-making, pulp andpaper, and oil and gas exploration) from Prague-based Harvard Capital &Consulting, the big privatisation investment fund group.Stratton proposed to inject marketing, management, and financialexpertise into the eight firms, regarding itself as a medium-terminvestor.Eventually, it would sell its shares on to strategic investors or floatthem on the market. Meanwhile, Stratton and Harvard (which hadsubsequently bought in the market further shares in the same companies)would vote their shares jointly.This was followed by a move against other big privatisation investmentfunds by a little-known Czech firm called Motoinvest acting in concertwith Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, two local banks. In a series ofstock market raids, Motoinvest bought blocks of shares in sixinvestment funds run by established local fund managers, saying that itwould dispense with the existing management and run the funds itself.Shortly afterwards, Bankers Trust bought by agreement 40% stakes in twoinvestment funds run by Ceska Sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank),intending to sell the stakes on to Western institutional investors.Each of these moves, but especially Motoinvest's, sent a shock wavethrough the relatively staid world of Czech fund management.Motoinvest's ploy demonstrated the funds' vulnerability as long astheir own shares trade at big discounts to net asset value. The obviousconclusion was that fund managers need to generate much better returnson their portfolio of investments in privatised companies.The government was also prompted to act more speedily to tighten up theregulatory framework. The lack of transparency on the Prague StockExchange has long been criticised as a major shortcoming and a sourceof weakness. In future, acquisitions of stakes of more than 10% in acompany will have to be disclosed.At the same time, the law is being changed to allow investment funds,which have hitherto been restricted to a maximum 20% holding in any onecompany, to elect to become managerial funds permitted to acquiremajority stakes in Czech companies.Big changes also appear to be impending in the banking sector. Foreignbanks were becoming a major force in the local corporate and investmentbanking markets when the National Bank temporarily stopped issuing newbanking licences in late 1993 and set about trying to encourage theemergence through mergers of a tier of middle-sized local banks.Now, with the failure of these hopes (despite the impending merger ofBanka Hana and Zemska Banka) and with the Czech government aboutformally to announce its bid for European Union membership, theNational Bank is thinking of lifting or easing the ban on new licences,with the UK's Midland Bank apparently heading the list of possible newarrivals.Meanwhile, two of the four large local banks, Ceska Sporitelna andCeskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (the former foreign trade bank), are at'the very preliminary stage' of discussing the possibility of a merger.These talks may never come to anything. But they point to one possibleway forward. The big local banks in the Czech republic (like those inHungary, another country of 10 million people) are relatively tinycompared with the foreign banks with which they increasingly have tocompete, such as the big German, Austrian, American (including now GECapital), Swiss, and Dutch banks building up key positions in theregion's banking and financial markets.Sooner or later, the 'big' local banks will have to follow their majorcorporate clients as they expand abroad, just as Western banks had toin their day.As competition builds up in the run-up to European Union membership,the big Czech (and Hungarian, Polish and other) banks will need to seekstrategic partners of their own or, alternatively, try to outgrow thelimitations of their own local home market by making acquisitionselsewhere in the region.In banking, as in other sectors, the second and perhaps the harderstage of the transformation of the Czech economy is getting seriouslyunder way.Czech Republic: Key indicators                                         1992  1993  1994 1995* 1996**Private sector: % GDP                    27.7  45.1  56.3  70.0    naGrowth: % GDP change                     -6.4  -0.9   2.6   4.0   4.8Unemployment: % end year                  2.6   3.5   3.2   2.8   2.8Inflation: % end year                    12.7  18.2  10.2   9.1   8.0Budget balance: % GDP                    -3.3   1.4   1.0   0.0   0.0Trade balance: dlrs bn                   -1.0   0.3  -0.4  -3.8    naCurrent account: dlrs bn                  0.6   0.4   0.3  -1.9  -2.3Net external debt: dlrs bn                8.6   3.9   2.8    na    naForeign direct investment: dlrs bn        0.9   0.5   0.9   2.0    naExchange rate: koruny to USdlrs end year 28.9  30.0  28.2  26.7    na               koruny to DM end year     17.9  17.3  18.0  18.6    na*  latest or end year estimate** projectedSource:  EBRD & othersBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996GLOBAL BANKING: HOME AND AWAYThe world's Top 50 global banks appear to have slowed their expansionabroad as the trend towards consolidation in domestic banking sectorstakes hold.The Banker's latest survey of global banking suggests that, while somehave expanded their percentage of overseas assets, others have returnedtheir focus to domestic markets.The top ranking continues to be headed by the UK's Standard Charteredwith its percentage of assets abroad remaining above 70%. However, forthe second year running, the bank has relied on Hongkong for more than50% of its pre-tax profits. Nevertheless, it does have an extensivenetwork throughout the high-growth region of Asia; predators withambitions in the area would find Standard Chartered a temptingacquisition. In January, rumours were circulating, with the UK'sNational Westminster Bank, ranked 13th globally, as a potential bidder.One new entry into the top five is ABN-Amro Bank, whose overseas assetsfigure this year of 61% includes those assets domiciled overseas bookedthrough the Netherlands. This figure looks set to increase further forin 1994, the number of the bank's overseas branches increased from 461to 540.The Netherland's second largest bank, ING Bank, is also a bank thatfocuses on international activities, having entered obscure foreignmarkets such as North Korea and Cuba before its rivals. Its acquisitionof failed Barings will enhance its international activities. However,the lack of information provided by the bank on its overseas assetsmakes a comparison with ABN-Amro difficult. It is not surprising tofind the Dutch banks venturing abroad, given their saturated homemarket.The top players continue to include the 'Big Three' from Switzerland,but their position in the global rankings has changed as they vie togain control of their domestic market.Swiss Bank Corporation expanded domestically in 1994 throughacquisition, co-operation agreements and minority stakes, losing sevenplaces in the rankings as the percentage of its assets held abroad fellfrom 53% to 47%.Union Bank of Switzerland also expanded domestically by acquiring fiveregional banks, resulting in a drop in its ranking to fourth fromsecond. CS Holdings made its large domestic acquisition of SwissVolksbank in 1993, followed in 1994 with the absorption ofSwitzerland's largest regional bank, New Bank of Argovie.However, such actions at home do not represent a change in overallglobal strategy. Swiss Bank Corp took over the UK's SG Warburg in 1995and CS Holdings has risen to second place in this year's rankings. Itsassets in the US through investment banking subsidiary CS First Bostonrepresent 30% of group total assets.Other strong European representations come from the five French bankswhich hold more than 40% of their assets abroad. Surprisingly, troubledCredit Lyonnais, under pressure to dispose of assets to pay for itsoverexpansion in the 1980s, now leads the French pack with 53.6%.According to the controversial rescue plan announced in early 1995,Credit Lyonnais was ordered to sell off 30% of its foreign assets.Deutsche Bank leads the four German banks in the list, with 43% ofassets abroad as of end December 1994. Deutsche Bank's chairman HilmarKopper said in November that the bank was only 'half German' and hasdesigns to become a global player in wholesale operations. With a 2.7%share of the European Union market, it is the market leader and isstrengthening its investment banking operations in London throughsubsidiary Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.Better disclosure from Dresdner Bank indicates that 33% of its assetsare held abroad, and this figure looks set to rise further with lastyear's acquisition of the UK's Kleinwort Benson.Other developments among the European banks include a drop in BancoSantander's assets abroad, from 38.6% to 29.7%, as a result ofabsorbing failed Banesto. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya now assumes the positionof top global Spanish bank. In December, the UK's National WestminsterBank sold off its US retail and commercial banking operations as aresult of competition arising from the rapid pace of consolidation inthe US banking market.However, one of the bank's strategies is to build up NatWest Marketsinternationally and it has recently expanded its futures operations inAsia.Outside Europe, Japan continues to be represented by 10 banks with twonewcomers, Mitsubishi Trust & Banking and Sumitomo Trust & Banking, inthis year's list through better disclosure of their overseasactivities. Their annual reports indicate ambitions to expand abroad,especially in China and the Asia region. This is not surprising, giventhe prolonged recession at home. However, a merger on 1 April betweenBank of Tokyo, the most international of the Japanese banks, and thedomestically stronger Mitsubishi Bank will create the world's largestbank, but with a higher proportion of the new banks' assets residing athome.Of the three Australian banks in the list, a contrast of strategiesexists between National Australia Bank and Westpac. National AustraliaBank continues to expand abroad with its acquisition of MichiganNational Corp of the US, increasing its overseas assets figure to 47%.This will be reflected in next year's survey. Meanwhile Westpac iscontinuing to refocus on its domestic market after reckless over-expansion in the 1980s, resulting in 1992 in a loss equivalent to onethird of its then Tier One capital.Of the six US banks in the ranking, JP Morgan, Bankers Trust andCiticorp all hold over 45% of their assets abroad. However, withpossible new regulations regarding interstate banking, US banks maytake advantage of the new opportunities to expand domestically.Indeed, a process of consolidation is under way within the US bankingsector and in 1995, the biggest bank in the US was created by themerger between Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan. Now they hold23.6% and 29.8% of assets abroad respectively, with the merger creatinga more powerful domestic than international franchise.

But Murayama's sudden resignation in earlyJanuary was precipitated not so much by a process of natural selectionas by fears that the parliamentary opposition would make mincemeat ofhim over the Jusen affair. If he is to save his own political skin, andthe reputation of the parliamentary coalition in which he served astrade and industry minister, Hashimoto has to champion the Jusenrescue.The issue is extremely important, not only for Japan but equally forinternational financial markets. The fragile Japanese banking systemcould be plunged back into turmoil if the Jusen scheme is turned into apolitical football. The so-called Japan premium would reappear ininterbank markets, the Tokyo stock market would likely reverse itsrecent gains and a dangerous downward economic spiral could result.With so much at stake it was small wonder that Murayama, who is 71years old and weary from the burden of 18 months in office, shouldshrink from facing what threatened to be a full frontal challenge onceJapan's national Diet reconvened on 22 January. The Shinshintoopposition party now has at its head Ichiro Ozawa, a man every bit asruthless politically as Hashimoto and who will seize any opportunity tobring down the ruling coalition.In a country like Japan which loves to hate its bankers, Shanshinto hasnothing to lose and everything to gain by capitalising on the Jusenissue.Japanese voters are often assumed to be docile but there is asurprising degree of popular outrage over the scheme devised lastDecember by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to rescue the mortgagelending firm - using Yen 685 billion or dollars 6.8 billion of taxpayersubsidies in the process .Even now, some five years after the collapse of Japan's bubble economy,bankers are still being berated by politicians and the public forcausing the bubble. That banks were forced into financing speculativeassets in the late 1980s after financial deregulation sent many formerclients in search of capital market finance rather than bank borrowingsis overlooked.Virtually everyone is baying for the blood of the bankers and Ozawa isan astute enough politician to exploit the popular ire and try to bringabout the downfall of the Hashimoto government over the Jusen issue.Few in Japan would argue with Shinshinto's right to force the coalitionto seek a popular mandate after its unseemly power grab in 1993, butthe few who realise what is at stake wish the opposition had chosenanother issue on which to go to war.The Jusen scheme represented the coping stone of an elaborate edificeconstructed by the finance minister under its former political headMasayoshi Takemura, who heads the minority Sakigaki party withinHashimoto's coalition. Under initiatives announced late last year, theMoF arranged first for banks to come clean on their bubble-economy badloans, to beef up their management systems and to agree to a ResolutionTrust-type body being set up, financed by a steep hike in depositinsurance premiums.The ministry also promised to thoroughly overhaul itself and to renderits opaque supervision of Japan's financial system more transparent andaccountable in future.But it was the Jusen scheme (which involved a considerable financialsacrifice on the part of Japanese banks) that finally tippedinternational confidence back in Japan's favour. Now, this could be injeopardy once more.The Jusen problem is big by any measure. Out of total loans of aroundYen 13 trillion the seven firms (which began with residential mortgagelending before splurging on commercial real estate financing in thebubble economy) have seen some Yen 6.3 trillion worth go bad. Most isattributable to banks and it represents one-third of the Yen 18trillion in loans which the MoF says is now irrecoverable in theJapanese financial system.The public has selected the wrong target in pillorying the banks overthe Jusen scheme. Taxpayers' money is needed not so much because banks(which founded and financed the housing corporations) have provedunwilling or unable to shoulder the full burden of writing off badloans, but because hundreds of agricultural co-operatives which alsolent to the Jusen are shirking their share of the burden.The co-ops, with formidable deposit-gathering powers through theirtrading connections with farmers, have agreed to accept only afractional part of the Jusen loan write-offs relative to the size oftheir exposure. Such is the co-ops' political influence, (especiallywith Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party which depends heavily uponthe rural vote), that few politicians are prepared to attack thempublicly .Banks are easy meat by comparison and even though there is risk forJapan in jeopardising again the health of the banking system thetemptation to make political capita}il out of the Jusen issue appearsirresistible. If the Jusen scheme were to unravel, banks would beforced to follow lengthy legal procedures in order to liquidate theseinstitutions and to crystallise their losses. The banking system wouldsee its international credit ratings sink even lower than they havedone already and more banks could suffer runs as the failed Hyogo Bankdid.This cannot be allowed to happen, not only because of the systemic riskit implies but also because Japan's fragile economic recovery willalmost certainly stall if banks do not soon become engines of creditcreation again. One reason why Japan's economy has been so weak for solong - real GDP has grown by under l% on average over the past fouryears - is because what little recovery has taken place has beenfinanced by a run down of savings and by tax rebates. Bank credit hasbeen absent.Loans outstanding at Japan's 11 commercial or 'city' banks actuallyfell by 1.4% from a year earlier to Yen 218.03 trillion by the end ofDecember, according to the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.While loans at the three long-term credit banks and seven trust bankshave risen marginally, banks in general simply are not confident enoughabout their balance sheets to engage in the kind of aggressive consumerand business lending needed to underpin a substantial rise in demand.Japanese banks badly need more generous tax treatment in writing offbad debt but the quid pro quo for this was that they agree to shouldera heavy part of the Jusen rescue burden. If the scheme falls through,so too presumably do the tax concessions.Despite the critical importance of restoring the banking system to fullhealth in Japan, few people are prepared to sacrifice themselves forthis cause. This became painfully obvious when Hashimoto began castingaround for a new finance minister to replace Takemura, who himself wasonly too eager to take theoopportunity offered by Murayama'sresignation to jump out of the hot seat.Finally, Hashimoto had to turn 66-year-old Wataru Kubo, secretarygeneral of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest forcewithin the ruling three-party coalition to make the 'sacrifice' ofoffering himself up as finance minister. What is normally regarded as aplum job would have gone to an LDP man but all the likely candidatesdeclined it.Although Kubo's appointment assures Hashimoto of socialist partysupport for the controversial Jusen scheme, political analysts say thatby putting the SDP stalwart in the direct firing line the new primeminister has provided himself with a sacrificial lamb in the event thata senior minister has to resign to take responsibility for the Jusenscheme.Hashimoto will insist that taxpayer's money being put into it shouldprove at least partly repayable, if the Resolution Trust-typeinstitution being set up as part of the scheme succeeds in collectingbad debts and realising collateral.A significant part of these bad debts is owed by organised crime(Yakuza) syndicates which borrowed from Jusen during the bubble but arenow refusing to repay loans. Bankers try to collect at their peril -sometimes literally on pain of death. The bad debt issue could wellprove to be fatal for the aspirations of some Japanese politicians too,to say nothing of its impact on Japan's financial system and economy.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996TAIWAN: GIVE US A SMILEService quality and conservative management appeared to be the keys forsuccess in Taiwan's rocky financial market last year and may wellcontinue to be the formula in 1996, according to local bankers andanalysts.Even though Taiwan maintained a 6.4% rate of real economic growth and20% growth in exports, the island's domestic economy remained cool.Financial markets were hit by the continued depression in the propertymarket and a stock market that lost about 27% of its value during theyear, factors which also slowed expansion of private consumption.The outbreak of a number of financial scandals, a rising number ofbankruptcies and intensification of tensions with mainland China in thesecond half of the year added to the perception of gloom in thedomestic economy, despite the strongest export sector performance inyears.Indicators of the sluggish financial environment included soft growthin the M2 money supply, which slowed from 13.1% in January to 8.4% byNovember.More critical for bankers was the relatively cool growth in loans andinvestments, which rose by only 12.1% over the first 10 months of 1995,compared to 15.1% during the same period in 1994. Moreover, thepercentage of non-performing loans rose to a high 3.1% by November,according to Central Bank of China data.Taiwan's major state-owned banks, which are particularly vulnerable toexposure in loans to the property market and small enterprises, lookedlikely to just barely meet earnings targets for the first half of the1996 fiscal year (which began 1 July 1995).Earnings for the top three state-owned commercial banks suffered fromthe impact of a rising share of non-performing loans and losses insecurities investments.During the first five months of their fiscal year (from July toNovember) compared to the year-ago period, the pre-tax earnings forFirst Commercial Bank slipped 14% to NTdollars 2.8 billion, while HuaNan Commercial Bank suffered a 22% decline to NTdollars 2.7 million andthe Chang Hwa Commercial Bank's pre-tax earnings reached only NTdollars2.4 billion, about 5% off the year ago period.On 31 December, the First Commercial Bank had deposits of NTdollars614.1 billion and loans of NTdollars 499.9 billion, followed by Hua NanCommercial Bank with NTdollars 604.5 billion in deposits and NTdollars480.4 billion in ordinary loans, and the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank withNTdollars 593.3 billion in deposits and NTdollars 460.1 billion inloans.Despite the soft conditions, the island's 16 newer private banks(mostly established in 1991-92) continued to attract a rising share ofdeposits and loans. With NTdollars 11.3 billion in total deposits andNTdollars 10.6 billion in loans, the combined weight of the new banksapproached the scale of a major state-owned bank.But the pace of growth of the new banks slowed markedly from previousyears and their ranks showed more signs of differentiation in businessperformance.E. Sun Bank emerged as the leader in deposits for the first time withNTdollars 82.7 billion, up 37% over last year, followed closely byCosmos Bank with NTdollars 82.6 billion and Taishin International Bankwith NTdollars 80.6 billion.Six other banks reported deposits over NTdollars 70 billion. But thefastest growth was tallied by En Tie Commercial Bank, the newestentrant, with 46%, followed by Bank Sinopac with 42% expansion indeposits.Growth in loans was clearly far slower than for deposits last year forthe new banks. Only five had extended over NTdollars 70 billion inloans by the end of 1995, led by Cosmos with NTdollars 75.9 billion, E.Sun Bank with NTdollars 73.9 billion, and Taishin International Bankwith NTdollars 73.5 billion.Indeed, virtually all banks faced difficulties in finding outlets forrising deposits. None of the 16 new banks listed more loans thandeposits by year-end, averaging 94%.Still, the new banks were more effective in this area than the threestate-owned commercial banks, among which the highest ratio was talliedby First Commercial with a year-end 81.4% ratio of loans to deposits,according to data published in the Commercial Times (8 January 1996).More significantly, only five of the 16 newer private banks tallied pre-tax earnings over 7% on revenues in what was the fourth year ofoperation for most of them.Overall, the new banks earned an average of NTdollars 630 million lastyear and tallied a profitability rating of 5.88%, according to earlydata collected by the vernacular Economic Daily News (5 January 1996).Bank Sinopac was the most profitable bank with 7.83% of pre-taxearnings compared to revenues with a reported NTdollars 807 million innet earnings, followed by the Asia Pacific Bank, E. Sun Bank, TaishinInternational Bank, and the Dah An Commercial Bank.Four other banks scored pre-tax profitability rating over 6%, but sevenfailed to reach this mark, with Bao Dao Commercial reporting the lowestprofitability ratio with 3.52% on NTdollars 352 million in pre-tax netearnings.Noted Professor Yin Nai-ping of the banking department of Taipei'sNational Chengchi University: 'We are now beginning to see thepolarisation of the new banks into those that are well managed andefficient and those that have less healthy management practices,including excessive dealings with affiliates of associated businessgroups.'Banking insiders indicate that banks that played it safe by reducinginvestment in securities and high-risk lending and those that turned toconsumer loans in 1995 came out with more positive results on the year-end balance sheets.The earnings of several new banks were hit hard by the end to write offnon-performing loans, particularly banks that focused lendingstrategies on smaller enterprises and the property sector.According to the Commercial Times (3 January 1996), Union CommercialBank wrote off close to NTdollars 200 million, the Dah An CommercialBank took a hit of about a NTdollars 100 million, and Pan Asia suffereda NTdollars 80 million in bad loans, mostly to corporate clients.On the flip side, a number of banks improved their balance sheetsmarkedly by shifting the focus of lending strategy to individual andconsumer loans.Huang Yungjen, general manager of E. Sun Bank, said ESB's share ofloans to corporations and individuals had shifted from about 60:40 inprevious years to 55:45% last year and that the target is half-and-halfin 1996.'The consumer lending market is mature here given the per capita incomeof over USdollars 10,000, and in relatively poor economic conditions,extending more consumer loans is a good way to disperse risk,' Huangnoted, adding that 'we can put more effort on corporate loans when theeconomy improves'.Huang said ESB also gained through a management priority on loan'quality over quantity.' While the non-performing loan ratio for the 16new banks averaged 3.15% by October 1995, ESB had a 1.9% ratio, thanksin part to diversification to consumer lending and close riskmanagement of major clients with loans over NTdollars 50 million withassigned staff and a headquarters computer database.Huang also noted that ESB gained by playing the stock marketcautiously. 'We held down the investments by our trust department tobetween NTdollars 100-200 million and ended up losing only aboutNTdollars 30 million, compared to other private banks that lost as muchas NTdollars 200 million,' Huang said.Yet despite the growing scale of the new banks, Chien Hung-Tao, generalmanager of Hua Nan, maintains that they do not yet pose a major threat.'As the new banks are under strong pressure from shareholders to turnprofits and as they bear higher costs, they cannot use low lendingrates to compete with us nor can they compete in terms of foreignexchange services,' Chien noted.Where the state-owned banks are feeling the heat from the new privatebanks is in personnel. 'Service attitude at the new banks is clearlybetter because they steal good employees from us,' complained anotherexecutive in a top three state-owned bank. A key concern for state-owned banks is whether a draft law allowing them greater flexibility inpersonnel management will be passed this year.For the new year, local bankers express cautious optimism. A forecastissued by the Central Bank of China in late December anticipates thatconsumer and investor confidence will revive after Taiwan's firstdirect Presidential election on 23 March, and with continued strongexport growth and accelerated public infrastructure spending in thesecond half, maintain a moderate 6.48% economic growth rate in 1996.But analysts note that the new year contains a number of majorpolitical uncertainties, mostly focused around the Presidentialelection. While incumbent President Lee Teng-hui of the rulingKuomintang is favoured by most pundits to win the poll, the processwill also entail two potential cabinet reshuffles.As a new legislature was elected in early December, Lee has to appointa premier in February for approval by the new Legislative Yuan, but thewinner of the presidential poll will also need to name a premier aswell, probably by May.Moreover, as the Kuomintang's majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuanwas reduced to a handful (85 seats), the new legislative environmentwill be less predictable and the weight of the grassroots oppositionDemocratic Progressive Party (53 seats) and the right-wing New Party(21 seats) on financial policy more evident.Not the least of bankers' concerns is whether mainland Chinese leaderswill move to moderate the current hard-line stance toward Taipei,particularly if Lee, who has been pilloried in the controlled mainlandpress, is elected.ESB's Huang Yung-jen noted that his bank's targets for 1996 are setconservatively 'as there are a large number of uncertainties'.'As the government tries to implement the plans to turn Taiwan into anAsia-Pacific regional operating and financial centre, the pace ofinternationalisation will accelerate as will the competitive pressurefrom foreign banks,' Huang noted.'Expectations are that the economy won't be worse than last year, butalso not much better,' Huang said. 'Many say that conditions mayimprove after the Presidential election and that relations withmainland China will settle down afterward, but this remains to be seen.'So we will retain a conservative approach and work to maintain thequality of loans, improve the effectiveness of capital use, and putmore stress on consumer loans and other products for the individualmarket to lower overall risk.'1996 will be a key year for a number of new banks, particularly asthree, Grand Commercial, Dah An and the Chinese Bank, will becomeeligible to apply for listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange next year.But TSE regulations also require that companies hoping to list as afirst grade stock must maintain pre-tax earnings to revenue ratios ofover 6% during the two years before application and that the latteryear's profit rate must be higher.Of the three, Dah An and the Chinese Bank both attained earnings over6% (7.2% and 6.41%, respectively), and plan to better this performancein 1996.However, Grand Commercial, which only tallied a 4.2% profit rate onNTdollars 530 million in pre-tax earnings, will only be able to applyfor second-class listing, even if it attains its ambitious target ofNTdollars 988 million in earnings this year. The remaining banks areunder no less pressure to attain this earnings rate during the comingtwo years.Roger Chuang, executive vice-president of the Grand Commercial Bank,said: 'We hope that after the Presidential election the overallenvironment will improve and the stock market will revive. withcontinued strong traditional business and improvement in non-coreareas, we should boost our earnings up to NTdollars 988 million.'New private banks' deposits and loans(NTdollars billion)                            Deposits  % change  Loans  % changeGrand Commercial Bank         77.1       33%     70.4     30%Dah An Commercial Bank        68.9       26%     68.8     26%Union Commercial Bank         73.8       28%     68.0     23%The Chinese Bank              72.5       21%     70.6     20%Far Eastern Int'Bank          54.0       33%     52.4     23%Asia Pacific Bank             66.4       25%     54.5     19%Bank SinoPac                  75.6       42%     68.2     34%E Sun Bank                    82.7       37%     73.9     35%Cosmos Bank                   82.6       24%     75.9     19%Pan Asia Commercial Bank      66.7       14%     65.0     20%Chung Hsing Bank              66.4       26%     65.7     23%Taishin Intern'l Bank         80.6       38%     73.5     27%Fubon Commercial Bank         69.3       16%     66.5     21%Our Bank                      70.6       28%     67.1     30%Bao Dao Commercial Bank       72.2       29%     65.7     34%En Tie Commercial Bank        52.0       46%     50.6     34%USdollars = NTdollars 27.4) As of 31 December 1995Source:  Bureau of Monetary Affairs, Ministry of Finance;Economic Daily NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996TAIWAN: STORM DAMAGETaiwan's financial authorities offered a draft programme to strengthenthe supervision of monetary institutions as part of an effort torebuild confidence in the island's financial sector in late December.It had been racked by several scandals in the latter half of 1995, oneof which led to the censure of the central bank governor.The series of scandals began in late July with a NTdollars 20 billionrun on the Changhua City Fourth Credit Co-operative after exposure ofembezzlement by its general manager for stock speculation thatultimately led to the co-operative's absorption into the Taiwan Co-operative Bank (TCB). Since then, a number of farmers associations'credit branches have also experienced bank runs.No sooner had this storm calmed than a NTdollars 10 billion run hit theTaipei-based International Bills Finance Co (IBFC) in early August inthe wake of the arrest of a 29-year-old IBFC dealer on charges offorgery and embezzlement in another stock market speculation scandal,which included the state-run Bank of Taiwan among its victims.In early December, the private Overseas Chinese Bank (OCB), in whichthe finance ministry is the largest stockholder with 14.7%, suffered arun of over NTdollars 10 billion when local media reported that a bankshareholder had allegedly borrowed more than NTdollars 6 billionwithout adequate collateral.Former OCB executive director Liang Po-hsun, a construction tycoon, wasforced to resign his executive post in the wake of the scandal and thebank was stabilised with the aid of a rescue package by local banks,but may face prosecution.Although the impact of these events has so far been limited, theiroccurrence has sparked official and private concern for the health ofthe financial system and criticism of alleged slow reaction and poorsupervision on the part of monetary authorities.In September, the Executive Yuan (cabinet) approved administrativepunishments for 54 officials in connection with the Changhua and IBFCscandals, including Deputy Finance Minister Chen Mu-tsai and DeputyCentral Bank of China Governor Chin Cheng-hsiung.The Control Yuan, the highest government watchdog organ, followed byvoting on 29 December to censure Central Bank of China Governor SheuYuan-tung and six other acting or retired officials of the Bank ofTaiwan for the IBFC affair. Moreover, Premier Lien Chan instructed thefinance ministry and the central bank to develop a plan to intensifymonitoring of the island's over 4,000 financial institutions. On 28December, Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo and Central Bank of ChinaGovernor Sheu Yuan-dong issued a draft programme to intensifyinspection and monitoring of over 4,000 financial institutions anddealing with financial crises through a new division of monitoringresponsibilities among the finance ministry, the central bank, theCentral Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) and local governments.Under the plan, the Taiwan Co-operative Bank will no longer supervisebasic level financial institutions, such as credit co-operatives orfarmers and credit branches of fishermen's associations.From 1 July 1996, the CDIC will monitor such institutions which havejoined the insurance deposit programme, and local governments (namely,the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taipei City and KaohsiungCity) will be responsible for supervising non-CDIC member institutionsin their districts.Responsibility for monitoring and crisis management over the island'sbanks (including overseas branches) will be divided as follows:* The Ministry of Finance will monitor new commercial banks establishedafter 1991 and the state-managed Farmers' Bank of China, the Chang HwaCommercial Bank and the Taiwan Enterprise Bank;* The Central Bank of China will supervise the rest of the domesticbanking sector, including the state-run Chiao Tung Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China, the Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of Taiwan, theTCB, the Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the First Commercial Bank, and theInternational Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).Lin stated that, beginning 1 July 1996, branches of foreign banksoriginating in Europe, the Americas and Africa will be inspected by thefinance ministry, while the remainder will be monitored by the centralbank.The finance ministry will monitor the entire insurance sector, whilethe central bank will oversee inspection of all bills financecompanies.Lin also said that the deputy finance minister and deputy CBC governorwill jointly head a MOF-CBC financial inspection oversight committeethat will be empowered to adjust the method and rate of inspections.Lin added that top executives of financial institutions will berequired to attend inspection meetings and that the finance ministrywill push to have internal auditors responsible not to management butto the boards of directors or examiners to improve the quality ofinternal auditing.Lin also stated that his ministry would propose a new law to separatethe credit function from the island's farmers and fishermen'sassociation to bring these operations under the inspection system.Sheu added that 'this is not a division of powers but an arrangement toenhance the effectiveness of inspection and monitoring'.'This is the first stage of improvement of the monitoring andinspection system,' Sheu said. 'After a year or two, we will review tomake further improvements.'Lin said that both agencies agreed that 'establishing an unitary agencyfor monetary inspection is not feasible at present'.In the meantime, prospects for passage by the Legislative Yuan of aproposed statute to liberalise the personnel management of state-runbanks remain dim, he noted.Hua Nan Commercial Bank General Manager Chien Hung-tao said thescandals serve as 'a warning that banks need to continuously upgrademanagement practices'.'The Changhua City co-operative case was clearly one of wrong-doing bytop management, while the IBFC scandal was created by a working-leveltrader,' Chien noted. 'Obviously internal auditing and managementstructures need to be strengthened in all banks.'Chien added that Hua Nan was now adopting a policy of moving employeesto new posts every two to three years and urging branch managers toheighten awareness. 'Times are no longer so relaxed as before and youcan't blindly trust employees,' he warned. One banking analyst notedthat the finance ministry feels that 'it would be very difficult to getstatutes on firewalls to control affiliated trading between financialunits of conglomerates passed by the Legislative Yuan now as suchproposals would spark sharp opposition from the private banks'.However, the analyst related that the finance ministry and central bank'are already surveying conglomerate assets and their utilisationquietly, even if they will not release such information openly'.'But if the banking and other laws aren't revised, such problems willcontinue to haunt the financial system,' he warned.A watershed may occur, for good or ill, shortly as many analystsanticipate a major reshuffling of the finance ministry and central bankwhen a new cabinet is appointed.President Lee Teng-hui is obliged to appoint a new premier in earlyFebruary in response to last December's election of a new LegislativeYuan, but any premier confirmed by the legislature in February willplay a caretaker role through Taiwan's first direct Presidentialelection on 23 March, after which the new president will have theoption of naming a new premier.In the meantime, depositors may be finding their own solution touncertainty. According to central bank data, basic financialinstitutions lost nearly NTdollars 175 billion in deposits from Augustto November last year, while deposits in the island's postal savingssystem rose over NTdollars 83 billion since July to reach a recordNTdollars 1.94 trillion by des lower interest rates.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996TAIWAN: SIX FOR THE HIGH JUMPThe government's highest supervisory body, the Control Yuan, decided tocensure Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong and five otherserving or former officials of the central bank and the Bank of Taiwanin connection with the International Bills Finance Co (IBFC) scandallast December.The Control Yuan's impeachment case said that Sheu, who was Bank ofTaiwan chairman until last May, mismanaged personnel relating to theBoT trust department and did not exercise proper control over the trustunit.The Control Yuan brief stated that such mismanagement had sown theseeds for the subsequent scandal as the former IBFC trader Yang Jui-yenillegally borrowed NTdollars 39 billion from the BoT trust department.Sheu declared that he would not resign, and he and the five otherpersons impeached denied the charges. 'There are many misunderstandingsand claims not in accordance with fact (in the impeachment),' saidSheu, who said he will put his case to The Committee on the Disciplineof Public Functionaries of the Judicial Yuan, which will now considerthe degree of punishment.Professor Yin Nai-ping of the Department of Banking at Taipei'sNational Chengchi University said the impeachment amounts to accounting'to the public for the flurry of financial scandals'.Yin noted that Sheu would probably not be faced with a severe penalty'as he was not directly involved in the IBFC case and in fact thecentral bank and the finance ministry coped with that scandalrelatively effectively'. He aded: 'But it will definitely hurt hisreputation.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ASIA NOTES: CHINA'S MARKET LAUNCHChina passed another important financial landmark on 1 January, withthe launch of its unified interbank market.The new system, being operated by the Foreign Exchange Trading Centrein Shanghai, enables local banks and financial institutions to lend oraccept short-term deposits of one day up to less than four months.It is using the same computer network as the foreign exchange market,linking 35 cities in China. On the first day of trading it linked 27cities.'It is a very important step forward with respect to China's financialreforms,' comments Benny Chiu, research manager of HongkongBank ChinaServices. He believes all the local banks and financial institutions,such as investment and trust companies, will use the new market.Stanley Wong, treasurer of Standard Chartered Bank in Hongkong,believes that the development of the interbank market system and ofstabilised interest rates will enable a yield curve to be established,which will in turn enable a forward market for the renminbi to bedeveloped.Foreign banks are barred from doing renminbi business and so do nothave access to the new interbank market.Until now China has had regional interbank markets with differingoperations and mechanisms. The Shanghai market was estimated to havehandled R200 billion (dollars 24 billion)of transactions last year.Chiu explains that the new national market provides more structure andformality by unifying the regional markets under the same regulationsand operations. It will also provide more market-based interest rates.On 1 April, The People's Bank of China will start open marketoperations formally, by which it will be able to offer interest ratesand control money supply.This will enable the authorities to exercise macro-economic control ofthe implementation of monetary policy, says Chiu.Wong explains that, prior to the new system, local banks in China havetended to lend or borrow among themselves on a city-by-city basis or ona bilateral basis, lending and passing on surpluses or liquidity amongthemselves at bilaterally agreed interest rates.Difficulties arose in moving liquidity from one city to another. Forexample, a shortage in Shanghai could not be readily met by a surplusin Beijing.This resulted in a disparity in interest rates, which ranged between 10-15%.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ASIA NOTES: INDONESIA WIDENS BANDBank Indonesia (central bank), in a further liberalisation ofIndonesia's currency, widened the band within which the rupiah would befreely traded from early January. The Bank has also issued guidelinesfor a new regulation allowing banks to do derivatives transactions inforeign exchange and interest rates, but not in securities and bonds.The rupiah now trades within a 3% range in the intervention band, upfrom 2%, that is, about 66 rupiah around an announced mid-rate, set byBank Indonesia against a basket of currencies. The Bank has alsocreated an inner 2% 'convergence' band, effectively within the 3% band,for transactions with the finance ministry and government.Bank Indonesia's recent band widening is the latest in a series whichbegan in December 1993. The shift creates more autonomy and flexibilityfor the implementation of monetary policy.Bank Indonesia is also pursuing a policy of depreciating the rupiah tothe US dollar by 4-5% a year to maintain export competiveness, sincethe country still has a big current account deficit estimated by thegovernment at dollars 7.94 billion in fiscal 1995-96, or about 3.8% ofgross domestic product.John Flint, treasury manager with Hongkong and Shanghai BankingCorporation in Indonesia, comments that, given that interest rates inother Asian countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia, have come downquite aggressively so far this year, 'the chances are that peoplelooking for yield enhancement trades will move a little bit more to therupiah now.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ASIA NOTES: WELCOME TO BURMAThe Burmese military government announced in late December that it willallow foreign banks with representative offices in Rangoon, thecapital, to set up joint ventures with private Burmese banks. It isreported that foreign banks would have to provide at least 35% of theequity capital.The invitation seems to have met with a lukewarm response from mostforeign banks in the country. Foreign bank sources say that most of the22 foreign banks with representative offices would prefer to have fullbranch operations.Standard Chartered Bank, while looking at the options available, has noimmediate plans to do anything more than run its representative office,says John Brinsden, resident director for institutional banking for thesub-region.Brinsden believes that the Burmese government's move in allowing jointventures with foreign banks is 'the first step down the road to theireventually allowing foreign banks to actually run full branches there -but that could be another two years or so.'Besides the 22 foreign banks that already have representative offices,a further 10 have been issued licences to open such offices. Of the 32banks, most originate from Asia. The rest include four French banks;Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered from theUK; and Bank of Nova Scotia from Canada.Burma has two state-owned banks, 11 non-exchange private banks and fourexchange private banks. Government related agents account for a largenumber of the shareholders in the four exchange private banks.The biggest constraint on growth and foreign investment remains therepressive military government, which in November rejected requests bythe opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by Aung SanSuu Kyi, for dialogue in a constitutional convention. Burma's rulingmilitary junta has consistently refused to recognise the results of the1990 general elections, in which the NLD won 80% of the vote.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996MACAU: BEIJING BOUNTYLike Hongkong, Macau is an anomaly in Asia. The enclave, on the SouthChina coast, represents one of the last two vestiges of Europeancolonialism in the Chinese empire. In less than 18 months' time it willbe the last such outpost, as the sovereignty of Hongkong returns toChina.Macau's own transition back to Chinese rule will not occur until 1999and most observers agree that this will be far smoother than even themost optimistic predictions for Hongkong's return to the MiddleKingdom.These political developments will have repercussions on the bankingsectors of the two regions and on individual banks. The most pressingcredit risks of banks in Hongkong are derived from their vulnerabilityto uncertainties surrounding the upcoming transition. Macau banks arelikely to be indirectly affected and this will become one of the mostsignificant issues for the banks in the coming years.As a regional and international financial centre, Macau has beenconclusively overshadowed by the breathtaking growth of Hongkong. Incontrast to the British authorities in the territory, which adopted alaissez-faire policy with regard to financial and banking affairs,Portugal restricted banks from operating in the enclave, at least until1982.During that year, the monetary authorities in Macau implemented a newbanking law which eased restrictions on foreign banks setting up shopin the enclave and in the following five years, about 10 such banksopened branches. At the end of 1995, the banking sector comprised sixlocally-incorporated banks and 18 foreign banks. Nevertheless, thedifference in the size of the two banking systems is immense: Macau'stotal banking assets are just 2% the size of Hongkong's.Ironically, China's flagship financial institution, the Bank of China,is by far the largest bank in the enclave, accounting for 33% of thebanking sector's total assets. Moreover, it is the dominant shareholderof the largest locally-incorporated bank, Tai Fung Bank.The growing presence of the Bank of China in Macau reflects the closerties between the mainland and the enclave in the lead-up to 1999. Thiswas further manifested on 16 October, 1995 when the Bank of China beganissuing Macau bank notes. Until then, Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU),the enclave's de facto central bank, was the only bank to perform suchan activity. In the wake of this landmark note issue, the Bank of Chinais expected to play a wider role in Macau's monetary affairs, in muchthe same manner that it has and continues to do so in Hongkong.Banks in Macau share many of the same strengths and weaknesses aslocally-incorporated Hongkong banks. They enjoy strong profits derivedlargely from handsome earnings on their mortgage lending activities.With the property market at this stage reasonably strong andcharacterised by a low level of defaults, they have been able to boaststrong asset quality. At the same time, however, the banks in Macauexhibit a noticeable lack of diversification in their assets.Like their Hongkong counterparts, they are engaged overwhelmingly injust two business activities: trade finance and property-relatedlending. This has been accentuated by the flight of variousmanufacturing concerns to South China in search of lower operatingcosts. Therefore, while their asset quality now may be strong, theunderlying quality of their assets is quite weak and renders themvulnerable to a change in the fortunes of the property market. Thisissue will become particularly salient in light of both Hongkong's andMacau's sovereign transition.As a consequence of the oversupply of residential apartments in Macau,local banks have been continuing their expansion into South China,principally through trade finance and syndicated lending, and this hasseen their risk exposures to the region correspondingly rise. Theproportion of China-related credits on Macau banks' books is alsolikely to increase in line with growing integration between the enclaveand the mainland and a potential easing of China's monetary policy.Although they share many of the same characteristics, banks in Macauare less profitable, less liquid and not as well capitalised as theirHongkong counterparts. Lending accounts for a greater proportion oftheir asset bases, but they have a slightly higher share of loans andadvances geared towards lower risk yet lower yielding trade financing.On a regional scale, their performance as a group, measured by acomposite weighting of their profitability, liquidity and capitaladequacy is only slightly above average*.Further opportunities essentially lie in South China, as will becomeevident, given the limited prospects for expansion locally. This washighlighted in the first three quarters of 1995 with the total loans ofthe banking sector growing by a very subdued 4.5% compared to the sameperiod of 1994.The relationship between banks in Hongkong and Macau go beyond sharedcharacteristics and operating similarities. Macau's pataca is pegged tothe Hongkong dollar and in a few year's time the territory and theenclave will be part of the same sovereign state.In 1983 and 1984, when Sino-British negotiations regarding the futureof Hongkong were at their most tenuous and Hongkong was in the midst ofa recession, this prompted runs on a number of Macau banks.Given that the Hongkong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, Macau'sinterest rate cycle closely follows both Hongkong's and America's. In1994 and most of 1995, this gave rise to a difficult operatingenvironment for local banks, with interest spreads being slightlysqueezed.The close relationship and intricate link between Hongkong and Macauwill clearly be demonstrated over the next two years, with developmentsaffecting banks in Hongkong likely to have a ripple effect on Macaubanks.If the socio-political situation of Hongkong or South China takes aturn for the worse, Macau banks are likely to suffer considerablehardship. This is despite the fact that Macau's own transition toChinese sovereignty is expected to be rather smooth in light of thefact that relations between Beijing and Lisbon have been moreharmonious than those between London and Beijing.Portugal even offered Macau back to Beijing in 1974 after the formerturned socialist. Macau's transition is almost regarded as an aside incomparison to the international attention Hongkong and 1997 isreceiving. The enclave's value in terms of strategic financialperformance is far less than the territory's.Macau banks will be operating in a period of uncertainty in theintermediate term for geopolitical reasons clearly beyond theircontrol. Nevertheless, following an increasingly closer degree ofintegration between the enclave and South China, the banks' assets areset to expand if the economic conditions are ripe. At this stage thereis unlikely to be a sharp shift in the composition of the banks' loanbooks and thus mortgage lending and trade finance will very muchcontinue to characterise their business activities.In this context will be the growing influence of the Bank of China bothin its actual operations in the enclave and greater say in Macau'smonetary affairs. In the meantime, the world is watching eventsunfolding as its high profile neighbour which will undoubtedly have asignificant impact on developments in Macau.*The Best Banks in Asia published by Thomson BankWatch, December 1995.Chris Tang and Andrew Seiz are senior analysts at the Hongkong officeof credit rating agency Thomson BankWatch.Selected industry averages Macao and Hongkong banksHongkong                        1994      1993     1992Return on average assets (%)    2.07      2.06     1.75Return on average equity (%)   21.59     22.36    22.79Leverage (times)                9.30      9.59    10.18Quasi-liquid assets ratio (%)  47.74     48.97    51.38Macau                           1994      1993     1992Return on average assets (%)    1.97      2.05     1.72Return on average equity (%)   29.31     33.89    33.03Leverage (times)               13.50     14.31    17.08Quasi-liquid assets ratio (%)  37.55     31.66    36.53Source:  Boletim Oficial de MacauBanks in Macau31/3/95Patacas million                                   Total      Total        %                                  assets    deposits    changeBank of China                     37,361     26,326       6.6Banco Comercial Portugues         25,285     20,499     266.7Banco Nacional Ultramarino        13,941      7,151      21.3Banco Tai Fung                    12,800     10,398      24.5Banco Portugues do Atlantico      10,722         52     -99.6Banco Seng Heng                    6,716      6,074      39.2Banco Totta & Acores               5,505      2,390     -32.1Banco Comercial de Macau (Asia)    5,319      4,031      13.6Banco Luso Internacional           4,052      3,453      39.6Banco Weng Hang                    3,789      3,103      22.0Hong Kong Banking Corp             3,458      2,885       9.8Banco Delta Asia                   1,873      1,423      18.0Banco Nacional de Paris            1,498        223     -21.5Overseas Trust Bank                  961        883     101.3Guangdong Development Bank           870        423     208.5Banco Citibank                       741        719     -14.7Standard Chartered Bank              632        569     -12.2Banco da America (Macau)             512        335       2.5Deutsche Bank                        469         54     -54.5                                   Total        %    Annualised                                   loans     change    profitBank of China                     15,758       3.04     113.4Banco Comercial Portugues          2,178      -9.30      12.9Banco Nacional Ultramarino         3,550     -12.46      23.8Banco Tai Fung                     5,701      12.03      76.6Banco Portugues do Atlantico       1,077       51.8      12.9Banco Seng Heng                    3,539        5.4      21.8Banco Totta & Acores               1,917       -7.3      16.1Banco Comercial de Macau (Asia)    2,903       18.7      10.2Banco Luso Internacional           2,402       16.8      16.2Banco Weng Hang                    2,091       15.7      20.8Hong Kong Banking Corp             2,363       -2.6      19.5Banco Delta Asia                   1,027       28.1       1.9Banco Nacional de Paris              682       29.2       2.2Overseas Trust Bank                  445       21.5       4.4Guangdong Development Bank           280      136.7       0.1Banco Citibank                         6      -51.8      -0.4Standard Chartered Bank              455       -1.9       3.1Banco da America (Macau)             364       32.7       3.9Deutsche Bank                        444       30.8       2.0dollars = 7.988 patacas (3/95)Source:  Boletim Oficial de MacauMarket share of banks in country of originCountry               % of assetsPortugal                  44.5China                     28.0Macau                     21.8Hongkong                   3.2Other                      2.5Source:  Thomson BankwatchBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996LATIN NOTES: ZEDILLO'S BIG BAILOUTThe loan restructuring at Mexico's leading bank Banamex marks a turningpoint in the Zedillo government's effort to resolve the post-devaluation crisis in the financial system.Proponents of this move view the Banamex agreement as a big step towardending the year-old crisis, but critics fear the deal establishes aprecedent for mushrooming subsidies to the banking industry.At issue is the government's agreement in mid-December to issue 10-yearbonds to Banamex for dollars 2 billion in Banamex loans, acquired bythe official bank deposit insurance agency Fobaproa. Payments on anestimated 43% of the loans sold to Fobaproa were already past due, withmost of the remaining debts classified as high-risk and many expectedto become non-performing during 1996. The Banacci financial group thatcontrols Banamex will increase its capitalisation by dollars 1.1billion during 1996.Even critics of the deal agree that this will enhance the quality ofBanamex's loan portfolio and substantially improve its capital ratio.At the time of the deal, Banamex management estimated that gross past-due loans had increased from Mexdollars 15.3 billion at end-Septemberto more than Mexdollars 17 billion by December. The loan sale toFobaproa reduced the bank's past-due loans by more than a third; theratio of past-due to total loans outstanding fell from 12.8% at end-September to 9% or less.Banamex's commitment to a capital increase should boost its capitaladequacy ratio from 10.4% in December to 15% when recapitalisation iscompleted this year. About half of the dollars 1.1 billion capitalinfusion is expected to be raised through equity and debt issues incapital markets; over dollars 500 million will be generated frominternal funding sources.The biggest concern raised by the Banamex operation is the precedentthat it establishes for expanded federal support for bank restructuringthis year.The quid pro quo of government purchase of troubled loans in exchangefor bank commitments to recapitalisation was established in mid-1995 byfederal agreements to buy dollars 1.5 billion debts from Probursa andSerfin.But the extension of the bank-support programme to the country'slargest - and one of its most financially sound - financialinstitutions signals that all banks will be offered the option ofnegotiating a similar agreement.Banco Mexicano, a financially solid subsidiary of the Invermexicofinancial group, followed Banamex with a deal in late December to selldollars 900 million in loans to Fobaproa and pledge a capital increaseof dollars 500 million by the end of 1996.Questions over the scale of the government's open-ended fiscalcommitment to bank bail-outs will intensify in the wake of the Zedillogovernment's decision to extend the ADE programme - which subsidisesinterest relief for individual and small-business debtors - by threemonths to end-April.About 75% of an estimated 2.1 million problem loans targeted for ADErelief - mainly credit card and mortgage debt - had been restructuredby year-end 1995. The hike in interest rates in the fourth quarter hasmagnified the cost of the subsidy for the fixed concessionary ratesapplied to restructured debts, and the extension appears certain topush ADE costs above the dollars 2.3 billion budgeted.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996LATIN NOTES: BANESPA GOOD HEALTH RECIPEThe Cardoso government's decision to end the year-old federalintervention in Sao Paulo's troubled state bank Banespa provides asymbol of the improving economic and banking outlook for Brazil.While the return of Banespa management to state control marks a setbackfor reformers who favoured outright privatisation, most analysts creditthe Cardoso government for implementing long overdue measures to slashstaffing and restructure assets that have left Brazil's largest statebank in better financial health.The Banespa action in mid-January helped a resurgence in economicconfidence, fuelled by further progress on the government's agenda forsocial security, fiscal and administrative reforms that underpin itsstabilisation and growth programme.A flurry of concern in mid-1995 over deterioration in the currentaccount balance and inflation has faded as the trade account hasreturned to surplus and price growth has slowed. Monthly surpluses inthe second semester narrowed the trade deficit for the first 11 monthsof 1995 to dollars 3.1 billion, while consumer inflation in 1995 fellto a 22-year low at 23.2%.And with international reserves hovering near dollars 50 billion, thereal was holding firm above 0.97 units to the dollar in January.The banking industry should benefit from the improving economicenvironment as stabilisation in current account and inflation trendswidens the central bank's room for easing interest rates lower in 1996.President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's has indicated that he will movecautiously in cutting interest rates. But with GDP growth this yearexpected to approach 5% and minimal risk of an inflation resurgence,banks should show steady growth in lending activity over 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996LATIN NOTES: NOW, WHERE WERE WE?Argentina's commercial banks began this year roughly where they leftoff in December 1994, before the Mexican crisis triggered a plunge inpeso osits as Argentine investors scrambled to protect themselves fromdevaluation risk by seeking safety in dollars.After bottoming out around dollars 37 billion in March 1995, Argentinebank deposits have clawed back lost ground to reach dollars 45.1billion in peso and dollar holdings - about the level on the eve of theMexico scare.Investors' persistent preference for hard currency is evident in thesteady climb of dollar deposits to more than dollars 24 billion, somedollars 3.2 billion higher than peso deposits in the banking system.Industry analysts expect growth in peso and dollar deposits to continueas economic growth recovers, setting the stage for a revival in dormantcorporate lending business by the year end. The fall in consumerinflation to less than 2% in 1995 points to further decline in interestrates from their March 1995 peak.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996MEXICO: NO EASY RECIPEQ The Mexican government has built an extensive - and costly - safetynet of programmes to prevent the considerable liquidity and assetquality blems of the banking industry over the past year triggering awider crisis in the financial system.What has been the level of government financial assistance to the banksover the past year and how much will it need to allocate to supportprogrammes in 1996? Also, how would you characterise the government'scurrent policy on bank intervention, especially in the light of recentmoves regarding Inverlat and Banamex?A Preventing or containing a financial crisis is not an end in itself.The ultimate goal of the authorities should always be the protection ofthe real sector of the economy and, thereby, the welfare of thepopulation. However, an immediate objective is maintaining andstrengthening the financial system, which has the banking system at itscore. This is essential to enable banks to efficiently perform theirmain role, credit intermediation, without which the functioning of anymodern economy would be impossible.Managing financial crises is never easy, nor susceptible to recipes ofgeneral application. However, there are some basic principles to beobserved, among which the following must be included: preventing thedevelopment of systemic risk; avoiding an unwarranted expansion ofcentral bank credit; shunning political and other pressures to bail outstockholders of financial institutions while, at the same time,protecting the legitimate interests of both creditors and borrowers;minimising the fiscal costs that may be inherent to the policiesadopted to overcome the crisis and, if feasible, distributing thesecosts over a number of years, and interfering the least possible withthe normal functioning of markets.In order to deal with the impact of the December 1994 devaluation oncommercial banks a comprehensive package was adopted and is currentlybeing applied. The components of the package are the following: adollar liquidity facility; a temporary capitalisationprogramme(PROCAPTE); adoption of the Investment Unit (UDI) scheme tomanage the problem of accelerated, and not contractually foreseen,amortisation of credits in real terms caused by inflation; easing ofsome restrictions concerning participation in the capital of commercialbanks in order to attract new investors, both foreign and domestic;acquisition of a fraction of banks' loan portfolios in a two to oneratio of new capital paid in by stockholders, so as to provide anincentive for banks to maintain adequate levels of provisions andcapitalisation; strengthening of supervision; and a debtor supportprogramme(ADE) to encourage additional loan restructuring, prevent thedevelopment of non-payment practices, provide interest relief and offera legal truce to debtors.The projected fiscal cost represents a net present value of Mexdollars90.8 billion (dollars 12.1 billion), equivalent to 5.5% of estimatedGDP for 1995. The fiscal cost of the ADE programme in 1995 was absorbedvia the application of a fraction of the fiscal surplus generated inthat year. The remainder, an amount which in net present value terms isequivalent to 4.7% of 1995's expected GDP, will be generated graduallythroughout the life of the programmes. A portion of this cost will befinanced by the commercial banks themselves.Direct intervention in troubled institutions has been limited to a fewcases. Recourse to this sort of action by the National Banking andSecurities Commission takes place only to the extent that otheroptions, such as merger or outright sale, are viable at all or within areasonable term. Banks' stockholders lose their investment, or seetheir participation diluted, should the state, through FOBAPROA, becomean owner. In that eventuality, FOBAPROA would only be a temporary owneras it would immediately proceed to find new suitable shareholders.Q Monetary policy has been the focus of considerable controversy anddebate over the past year. Some complain that an excessively tightpolicy threatens to deepen the recession, others feel the fall in theCetes (Treasury Bill) rate last September may have been too rapid.What are the primary objectives for monetary policy in 1996 and whatbenchmarks has the Banco de Mexico established for money supply growth?A As stated in the Law of Banco de Mexico, the primary objective ofmonetary policy is price stability. Consequently, it is imperative thatmonetary policy in 1996 be aimed at fostering the convergence of thepublic's inflation expectations towards the objective announced by thegovernment. To this end, central bank policy should be defined in termsof a variable under its control and which the public can easilymonitor. For 1996, as in the previous year, Banco de Mexico decided toset a limit on the increase of its net domestic assets. It is expectedthat the expansion of the demand for base money in 1996 will be in theorder of Mexdollars 18 billion. The needed growth of the supply of basemoney will originate from the accumulation of net internationalreserves and a maximum increase of Mexdollars 15 billion in netdomestic assets of the central bank.In its monetary programme for 1996, a widely distributed document,Banco de Mexico announced quarterly limits on the growth of its netdomestic assets.These limits take into account the seasonal behaviour of the demand forbase money and the expected path of net international reservesaccumulation.It must be stressed that in accordance with the stabilisation programmeadopted by Mexico, monetary policy, combined with other measures takenby the Federal Government, has been geared towards attaining, amongothers, two very important objectives: a steady reduction of theinflation rate and lower interest rates. The latter, however, will notbe achieved by artificial means but rather as a consequence ofgenerating expectations of declining inflation. It is a mistake tocompare, as some analysts do, the level of the Cetes rate in the mostrecent primary auction (about 41%) with the rate of past annualinflation observed at end-year 1995. It is prospective inflation thatmatters. If the market expects lower inflation in the future, it isonly natural for nominal interest rates to fall.Q The Zedillo government established a 1996 consumer inflation targetof 20.5% and GDP growth target of 3% in the document accompanying thefederal budget last November. Do you see the inflation target asrealistic and how will the central bank balance the conflicting demandsof curbing inflation and stimulating growth during 1996?A Mexico's experience, in line with those of many other countries,confirms that monetary policy makes its best contribution to economicgrowth and employment when it is aimed at achieving price stability.Banco de Mexico will assuredly contribute its full efforts in order toaccomplish the economic programme's 20.5% annual inflation objective.Nonetheless, having an explicit inflation target does not necessarilyimply that the central bank is making a projection of future pricebehaviour. It is a well-known fact that a central bank cannot directlycontrol changes in the general price level. Its influence overinflation is indirect, through the effects of its actions on aggregatedemand. Furthermore, there are several variables, not under theinfluence of central banks, which have a marked incidence on thebehaviour of prices. In sum, the proper monetary policy is a necessaryand useful, although not sufficient condition to ensure the attainmentof an inflation target.To the extent that the average exchange rate in 1996 coincides withthat included in the programme, and indirect taxes, prices of goods andservices produced by the public sector, foreign inflation, andinternational prices of raw materials remain roughly in line with theprojections in the economic programme, an annual inflation of 20.5% iswithin reach. At any rate, the monetary programme was designed on thebasis of the 20.5% inflation assumption and will not be modified.Q The peso's devaluation of more than 120% from December 1994 to yearend 1995 has ushered in a sweeping overhaul in exchange rate policy.What is the Banco de Mexico's current exchange rate policy, whatcriteria will guide future interventions and to what extent will theBank permit the peso to depreciate during 1996 especially with thegovernment's stated goal of an average exchange rate of 7.7 new pesosto the dollars?A On 22 December, 1994 Mexico adopted a floating exchange rate regime.From mid- March to October 1995, Banco de Mexico did not intervene inthe foreign exchange market. However, during the last two months ofthat year it did so four times in order to reduce unwarrantedvolatility in the market.Like most central banks, Banco de Mexico recognises that occasionalinterventions may be necessary to smooth out erratic movements in theexchange rate. Sporadic interventions do not mean that Banco de Mexicohas a real exchange rate objective. The market determines the exchangerate and, therefore, the latter is by definition an equilibrium rate.In that sense, the exchange rate can be neither undevalued norovervalued.In order to present the 1996 Budget to Congress, which includes itemsdenominated in foreign currency, the government had to have an estimateof the average nominal exchange rate for the year. However, thisestimate, 7.7 pesos per dollar, should not be interpreted as a goal. Itis not a revealed specific support level for the peso which the centralbank is bound to defend.Q Do you believe that the existing central bank law goes far enough inestablishing and protecting the Banco de Mexico's role as anindependent monetary authority?A In August 1993, Congress approved an amendment to the MexicanConstitution whereby the central bank was granted autonomy. The new lawfor Banco de Mexico was passed and came into effect on 1 April 1994.For autonomy to be effective, the central bank must have control overall of its credit operations. Thus, the Constitution states that noauthority may order Banco de Mexico to grant financing, either throughcredit of any sort or through acquisition of assets.One of the foundations of the autonomy of Banco de Mexico is theindependence of judgment of the persons responsible for conducting thebank's affairs. Thus, its administration has been entrusted to a five-member board chaired by a governor. The governor is named for a six-year term starting at the beginning of the fourth calendar year of thesix-year presidential term, while the four deputy governors areappointed for overlapping eight-year terms, each one being designatedevery two years.Thus, the composition of the board assures the stability and continuityof policy that is brought about by a long-term perspective in thesetting of policy. Board members can only be removed for reasons ofserious offence, as defined in the law.Existing central bank legislation in Mexico indeed goes far enough inprotecting the central bank's role as an independent monetaryauthority.Critics should read the pertinent Mexican legislation and modify theircharacterisation of Banco de Mexico as an institution subservient tothe federal government's economic and political interests.Those who claim that in spite of the respective legal provisionsautonomy has not been effective in practice bear the burden of proof.Such assertions overlook the fact that for a long period Banco deMexico has not granted net financing to the federal government.At times, critics seem to argue that central bank autonomy means havingthe power to select the exchange rate regime. In Mexico, as in nearlyall countries, that decision rests on the government.Q Do you believe that present international support (from the US, IMF,World Bank and other institutions) is sufficient to preserve exchangerate and broader economic stabilisation during 1996?A In the weeks following the December 1994 devaluation, financialmarkets reacted violently, as fears mounted that the government andother borrowers would not comply with payments to non-residents due inthe short-term.Mexico's crisis had immediate effects upon several markets, mainly inLatin America, and there was a serious risk of systemic repercussions.The gravity of the situation called for exceptional internationalassistance. Thus, a financial package was put together with the help ofthe United States, Canada, the International Monetary Fund and the Bankfor International Settlements. This package has allowed Mexico tocomply with its obligations and has thus facilitated the stabilisationof financial markets. To date, Mexico has drawn dollars 20.8 billiondollars net, far less than originally estimated, and in all likelihoodwill not need additional support. As early as May 1995, renewedpossibilities for placing Mexican paper in international markets haveemerged and are gradually increasing.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996GHANA: RERUN THE GOLD RUSHLong known mainly for its gold and cocoa exports, Ghana hasrestructured and diversified its economy enough to go from backwater tobona fide emerging market in ten years.In a business climate that is already flourishing by Africa's humblestandards, new opportunities are arising in what is being called thecontinent's most ambitious privatisation effort. The Jerry Rawlingsgovernment is working closely with the World Bank to sell off thecountry's largest bank, two smaller ones it also owns, and other keystate assets in communications, transport, insurance and other sectors.No matter how much promotion is done, no one expects it will be easy toconvince potential buyers to invest in Africa. But the run-up isnevertheless providing extensive advisory work for the handful ofstrong privately owned banks that already exist in Ghana. Add the heavydemand for financing that the country's private banks already face,plus the related business they see via the small but growing localstock market, and you have a serious operational challenge for thepeople who run them.The busy environment has begun attracting experienced internationaltalent to Accra, where a decade of sustained 5% annual gross domesticproduct (GDP) growth has brought Mercedes SLs, satellite dishes andcellular phones popping up alongside the more traditional trappings ofAfrican life.In have come people like CJ Best, a veteran US banker who arrived in1994 to manage CAL Merchant Bank under the auspices of an internationalpublic/private sector co-operative venture called the AfricanManagement Services Co. (AMSCO). 'It's an exciting time to be here,' hesaid. 'The whole economy has become much more dynamic. Ghana has thepotential to become a focal point for all of Anglophone West Africa.'From headquarters in Amsterdam just across from the ING tower, AMSCOuses a combination of government and corporate funds to help owners ofpromising African companies locate new full-time managers with the hard-to-find skills they need. It then provides them with training grantsand networking opportunities throughout their contracts to help buildcompetitiveness in their firms.CAL was launched by a private Ghanaian group that had IFC financing in1990 when the government first allowed private competition in banking.Since then it has built up dollars 39.4 million in assets and stronglocal market shares in trade finance, capital markets and advisoryservices. It needed a general manager who could build it into aninstitution that top clients in New York and London would use.For that AMSCO found them Best, who had specialised in African financefor more than 20 years at Chase Manhattan, the New York branch ofUnited Bank for Africa, and elsewhere. His job is to help build CAL'sgrowth into the international merchant bank of choice at a time whenGhana is poised to attract additional private investment from abroad.He plans to devote much of 1996 to giving all his employeescomprehensive training through resources provided by AMSCO's ManagementDevelopment Fund, whose donors include bilateral aid agencies from theUS and Europe, and hopefully turn the bank into a globally competitiveinstitution that will set a precedent for Ghana and all of Africa.'A lot of my work involves training by example, both on questions ofoverall management and specific needs such as credit analysis, all thevarious elements of risk and so on,' he said.'We've historically provided a lot of letters of credit to Ghanaiancompanies, and now are building up a corporate finance group thatshould be at full strength in about 12 months.'CAL is a rarity in Ghanaian banking in that it has no governmentownership.It and the other local niche players which deal with an internationalclientele such as Ecobank, Databank, and the local affiliates ofBarclays and Standard Chartered, have a unique vantage point on theplanned privatisation of the country's largest financial institutions.They are closely involved in plans to prepare larger competitors forsale under contracts funded by the World Bank, which recently said thesmall private banks were 'more adept and efficient at financialintermediation' than those the government owns.Topping the for-sale list is Ghana Commercial Bank, the country'slargest with dollars 141 million in Tier One capital, almost half ofthe country's banking assets, and an established internationalpresence.Two smaller domestic lenders, Social Security Bank and NationalInvestment Bank, also are on the block. The idea is to bring thegovernment shareholding down to 40% in each case, with 30% being listedon the stock exchange and another 30% going to a foreign strategicpartner who can bring in new management sophistication and aninternational network to support the country's growing export strengthsin gold, timber, cocoa and other commodities.All three banks could spell interesting opportunities if offered at theright price. But investors are wary of 1994's 70% inflation and 40%currency devaluation against the dollar, and few international bankshave shown interest lately in buying minority stakes in emergingmarkets. Except for South Africa, they seem unwilling to take onAfrica's risks, especially in the wake of the Meridian-BIAO collapse.That leaves much promotional work for the World Bank-funded advisoryteams.Best's team at CAL, for example, is working with Johannesburg-basedNedcor and KPMG Peat Marwick to get National Investment Bank ready forsale.Another South African institution, Standard Bank, is working withCoopers & Lybrand on a similar effort for Social Security Bank, whileCredit Commercial de France and Price Waterhouse are working on GhanaCommercial Bank. No one yet knows if any eventual buyers can beattracted from Europe, Asia, the US, South Africa, or anywhere else, orwhat sort of incentive packages they might require.'If any place in Africa outside of South Africa is attractive tointernational commercial banks, Ghana would be,' said World Bankfinancial sector specialist Elie Saleeby. 'But the question is whethertheir strategic plans leave them in a mood for buying anywhere.'The privatisations are intended to be the crowning achievement of theFinancial Sector Adjustment Programme (FINSAP), a restructuring effortthat has received dollars 200 million of World Bank funding since 1987.It has prompted big changes in Ghana's state-run institutions,including a cleaning up of balance sheets through transfer of non-performing public and private sector assets to a government trust,reform of daily operations and introduction of new prudentialregulations.'Noteworthy achievements have been made in Ghana,' Saleeby said. 'It isa financial sector where significant efficiencies have been introduced,although there is still more to be done. It's emerging fast, and likeall emerging markets there will be hiccups from time to time. But thegreatest challenge is to maintain momentum, and they've done a fairlygood job of maintaining it so far.'The goal is to get Ghana's leading banks up to international standards.The World Bank argues that can only come with the participation of topinternational partners as core investors. Emerging market bank watcherssay such transactions can be a good way for the host institution toobtain valuable capital, access to new management, and globaloperational links that it cannot get at home.Polish export finance specialist BRE, for example, sold a 21% stake toCommerzbank a year ago, thus gaining 'a leg up on its domestic andinternational competition' and a reputation as 'the most innovativePolish bank' in the view of Creditanstalt Investment Bank analysts. INGand Allied Irish Bank hold similarly sized chunks of other Polishbanks, and in December GE Capital Services paid dollars 87 million fora controlling 32.5% stake in Hungary's Budapest Bank, which CreditSuisse had considered but then rejected a year earlier.That, though, was Europe. Africa may be of far less interest tostrategic investors of that calibre from Western Europe and the US,perhaps opening a door for banks from South African banks to buy theirway into Ghana. How much it would cost is unknown, but sources close tothe process say the transactions could take another year or more toconclude, and may require deferred payment plans of other sizeableincentives. The Rawlings government has meanwhile already floated 30%of Social Security Bank on the local stock exchange, and now may do thesame with the two other banks on its list.Meanwhile, CS First Boston and Ecobank have also just begun World Bank-funded advisory work on the upcoming privatisation of Ghana Telecom,set to be the biggest divestiture since 1994's dollars 450 million saleof part of the state holding in Ashanti Goldfields to portfolioinvestors through a GDR and local capital market issue. Ghana Airwaysand the Tema oil refinery are also set for sale. It all adds up to bigbusiness for the country's few private banks.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996BARCLAYS TESTS BARCLAYZONEBarclays Bank has launched a three-month pilot to test the acceptanceof an interactive share dealing branch system. The touch-screenmultimedia system, called BarclayZone, provides a two-way video linkbetween the customer and Barclays Stockbrokers based in Glasgow. Itprovides information, advice and facilities for share registration anddealing. The pilot will take place in three branches and will testcustomers' appetite for such a service with the possibility forextension to other services such as taxation services, wills, unittrusts, portfolio management and travel or health insurance.A successful pilot will also see BarclayZone sites opening in airports,train stations and out of town shopping centres.BarclayZone has accounted for a 'significant investment'. It wasdeveloped by Barclays Multimedia, a division of Barclays GroupOperations Technology, which was set up in mid-1992 by Joseph de Feo,head of Barclays' IT department. It is the latest in a series of remotebanking services that were launched by Barclays in 1995.Those included a multimedia kiosk developed in conjunction with ThomasCook to provide travel and related financial services, a home shoppingservice via the Internet called BarclaySquare and a home bankingservice via PC for personal customers, called Barclays PC Banking,available at the end of this month.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996REUTERS LAUNCHES KOBRAReuters, the news, information and dealing room systems' vendor, haslaunched a software package, Kobra, to provide users with tools tocreate their own information selection, manipulation and display. Kobraenables users, with a constant standard display, to mix informationfrom different information sources on one screen.Based on object-oriented technology, whereby programs are broken upinto modules (objects) and functions, Kobra integrates different typesof information (data, text and graphics) in real time.Kobra comes in four different versions targeting different levels ofuser.Run mode provides users with access to pre-arranged displays.Montage mode is for more specialised users to build their own displays.Link mode builds on functionality provided by the Montage mode butprovides links between items coming in from different sources.Development mode is designed as a toolkit for creating objects that canbe used on any of the other levels of workstation.Reuters has also ventured further into the information superhighway byacquiring a 2.5% stake in Yahoo, a software browser for the Internet.This extends Reuters' policy of supplying news services on a wholesalebasis to various Internet suppliers (including Yahoo, the MicrosoftNetwork and Compuserve); a relationship analogous to Reuters supplyingnews services to newspapers.Peter Thomas, director media relations, Reuters, says: 'We see theInternet as an opportunity for us but, as everybody else, we continueto research the best way for it to be utilised'.

The wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM (TheBanker, 7/95, p89), has cut the price of the desktop version of LotusNotes by more than half (58%) in an attempt to 'accelerate sales anddeployment' of the product.However, Lotus has increased the price of the Notes server products,required to run Notes in the network environment, to bring them more inline with other client-server products which use a lower client costand a higher server cost, according to Jim Moffat, communications'product manager, Lotus (UK). Before the announcement the client and theserver products' pricing structure was the same.'Because of the performance enhancements to the product, we aresupporting many more users for our server, and because customers buymany more clients than servers, the cost of ownership is actually goingdown drastically,' says Moffat.The announcement came prior to the shipment of Notes Release 4 whichstarted last month in the US and Europe. The product includes newfeatures such as intelligent agents to make it easier to store, andnavigate through, information; Internet access via the InterNotes WebNavigator; and tools for developing Web applications.

Productionis now shared with Flextech, a subsidiary of US's TCI, which owns 30%of EBN.Dow Jones will continue to support Dow Jones Investor Network theforerunner for Telerate Live which is broadcast in the US.Bloomberg, on the other hand, has announced the availability of itsdealing room television service to the European market. It intends theservice to be transmitted to all its customers' terminals free ofcharge. Bloomberg believes the pricing structure will encourage morepeople to take its terminals.There is an appetite for such TV services in the dealing room but priceis a key issue.

But, whatever thepolitical and economic hurdles which EMU must overcome, the challengeof making the necessary changes to computer systems within the bankingindustry may prove to be its most serious handicap.As the sector is already dogged by a constant stream of softwarefailures, the risk of development problems on IT projects on the scaleof EMU preparation is considerable. This problem will be exacerbated bya demand for specialist IT skills, which will be in limited supply.So it is imperative that immediate action should be taken to preparefor the conversion of banks' computer systems to handle a singlecurrency, if the deadlines for EMU are to be met. However, continueduncertainty over the details of the currency changeover is impedingprogress.EMU will involve largescale enhancement or rewrite of multiple systemsacross most parts of a bank, all of which must interrelate and completewithin the same ambitious timescale.To say there is a significant systems delivery risk is anunderstatement - experience suggests there is a certainty of majorsystems development failure in many banks and a very high likelihood ofknock-on impact on other projects and business functions. Moreover, ifa software development fails once an irrevocable commitment is made toEMU, there will be no fallback option if a bank intends trading after E-Day.Nor will these likely failings be isolated incidents. The transition toEMU will be exposed to the weakest link in the chain. If any one memberof a payments network is behind, for example, then an EMU-compatiblenetwork cannot go live. Similarly, if a particular segment of thebanking industry in a given country is not ready, then conversion tothe new currency at the retail level cannot take place.Failsafe approaches to systems development do exist. However, theyusually involve more protracted development timescales and theiradoption would jeopardise the ambitious deadlines for EMU.A typical big bank has hundreds of separate systems in operation, eachwith its own natural life cycle. The additional step of adapting thesesystems for EMU may invalidate previous decisions regarding investmentpriorities and shorten the shelf-life of individual systems.For larger banks, the development costs of preparing IT systems for thesingle currency are therefore expected to exceed ECU60 million.However, following recent cutbacks, banks have little spare capacity inIT development. For this reason, EMU investment needs to beincorporated into IT planning cycles as a matter of urgency.It is important that banks undertake both a 'top down' and a 'bottomup' assessment of the systems impact of EMU, to arrive at a realisticunderstanding of the changes required and a credible assessment of thetiming and resourcing implications.A recent report, European Monetary Union - critical IT supply-sideissues, produced by CGS, evaluated the demand which EMU will place onthe IT services industry, and whether the industry has the capacity tomeet this demand.The only comprehensive estimate of the systems cost of EMU to banksstands at ECU5 billion. Based on this figure and on assessments derivedfrom experience of working on EMU projects in Germany, the Netherlandsand France, CGS has modelled the likely pattern of demand for ITservices.While concluding that demand is unlikely to exceed the capacity of theIT services industry, the CGS findings reveal that considerableuncertainty still remains because:* estimates of the demand itself are shrouded in doubt;* the supply of appropriate IT resources cannot be turned on at will;* the timing of this sudden demand surge coincides with other demandpeaks.Although European political leaders have agreed upon the timetable forEMU, the structures necessary to support the unification process remainambiguous and undecided. As yet no legal framework exists and there isscarcely more clarity now than a year ago on the crucial question of adual currency operation.Moreover, little work has been done to estimate how the demand for Euro-denominated accounts will affect different sectors of the economy. Eventhe characteristics of the new currency itself - such as interestcalculation and capitalisation rules - remain undefined. So to estimatethe full scale of the technological transition with any accuracy isextremely difficult.The costs of currency changeover published to date are minimumestimates only and, in the manner of all such calculations, will tendto creep upwards as detailed requirements become clearer. Indeed, asfigures were based on the assumption of a Big Bang conversion and aperiod of dual currency operation now seems more likely, IT costs arelikely to be inflated by at least 50%.One thing is certain, however: IT resources are not interchangeablecommodities and specialist skills in limited supply are likely topresent real supply side bottlenecks, despite theoretical capacity inthe IT industry as a whole.First, larger banks and retail banks are more likely to use in-housedeveloped systems than smaller and wholesale banks. The danger will bewhere internally developed old systems, supporting core parts of thebusiness, require major redevelopment to accommodate EMU. These are thevery systems where banks may be least able to turn to externalresources to make the necessary changes.Second, for industry segments such as international branch banking, andfunctional areas such as treasury, the critical path for EMU will bethe changes made by package vendors.From an EMU perspective, packaged software, which is written to beflexible, is likely to accommodate change more easily than much of theold bespoke software in banks. Vendors typically have limited financialresilience, however, and may be reluctant to act until the uncertaintysurrounding EMU is eliminated. And there will undoubtedly be a smallminority of package vendors who experience problems in implementing thenecessary changes for EMU.As these problems will become clear only late in the day, affectedbanks will have little opportunity to develop alternative systems.Given the scale of effort demanded, it is reasonable to expect banksacross Europe to respond to the prospect of a single currency with afrenzy of detailed planning and impact assessment. Unfortunately,progress is far from uniform. This is in part a question of politicalgeography. In Germany, the Netherlands and France, for example, CGS isworking with banks which have a 'sleeves up' attitude to EMU, based ona conviction that it will happen. By contrast, at least one UK clearingbank has devoted neither time, thought, nor resources to the issue,based on a conviction that, for the UK at least, EMU will not happen.All European banks face the same dilemma: they can wait until 1998 todiscover whether their country will join EMU, when it will be too lateto implement the systems changes, forcing a negative decision; or theycan invest now for an outcome which may not arise.It is unclear whether governments, or even banks themselves, appreciatejust how large an effort is involved in preparing banks' IT systems forEMU, or indeed the urgency of moving on to a war footing today toensure that the necessary changes are properly planned and executed.It is essential that institutions such as central banks and bankingfederations should seek to encourage a more coordinated approach tocurrency changeover, if the deadlines for the single currency are to bemet.The first step should be the establishment of guidelines for banks toassess the systems impact of EMU, combined with milestones at whichbanks must explain their plans and monitor progress.Early warning systems should also be established to enable problemswithin individual institutions to be identified swiftly and rectifiedbefore the point of irretrievable breakdown is reached.Finally, contingency plans should be set in place, perhaps includingsoftware rescue services, temporary bureau processing, or systems loansbetween banks.The significance of IT preparation for EMU should not beunderestimated.Otherwise, come 1998, some countries may find themselves unable toparticipate in EMU, irrespective of their success in achieving economicconvergence criteria.IT preparation may seem a mundane consideration in comparison to thecontinuing debate on the economic and political implications of EMU.Nevertheless, it is an indisputable fact that no country will be ableto proceed with EMU unless its national banking community has madesufficient progress in making the necessary modifications to computersystems.John Rushton is senior manager for CGS, a European computer servicescompanyBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996TECHNOLOGY: EUROPE'S IT BOOMThe European IT software and services market is forecast to grow 8% ayear for the next five years, boosting market size to more than dollars130 billion by the year 2000, according to Input, a global intelligenceand consulting firm.In another report published in January, European Software and ServicesMarket - Competitive Analysis, 1995, Input ranks the market shares ofthe leading European software and service vendors.In 1994, the top 20 vendors accumulated revenues of dollars 29.6billion or 35.7% of the total European market of dollars 83.3 billion.The report highlights IBM's domination in Europe, which holds the topslot in France, Germany and the UK. However, it has had its positioneroded in the Nordic region by the formation of groups throughacquisition, for example, Celsius in Sweden; by forceful niche playersin Denmark; and robust defence of their markets by local vendors inFinland and Norway.US vendors such as CSC, Andersen Consulting and EDS continue todominate tenders for big contracts, except for SAP of Germany.In the Netherlands, national vendors - Philips, BSO-Origin, Raet,Roccade, Getronics - have recently announced alliances to extend theirgeographical reach and extend their service portfolios.The report also highlights the emergence of new entrants, for example,telecommunications vendors, such as MCI and AT&T, which continue toextend their range of services.They have done this either through acquisition, for example, MCIacquired SHL for dollars 1 billion last year; or by the creation of aprofessional services unit internally, for example, AT&T Solutions.AT&T is now in the throes of a major restructuring.The report observes that some vendors are relationship builders ratherthan technology experts. They are using 'value-based pricing' todifferentiate themselves from the competition and establish long-termrelationships with clients based on improvement in business, ratherthan IT, metrics.Among banks worldwide, expenditure for outsourcing, systems integrationand network services is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)of 15%, says Input in a study of worldwide banking informationservices.Outsourcing is increasing at a CAGR of 19%, since banks are now usingoutsourcing to handle business functions, network management anddesktop services as well as application and platform systemsoperations.A recent survey by Information Week of the biggest information systemsspenders in Europe in 1995 put three banks among the top 10: BarclaysBank was the third biggest spender with dollars 1.3 billion; ABN AmroHoldings was fifth with dollars 960 million; and Deutsche Bank wasninth with dollars 814 million.Leading European software and services vendorsEurope, 1994                                                   Estimated                                                     sector    Market                                        Country     revenue     shareRank     Vendor                         of origin   (dlrs m)     (%) 1    IBM                               US            7,890       9.5 2    CGS                               France        2,025       2.4 3    Siemens Nixdorf International     Germany       1,905       2.3 4    Digital Equipment Corporation     US            1,765       2.1 5    Reuters                           UK            1,755       2.1 6    EDS                               US            1,585       1.9 7    Microsoft                         US            1,260       1.5 8    ICL                               UK            1,150       1.4 9    Bull                              France        1,115       1.310    Andersen Consulting               US            1,065       1.311    Computer Associates               US              955       1.112    Sema                              France          950       1.113    Finsiel                           Italy           905       1.114    Olivetti                          Italy           895       1.115    Oracle                            US              815       1.016    SAP                               Germany         800       1.017    AT&T                              US              795       1.018    Hewlett Packard                   US              735       0.919    Datev                             Germany         640       0.820    CSC                               US              635       0.8Top 20 Total                                         29,640      35.7Total Market                                         83,300     100.0Source:  InputBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996TECHNOLOGY: FRAUD BUSTERSLast September three fraudsters were jailed for a pounds 120,000swindle which involved the first home-made high street cash dispenser.More than 300 bank and building society customers were fooled by theHalifax 'card cash' dispenser which had been carefully built into thefront of an equally fictitious mortgage broker's premises in EastLondon.According to Moira Lavery of lawyers, Dibb Lupton and Broomhead, notone of the victims realised, as they tried in vain to withdraw cash,that their personal identification numbers and card details had beensecretly recorded to make counterfeit cards, later used to plundertheir accounts.While these fraudsters were caught and were jailed for up to fouryears, the fake cash dispenser they built highlights the lengthsfraudsters will go to and the ingenuity used against financialinstitutions and the public.The Lebanese loop, a piece of camera film inserted into an automatedteller machine (ATM), is another ingenious device to defraudcardholders.For Lorna Harris, head of the fraud prevention unit of the UK'sAssociation for Payment Clearing Services (APACS), the struggle is notto get complacent and to be ever vigilant against new types of fraud.Although plastic card fraud can never be fully eradicated, considerableprogress is being made in limiting losses.In the UK, plastic card fraud losses have declined rapidly in recentyears since the peak in 1991 when losses reached pounds 165.5 million.In 1994 fraud losses fell to pounds 96.8 million , 25% lower than in1993, and Lorna Harris says the 1995 figure is expected to show afurther downward trend.Why the improvement? APACS attributes the success to better co-operation between banks, retailers and the public and the banks'authorisation strategy introduced in 1992.Before then about 10-12% of all plastic card transactions requiredauthorisation but, since the banks got together and developed anapproach across all retail sectors from April 1994, some 30% of allcard transactions are authorised and fraud losses in certain retailsectors have fallen as much as 75%.For banks, fraud is not seen as a competitive issue and the UK banks'willingness to co-operate with each other, along with the existence ofan umbrella body such as APACS, is viewed as critical to recentsuccess. Also, the negotiation of a tariff reduction with BritishTelecom lowered the cost of authorisation calls for retailers and addedto the spirit of co-operation.In other countries, card fraud has been rising and global figures forVisa show a worldwide confirmed fraud total of dollars 675 million forthe year ending June 1995. The US accounts for 58.2% of this figure.Many countries, however, the US included, do not have an inter-industryumbrella organisation such as APACS in the UK and many believe that thelack of such a coordinating vehicle has been the reason behind growinglosses in these countries.New approaches are being used to limit card losses which are stilldominated by lost/stolen cards which make up 71.1% of the latest UKlosses. The emergence of 'hot card' checking has become invaluable incutting fraud.With 5,000 cards lost or stolen every day out of a total of 86 millioncards issued in the UK the problem for issuers, retailers and customershas been growing with retail outlets, such as petrol stations, beingthe most fraud prone, accounting for around a quarter of all losses.In the petrol sector, with a high volume of low-value transactions, theuse of on-line authorisation has proved inappropriate and 'hot card'checking, using a simple swipe mechanism, has proved very effective. Acashier can tell within seconds whether a credit, debit or chequeguarantee card is being used fraudulently.In the last three years hot card files and hot card broadcasting havehelped to combat fraud and provide a low-cost alternative to on-lineauthorisation.The market leader, CardClear, uses terrestrial television networks totransmit data on lost/stolen cards to retailers and hopes to have 5,300installed sites by 1997.CardClear managing director, Brian Raven, says hot card broadcastinghas been endorsed by the UK banks for use in the petrol sector andsince October 1993 Barclaycard's losses (largest UK card issuer) inthat sector have fallen by 54%. Raven also believes that cross-borderfraud is growing (from 13.2% of all losses in 1992 to 21.7% in 1994)and that the market need for hot-card broadcasting will expand.CardClear hopes to use satellite broadcasting to carry its service intocontinental Europe for use by European banks on a pan-European basis.In January it announced a three-year agreement with UK petrol retailer,Mobil, to install its hot card system in Mobil's 700 retail outletsthroughout the country. And Raven hopes to provide a range ofinformation services to retail and other market sectors .One recent card innovation, however, does not appear to have been thateffective. The photocard has been described more as a novelty than afraud prevention tool and surveys from Norway and New Zealand indicatethat it has no more advantages than a card without a photo.While two leading banks in the UK have introduced photocards, the take-up has only been a modest 30% and industry statistics show that only500,000 photocards have been issued, amounting to just 0.6% of the UKmarket.Sophisticated new technology is also expected to provide significantimprovements in combating card fraud, with new products to be launchedsoon.'Europay believes that neural networks are an important element of itsrisk management strategy, along with the introduction of smart cards,'says Patrick Nelson, business development manager for the UK andIreland for Europay International, Europe's leading internationalpayments organisation.'Counterfeit fraud is still very much a risk for card issuers andacquirers across Europe and many local systems are unable to deal withthis problem.'Europay's new neural net fraud prevention system, set for launch inthe first quarter this year, identifies likely patterns of fraud basedon a merchant's international activity.'This means that, unlike other neural network systems that analysecardholder behaviour, Europay's system is able to flag suspiciouspurchases without any delay to the cardholder at the point of sale. Byfocusing on fraudulent or targeted merchants such as stores sellingbrands of upmarket Swiss watches, the system has the potential toprevent 12% of international fraud volumes.'Nelson explains: 'Europay chose neural network technology to complementits existing fraud prevention measures as it can be quickly adapted totake into consideration changing circumstances and does not requirestrict models to be imposed from the outset. For the past 12 monthsEuropay has been working with Nestor to refine its system by using datacollected from clearing payment transactions.'After rigorously testing the system on its mainframes to make sure itcan cope with huge volumes of data, Europay is now in a position to beable to deliver the system to members either as a stand-alone productor to complement the technology they have developed themselves.'By tailoring the system to meet the individual requirements of eachbank, Europay is confident that neural network technology will play akey role in fighting fraud across Europe.' The smart card alsorepresents another big step forward in fraud prevention.France already has a 'chip' card in action which has proved hugelysuccessful against crime. But it lacks international compatibility. Inthe UK, a strategic approach to add chips to plastic cards has beenestablished through APACS. The so-called ICC project is expected tohave a chip card in production by the end of 1997.Although the chip project was prompted by concerns over fraud, and therealisation that magnetic strip technology was reaching the end of itslife cycle, APACS soon became aware that the industry costs ofintroducing the new chip technology could not be justified on projectedfraud savings alone.APACS notes that the recent growth in electronic commerce has placed anew imperative on financial institutions to be able to offer securepayment services. The Internet is a prime example of the need for suchsecure payments.Chip-enabled plastic, as such, is a good entry point as the card is auseful mechanism for transporting the chip which, in turn, is goodtechnology for storing the tokens necessary for secure services.The UK aims to have 50% of its point-of-sale terminal base converted tochip delivering 65% by value of UK transaction turnover by the end ofthe millennium. It is anticipated that the whole of the ATM networkwill be converted in a similar period or earlier.The project, which includes the active involvement of the majorschemes, Europay (representing Mastercard), Visa and Switch shouldprovide a quantum leap in card security.Smart cards will provide the future technology for the paymentsindustry.Initially, experts suggest, the new cards will probably be programmedwith a signature comparison facility, along with an ability to checkthe card user's pin code.But if the technology improves, so-called biometric information couldbe included, possibly involving a finger-print scan, dynamic signatureverification, back of hand vein checks, retina scans and - perhaps oneday - voice recognition. This will certainly give tomorrow's fraudstersplenty to ponder.Trends in UK plastic card fraudPounds millions fraud losses1990                125.61991                165.51992                165.01993                129.81994                 96.8Source:  APACSBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996THE BOTTOM LINEThe outlook for European economies and financial institutions over theshort, medium and long term bears considerable scrutiny. Uncertaintiesand unknowables notwithstanding, the prospect of much faster changethan many people believe or can absorb is, or should be, of majorconcern. The fall of communism in the late 1980s led to a cataclysm incentral and eastern Europe; the spillover, the spectacular economicgrowth in Asia, and the pervasive impact of technology are factors thatmany in western Europe may not have fully taken on board.As historian Eric Hobsbawm noted in Age of Extremes: 'Perhaps the moststriking characteristic of the end of the twentieth century is thetension between the accelerating process of globalisation and theinability of both public institutions and the collective behaviour ofhuman beings to come to terms with it.'Although western Europe is not alone in wrestling with these issues,history and tradition weigh heavily on those in the EU; radical changewill not come easily. Already this year the spectre of economicweakness and reduced growth has spread across the continent and touchedthe strongest economy, Germany. Recent figures showing risingunemployment, lower growth expectations and expected larger budgetdeficits have altered perceptions of Germany and, as a result, Europeoverall.Analysts believe the near term risk in Europe is one of deflation ascountries, while continuing to keep a hold on inflation, struggle tomeet Maastricht convergence criteria for European economic and monetaryunion (EMU) and strong core currencies erode competitiveness.However, the risks are also much broader. Much is at stake and monetaryunion is only one aspect of a Europe needing to reposition itself in afast-changing global environment.But EMU represents the prime challenge now and 1996 is critical ifunion is to proceed. By the end of this year experts believe it will beclear whether January 1999 will be the genuine starting date, and ifthe project is viable.A consensus appears to be emerging that a small group of countriescould start, but that both Germany and France would have to beincluded, as anything less than two major economies would not beacceptable. Will the convergence criteria be met? Some recent viewssuggest that Germany and France are now likely to have deficits in 1997of 3.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), in excess of the official 3.0%criteria, but that governments would not object to such modestovershooting.The problem comes if the current economic downturn persists and thedeficits rise to the 4% of GDP range. Governments would then find itdifficult to accept such large overshootings, even if other criteriawere more or less acceptable. Does Europe, from the handful ofcountries that could make 1999 to those which cannot, have the will tomeet the targets and strive for long-term goals?Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, theforerunner of the European Central Bank, made encouraging noises inlate January. 'European citizens are just as mature and well-informedas financial market operators. Over time experience has taught them toassess the effects of economic policy decisions from the viewpointwhich goes beyond the short term.'They are, therefore, aware of the overriding necessity of bringing therising trend of public spending on social security, health care andpension schemes under control - because they know that in the long termthese increases will jeopardise the whole of our social welfaresystem.' Unfortunately, Lamfalussy appears more hopeful than realistic.Evidence suggests that, except perhaps for the Germans, governments,the public and financial institutions are not well aware of the long-term implications of EMU and have scarcely addressed the issue beyondnarrow, parochial parameters.Most banks appear not to be technically prepared even if the politicalgo-ahead is given. And what will be the relationship between thehandful of countries that could make 1999 and those which do not?Uncertainties multiply and even if Lamfalussy's optimistic opinion of'European citizens' is accepted, much still needs to be done to makethe partnership between the political decision-makers and the privatesector on EMU really work. There is little evidence to show thatfinancial institutions are taking a proactive stance on anything to dowith EMU.Can a wait and see policy work? If the 1999 start founders, as itmight, and delays are ruled unacceptable, as is likely, the lack of anEMU process will have severe long-term implications. EMU, like it ornot, is Europe's response to globalisation and if a void ensues thenEurope will be the loser.Looking longer term to 2006, what are the prospects? The onlycertainties appear to be that Asia will not stand still and thattechnology will continue to reshape employment. Since the industrialrevolution technology has shifted employment upstream; today thatprocess is accelerating and politicians' rhetoric that more educationis needed belies the fact that fewer real jobs in certain sectors arebeing created and fewer are likely to be created.EMU represents a long-term strategy for Europe. It may not be perfectbut if governments, the public and also banks do not take a proactiveapproach there will be no strategy. Europeans need to look to theirfuture and act accordingly.Back to Headline List WT02-B38-10IA086-000616-B020-188http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi14.html 205.156.212.5 19970122004753 text/html 28129HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:46:01 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:24 GMTContent-length: 27942Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi14.html Sample Issue Copyright THE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNet February 21, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES COURTING FAVOR: S&LS GIVEN NARROW ODDS ON SUPERVISORY GOODWILL (744 words) INTERSTATE BRANCHING BILL: IT HAS LEGS (575 words) INTERSTATE BILL AT A GLANCE (239 words) MULDOON DOES $1 BILLION IN CONVERSIONS IN 1993 (456 words) LITIGATION CREDIT UNIONS ARE HEDGING THEIR BETS (377 words) ENFORCEMENT D&OS FACE EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS (361 words) DAVID PAUL GUILTY ON SECURITIES CHARGES (442 words) LENDER LIABILITY PROMPT ACTION ON SUPERFUND LAW SOUGHT (807 words) CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994COURTING FAVOR: S&LS GIVEN NARROW ODDS ON SUPERVISORY GOODWILLOral arguments held on supervisory goodwill Feb. 10revealed a bitterly divided, 11-member court likely to decide for oragainst the thrift industry by a margin as thin as a single vote.     Industry lawyers were buoyed by the receptiveness of manyof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit judges to itsarguments and by concession of key points by the government. But too manyjudges still appear to be leaning toward the governments camp to predict anindustry win in the battle over whether Uncle Sam owes thriftsboth livingand deadfor supervisory goodwill promises made during the debacle.     Between 40 and 50 supervisory goodwill cases have alreadybeen filed and a victory in this lead case could encourage more to stepforward. The number of cases could rise above 100 and claims could add upto $1 billion.     Its too close to call, said Daniel J. Goldberg, an attorneywith Housley Goldberg & Kantarian in Washington. Goldberg predicted a 6-5or 7-4 decision in a ruling that could take a year.     Edward H. Sisson, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, aWashington firm representing several supervisory goodwill cases, said hewas encouraged by how the court received the arguments, giving a slightedge to thrifts.     Sisson said that government arguments, such as thatsupervisory goodwill agreements were not contracts and the so-calledsovereign acts doctrine, were revealed as red herrings.     Under sovereign acts doctrine, the government can breachcontracts without obligation so long as it acts to benefit the generalwelfare.     Sisson and other observers were surprised that thegovernments attorney, Douglas Letter, conceded under grilling from JudgePauline Newman that the goodwill agreements did constitute contracts.Newman dissented in a pro-government decision by a three-member panel ofthe same court in May 1993.     If we agree with the court of federal claims that these arecontracts, Newman said, then the govern-ments position on sovereign rightsdoesnt apply.     Goldberg said he was also surprised that Letter appeared toconcede the regulatory capital credit issue to thrifts. This could besignificant, Goldberg said, since the counsel for Glendale, Jerry Stouck ofSpriggs & Hollingsworth, and for Statesman, Charles J. Cooper of Shaw,Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, pursued somewhat different strategies.     Statesmans claim is widely seen to be stronger thanGlendales and Goldberg said it was possible, though less likely, thatStatesman would prevail but not Glendale. But both have valid contracts, hehastened to add.     The oral arguments were punctuated by interruptions fromargumentative judges, who asked for clarifications or interjected sarcasticbarbs. Several judges seemed intolerant of the governments attempt to walkaway from a contract and from responsibility for any attendant damages.     Letter repeatedly invoked an interpretation of the SupremeCourt ruling in Powen vs. Public Agencies Opposed to Social SecurityEntrapment, 477 U.S. 441, a 1986 case suggesting that the government has aright to break a contract.     At one point Judge S. Jay Plager cut in, telling him, Iwant you to remember something from first year [law school] contractsclass.     I had a terrible first year contracts professor, Lettersaid. I learned almost nothing.     Plager instructed Letter that nobody disputes that thegovernment can break a contract. But when a contract is broken damages mustbe paid. Plager then said that thrifts never would have taken on millionsof dollars in liability by taking over insolvent institutions withoutgoodwill accounting promises from the government. Nor would regulators havetried to resolve one failing thrift by dragging down another, said Plager,referring to the knock-out impact of broken goodwill promises.     I have arguments for all of that, Letter said.     Obviously something you learned in contracts, Plager said.     Or in my opinions, joked Chief Judge Helen Nies, who wrotethe majority opinion in the earlier pro-government decision.     Minutes later, Letter tried to flatter Plager by saying, Iwish I had had you as my first year contracts professor.     Me too, we wouldnt be here, the judge retorted.     In the course of his argument, Nies pressed Stouck to showher where in Glendales agreement did the government specifically agree to a40-year goodwill amortization period and promise that there would be nochange in policy, the so-called double promise.     Stouck said these details were spelled out in a letter tothe Federal Home Loan Bank Board by Glendales accountant in a letter hesaid was integrated into the contract.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994INTERSTATE BRANCHING BILL: IT HAS LEGSWith interstate branching legislation appearing to have itsbest shot in almost a decade in passing Congress this year, industrylawyers and lobbyists are scrambling to reshape a measure cynics had givenlittle chance of winning congressional approval this yearif ever.     It has legs, one legislative lobbyist for a bank tradegroup in Washington said. I never thought I would ever see it passed in mylifetime, nevertheless my career, he said with  little sarcasm.     The linchpin of the political viability of the legislationis language that bars branching across state lines without acquisitiona bigcarrot to community banks  because it offers  a potential windfall if theywant to sell out.     An amendment to the legislation offering incentives toinstitutions seeking to branch interstate to do so by acquiring troubled ormarginally capitalized institutions is among options being proposed by somemembers of Congress, industry officials and regulators. No such requirementis contained in the initial legislation that passed the financialinstitutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee Feb. 3 by a 29-0vote. Ironically, the bill was passed before it was officially introduced.But markup by the full banking committee could come before the end ofFebruary.     Another potential change would be to allow states to optout of Douglas amendment repeal, an amendment that will be sought by theIndependent Bankers Association of America. That group believes that thelegislation passed Feb. 3 gives the back of its hand to 14 states that havenot chosen to allow holding companies outside regional compacts to acquirebanks in their state.     The bill passed by the House panel permits full nationwideinterstate bank holding company acquisitions one year after enactment andnational bank interstate branching by acquisition three years afterenactment. The bill allows states to opt out entirely from interstatebranching within three years after enactment of branching legislation. Thebill also allows bank holding companies operating in more than one state toconsolidate those subsidiaries into one bank 18 months after enactment.     But  securities analysts and industry lobbyists believethat the IBAAs concerns about allowing states to opt out of repeal of theDouglas amendment is a mere face-saving move aimed at disguising the factthe IBAA was caught off guard by Sen. Christopher J. Dodds, D-Conn.,announcement and the new-found momentum behind the bill that Dodds decisioncreated.     These officials also said that the only bank of note tobenefit from a state opting out of repeal of the Douglas amendment would beBarnett Bank of Jacksonville,  a $38 billion-asset institution thatdominates the Florida market but is weak outside the state. One analyst inNew York speculated that two potential acquirers Barnett would like to holdoff are BankAmerica in California and Chemical Bank of New York.     Steve Verdier, senior legislative counsel for the IBAA,confirmed that the IBAA was surprised at Dodds announcement and the new-found potential for the bill to pass. I think you could write that aboutanyone in Washington connected with banking legislation, he said. No oneoutside of Mark Leggett, the Washington lobbyist for NationsBank, gaveinterstate branching more than an outside chance of passage this year.     No small part of its new-found momentum is the statementFeb. 3 by  Dodd announcing that he would not seek to bog the legislationdown by adding an amendment that hamstrings the ability of banks of allsizes to grow their insurance sales business.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994INTERSTATE BILL AT A GLANCEThese are the main provisions of the Interstate BankingEfficiency Act of 1994, as introduced in the House Feb. 10:     Interstate banking      By acquisitionOne year after enactment, permits fullnationwide interstate bank holding company acquisitions.

Muldoon, Murphy & Faucette of Washington did the legalbilling on 15 mutual to stock flips in 1993 worth a total of $1.03 billion.     While Silver, Freedman & Taff handled six more flip dealsthan Muldoon, its rival handled bigger flips that issued far more stock.Offerings associated with Muldoon averaged $68.5 million per flip. Silverflips averaged $42.2 million.     We came out on top because we have a lot of veryexperienced people who work in securities and almost everybody hasgovernment experience, said Joseph A. Muldoon Jr. He said the firm thrivesbecause it takes good care of its clients.     The top underwriting, legal and appraisal firms dominatedthe biggest of the 109 thrifts that converted from mutual to stock formlast year, raising $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, according to the data ofSNL Securities.     The king of the conversion hill is Adams Cohen Securities,the underwriting firm on Long Island. It had a piece of flip deals worth$1.1 billion, or more than half of the total 1993 gross. The dozen flipdeals associated with Adams Cohen  averaged $94.4 million in grossproceeds.     Kaplan Associates of Washington led the appraiser group;deals associated with this firm came to $1.05 billion, almost twice as muchas its next closest competitor, RP Financial Inc. Kaplan flips also had thebiggest gross per appraiser, averaging $75.3 million.     The lead firms in these groups handled the doozy deals of1993. When the Coral Gables Federal Savings & Loan Association flippedearly last year, it was the largest  since a few big flips in the mid-1980s, according to Robert Adams, managing director of Adams Cohen. TheCoral Gables deal was eclipsed at the end of the year by Astoria FederalSavings Bank in Lake Success, N.Y., only to be eclipsed earlier this yearby the mother of all flips, Green Point Savings Bank with about $6 billionin assets.     Muldoon and Adams did both the Astoria and Green Pointdeals. Appraising for Astoria was done by Kaplan; RP Financial ofArlington, Va., the second largest flip appraiser, handled Green Point.     Close scrutiny of mutual to stock flips by regulators andmembers of Congress concerned about excessive insider benefits has thesefirms uncertain about what 1994 will hold.     As to 1994, I would say were very cautious, Adams said. Wedont know where the congressional hearings and legislation [on mutualflips] will go. He said the firm is keeping an eye to the windward anddiversifying. Were substantially expanding our sales trading activity andother research work, he said.     Muldoon predicted a clampdown on merger-conversions, but hewas cautiously optimistic that conversions will continue.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994CREDIT UNIONS ARE HEDGING THEIR BETSThe National Credit Union Administration has the authorityto allow AT&T Family Credit Union in North Carolina to serve additionalemployee groups, the credit union and Credit Union National Associationclaim in a motion made in federal district court in Washington. However,given the possibility that banks could win the case, the two defendantsalso say that even if the banks win, relief should only be prospective.     AT&T Family and CUNAs brief, filed as a motion for summaryjudgment in First National Bank and Trust Co., et al vs. NCUA, No. 90-2948,is a crucial component of a lawsuit that could have broad legal, politicaland competitive implications for both the credit union and bankingindustries.     The American Bankers Association filed the suit on behalfof First National Bank and Trust, arguing that the Federal Credit Union Actcommon bond criteria bars credit unions from expanding their field ofmembership beyond their primary service group, that is employees of AT&T inNorth Carolina.     In summing up the banking industrys case, AT&T FamilyCredit Union and CUNA put it best:     The relief sought in plaintiffs complaint includes adeclaration that all amendments to Family Federals charter that wererequested after Nov. 14, 1989 are null and void. Such a declaration woulddivest Family Federal of approximately 95 employee groups. These groupshave 34,000 members30.3% of the total membership of the credit union. Thiswould have a catastrophic effect on Family Federal and its members.     Besides its argument that NCUAs action was proper andFamily Federals charter is lawful and valid, the Family Federal-CUNA briefhedges its bets by saying that even if the banks are right, giving bankswhat they want would impose harm on the credit union of great magnitude,while the competitive harm to the plaintiffs that would result fromprospective relief only is negligible.     The brief added, This requires the court either to rulethat the banks are not entitled to retroactive relief or, at the veryleast, to hold an evidentiary hearing to evaluate the relative harms andother equitable factors such as waiver and estoppel.     Banks are seeking divestiture because they believe thatcredit unions have become unfair competitors because they are not taxed andyet can offer the same services.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994D&OS FACE EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSGiving another kick to one of its favorite politicalfootballs, Congress has moved to extend the statute of limitations forcivil actions against insiders at failed thrifts.     Sen. Alfonse M. DAmato, R-N.Y., pushed for the extension aspart of his efforts to keep pressure on the Clinton administration inregard to White-watergate, the controversy surrounding the role of thepresident and his wife in an Arkansas real estate project that was fundedby a savings and loan that later collapsed.     DAmato offered an amendment Feb. 9 to a supplementalappropriations bill that allows the Resolution Trust Corp. to bring civilsuits for fraud and gross negligence until Dec. 31, 1995. The Senateapproved the amendment the same day by a vote of 95-0, and on Feb. 11 theHouse of Representatives voted 390-1 to instruct their conferees to retainthe amendment.     This means that those who are potentially liable to thetaxpayers cant hide behind the calendar or a legal technicality, theranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said. Congress will nottolerate gross fraud or negligence at the taxpayers expenseno matter whothe culprits are.     DAmato was joined in offering the amendment by Sens. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.     DAmato said he pushed for the extension for fear that thestatute of limitations would run out by the end of February for casesinvolving the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the institution connectedto the Whitewater resort development in Arkansas.     He cited the administrations repeated failure to provideany specific information regarding the expiration of the civil statute oflimitations in the Madison/Whitewater controversy.     Under current law, the statue of limitations for fraud andgross negligence is five years. DAmatos amendment, certain to pass becauseit was attached to a supplemental appropriations bill, extends the statuteof limitations in cases involving failed S&Ls to the same date that the RTCgoes out of business.     Now that the RTC will have additional time, we must beconcerned that it will use it to conduct a thorough investigation and thenrecover some of the billions of dollars taxpayers have poured into thesavings and loan bailout.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994DAVID PAUL GUILTY ON SECURITIES CHARGESAndrew WheatIn a surprise move David L. Paulwho became a symbol of theS&L era as the defunct head of the former CenTrust Bankpleaded guilty Feb.10 to remaining charges in a 100-count indictment.     Miami-based CenTrust failed in early 1990 at an estimatedtaxpayer cost of $1.5 billion. The indictment came two years later and ajury was selected last October for the first batch of counts that chargedthat Paul had diverted bank funds to pay for the work on his mansion andhad obstructed justice. The jury found Paul guilty of many of thosecharges.     The second batch of charges to which Paul just plead guiltycover racketeering allegations that Paul and his associates misledregulators and purchasers of CenTrust subordinated debentures about theunderwriting of CenTrust junk bond investments.     A 1991 FDIC suit against junk bond king Michael Milkenargued that directors of several thrifts, such as Paul, Charles Keating andThomas Spiegel, allowed Milken to draw on their funds to support prices andprevent defaults in his multibillion house of cards. Each of these personsintended to share in the plunder of their respective institutions and toobtain other benefits the Milken Group provided to those who purchasedlarge quantities of Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, the suit said.     An additional charge in the second batch of Paul chargeswas that CenTrust parked a piece of the offering with Bank of Credit andCommerce International parties to make it appear that it was more heavilysubscribed than it was. Further charges allege that CenTrust transactionswith Charles Keatings Lincoln Savings and Loan contained materialinformation that was not disclosed to auditors.     Sentencing is scheduled for April 1, April Fools Day.There will also be Rico forfeiture proceeding March 21.     I have a hard timeeven for internal purposesestimating whatkind of sentence he might be faced with, said Allan Sullivan, the assistantU.S. attorney handling the case. It all is governed by sentencingguidelines. Its all calculated based on fraud losses, and aggravating ormitigating factors.     This marks the conclusion of a successful prosecutionagainst Paul resulting in his prosecution on Rico charges, Sullivan said.     In an interview with The Thrift Regulator in October (Oct.4, page 3) Pauls attorney, Stephen Neal of the Chicago office of Kirkland &Ellis, said there was no question the bank had paid for work on Paulshouse. But he dismissed the second set of chargesto which his client hasnow pleaded guiltyas nonsense put into the indictment solely to soil Paulsname through guilt by association with Keating and BCCI.     Neal could not be reached for an updated comment.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994PROMPT ACTION ON SUPERFUND LAW SOUGHTIt is doubtful that the banking industry will be successfulin trying to use a negative court decision on the ability of a governmentagency to exempt lenders from hazardous waste cleanup suits brought byprivate parties as a lever to force Congress to act quickly on a law whichprovides that protection. That will mean that for the time being,persuading judges to read the lender liability exemption in the currentSuperfund law broadly is the best way for lenders to reduce their potentialliability for cleanup of hazardous waste.     One of the reasons prompt action on the legislation, theSuperfund Reau-thorization Law, H.R. 3800 and S. 1834, is unlikely is thatCongress, even under the most optimistic of scenarios, will have littletime to deal with it this year. Second, the misery-loves-company groupsthat brought the court suit against the Environmental Protection Agencys1992 regulation are unlikely to cave in quickly to pressure from theadministration and members of Congress, even though these groups areacutely aware of the potential economic impact of leaving lenders out todry for the damage caused by borrowers to the environment.     The two groups are state and local governments and thechemical industry, both with a big stake in having someone with deeppockets share the blame for cleanup of hazardous waste. The suit is Kelleyvs. EPA. Frank J. Kelley is the attorney general of Michigan. The ChemicalManufacturers Association was the co-plaintiff in the case.     The bill does what a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe D.C. Circuit says the EPA doesnt have the authority to do unilaterally,establish strict limits on when lenders are liable for hazardous wastecleanup. But in its Feb. 4 decision, the court held that Congress mustgrant EPA the authority to limit lender liability. Otherwise, courts willdetermine the extent of lender liability based on the current Superfundlaw, the court said. The EPA promulgated the rule in response to the FleetFactors decision in the 11th U.S. Circuit in 1990, which imposed liabilityon lenders based on the theory that the mere capacity to influence aborrowers decisionmaking was sufficient to make the lender potentiallyliable. It in effect called into question the secured lender exemption inthe original Superfund statute.     Elliott P. Laws, assistant administrator for the Office ofSolid Waste and Emergency Response at the EPA, testified before a Housepanel Feb. 10 that the provisions in the reauthori-zation law regardinglenders and trustees has assumed a greater level of importance.     Although the government has not yet determined whether toseek a rehearing by the full court in the case, the administrationsproposal would confirm EPAs authority to administer the statute in a fairand effective manner, Laws said. An unnecessary imposition of liability onlenders and trustees ... would have a chilling effect on the provision ofworking capital to otherwise credit-worthy borrowers, or to provide fundsfor the purchase of environmentally distressed property. Clear liabilitystandards for lenders and trustees are necessary elements of theadministrations plan to rehabilitate urban brownfields and to bringdistressed property back into the stream of commerce.     Besides strictly limiting lender liability, the proposedlegislation would overhaul the manner in which shares of responsibility forcleanup of hazardous waste would be allocated and provide for expeditedsettlements. Laws summed it up this way: The administration intends toincrease fairness and reduce transaction costswith the expectation thatmost parties will settle their liability to the U.S. and that more moneywill be spent on cleanups, rather than lawyers.     Under the proposed law an early, expeditious and obligatoryallocation process would be created. Each liable partys share of responsecosts would be allocated by a neutral, third-party allocator. The proposedprocess is intended to reduce, if not virtually eliminate, the expensiveand time-consuming process of litigating these issues in federal districtcourt, Laws said. The plan offers substantial incentives to parties whochoose to settle their liability, and disincentives to parties who chooseto litigate following the allocation.     The American Bankers Association acted strongly against thecourt decision and called for prompt action on the legislation. The ABAsaid it would seek a rehearing before the full court on the rulingit hasbeen certified as an intervenorbut industry lawyers believe that is aholding action aimed at persuading Congress to move quickly on the bill.The only thing that could yield a rehearing is the still-to-be publisheddissent of Chief Judge Abner Mikva to the courts ruling.

Jim Edgar may resurrect a plan to build anindoor stadium for the Chicago Bears professional football team if aproposal to renovate the team's current home, Soldier Field, is indeeddead.    "We plan to touch base with both the Bears and city hall to determinethe status of the renovation proposal," said Edgar spokesman Eric Robinson."If the governor is convinced the proposal is dead, he's prepared toexplore other avenues to keep the Bears in Chicago."    One avenue favored by the governor is the possibility of building anindoor, multi-use facility in the Chicago area that has become known as"McDome," Robinson said.    In the summer of 1995, state officials hinted that a domed stadiumcould be built with bonds issued by the Metropolitan Pier and ExpositionAuthority. Although the authority has used most of its $937 million of bondauthorization, state officials had said it might be possible to issuestadium bonds by refinancing existing debt, a plan that still may befavored by Edgar.    "The governor believes that a multipurpose facility could be builtwithout raising taxes," he said. Robinson would not give details about howthat might be done.    In October, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled a $156 million planto renovate Soldier Field, the Bears' current home. The proposal calls forthe Chicago Park District to issue $100 million of taxable revenue bonds,backed by annual club seat fees, revenues from permanent seat licenses,concession fees, and a contribution from the team. The park district wouldalso issue the remaining $56 million of bonds payable with property tax orother district revenues.    Team officials have deemed the Soldier Field proposal unacceptable andhave reportedly declared negotiations with the city dead. However, Edgarwanted to be assured of that demise before reviving the McDome possibility,Robinson said.    "In the environment we work in, things are never dead until they'redead," he said. "We want to verify that from both sides (before movingforward)."    Meanwhile, a group of Indiana business leaders are continuing theirpush to build a new, $312 million stadium for the Bears in Gary, Ind., tobe financed with taxable bonds issued by the group. About 60% of the bondswould be repaid with various stadium-related private sources. The remaining40% would be repaid from revenues from a proposed 0.5% economic developmentincome tax to be levied in the county.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996THE BULLHORN    "Nothing that was written in their response successfully gets aroundthe fact that Merrill Lynch guided this county into bankruptcy."    - J.

The current problem stems from the federal government's partialshutdown, which includes the Census Bureau, the agency responsible forpublishing the figures states use each year to compute the amounts they areallowed to allocate to bond issuers.    Under normal circumstances, Census would have released that report lastweek, so that officials could begin this year knowing exactly how much theyhave to work with. But because Census workers are on furlough, states willhave to wait awhile before they know what their 1996 cap amounts are goingto be.    But the problem is even worse than that: If past experience is a guide,states may not be able to use those population numbers when they eventuallycome out.    Back in 1990 Census issued the wrong figures during the last week ofDecember, and corrected itself with a new report in January. The TreasuryDepartment ruled that neither report conformed to the letter of the law,and told states they had to go back and use their 1990 volume cap amountsfor 1991.    If history repeats itself, states in 1996 will be stuck with year-oldvolume caps again, and the largest states, which have growing populationsand huge demand for private-activity bond authority, will be hurt the most.    One improvement over last time is that issuers probably will not haveto wait six months before the issue is resolved. When the 1991 snafuoccurred, the Treasury did not issue a ruling until July, leaving states inthe dark for the first half of the year - the period in which theytypically allocate most of their volume cap authority.    The Treasury apparently learned its lesson from that debacle and hasbeen routinely issuing a revenue procedure a few weeks after the beginningof each year, confirming that the numbers in the previous December's Censusreport are the correct ones to use. Last week Treasury officials declinedcomment on this latest mess, and it will be interesting to see how theyresolve the problem and whether they do so quickly.    But the difficulties caused by the delayed Census report illustrate aneven deeper problem facing those who must live under the confines of thecap: its inequity.    Under the volume cap law, states are permitted each year to allocatethe greater of $50 per capita or $150 million in private-activity bondauthority. In 1995 that left 21 states at the $150 million level, and manyof those with more bond authority than they knew what to do with.    But most of the larger states, which are stuck with $50 per capita, arechafing under the cap's restrictions. They, of course, are the ones whostand to be hurt if states are forced to revert to their 1995 allotments -thus, not accounting for any growth in population - in 1996.    There are other problems with the volume cap that affect all states.Chief among them is the fact that the cap is not indexed for inflation, sowhile in dollar terms the cap has remained constant, in reality it hasdropped over the last several years.    In 1993 the Public Securities Association reported that inflation haderoded the cap to the point where it was really $41.25 per capita, not $50,and $120.8 million, not $150 million.    Despite the problems that persist, legislation to ease the volume caphas never caught fire in Congress. Rep. Bill Coyne, D-Pa., in 1993introduced a broad bill to ease bond curbs, which included a provision thatwould have indexed the cap for inflation. But Congress never acted on thatbill.    Former Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, offered a proposal in 1993 designed tohelp alleviate the cap's inequities. Grandy's proposal would have allowedstates with an overabundance of cap authority to shift the authority tostates that had used up their cap in a given year. But Congress took noaction on his measure, either.    And so problems with the volume cap continue. If the population-reportmess creates enough difficulties for the states, 1996 may finally be theyear that Congress is forced to take a hard look at the volume cap law andwhat can be done to improve it.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996TRENDS IN THE REGION: LEASE REVENUES BUOY SACRAMENTO'S SKYLINEBy Joe Bel Bruno    In sharp contrast to California's stagnant construction industry,building projects rising in Sacramento have created a mini-boom in thecapital city.    The skyline in downtown Sacramento has been reshaped to include morehigh-rise buildings, many of them used by federal, local, and stategovernment. Money used to reinvent the city's downtown isn't coming fromprivate dollars, but instead from lease revenue bonds and other forms ofpublic finance.    There are currently two large buildings being constructed and financedthrough lease revenue bonds: the massive new federal office and courtbuilding, and a new addition to the Sacramento Convention Center complex,operated by the city. And what will be Sacramento's sixth major state-ownedbuilding to go up in less than three years - an 850,000-square-foot officebuilding that will house the California Environmental Protection Agency -is already in the planning stages.    Critics complain that the state relies too heavily on expensivefinancing in order to avoid getting voter approval for general obligationbonds, which can be sold at a lower interest rate. Financing constructionprojects with lease revenue bonds can cost the issuer up to twice as muchin interest as other forms of financing.    "Using lease revenue bonds for construction is a fairly standardpractice," said Jerry Beavers of the California Legislative AnalystsOffice. "We're putting out so much in interest that in the end, after thebonds have been paid off, it costs almost double what it actually cost toput up the building."    Lease revenue bonds are paid off - typically over 20 years - from fundsformerly used to pay for leased buildings. Supporting the use of leaserevenue bonds is Gov. Pete Wilson, who contends that they are a good use oftaxpayers' money.    However, some officials note that as the current upswing inconstruction shows, the state is nibbling away at escaping its leaseobligations. Currently the state leases 7.2 million square feet of officespace around Sacramento, while it owns 5.1 million.    "We've used lease revenue bonds for a long time to help financeconstruction costs both (in Sacramento) and elsewhere," said CraigReynolds, chief of staff for state Sen. Lucy Killea, I-San Diego. "However,there has been some talk in committee with the proposal of new constructionprojects to take a closer look at the financing. This will likely happen."    In general, state government is a major employer in Sacramento, hiring62,600 at the seasonal peak, excluding college and university employees.California employs 195,700 people statewide.    Construction projects awaiting legislative approval include two massivelow-rise buildings in the city's suburbs and a cluster of new high-risebuildings on state-owned property south and east of the capitol.    One of the state buildings considered to be among the most extravagantis owned by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. It isdesigned with six terraced levels that are enclosed by outside walls andconcealed behind jasmine shrubbery that extends around the building for twoblocks. Offices open out to the man-made garden setting.    However, because of its private funding, the building has receivedlittle criticism. The $78 million cost was paid by using seven days' worthof the investment returns on the organization's $94 billion portfolio.Unlike other state agencies, CalPERS receives no tax-generated money.    "I think the public would rather have the state build some of thesebuildings using other, more cheaper ways ... or no public money at all,"Beavers said. "There has been so much growth in the past few years, thatnow we are realizing it is time to put a plan together that will manage itbetter."    Legislators are expected to soon devise a plan to organize and managethe buildings, as well as develop a plan to regulate growth aroundSacramento.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996MONEY MARKET FUNDS: YEAR-END UPSURGE IN TAX-FREE FUND YIELDS ISTYPICAL, PLAYERS SAYBy Elizabeth Roy    Tax-free money market fund yields shot up last week - but marketparticipants said the surge was typical year-end behavior.    Meanwhile, the Dec. 22 downgrades by Standard & Poor's Corp. of fourJapanese banks that provide letters of credit for money market fundsecurities has not affected trading, the participants said.    They said the market had already priced in the downgrades.    Standard & Poor's downgraded Mitsubishi Bank to A-plus from AA-minus,Sanwa Bank to A from AA-minus, and the Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi KangyoBank to A from A-plus.    On Thursday the rating agency also downgraded Fuji Bank, to A-minusfrom A-plus. All five banks were placed on CreditWatch in August.    Money market yields rise at year-end for two main reasons.    First, demand wanes as retail investors withdraw funds either to coverholiday or other expenses, or to avoid paying intangibles taxes in statessuch as Florida and North Carolina. Those states tax investors based ontheir holdings on the last day of the year.    Institutional investors also retreat from money market funds in thefinal weeks of the year, players said, either to make tax payments on Dec.15, or to trim the number of investments they have to print on their year-end balance sheets.    At the same time, remarketing agents also want to enter the new yearwith clean balance sheets. As a result, they offer money market funds highyields on daily and weekly floaters in an effort to clear them from theirbooks.    "We're obviously seeing a year-end spike, due to a lot of money that'sbeen leaving the arena," said Bradford Owensby, municipal securitiesanalyst for the $1.3 billion Nations Tax-Exempt Fund and the $110 millionNations Municipal Reserve Fund.    The investment adviser for the funds, a wholly owned subsidiary ofNationsBank of North Carolina, as of yesterday became known as TradeStreetInvestment Associates Inc.    Referring to the high yields being offered on money market instruments,Owensby said: "Dealers don't want inventory, so they've been jacking uptheir rates."    The high yields are aimed at corporate "crossover" buyers in particular- those that can invest in either taxable or tax-free products, he added.    Andrea White, assistant vice president in municipal trading at HarrisTrust and Savings Bank, agreed.    "Yields have been going up fairly substantially," said White, whosefirm runs a $400 million tax-free money market fund and a $250 millioncommon trust fund.    In the week leading up to last Wednesday, yields on weekly floatersrose 45 basis points, and those on daily floaters were up 100 basis points,she said.    Also on Wednesday, White said, weekly floaters were yielding in the4.95% to 5.10% range, compared to returns of 3.70% on tax-free commercialpaper maturing in February.    After Jan. 1, however, short-term yields should drop down to about 2%and stay there for at least a couple of weeks as cash flows back into moneymarket funds, she added.    Only on July 1 do investors receive as much money in the form of couponpayments and bonds maturing as they do on Jan. 1, White noted.    The Harris money market funds have lost $15 million to $20 million inrecent weeks, but the managers expect to have to cope with $50 million ofinflows starting today, White said.    Jim Hannan, vice president at First National Bank of Maryland andmanager of the $88 million ARK Funds Tax-Free Money Market Portfolio, saidsome weekly floaters have been resetting at yields as high as 5.25% - ataxable-equivalent yield of 8%.    "The first week in January, that'll come down to 3.5%," he said.    In the meantime, Hannan said, a money market fund yielding 4.25%, ashis was on Wednesday, offers a taxable-equivalent yield of 6.55% - 95 basispoints over the 5.60% that the typical taxable fund is offering crossoverbuyers.    Even so, Hannan's fund saw the assets of its institutional class dropto $71 million from $80 million at the beginning of December, he said,adding that he expects the money to return this month.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996BROKER PROFILE: MUNI INVESTORS SHOULD AVOID FUNDS, BROKER SAYSBy Jon Birger    Mutual funds offer far more advantages for equity investors than formunicipal bond investors, according to Bill Glassner, an independent brokerin Cedar Knolls, N.J., affiliated with Royal Alliance Associates Inc.    With an equity fund, "a manager really adds value" compared to what abroker can do, said Glassner, who has about 400 clients with accountstotaling $150 million. "I don't have the time to research individualcompanies on my own and give them the diversification they need."    Municipal bond funds also offer diversification and expert research.However, in Glassner's opinion, municipal funds' inherent interest raterisk outweighs their advantages.    For fixed-income investors, Glassner recommends only products with "afinite life," principally bonds but also unit investment trusts, he said.    When Glassner has clients who come to him with existing holdings inbond funds, "I tell them, 'If you didn't like the fluctuations of 1994 -not knowing where you stood with a fund - here's another approach: you canbuy the individual bond and no matter what happens with the ups and downsof the market, you're going to get your money back.'    "The individual client understands that even if everything goes wronglike it did in 1994, they have a guaranteed value on a certain date," hesaid. With a fund, there is no specific date when investors are guaranteedfull return of principal.    While a patient fund investor should eventually recoup his fullinvestment - either through higher yields or appreciating shares -  "it'sharder for the unsophisticated client to visualize that," Glassner said.    One of the few scenarios in which Glassner does recommend bond funds isfor investors interested in the high-yield sector of the municipal market.    "I only use funds for things that I can't efficiently buy on my own,"he said. "On the (high-yield) muni side, I use a fund that has theresources and the people to research the small deals - the unrated deals -and to diversify in a portfolio in order to make it safer."    Glassner's favorite high-yield fund is the Van Kampen Merritt Tax FreeHigh Income Fund.    About 40% of Glassner's accounts is invested in municipals - theremainder divided about equally between equities and taxable mortgage-backed securities.    A self-described bargain hunter in the equity market, Glassner takesfew such risks when buying individual municipal bonds.    Municipal bond investors "are basically looking for safety," he said."I go out of my way to be real safe."    While Glassner said he understands why many yield-hungry institutionalportfolio managers prefer A or triple-B rated bonds, he does not recommendthis strategy for retail buyers.    Individual investors who buy municipals want peace of mind, he said.    "And especially with these low yields (and narrow credit qualityspreads), you're picking up so little extra by taking the uninsured bond,"he said.    About 70% of Glassner's clients are New Jersey residents. He generallyadvises these investors to buy Garden State bonds in order to takeadvantage of the in-state tax advantage.    Interest earned on New Jersey bonds is exempt from the state incometax, which is 6.58% for individuals in the top tax bracket.    "I'm not too concerned about the New Jersey economy," Glassner said ofhis clients' high exposure in the state. "But I will buy a state like Texasif I see enough yield to cover the New Jersey tax."    Some of Glassner's best-selling New Jersey issuers include the state ofNew Jersey itself, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the PortAuthority of New York and New Jersey.    He and his clients also like northern New Jersey municipalities such asEssex County, Parsippany, and West Orange Township Board of Education.    "Investors are generally a little more comfortable if they know thetown," he said.    Glassner is a big fan of zero-coupon bonds, particularly for investorswith a specific time horizon.    "I use the zeros a lot," he said. "I have a lot of people who justdon't care about the income and they love buying a bond at 25 cents on thedollar or 50 cents if it's shorter.    "And I also find higher yields there because the marketplace doesn'treally like (zero-coupon bonds). In general they want the bonds with thecash flow."    Zero-coupon bonds issued by Camden County Municipal Utility Districthave been among his top sellers, according to Glassner.    Because Camden is one of New Jersey's most economically depressedareas, these bonds "don't trade real well, so we end up with a good yield,"he said. "They're insured, and we're going to hold them" to maturity.    For sophisticated investors willing to take on a little risk, Glassnerrecommends housing bonds.    "Some people view the fact that there can be an unpredictable,extraordinary redemption as a negative," he said. "I view that as apositive."    Investors are compensated for the call risk with above-market yields,he explained.    "You can sometimes get a real high coupon at a very small premium witha housing bond," Glassner said. "I usually view a three- or six-monthbreak-even period as fair, but I've got to find a client who knows there'sa little risk of losing the premium a day after he buys it."    Glassner's clients generally buy bonds in the four- to 12-year maturityrange - "though I do have some clients who will go out 30 years as part ofa laddered portfolio.    "In general, people are looking for 5%" yield, he continued. "Fivepercent seems to be the psychological barrier right now."    Investors seem to have adjusted to long-term yields in the 5% to 5.5%range, according to Glassner.    "The area where I get the most resistance is in the shorter end, wherethey're taking 4% or 4.25% for a maturity that they don't think is thatshort - four to eight years," he said. "A lot of clients would rather leavethe money in cash."    As for the flat tax, Glassner said neither he nor his clients areparticularly concerned.    "Nobody's really talking about it - it hasn't come up at all (inconversations with clients) during the second half of the year," he said.    Glassner does not believe a flat tax will pass. And even if it did -thereby reducing municipals' resale value - investors who hold their bondsto maturity would not be affected, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996PORTFOLIO MANAGER PROFILE: CONSERVATIVE MANAGING CAN REAP REWARDSBy Sarah Stirland     A top performance can be achieved even with a conservative strategy,according to Ronald H. Schwartz, portfolio manager of STI CapitalManagement's $150 million STI Classic Investment Grade Tax-Exempt BondFund.    Schwartz's portfolio has consistently landed among the top fiveperforming intermediate funds over last three years.    But he said he achieves his results incrementally. "Our philosophy isthat we don't try to hit a home run," he said.    "We don't feel like we can forecast interest rates far out into thefuture accurately for a long time period, so we will have our short-termbias based on our fundamental and technical analysis - we're not going tomake major bets by any means," he said.    In addition to managing the intermediate bond fund, Schwartz oversees atotal of $1.4 billion in municipals in a Florida fund and two common trustfunds.    But it is the intermediate bond fund that has regularly appeared in theLipper Analytical Services Inc. top-five performer rankings this year.    Schwartz's fund recorded a one-year total return to the end of thethird quarter of 11.31%, ranking first out of 111 intermediate funds.    In 1994, Lipper named the portfolio top performer in its class.    Nothing Out of the Ordinary    Despite this achievement, Schwartz describes his investment strategy asdoing nothing particularly out of the ordinary.    Schwartz has kept the average maturity of the fund relatively short,currently at seven and a half years, with an average duration of fiveyears.    That positioning is in keeping with his philosophy of not making biginterest rate bets, he said.    "If we're bullish on the market we'll extend the average maturity toeight years, but we're not going to say: 'We know interest rates are goingto go lower, let's change this average maturity from seven and a half yearsto 15 years,' " he said.    Instead, Schwartz said that he will extend or contract his maturitiesslightly from his neutral level of seven and a half years, according to hisrate forecast.    "It's the unknowns that really move this market and you can't predictthose," he added.    Instead, Schwartz uses yield curve analysis to find value and toachieve his goal of the highest total return possible.    "We constantly look at the current yield curve market and look at whereon the yield curve would be best to invest," he said.    Currently, Schwartz is buying in the intermediate area, where he thinksthe value is.    In this 15- to 20-year sector, he said, investors can find yieldsalmost as high as those on 30-year bonds with less risk.    "When you go out 10 more years to the 30 years, all you pick up is 10basis points," he said.    Risk-Reward Ratio    "We don't feel that risk-reward ratio is to your benefit, so let's takeless risk by going into the 20-year area and all we give up is maybe fiveto 10 basis points - that's worthwhile, to us," he explained.    "You're basically getting 98% of the 30-year bond with the 20-yearbond, so you're taking less risk or volatility while earning 98% of the 30-year bond," he added.    In addition to using to using yield curve analysis, he gauges value bycomparing municipals to Treasury securities, he said.    The intermediate area also currently looks attractive using thismeasure, he said.    At the moment Schwartz is pursuing a barbell strategy.    In addition to extending his maturity out to about eight years at thebeginning of 1995 when he was optimistic about the market, he has beenbuying prerefunded bonds at the short end of the curve.    "They've been yielding 78% to 80% of Treasuries - that's a veryattractive ratio for the shorter end and for something that is the mostsecure bond in the market," he said.    Schwartz's barbell approach involves buying securities in the one- tosix-year area and in the 15- to 20-year area.    "We feel like that's the area of the curve that has the best returnpotential in this kind of environment," he said.    Schwartz said that although there is nothing unusual about hisstrategy, he manages to find value because the STI fund is a national oneand can also, like many other national portfolios, take advantage of thesupply and demand inequities that crop up in the market at different timesof the year, he said.    This ability to pick and choose between the different states gives himan edge over state-specific funds, he said.    Tracking Prices    Schwartz said that he also makes the most of market inefficiencies bykeeping records of the price levels at which different bonds trade.    "We do very extensive historic relationship spreads of how bonds shouldtrade against each other," he said.    "For example, how should a general obligation bond trade versus arevenue bond? How should a specialty-state bond trade versus a non-specialty-state bond? How should a premium bond trade versus a discountbond," he said.    Schwartz buys and trades according to the aberrations he sees in thesehistoric relationships, he said.    Currently, he is taking advantage of the oversupply of bonds and thenwaiting for the New Year to roll in when a lot of bonds mature, are calledor make their coupon payments.    He estimates that more than $40 billion of cash will flood the marketin January - bringing demand, which he believes will create a good sellingclimate.    As part of his strategy of managing by making small but progressivechanges to his portfolio, Schwartz will trade bonds even if they only givehim a slight advantage, he said.    "If Floridas are trading expensive and Washington bonds are tradingcheap, then I will do that trade and earn a quarter and give that return toinvestors," he said.    Feeling Optimistic    At the moment, Schwartz has extended his portfolio because he hasstarted to feel optimistic about the market again, after worrying, earlierthis year, that the rally had run its course this year.    In addition, he has been buying intermediate bonds because they arelooking attractive again at the moment.    "In the 15-year area, we have seen yields as expensive as 85%, as cheapas 88.3% and it's currently at 88.2%, so you see it's at one of thecheapest areas versus Treasuries for the last three months, and over thepast year, it's been as cheap as 89.4%," he said.    Schwartz said he does not like to take credit risk either.    "We've seen too many investors reaching for yield and buying creditsthat are not adequately compensating them for the risk," he said.    Areas he avoids are housing bonds and utility bonds, he said.    Schwartz's avoidance of housing bonds fits with his philosophy thattotal return is the best measure of performance rather than income.    He believes that portfolios that rely on income are not as worthwhileas funds that rely on total return because total return measures the totalvalue of the portfolio - not just the income, which could be boosted bysacrificing capital.    Housing bonds in particular give investors high coupon payments buttheir value often amortizes as the securities age, not to mention they missout on the chance to benefit from rising prices.    "A housing bond is going to give you a lot of income, but in a bullmarket, those bonds are not going to appreciate very much at all becausethey are going to be called and the investor is not going to see that inthe total return number," he said.    "In a year like this past year, if you just had housing bonds, youcould never have a 13% return," he added.    He points to the Securities and Exchange Commission's 1993 ruling thatfunds must compare their performance with an index in their prospectuses asan example of how important achieving a high total return is.    Schwartz added that he believes total return is the best measure of afund's performance despite the fact that it ignores investors' tax bracketsand any capital gains tax liability that may be created.    Despite his bias toward total return, Schwartz believes that funds thatemphasize current income will still flourish.    "I think that current income funds are going to be around and will dowell.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996SOUTHWEST BOND-WATCHCalifornia    Six months after former Assembly Speaker Willie L.

Prado    Wyoming    The Internal Revenue Service has approved a program that uses statefunds to back general obligation bonds issued by local school districts,allowing them to borrow with higher credit ratings, according to astatement released by Cheyenne law firm Rothegerber, Appel, Powers, &Johnson.    "This ruling will allow the state to go forward with the School BondGuarantee Program for public education in the state," state auditor DaveFerrari said in the prepared statement.

Hamilton describes himself as a conservative businessman but aDemocrat. "With a name like 'John Kennedy,' how could I be anything else?"he said. He also noted that at 32, he's Kentucky's youngest treasurer thiscentury.    Despite the fact that Hamilton completed only one year toward hisbachelor's degree at Lexington Community College, he is credited with"turning a failing (transportation) business around and increasing grossrevenue by $350,000."    The company, United Transportation Inc. of Lexington, was whereHamilton honed his managerial skills as president from 1983 - the year heleft college - to August 1995.    Hamilton, a political neophyte, plans on exploring the possibility ofexpanding the treasurer's investment activities - perhaps by addingmanagement of an LGIP to the office's responsibilities.    "We're going to work more closely with Kentucky's finance secretary andthe revenue cabinet compared to the last treasurer," Hamilton said. "Thosetwo agencies play an essential role in the state's investment programs.There needs to be an active and independent participant involved."    When pressed for details, Hamilton said he is interested in expandingthe treasurer's presence in investment policy decisions, but notnecessarily his authority.    Hamilton succeeds another Democrat, Frances Jones Mills, who servedthree separate terms as Kentucky's treasurer, the first beginning in 1976.    "Ms. Mills often didn't attend the meetings of the State InvestmentCommission," he said. "She would often send a surrogate. That will nothappen with me. But as far as any changes in investment policies, I willhave to learn more about the process before proposing anything."    Under state law, the treasurer serves as vice chairman of the StateInvestment Commission, which meets quarterly and essentially acts as anoversight board.    The day-to-day operation of the cash fund is conducted by the Office ofFinancial Management and Economic Analysis.    "Historically, the Investment Commission approves policies andprocedures and the staff of my office implements their decisions," said DonMullis, executive director of the financial management office.    There is currently at least one LGIP in the state, but that is operatedby the Kentucky Municipal League and the Kentucky Association of Counties,Mullis noted.    Although the state is permitted to establish an investment pool, onehas never been authorized, Mullis said.    "If such a pool were begun, it would in all likelihood start with theInvestment Commission and be managed and administered by this office,"Mullis added.    Kentucky's cash fund is doing fairly well, Hamilton said, pointing tothe revenue surplus of several million dollars. He said he hopes to enhancethe surplus by examining ways to boost returns for the state's cash fund.    "For me the biggest challenge ahead is restoring the sense of integrityof this office," Hamilton said. "So maintaining a strong presence on theInvestment Commission will be a good step in that direction."Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996NONPROFIT IOWA HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGECHICAGO    Two not-for-profit health systems in Iowa have signed apreliminary agreement to merge, leaving unclear the status of $220 millionof outstanding debt.    Officials of the Iowa Health System last week approved a memorandum ofunderstanding to merge with St. Luke's Health System. The memorandum isgood until March 1; Scott Eldridge, chief financial officer of St. Luke's,said he expects the final agreement to be reached late next month.    St. Luke's now has about $70 million of outstanding tax-exempt debt,Eldridge said. All of the health system's bonds have been sold withinsurance, and therefore carry a triple-A rating, he added.    The Iowa Health System has about $150 million of outstanding tax-exemptrevenue debt, according to chief financial officer William Miller. He saidthe debt is rated A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and A1 by Moody'sInvestors Service.    "I can't really say what will happen to the debt in the mergedorganization because it hasn't been decided yet," said Eldridge.    "We're sorting out those options now," echoed Miller. "One thing weknow for sure is that there certainly won't be a refinancing."    Eldridge suggested that the two groups may become jointly obligated forthe combined $220 million of debt now outstanding.    "It looks like ultimately, we will (both) be fully responsible for allthe debt of the merged organization, instead of carrying individual debtfor each operating unit," he added.    Eldridge said Sioux City-based St. Luke's decided to merge with DesMoines-based Iowa Health System primarily to capture a bigger share ofstatewide managed-care health contracts.    "Both systems are strong, and they'll be getting stronger through themerger," said Eldridge. "We view it as a way to attract more (primary care)physicians into our systems."    - Cris CarmodyBack to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996SCHOOLS' NEEDS ARE FERTILE GROUNDBy Kieran Beer    There was a time when immigrant children from all over the world gottheir first taste of the American dream at the local public school.    Public schools constructed in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s were safe,clean, well-lit places. Some of them were even elegant structures,expressions of the nation's faith in public education and the opportunityfor personal advancement.    Times certainly have changed. The structures built decades ago, whichserved to school other generations, are in decay, and there seems to belittle public will to restore them or to build new schools.    That certainly is the conclusion of the page one story that ran in theNew York Times the day after Christmas. The story cited hard numbers fromthe Government Accounting Office that $112 billion is needed to renovateold schools and build new ones. Despite that need, states, municipalities,and school districts are spending less than ever on schools'infrastructure.    The Times account also offered anecdotal evidence of our neglect ofschools that sound like accounts of life in the third world: a collapsedceiling in Montgomery County, Ala., that could have injured children; aleaky roof and condemned gymnasium in a New York City school; and termiteinfestation in New Orleans.    Like any crisis, the state of the infrastructure of America's publicschools has myriad causes. Among these are overcrowding caused by a newwave of immigrants - particularly in places like Texas, Florida,California, and New York - and the fact that baby boomers have producedtheir own boomlet of school-age children. But no confluence of problemsexcuses our society's indifference to children and to the dark future suchindifference will create.    All of this provides muni bankers with an opportunity to be the goodguys, despite all the heat they have taken during the debate about a flattax. A number of flat tax proponents have characterized muni bankers -referring to them as Wall Street bankers to emphasize their distance fromMain Street - as an ignoble lot who, in league with government bureaucrats,help fund boondoggles and profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Well,building and repairing schools is not a boondoggle - it is a nobleendeavor.    But to be the good guys, the municipal bond community will need tocontinue to reinvent itself. Even as a number of more nimble firms arelooking at project finance and other alternative methods of finance, themunicipal bond community should be exploring both traditional and new waysto build new schools and repair existing ones.    Alternative methods of finance are necessary given the anti-tax, anti-spend political climate. Brokering a private-public partnership between theinformation technology vendors and the states to upgrade schools is oneplace to start.    Another reason creative methods of finance will be needed for educationinfrastructure is that education itself needs to undergo revolutionarychange. Even as we try to figure out ways to give kids good one-on-onelearning experiences with teachers, it is important to apply the revolutionin information technology to education. (Hence, the importance of theinformation technology companies.)    There is no reason that a state's best teachers - or even the country's- should not be accessible electronically to thousands of childrenregardless of the school districts they live in, one member of themunicipal bond community observed. "Schools ought to look more like theSony Movie Megaplex than Adlai Stevenson (Intermediate High School)," saidan investment banker.    There are many obstacles - including the need to work out the tensionbetween local and regional control of schools. But a vision that returns tomaking school structures express our faith in education and the future isworth fighting for.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996NRMSIR    The Securities and Exchange Commission has designated six companies asnationally recognized municipal securities information repositories, orNRMSIRs, in accordance with its new secondary-market disclosure rules forbroker-dealers, which go into effect today.

Eckstrom andseveral Treasury staffers were busy with some shopping of their own -hunting for bargains in the capital markets.    And on Dec. 26, while the malls were jammed with people waiting in lineto make their holiday shopping returns, the state Treasury was looking forhigher returns on South Carolina's surplus funds.    Although both days were official state holidays, the treasurer and somestaff members volunteered their time - while investment banks and theFederal Reserve were open - in an effort to boost the returns on statefunds that otherwise would have remained dormant, according to JohnPownall, deputy treasurer in charge of investments.    In all, the state Treasury managed to pick up about $11,300 in extraincome on $152 million in idle funds over the holidays, Pownall said. Thetotal returns were about $93,700, while they would have been about $82,400had the funds been allowed to remain dormant, earning about 4.8%, hesaid.    The state picked up the extra income by investing in five-dayrepurchase agreements with state banks, Pownall said.    Eckstrom and Pownall, along with Treasury staff members Faye Nealy,Leanne Register, and Chuck Sanders, participated in the volunteer effort,which was the second time the group had volunteered on holidays. The firstwas on Nov. 24, the Friday after Thanksgiving.    During that holiday, though, the extra earnings were less - about$3,000 extra on a total investment of $43 million, Pownall said.    The idea for the volunteer program came from long-time treasury stafferKen Cliatt, Pownall said.    "As soon as we took office, (Cliatt) sent me an e-mail message tellingme that he had been suggesting this for some time," Pownall said. "Hethought there was some low-hanging fruit here that we could take advantageof. And we thought that this was just too good an idea to pass up - it'sjust common sense, basic investing."    Although the extra earnings are not earmarked for charities because ofstatutory restrictions, the benefits will be passed on to the people of thestate, who can in turn pass them on to the state's needy, Pownall said.    "(Giving the money to charity) is a great idea, but unfortunately it'ssomething that the law wouldn't allow us to do," Pownall said.    "But we think that to the extent that the taxpayers have a little extramoney in their pockets, maybe they can put it to use in charities or othercauses," he continued.    "It may be a Christmas present to the taxpayers."Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996WHAT'S SELLING: COLORADO PAPER RATES COMING BACK TO EARTH AFTER BUSYDECEMBERBY SARAH STIRLAND    Colorado paper is currently trading at rates that are lessstratospheric than usual, according to Richard O'Connor, a municipal traderin Kirkpatrick Pettis' Denver office.    "Sometimes Colorado paper gets levels out for the bid that you can'tbelieve," he said.    Last Wednesday, "Colorado paper got a number that you would consider astrong general-market number. It wasn't trading as though there were noColorado paper around."    O'Connor attributes this change to the lack of market participants atthis time of year and November's flood of issuance in the state.    Normally, Colorado municipal bonds trade at above-market levels becauseAmendment 1 has made in-state paper scarce. The amendment mandates that allnew bond issuance must be voter-approved.    In early December, retail investors in Colorado were gobbling upprerefunded bonds with a vengeance.    "There was a huge appetite for prerefunds - you couldn't find bonds.There was so much retail appetite because a lot of money came due Dec. 1,"he said. "You could easily sell a $1 million block of prerefunded bonds."    Many retail investors, who tend to be older retirees, have a preferencefor these types of Treasury-backed securities or for other triple-A ratednames because of previous bad experiences with higher yielding credits,O'Connor said.    "When you have your older investors who have been burned in the past onlesser credits, they don't care what it is so long as it's Moody's(Investors Service) and (Standard & Poor's Corp.) triple-A," he said.    To get his hands on prerefunded Colorado bonds, O'Connor contactedmutual funds that owned the securities and offered them high prices, hesaid.    "You pay them what would appear at the time a fairly stellar number forbonds - they couldn't necessarily turn you down and you turn around andflip (the bonds) in a phone call," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CALIFORNIA QUAKE AUTHORITY SLATES BOND SALELOS ANGELES    The newly formed California Earthquake Authority hasslated a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Co. to underwrite a $1.5 billionrevenue bond sale later this year, part of the $10.5 billion in funds thenew agency needs.    Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Bear Stearns & Co. are also among the majorfirms in the syndicate, according to the announcement from insurancecommissioner Chuck Quackenbush.    In addition to the bond sale, other funding sources for the authority'splan to pay homeowner earthquake damage claims includes $1 billion in cashcontributions from insurance companies, and another $3 billion in fundspromised by insurance companies if necessary to pay claims.    The plan also includes $2 billion from reinsurers, $1 billion assessedfrom earthquake insurance policy holders, and $2 billion from additionalassessments on insurers, Quackenbush spokesman Richard Wiebe said.    Quackenbush, elected in November 1994, returned last month from a two-week global jaunt aimed at seeking reinsurance for the new authority.    Gov. Pete Wilson in October signed into a law a bill appropriating$500,000 to investigate the viability of an earthquake insurance authorityand laying much of the groundwork needed for its start-up.    Quackenbush and Wilson proposed the authority's creation last summer inthe wake of an exodus of homeowner's insurance carriers after massivedamage claims stemming from the January 1994 Northridge earthquake near LosAngeles.    - Antonio A.

El Paso County district attorney John Suthers' office confirmed lastweek that Shipley is now being included in an investigation centering onformer pension fund manager Mike Witty.    Witty resigned from the pension board in 1994 after the countydiscovered there was no bidding process when he was awarded consultingcontracts to oversee the $80 million fund's real estate investments,according to county officials.    However, the inclusion of Shipley in the inquiry is not expected tohave any immediate impact on the treasurer's office or county finances oroperations, said Ken Kile, deputy county treasurer.    "I don't believe it's gotten to the point where it will have mucheffect," said Kile.    Shipley, who is still on the job, did not return telephone callsseeking comment.    Suthers' investigation began after the county learned of a secret,unauthorized bank account that Witty allegedly set up in the fund's name in1993. Since then, two audits have been launched, including one by theaccounting firm Arthur Andersen, which county commissioners approved inearly December.    But last week Suthers announced that his investigation had grown toinclude charges that Shipley and pension fund board member Carl Hattonborrowed thousands of dollars from Witty while he was awarded consultingwork.    Hatton resigned from the board after Suthers' announcement Dec. 26, butShipley, who served as chairwoman of the pension fund until Dec. 20,remains on the board. The new chairman is Dan May, a deputy districtattorney who has been on the board since 1994.    Hatton and Witty could not be reached by press time.    An audit county commissioners released Dec. 18 found that while Wittycontrolled county pension funds, they were invested heavily in real estate.The report by Aurora, Colo.-based Comiskey & Co. found that the fund'sconcentration in real estate increased to 34% from zero between 1992 and1994.    An earlier audit in May 1994 noted that besides his $55,000 salary tomanage the fund, Witty earned more than $500,000 in 1993 and 1994 under hiscontract with the fund as a private consultant to oversee the fund's realestate investments.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996WHAT TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA BUDGET SURPLUSLOS ANGELES    When California Journal - a Sacramento-based politicalmonthly magazine - recently asked a number of state budget observers abouta hypothetical surplus of $1 billion, it got responses ranging from doubtthat such a positive number could ever occur to calls for tax cuts.    Stephen Zimmermann, Western region managing director for Standard &Poor's Corp. in San Francisco, said in the Journal's January issue thatCalifornia's first priority must be to pass a true balanced budget - onethat doesn't require crossover borrowing from one fiscal year to another.He also suggested a reasonable reserve of at least several percent of thebudget.    "As for further bonded debt, we'd like to see a real capital needs planthat prioritizes expenditures funded by bonds," Zimmermann told the state'sleading political journal.    "California's current debt service is now about 5% of the budget," headded. "That's considered moderate, so increasing it is not particularly aproblem, as long as the capital expenditures are orderly and planned."    Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,suggested that a surplus ought to retire bond debt to improve the state'sbond ratings.    The anti-tax activist also told the Journal that some taxes should betrimmed, and suggested that the state's massive surplus under former Gov.Ronald Reagan in 1974 led to pressure that brought about tax and bondinglimits under Proposition 13.    - Antonio A. PradoBack to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996MOODY'S SEES NEXT HUD BILL HAVING 'FAR-REACHING' IMPACT ON BONDSBy Joan PrydeWASHINGTON    Moody's Investors Service says provisions in the still-unresolved HUD appropriations bill for fiscal 1996 set the stage for majorchanges in bond-related federal housing programs next year when lawmakersdraft legislation reauthorizing those programs.    "While the housing appropriations bill did not contain substantialchanges to Section 8 or FHA insurance, it would appear to indicate that thefinal outcome of the Capitol Hill debate on housing programs may have morefar-reaching implications for bonds backed by such federal housingassistance, as well as for bondholder security," Moody's said in a recentreport.    Congress passed the funding bill for the Department of Housing andUrban Development, and agencies within HUD such as the Federal HousingAdministration, in late November. President Clinton vetoed the measure onDec. 18, because he disagreed with funding levels of other agencies in thebill not related to HUD. Congress is expected to try to fashion a new billmore to his liking.    Among the HUD provisions in the vetoed bill important to the municipalmarket, one would have given HUD temporary authority to renew expiringsubsidy contracts under the Section 8 rent subsidy program. The provisionis designed to keep alive revenue streams for bond-financed multifamilyhousing projects under the program while Congress in 1996 comes up with aplan for revamping the Section 8 program.    Although Moody's said the provision is helpful to keep those projectsgoing, the bill does not provide for subsidy increases during the nextyear, which could cause problems.    "Extending contracts at current contract rents for one year would keepsubsidy levels constant," the ratings agency said in a report titledMoody's Monitors Rating Implications of HUD Debate. "To the extent,however, that expenses increase while subsidy levels remain constant, thismay signal the beginning of new financial stresses for these projects,subject to the economics of individual projects."    The Clinton administration and Congress want to overhaul the Section 8program because the federal government cannot afford to renew the thousandsof subsidy contracts set to expire in the next several years. Theadministration has proposed transforming the subsidies - which now are paidto project owners - into certificates issued directly to tenants.    For projects also backed by FHA insurance, the administration hasproposed requiring owners to "mark to market" - that is, adjust theircontract rents to market levels and restructure their underlying debt. Inthe event that the lower rent could not support a given mortgage, the loanwould go into default, and a claim would be made against the FHA insurancefund.    The appropriations bill just vetoed by Clinton included a provisionthat would have permitted HUD to begin testing its mark-to-market plan on15,000 units of multifamily housing out of a total of about 800,000 thatreceive Section 8 subsidies.    Moody's said that trial would be instructive, because the big questionabout mark-to-market is whether the FHA can handle a big influx ofinsurance claims that is sure to result if the program is fullyimplemented.    "While the ratings on these bonds are based on the FHA insurance, aquestion remains as to the ability of FHA to process and pay claims in atimely fashion," especially if implementation of mark-to-market sharplyincreased the number of claims that the housing agency was having toprocess, Moody's said.    If that were to happen, "Moody's view on these bonds could beaffected," the ratings agency said.    Moody's said it has requested information from state housing financeagencies regarding their multifamily portfolios "to better gauge the impactof potential changes to the programs."    "In the course of our ongoing surveillance efforts, we are maintaininga dialogue with the agencies regarding the ways in which they are preparingfor potential changes which could affect their Section 8 portfolios,"Moody's said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CHANCES DWINDLE FOR REFORM OF THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACTBy Martha M. Canan    The prospects for overhauling the Glass-Steagall Act have dimmedconsiderably since last year because commercial banking and insuranceinterests cannot resolve a dispute over bank insurance powers.    As a result, the issue of whether banks should have authority tounderwrite municipal revenue bonds is being held hostage to the insurancedispute, which threatens to derail House banking reform legislation thisyear, lobbyists say.    If Congress does not act on Glass-Steagall this year, the FederalReserve Board is expected to come under increasing pressure to expand banksecurities powers, including the ability to underwrite revenue bonds,through regulatory action.    The effort to reform the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibitsmixing commercial and investment banking, gained momentum last spring whenthe House Banking and Commerce committees passed a bill that would allowbanks and securities firms to affiliate through holding companies.    The legislation would give banks new power to underwrite revenue bonds,in addition to existing authority to directly underwrite less lucrativegeneral obligation bonds. However, banks would be required to engage insuch new activity only through separately capitalized holding-companyaffiliates. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed banks todirectly underwrite revenue bonds, but the current language omits thatauthority.    The dispute between the commercial banking and insurance industriesinvolves a provision in a related regulatory relief bill that would haltfor at least five years any regulatory effort by the Office of theComptroller of the Currency to expand bank insurance powers. A relatedissue is whether to allow banks under federal law to affiliate withinsurance companies.    Insurance interests strongly oppose letting commercial banks into theirbusiness, while commercial banking interests view insurance activities asessential to their ability to compete with other financial servicesproviders in a technologically advanced global marketplace.    The insurance dispute has prevented the House leadership from bringingthe Glass-Steagall bill to the floor, because lawmakers do not want tochoose between the two influential industries, which contribute heavily topolitical campaigns. House leaders have long planned to combine the Glass-Steagall and regulatory relief measures into one package for a floor vote.    Months-long negotiations between banking and insurance industryrepresentatives and House leaders and staff - including Speaker NewtGingrich, R-Ga., Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., andBanking Committee chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa - have made little progresstowards crafting a compromise.    In a recent letter to Thomas Labrecque, chairman and chief executiveofficer of Chase Manhattan Corp. and member of the Bankers Roundtable,Leach expressed his frustration with what he views as the intransigence ofbanks that oppose any change in the U.S. comptroller's powers on bankinsurance, sources said.    The letter, which the Banking Committee and the Roundtable refused torelease, prompted speculation that Leach may be ready to suspend orterminate the talks, although some lobbyists said they could not imagineLeach pulling the plug after all the effort he has put into passage of thebill.    A subsequent press release issued by the American Council of LifeInsurance last Thursday reinforced the pressure Leach appears to be puttingon the banks. The council "noted with regret the failure of negotiationsthis year regarding insurance provisions contained in (the reform bill)."The statement said ACLI officials "expressed frustration with the 'delayingtactics' employed by banking representatives to reach a workablecompromise."    The council, which represents 600 insurance companies, charged thebanking interests with being "inflexible," while saying that insurancecompanies have made "significant concessions."    But Alfred Pollard, senior director at the Roundtable, said thestatement reflects "the complexity and difficulty" of the numerousinsurance issues under discussion. "There has been no effort to delay onour part," he said.    At this point, "it's ... looking pretty bleak" for passage of a Glass-Steagall bill in this Congress, said James McLaughlin, director of agencyrelations for the American Bankers Association. "Most people ... think itis already dead, but there is always a slim possibility, at least for thefirst few months of the year," that the House will pass a bill in time forthe Senate to act, he said.    Even if the House passes a bill, any debate in the Senate promises tobe contentious, as would be efforts to reconcile differing House and Senateversions of the measure, McLaughlin and other lobbyists said.    Legislation sponsored by Senate Banking Committee chairman AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y., would allow affiliations not only between commercial banksand securities firms, but also insurance companies and industrialcompanies. This approach raises major policy issues, such as whether toallow companies like General Motors into the banking and brokeragebusinesses, McLaughlin said.    D'Amato has said he will not act on his legislation until the Housetakes action, a Senate Banking Committee spokesman said.    D'Amato has made clear he does not want to repeat what occurred duringprevious sessions of Congress, when the Senate three times passed a Glass-Steagall reform bill, only to have it die in the House, lobbyists said.However, election-year politics mean that Senate action cannot be ruledout, even if the House fails to act, because senators may want to placatefinancial services constituents who want reform, lobbyists said.    House Banking Committee spokesman Dave Runkel maintained that the HouseGlass-Steagall bill "is not dead" and that committee staff, led by JosephSeidel, are continuing to broker meetings with banking and insuranceindustry representatives to reach a compromise.    While the main sticking point is over insurance, the rest of the billaffecting the ability of banks and securities firms to enter each other'sbusiness "is pretty much intact," Runkel said.    Wall Street and regional securities firms have differing interests andconcerns about letting commercial banks into their business, with regionalfirms more opposed to competition from banks. The Securities IndustryAssociation has said it supports legislation that would put securitiesfirms on equal footing with banks and not subject the firms to moreburdensome banking regulation.    The securities association has been supportive of banking interests onthe insurance dispute, because securities firms that want to entercommercial banking do not want to be forced to divest insurance-relatedbusinesses.    But the securities group opposes letting banks directly underwriterevenue bonds and other securities, and the association was a major forcein getting Leach to change the bill to require banks to engage in suchactivity through separately capitalized units.    But the requirement would discourage many of the couple of hundredbanks that now underwrite GO bonds from setting up separate units to sellrevenue bonds because of higher associated costs, McLaughlin said. Amongother things, the banks would have to set up firewalls between theaffiliate and the parent and other units, which would mean separate boards,separate sales, no joint marketing, and other mechanisms aimed atprotecting federally insured deposits from the risks of investment banking.    Roughly 30 banks now have affiliates engaged in so-called non-eligiblesecurities activities, such as revenue bond underwriting, under Section 20of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Fed allows creation of such affiliates thatmeet strict revenue limit, firewall, and other requirements.    If Congress does not act this year, the Fed is expected to come underpressure to ease these requirements for Section 20 affiliates, thus pavingthe way for expanded bank securities activities. But the Fed probably wouldact only in small incremental steps, and many banks still would bediscouraged from setting up Section 20 units because of costs, bankinglobbyists say.    Fed regulations now limit revenues that can be derived from Section 20securities activities to 10% of gross revenues. The Fed could "easily"raise this cap to 25%, "if not higher," said Melanie Fein, a bankingattorney with Arnold & Porter.    However, Gingrich said in a recent letter to Leach that he has nointention of contacting the Fed to encourage such action. "I prefer passingthe Glass-Steagall bill in as close a consensus position as possible sothat Congress will ultimately make the policy determinations on theseimportant issues, and not regulators," he said.    The Dec. 13 letter came as a follow-up to a meeting earlier in themonth among Gingrich, Leach, congressional staff, and representatives ofJ.P. Morgan & Co., Banc One, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, and Bankof America. Gingrich said the banking representatives appeared to havemisunderstood his answer to a question about Fed activity in this area.    Meanwhile, a "pivotal event" for banks this year that could change thewhole face of the Glass-Steagall debate promises to be a U.S. Supreme Courtdecision, which is expected by the end of June in Barnett Bank v. TomGallagher, Insurance Commissioner, Fein said.    The case, which is set for oral argument on Jan. 16, asks whethernational banks with branches in towns of less than 5,000 people have theright to sell insurance in small towns, even if a state law prohibits anysuch activity. The National Bank Act prohibits national banks fromunderwriting insurance but contains a key exemption allowing such activityin towns of up to 5,000.    More than a dozen states have "anti-affiliation" laws like the Floridalaw at issue in the case. These laws prohibit commercial banks fromencroaching on the business of insurance agents.    If the high court rules that state law "trumps federal law in thisarea, then banks would not be able to use the town of 5,000 exemption tosell insurance," Fein said. "That would mean that banks would need to pushharder in Congress to gain legislative authority to sell insurance," shesaid.    If the court rules that the federal law preempts local law, banks wouldhave even less need than they do now for Glass-Steagall reform legislation,Fein said. Much will depend on the decision, which could be limited in itsimpact depending on how narrow it is, she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996LOUISIANA GOVERNOR-ELECT: VOTERS NEED A VOICE ON GAMINGBy Christopher McEnteeATLANTA     Louisiana Governor-elect Mike Foster says voters shoulddecide whether they want gambling, and plans to call a special session formid-March to get lawmakers' support for a referendum.    A referendum would either uphold or throw out video poker, riverboatgambling, and the New Orleans land-based casino that the state Legislaturemade legal in a 1992 act.    Foster, who takes office Jan. 8, feels that gambling was "rammed downthe people's throat" without a referendum, said Marsanne Golsby, Foster'spress secretary. Moreover, public opinion has soured on gambling because offederal probes of several state lawmakers' connections with the gamingindustry and poor revenue growth from gaming.    Rather than allowing separate votes for each form of gaming, Fosterwill request an "all-or-nothing" vote, Golsby said.    Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, Louisiana will havegambling for the foreseeable future. The state has existing contracts orlicenses with a number of operators that would not be affected by the vote,Golsby said. Gambling would have to be phased out as licenses and contractsexpire.    In the some cases, such as video poker, the state grants a one-yearlicense annually, so these machines could be shut down almost immediatelyif voters reject gaming. But the state's 12 riverboats would stick aroundlonger because they were given five-year contracts that start to run out in1998.    But New Orleans voters could have to wait until Harrah's Jazz Co.'s 30-year contract runs out before they see a land-based casino leave theircity. That is unless that contract was broken when Harrah's Jazz, thepartnership developing the casino, filed for voluntary bankruptcyprotection on Nov. 22.    Foster and his aides are working closely with Harrah's Jazz, Golsbysaid, to figure out what the company intends to do about its finances andits plans to build what they claimed would be the world's largest casino.The partnership has until mid-March to present a reorganization plan inU.S. Bankruptcy Court.    But Golsby said Foster is reluctant to comment about Harrah's plans,other than saying the state will review its proposals when it comes torevenue-sharing agreements.    For its part, Harrah's Jazz says it wants to push ahead with casinobuilding, yet Louisiana must cut red tape associated with the project andallow it to reduce capital and fixed costs in its operating contract.    Harrah's Entertainment vice president Colin V. Reed said last monththree changes must be made to its contract before a casino can be"successful in a market that has substantially less" demand for gamblingthan first imagined.    First, the casino would scale back the number of slot machines andgames. Secondly, Harrah's Jazz would ask its bondholders to become equitypartners in the operation while it attempts to secure more cash.    Lastly, Harrah's Jazz said the state must be more "flexible" aboutreceiving the $100 million minimum annual tax Harrah's Jazz is committed topaying. The tax is the single largest fixed cost in the project.    Reed suggested that the state should take $125 million, which hasalready been paid, and use that money as an advance on the tax until thepermanent casino is in business. He claimed that the deferral of taxeswould be acceptable under state law because the casino would not be able tomake its minimum payments otherwise.    Under their plan, the state expected to receive the greater of 18.5% ofgaming revenues or a $100 million flat tax from its sole New Orleanscasino, operated by Harrah's Jazz. To date, the state has received only $13million from a temporary casino set up in advance of the permanent Harrah'sfacility.    State budget officials estimate that riverboats and video poker willgenerate about $375 million in tax revenue throughout Louisiana in fiscal1996.    If they intend to repeal gaming laws, state lawmakers must approve aconstitutional amendment by a two-thirds vote and ask that voters take upthe issue. If legislators approve an amendment in mid-March, it could gobefore the public 45 days later at the earliest, or be placed on the ballotin November.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996ENDING WITH A BANG, 1995 VOLUME SURPASSES EXPECTATIONSBy Yong Lim    Suprising market observers, December was the fifth straight month inwhich municipal bond issuance beat 1994 levels, according to figurescompiled from Securities Data Co.    However, 1994 still stays slightly ahead of 1995 for overall long-termnew-issue volume.    State and local governments sold 818 issues totaling $16.76 billion inDecember, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in December1994. This follows June and November of 1995, with $18.4 billion and $17.99billion, respectively, as the third biggest month of new-issue volume.    In 1995, bond sales totaled $156.22 billion, 5% below the $164.5billion sold in 1994.    Refunding issues rose a staggering 273% in December, to $3.86 billionfrom $1.04 billion in December 1994, while issues that combined new-moneyand refunding bonds rose nearly twelve-fold in December, to $1.69 billionfrom $131 million.    New-money issuance ended 1995 at $111.15 billion, 3% below 1994'sfigure of $114.31 billion. Refundings for the year were $32.94 billion,down 15% from $38.91 billion, while combined issues totaled $12.13 billion,up 8% from $11.28 billion.    Transportation, education, and housing were the only specific purposesto show increases in bond sales from 1994. Transportation issues were up asolid 13% in 1995, to $16.78 billion from $14.82 billion. Education issueshad a small 8% increase to $32.06 billion from $29.6 billion in 1994.Housing increased a slight 2% to $16.16 billion from $15.86 billion in1994.    Public facilities, which covers libraries, stadiums, and fire stations,suffered the greatest percentage drop from 1994, falling a hefty 32% to$5.68 billion from $8.37 billion. The largest category, general purpose,posted a 5% decline in 1995, to $39.37 billion from $41.57 billion.Declines in other purpose categories ranged from a scant 4% dip forutilities to a large 28% decline for environmental facilities.    New issues subject to the alternative minimum tax for individualsremained slightly above 1994 levels, rising 7%, to $17.95 billion from$16.86 billion. Taxable municipal bond sales posted a 13% rise, to $9.53billion from $8.45 billion.    Bonds sold through negotiation rose a meek 0.3% in 1995, to $112.63billion from $112.25 billion in 1994. Competitively sold issues declined asolid 17%, to $40.85 billion from $49.47 billion.    Revenue bond financing fell 11% in 1995, to $96.73 billion from $108.71billion in 1994. General obligation issuance, however, rose a modest 7%, to$59.49 billion from $55.79 billion.    Variable-rate securities rose 5% in 1995, to $19.16 billion from $18.32billion. The sale of convertible municipal bonds, which are zero-couponbonds that can be converted into current-coupon securities, havequadrupled, to $296.5 million from just $69.3 million in 1994.    The use of bond insurance to enhance new municipal issues increased 11%in 1995, to $68.08 billion from $61.31 billion.    Bank letters of credit declined 19% in 1995, to $9.91 billion from$12.16 billion in 1994, while the use of collateralized mortgages andmortgage insurance fell 21%, to $3.72 billion from $4.72 billion.    California issuers were the busiest among the 50 states in 1995,selling $20.14 billion. That was down 21% from $25.62 billion in 1994. NewYork was second with $18.73 billion, down 1%, followed by Texas with $10.47billion, up 1%; Florida with $9.05 billion, up a strong 18%; andPennsylvania with $7.15 billion, down 19%. Only 26 states and one U.S.territory reported higher new-issue volume in 1995. North Dakota reportedthe highest increase, doubling its 1994 volume of $241 million to $547million in 1995. Delaware had the biggest decrease in volume, cutting inhalf its 1994 figure of $364 million to $163 million in 1995.    Bond issuance dropped more strongly at the state level than at thelocal level in 1995. Cities, villages, towns, counties, local districts,and local authorities showed a combined 2% drop in 1995, to $91.25 billionfrom $93.4 billion. At the same time, state governments and agencies posteda combined 9% decline, to $62.49 billion from $68.38 billion.    Securities Data's volume figures are based on long-term bonds withfinal maturities of 13 months or more. Private placements are included, buttaxable bonds sold by private nonprofit organizations and remarketings ofvariable-rate bonds are excluded. The figures are preliminary and subjectto revision.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CASH FLOWS BACK INTO MUTUAL FUNDS, BUT NOT EVERYONE GETS A SHAREBy Elizabeth Roy    Cash flows into both national and single-state mutual funds edged intopositive territory in November, reaching $274.8 million and partly undoingOctober's $509.4 million in losses, according to figures from theInvestment Company Institute.    The gains were modest, however, and several mutual fund companies saidthey had not seen their share. They blamed the growing appeal of retirementinvesting, the stock market's stellar performance, and the delayed federalbudget for investors' lack of interest.    According to the ICI, national funds saw inflows of $190.4 million inNovember, compared to October's outflows of $284.2 million. With reinvesteddividends the figures were inflows of $528.9 million and $55.6 million,respectively.    State funds gained $84.4 million in November, compared to losses of$225.5 million the previous month. With reinvested dividends, there wereinflows of $349.2 million and $40.3 million, respectively.    Municipal money market funds also posted inflows in November, as inOctober. Excluding reinvested dividends, the funds added $12.5 billion inNovember, compared to $13.1 billion the previous month. Includingdividends, both months recorded $15.3 billion inflows.    In its monthly report, Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. saidit sold just $300,000 net of all firms' tax-advantaged bond funds inNovember, down from $35.6 million in October, with reinvested dividendsincluded.    A drop in sales from $136.8 million in October to $104.5 million inNovember accounted for the bulk of the shift, according to Schwab spokesmanTom Taggart.    At least part of the drop is seasonal, Taggart said.    "Toward the end of the year, a lot of people tend to reshuffle theirportfolios," he said.    In addition, Taggart said, the stock market's excellent performance hasled many investors to shift cash from bonds to equities in anticipation ofanother great year for stocks.    The growth of retirement investing has further sidelined municipals,since those tax-deferred assets do not flow into tax-exempt funds, Taggartsaid.    Fidelity Management & Research Co. experienced net sales of $14 millionin November, including reinvested dividends, according to spokeswoman TeriKilduff.    But as of Dec. 21, Fidelity's tax-free funds had experienced netredemptions of $41 million - a development Kilduff blamed on investoranxiety over the delayed federal budget.    At Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., spokeswoman Marilyn Morrison said:"Municipal bonds continue to be pretty stagnant."    The largest outflows have come from the firm's national long-term fund,while its intermediate fund has seen the lightest redemptions, Morrisonsaid.    The firm attributes that pattern to investor perception that long-termfunds will suffer most in the event of major tax reform, she added.    By contrast, USAA Investment Management Co. benefited from the netsales trend identified by the ICI. Company president Michael Roth said thefirm's tax-free funds saw inflows of $41 million in November. Roth saidinvestors were attracted by the high yields reached by municipals due tothe market's rally and fear of tax reform.    Smith Barney Inc. has also seen its share of gains, said executive vicepresident Jessica Bibliowicz. December has emerged as the strongest monthof 1995 for its tax-free funds, which also posted gains in November, shesaid.    Investor confidence in portfolio manager Joe Deane is largelyresponsible, according to Bibliowicz.    "Being the number-one ranked fund doesn't hurt," she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CALIFORNIA DEBATES WHETHER TO LINK SCHOOL FUNDING TO BUILDING PRISONSBy Antonio A. PradoLOS ANGELES    Top California GOP lawmakers said they hope partisanpolitics don't get in the way as they reconvene today in hopes of passing aresolution by next Monday to place a $3 billion state school generalobligation bond issue on the March 26 primary election ballot.    Last year's legislative session ended in September with Republicans andDemocrats deadlocked over GOP insistence that school bonds be linked to aprison bond initiative.    That stalemate must be broken within the next few days, or the measureswill have to wait until November for the next opportunity to appear on astatewide ballot, according to California Secretary of State Bill Jones.    However, the same stumbling blocks that tripped up the bill inSeptember are still in place. While both sides agree on the need for schoolconstruction funding, a Republican bill to be introduced today byAssemblyman Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, nonetheless includes a $1.9billion GO bond measure for new prison construction.    "We have a need for school construction, and a need for prisonconstruction, and Republicans will propose a bill in the early part of thesession to do both," Brulte said in a press statement.    The Democratic school bond proposal does not include the prison bondprovisions. Both measures require two-thirds majority approval in theAssembly and state Senate for passage.    "The Republican approach is still to hold the schools hostage tobuilding prisons," said Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Los Angeles, who lastmonth succeeded San Francisco Mayor-elect Willie L. Brown Jr. as the lowerhouse's top Democrat.    "The Democratic view is (that) we need to build public schools toreduce class size," Katz said. "And after we deal with schools, then we'lldeal with prisons."    Aides to Brulte and Katz would not speculate on whether either sidewould budge and allow a compromise.    When the Legislature reconvenes today, the raucous Assembly will returnto a divided house and probable battles over its leadership.    With Brown's departure on Dec. 14 following his election as SanFrancisco mayor, the Assembly was left with 41 Republicans, 37 Democrats,one Reform Party member, and one vacancy.    The GOP will probably try to install Orange County assemblyman andparty leader Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, into the speakership, oustingBrian Setencich, R-Fresno. Republicans are wary of Setencich because he waselected in an overwhelmingly Democratic vote.    And while the more docile state Senate has 21 Democrats holding asimple majority control - with 16 Republicans, two independents, and onevacancy - Brulte's bond bill probably won't gain the 27 votes needed topass even that less partisan body.    Senate president pro tempore Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, said he opposesany linkage of school bonds to prisons, adding through an aide that hisparty caucus wants to curb what he called the "reckless spending" that hasmade California's prisons among the most expensive in the nation.    Meanwhile, education groups are urging lawmakers to cast politics asideand place school GO bonds on the March ballot.    The state Department of Finance has estimated that California's schoolcapital project needs at least $7 billion to refurbish aging facilities andbuild new schools to handle statewide enrollments estimated at 140,000 newstudents annually.    "If California's financial situation were more dire, I could understandmy colleagues' concerns," said longtime Assemblywoman Dede Alpert, D-LaJolla, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, and among thoseopposed to linking school and prison bonds. "But our classrooms are themost overcrowded in the nation."    She added that while California's debt levels are up, they are moderatecompared to some states.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996N.Y.C. ECONOMIC AGENCY POSTS ANOTHER BANNER YEARBy Christina Pretto     Increased business confidence in the local economy helped to make 1995another record year for the bonding arm of the New York City EconomicDevelopment Corp.    In one fell swoop last year, the city's Industrial Development Agencyused up its entire annual allotment of private-activity bond volume - $120million - to help finance a recycling plant on Staten Island for PrattIndustries, an Australian company.    That deal and others, including some scheduled to close this week,brings the agency's total issuance for the year to more than $864 million,just $7 million less than 1994's $871 million. Going forward, developmentagency officials expect 1996 issuance levels to resemble those in 1995.    The agency is able to exceed its annual allotment of private-activitybonds by using allocations built up in previous years and by applying forextra capacity from state private-activity reserves.    In 1995, the agency completed 39 transactions that ranged in size from$253 million to $1.3 million. In 1994, the agency completed 24transactions.    The numbers run in sharp contrast to issuance levels between 1987 and1993. The most bonds issued in the period was $417 million of debt in 1991.A more typical year was 1987, when the agency issued about $44 million ofdebt.    Corporation officials attribute the increase largely to a greaterconfidence in the economy on the part of small businesses and nonprofits,which has made the businesses more willing to take on long-term debt.Better marketing of the agency's programs has also increased demand, theysaid.    Indeed, corporation president Charles Millard said he would like morebusinesses and nonprofits - especially smaller ones - to take advantage ofthe Development Agency's ability to issue tax-exempt bonds to raisecapital. Such financing is viewed by city officials as an investment toolto revive the city's weak economy.    The Industrial Development Agency is a subsidiary of the EconomicDevelopment Corp., a public-benefit, quasi-governmental entity that ischarged with improving the city's business climate.    The Development Agency - among other programs - issues revenue bondsfor both businesses and nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations needing funds forcapital investment.    Both the corporation and the Development Agency have been at theforefront of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to retain and attractbusiness - and thus jobs and tax revenues, crucial to a city that in thelast five years has lost more than 400,000 jobs while battling to closechronic multibillion-dollar budget gaps.    The issue for Pratt Industries is a key transaction in Giuliani'sagenda to bring in new business. The agency plans to sell another $150million of debt for Pratt in 1996.    The agency also recently sold about $253 million of bonds to finance aco-generation plant for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a transaction that wasbegun nearly four years ago. Together, the two projects are expected togenerate more than 800 jobs.    But the agency is not focused solely on large deals - quite theopposite. The lion's share of its issues over the past two years have beenless than $10 million, and have targeted smaller businesses and nonprofits,such as a $1.3 million issue for the Dance Theater Workshop, a Manhattandance group.    "I want more not-for-profits and small businesses to know we'reavailable," Millard said in a telephone interview. "If they can get accessto capital, then they can have an opportunity to grow."    Many of the smaller issues are unrated and privately placed with fundsthat are familiar with agency programs and need to diversify theirportfolios with small blocks of debt that are still triple- or double-tax-exempt. The bonds are rarely traded and instead are held to maturity.    To facilitate many of the agency's debt transactions, the corporationmust first acquire a title interest in a client's property. Suchacquisition creates a public interest in the business and legally justifiesthe issuance of tax-exempt bonds.    Issuance is also subject to allocation of New York State's allotment ofprivate-activity bond capacity. Of the state's $900 million annual private-activity capacity, the city's Development Agency receives $120 million ayear.    The agency may also apply for reserve allocation, which the state setsaside every year, totaling $300 million. Both state and local agencies maydraw from the reserve on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by thestate Economic Development Department, headed by Charles Gargano.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996S&P SAYS UPGRADE FOR N.Y. WILL COME WITH BUDGET BALANCEBy Christina Pretto    Standard & Poor's Corp. last week said New York State is in line for anupgrade to A from A-minus if Republican Gov. George Pataki succeeds inpushing through plans to cut spending and impose structural balance for thefiscal 1997 budget.    However, the rating agency warned that an upgrade to above the A-levelis years away because the state has yet to demonstrate a commitment tofiscal responsibility over an extended period.    Market reaction to the statement was virtually nil, as holiday doldrumskept trading activity low, several traders said.    "New York paper is pretty stretched as it is," one trader said. "Ithink everybody is into a holiday mode."    Nonetheless, market participants have been grumbling over the past fewmonths that the state - the lowest rated in the country by Standard &Poor's - is due for an upgrade as it embarks on a path of tax cuts coupledwith spending reductions.    The upgrade to A - if it happens - will occur in or around March.Richard Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's, said in an interview lastweek that the positive outlook on the rating would be removed at aroundthat time.    "We're going to make a determination as to whether the rating is A orA-minus in March," Marino said. "At that point we'll take the positiveoutlook off the rating and replace it with a stable outlook."    An upgrade to A will hinge on the state's enacting a structurallybalanced budget that reduces general-fund spending, like that currentlybeing proposed by Pataki, Marino said.    Whether that happens, however, is subject to significant risk,including legislative opposition to cuts in social service spending anduncertainty surrounding changes in federal funding for entitlementprograms, Marino added.    Moody's Investors Service already rates New York State's generalobligation bonds A.    Overall, Standard & Poor's praised Pataki's proposed $63.3 billion all-funds budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 - particularly theadministration's effort to introduce the plan a month ahead of schedule.    "This was an extremely difficult task given the uncertainty surroundingthe federal budget," the rating agency said in a statement.    The plan also calls for reducing state general-fund spending for thesecond straight year, moving budgeting to a cash basis, and balancing taxcuts with cuts in spending, particularly in Medicaid.    Separate but related budget initiatives include a proposal by Patakithat both the executive and legislative branches agree on one set ofrevenue estimates for budget deliberations, which rating analysts saidwould be a step in the right direction.    "Any serious movement ... to this method of revenue forecasting wouldbe viewed positively," Standard & Poor's said.    Currently, the two parties constantly haggle over revenue estimates,which are often revised upward simply to accommodate an unwillingness toreduce spending. As a result, deficits are exacerbated, credit analystssaid.    The governor has also proposed constitutional amendments to require:the Legislature to enact a balanced budget; the governor to propose theexecutive budget by Dec. 1; and the enactment of an austerity budget whenthe budget is passed late, rather than the use of emergency appropriations.    "While these initiatives are very long-term in nature ... if carriedthrough, (they) could position New York to have a credit rating more inline with other states in the country," the rating agency said.    But the state must do a few other things to garner an above-A rating,Marino said, suggesting an elimination - or significant drawdown - of thestate's $4 billion accumulated deficit, and years of on-time budgetenactments.    "An above-A level wouldn't happen before the end of the century,"Marino said. "We're looking for long-term actions."    But some market observers argue that the Pataki administration'swillingness to fight for spending reductions and tax cuts deservessignificant recognition from the rating agencies.    "It's ridiculous. We're below West Virginia and Louisiana," said oneanalyst. "Come on."

While a number of states have the resources to make up for the overdueaid from Washington, a prolonged stalemate between Congress and thepresident could put other states in the same fix as New Jersey, said HymanC. Grossman, a managing director for Standard & Poor's Corp.    With no agreements on appropriations for federal departments governingMedicaid, Medicare, welfare, or job training - the most significantprograms sending money to the states - many states have been spending theirown funds on those programs since the federal fiscal year began Oct. 1.    Yesterday, New Jersey completed the second - and final, according tostate Treasury officials - installment of a $505 million short-term cash-flow borrowing authorization by issuing a $250 million commercial paper taxand revenue anticipation note.    The issue was rated A1-plus by Standard & Poor's and Prime-1 by Moody'sInvestors Service. A line of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland ensuredadequate liquidity for the commercial paper program, and helped secure thehigh ratings, rating agency analysts said.    On Dec. 5, New Jersey issued $200 million in commercial paper Trans asa result of the cash-flow pressure caused by delay in aid from Washington,state officials said.    A spokeswoman for the state treasurer said that while the state ispermitted to borrow $505 million, the $450 million in commercial paperTrans should cover for the absence of federal assistance.    Of the programs that receive federal aid, New Jersey's Human ServicesDepartment faces the greatest potential for disruption, Grossman noted.Most of the proceeds from the commercial paper will go to human services.    "Different states are handling effects of the budget impasse indifferent ways," Grossman said. "Most states are handling the cash-flowproblems internally. They can move money around - apparently with lessdifficulty than New Jersey. But some states have legal restrictions on theability to borrow internally."    Florida is one state that has been able to successfully transfer moneywithin its borders to cover the delayed federal aid, Grossman said.    "In effect, what Florida has done is advance money to service providersthat ordinarily would have been paid from federal money," Grossman said."When and if the federal budget gets straightened out, federal money willflow down to Tallahassee and then the state will reimburse from whence theyborrowed."    New Jersey doesn't have constraints that prevent borrowing internally,Grossman said. But state officials probably concluded that it was lesscostly to issue debt than to shift money around internally, he said.    "When you borrow internally, you have to pay a taxable rate," Grossmansaid. "It's cheaper to go out and issue tax-exempt commercial paper."    The commercial paper Trans should cover the state's liquidity for atleast six weeks, said David Alter, an assistant vice president withMoody's.    "It should be said that the state has adequate reserves to maintain thedifference from that shortfall," Alter added. "The month-ending balance forJanuary is sufficient even without the cash-flow borrowing. It's topreserve proper liquidity, because at some point in January, the statewould normally experience a low point anyway. This borrowing is a littlemore than usual, but they expected to do it anyway."    At this point in time, both Grossman and Alter said that no otherstates have accelerated their issuance as a result of the federalgovernment shutdown. But they do expect other states to follow suit if theimpasse lasts through January.    On Dec. 22, Congress passed a continuing spending resolution that willexpire midnight Jan. 3. The programs operating under that resolution areAid to Families With Dependent Children, veterans benefits, and the budgetfor the District of Colombia.    "Of course, this is America and this thing will get resolved at somepoint and by the time February rolls around, cash-flow estimates show alarge bump up in revenues," Alter said. "So while the situation isdifficult for New Jersey, it is by no means desperate."    Amy B.

Merrill, top lead manager in 1993 and 1994, dropped to second positionfor that category but took the top honor among co-managers.    The figures also show long-term bond sales totaled $156.22 billion in1995, helped by a strong close to the year. The figure was higher than mostmarket observers had expected but still 5% below the $164.5 billion sold in1994, according to Securities Data.    In December, state and local governments sold 818 issues totaling$16.76 billion, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed inDecember 1994, Securities Data said. Private placements are included in allvolume figures but not the underwriting rankings. (See article on page 3.)    Last year Goldman Sachs lead managed 307 issues, totaling $19.83billion. That accounted for 12.8% of the $154.94 billion of long-term bondssold through negotiated and competitive underwriting during the period.    Merrill Lynch lead managed $17 billion in 1995, followed by SmithBarney Inc. with $12.98 billion, PaineWebber Inc. with $12.71 billion, andLehman Brothers with $9.83 billion.    Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been in a dogfight for the top ofthe municipal underwriting rankings since 1987. Merrill, which last won thecrown in 1994, has won five out of the last nine years. But Goldman easilyprevailed in 1995, not only taking first place for the year as a whole butalso grabbing each quarter's top honors.    In co-manager rankings, where each manager in an issue is given creditfor the full par value of the sale, Merrill Lynch led in long-term bondsales, with 779 issues totaling $45.9 billion, followed closely by SmithBarney with $44.88 billion.    After them came Goldman Sachs with $44.57 billion, PaineWebber with$41.63 billion, and Lehman Brothers with $35.61 billion. Merrill last wonthe co-manager rankings in 1989. PaineWebber has dominated from 1990 to1994 as top co-manager in municipal underwriting.    By a large margin, New York City was the leading issuer of long-termbonds in 1995, with 14 issues totaling $5.42 billion. It was the biggestseller of debt from 1991 to 1993, but was eclipsed by the state ofCalifornia 1994.    The New York State Dormitory Authority was second in 1995 with $1.79billion of long-term bonds sold, followed by the New Jersey TransportationTrust Fund Authority with $1.59 billion.    Connecticut followed with $1.56 billion, and the Foothill/EasternTransportation Corridor, Calif., with $1.51 billion.    California fell from first in 1994 to ninth place with $1.25 billion.    Except for the second quarter, where Foothill/Eastern was the topissuer, New York City led every quarter in 1995.    Securities Data's long-term bond rankings are based on issues withfinal maturities of 13 months or longer, while short-term rankings arebased on issues maturing in under 13 months. Municipal forward sales areincluded, but private placements, remarketings, and taxable debt issueddirectly by private nonprofit organizations are excluded. The rankings aresubject to revision.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996SAYING GOODBYE TO 1995, PLAYERS HOPE FOR QUICK PRIMARY PICKUPBy Michael Stanton    After a week of solid gains despite light post-holiday volume,municipal market players say they are looking forward to a rise in activitythis week to validate prices' climb.    Last week's almost dormant primary market is expected to be replaced bya more active new-issue sector starting tomorrow, but although the calendaris heavier, several underwriters noted that many of the deals planned forthis week are refundings whose ultimate timing will rely on the market'sperformance.    Leading that list is an insured $155 million electric system revenuerefunding issue for Sikeston, Mo., that is scheduled to be priced in thenegotiated sector by lead manager A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.    An underwriter at the firm said the deal - originally planned for lateDecember before the market deteriorated under the weight of a supply surge- has returned to the calendar for next week, but could be delayed again.    "We put it on the calendar, but the market's going to have to tell uswhen it's going to be priced," the underwriter said.    Other significant deals on the negotiated calendar for this weekinclude an $89.3 million general obligation public improvement refundingbond issue for Richmond that is set to be priced by Goldman, Sachs & Co.    Meanwhile, Smith Barney Inc., as senior manager, plans to price a $66.4million sales tax revenue refunding issue for the Riverside County, Calif.,Transportation Commission. The deal is set to be insured by FinancialGuaranty Insurance Co.    In other negotiated action, Goldman Sachs will return to the market assenior manager for a $65 million hospital revenue refunding issue forIntegris Health Systems in Oklahoma. The deal is set to be sold withinsurance from AMBAC Indemnity Corp.    The competitive sector, meanwhile, will gear up for a $127 millionrefunding from Clark County, Nev., on Thursday, while a long-awaited $183.9million Florida Board of Education refunding remains on 24-hour notice.    In Thursday's secondary market activity, traders said municipal priceswere unchanged to up #1/4 of a point in light trading, with what demandthere was coming from other dealers, while major buy-side participantsmoved into a "holiday mode" ahead of Friday's early close and the longweekend for New Year's Day.    Although traders uniformly cautioned that the week's gains were basedon very thin trading activity, most said the slow primary market supply andlight forward calendar, lent the market a firm tone going into the newyear.    "The primary's not going to be dead like it was this week, but it'sstill going to be relatively quiet, so from the supply side of things, Ithink we still have a good tone," another trader said.    The Bond Buyer's 30-day visible supply of new issues expected to cometo market within the next month totaled $2.29 billion Thursday, up $141.4million from Wednesday. That comprised $1.06 billion of competitive issues,up $141.4 million, and $1.23 billion of negotiated issues, which wasunchanged.    Standard & Poor's Blue List of dealer inventories fell $119.9 million,to $1.44 billion.    With the impasse over the federal budget causing a suspension in datareleases from the Commerce Department and Bureau of Labor Statistics,fixed-income players were forced to turn to several privately compiledsources for insight into the economy's health.    Although data on the number of initial unemployment claims for the weekof Dec. 18 was delayed, the Conference Board reported that its index ofhelp-wanted advertising volume fell four points to 127 in November, whichis considered to reflect a drop in the supply of jobs and a slowingeconomy.    The signs of economic weakness helped government market traders sustaintheir week-long rally, pushing the 30-year Treasury bond through the 6%psychological barrier, where it stayed for the remainder of the session.Late Thursday, the long bond was quoted up #12/32, to yield 5.98%.    But both the Treasury and municipal markets' attention remained focusedon Washington, with players voicing hopes that the stress of the governmentshutdown, along with the rapidly approaching presidential primary season,would lead to a quick agreement between White House and congressionalleaders to balance the budget.    The debt futures markets moved up in line with the cash markets'bearish tone, although the municipal futures contract continued tounderperform the Treasury contract. The March municipal contract closed up#9/32 Thursday, to 120#23/32.    But the MOB spread widened again, and was calculated at negative 13Thursday, compared with negative nine Wednesday.Back to Headline List WT02-B38-12IA086-000616-B020-274http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi65.html 205.156.212.5 19970122004946 text/html 24576HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:47:50 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:15 GMTContent-length: 24389Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi65.html Sample Issue Copyright CALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNet January 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES MUNI BRIEFS (793 words) LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRIL (461 words) MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCING (207 words) POLLUTION AUTHORITY SELLS $11.2 MILLION ISSUE FOR RECYCLING (83 words) BANKAMERICA OPENS ATLANTA OFFICE (142 words) MERRILL LYNCH MOST ACTIVE UNDERWRITER IN 1995 (539 words) MARKET WRAPUP SNOWFALL IN EAST BOOSTS BAROMETER (164 words) DEAL TALK MENLO PARK ISSUE ENJOYED RIGHT TIMING (266 words) LOCAL FOCUS SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING (145 words) SACRAMENTO UPDATE LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURES (476 words) CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MUNI BRIEFSFirst-time buyers of municipal bonds are quick to pick up on theapparent contradiction of double-A-rated bonds yielding less thansupposedly more secure triple-A insured bonds, according to Robert W.Chamberlin, senior vice president and chief municipal analyst for DeanWitter Reynolds Inc.     While Chamberlin and other analysts agreed there is no simpleexplanation, they all said supply and demand is a major factor behind thedifference, typically four to eight basis points.     "In pure economic terms, a lot of anything tends to cheapen theprice -- even with something that (in theory) should be high-priced,''Chamberlin explained. "That clearly is what is happening with triple-Arated bonds.''According to the Public Securities Association, almost 45% ofnew municipal issues came to market with insurance in 1995.-- Jon BirgerRep. Richard Baker, R-La., is working on separate legislativeproposals that would dramatically change municipal market disclosure andmake it harder for municipalities to file for bankruptcy.     The legislation, which is still being drafted but could beintroduced during the next few weeks or months, stems from a hearing onOrange County that was held last July by the House Banking Committee'scapital markets subcommittee that Baker chairs, an aide and other sourcessaid this week.     Baker had said after those hearings that he planned to introducelegislation to improve municipal disclosure and to make it more difficultfor local governments to file for bankruptcy.     It is not yet clear what support Baker would have for thelegislation from congressional committees that have jurisdiction over theseissues or from municipal market groups.     But the Public Securities Association and Government FinanceOfficers Association plan to consider the draft disclosure bill at meetingslater this month, officials with those groups said. --  Lynn Stevens HumeEnvironmental and transportation bills important toinfrastructure finance are expected to see a lot of congressional activitythis year -- but not necessarily passage.     Lobbyists and analysts give flow control and drinking waterbills better chances for final action than reauthorization of the CleanWater Act. On transportation, the House is expected to take more initiativethan the Senate in laying the groundwork for next year's debate onreauthorizing a major 1991 highway law.     Analysts Debra Coy and Gregg Orrill of Washington Analysis,which is part of the investment banking arm of the HSBC Group, said in arecent report that drinking water and flow control bills, along withSuperfund legislation, "continue to be our best bets for completedenvironmental legislation by mid-1996.''-- Martha M. CananPotential changes in federal funding will move to the frontburner as the number one item affecting state credit ratings in 1996,according to a report from Moody's Investors Service released earlier thisyear.     Health care and welfare are the areas in which state creditquality is most vulnerable, the rating agency said, emphasizing thewidespread reliance of states on federal support -- and voter pressure forlower taxes.     But Moody's said ratings changes this year do not have to be allone-way.-- Peter ListThe National Association of Bond Lawyers is calling on federalregulators to withdraw the long-pending private-activity bond rules, offera new set of proposed regulations for comment, and move quickly to makethem final.     Although a number of issuer groups have suggested re-proposingthe private-activity bond rules, this is the first time the bond lawyersassociation has called for a newly proposed set of regulations since therules were first published in December 1994.For a number of reasons, "including the significance of thisregulatory project and its widespread impact on state and localgovernments, we believe that re-proposing the proposed regulations withmodifications and amendments would be the most prudent way to proceed withthis project,'' NABL said in a letter released earlier this month.-- JoanPrydeRep. Christopher Cox is working with the Securities and ExchangeCommission to draft legislation that would simplify municipal disclosureand make it more like corporate disclosure without repealing the TowerAmendment to the securities laws.     The draft legislation may also propose setting federalrequirements for municipal financial reporting, accounting, and auditing.     "The idea would be to avoid any conflict with Tower and to avoidthe imposition of any new costs'' or burdens on issuers and other marketparticipants, Cox, a Republican from Orange County, said in an interviewJan. 5.     Cox said he hopes to have a draft bill ready within 30 days todiscuss with state and local groups, the Public Securities Association, andother municipal market participants.     "I intend to work closely with the commission and withinterested market participants for an extended period before introducingthe legislation,'' he said.-- Lynn Stevens HumeThese news briefs were excerpted from CPF's sister publication,The Bond Buyer.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRILThe City of Los Angeles Department of Airports will sellbetween $90 million and $150 million in revenue bonds this spring to payfor a new terminal complex at Ontario International Airport in SouthernCalifornia's Inland Empire.     The financing team is already in place. The financialadvisers are Lazard Freres & Co., Charles A. Bell Securities Corp., andMarilyn L. Garcia. The agency was working with Lazard Freres' Los Angelesoffice before it closed. The firm's relationship with the city continuesfrom its New York office. O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles is bond counsel.     The Ontario bond issue, tentatively scheduled for April,will be for about $90 million if the department builds only two terminalsin the new complex and leaves space for a third structure to be builtlater.     But the city also sought construction bids for building allthree terminal buildings to see if it could get an attractive price, giventhe current weakness in the state's construction industry. Constructionbids are due Jan. 26.     If all three buildings are constructed at this time, theproject's cost will be $343 million, with bonds financing $150 million ofthe project, said Kathy Van Ness, deputy management analyst for thedepartment.     "We've been having some protracted discussions on thestructure of the bond issue," Van Ness said. The agency is discussing howto finance the project using airport revenues, passenger facility fees andfederal grants.     Last year, the department refinanced revenue bonds tied toLos Angeles International Airport so it could remove covenants thatprohibited the use of airport revenues for non-airport uses and restrictedthe transfer of airport revenues to the city's general fund. In addition toLAX and Ontario, the department also runs the city's Burbank Airport andPalmdale Airport.     In last summer's bond sale, the department includedinsurance at the bidder's option that was provided by FGIC. It's uncertainwhether the agency will offer enhancement on the Ontario issue, Van Nesssaid.     Ontario handles 6 million passengers a year in its fast-growing service area that includes five million residents and covers SanBernardino and Riverside counties, and portions of northern Orange Countyand eastern Los Angeles County. By comparison, 50 million passengers travelthrough LAX annually.     Ontario airport's lower profile among investors will be achallenge for the agency. Van Ness said she is considering offering anoptional tour of the airport and region to the ratings agencies.     Passenger traffic at the airport, located about 35 mileseast of Los Angeles, has increased steadily for the past decade.     In 1975, 1.29 million people used the airport. In 1993, 6.2million travelers used the airport and 353,000 tons of air freight wereshipped from the facility. The new terminal complex will provide capacityfor 12 million passengers.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCINGThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern Californiaspent much of last week watching interest rates, waiting for theopportunity to sell a $200 million refunding issue.     "We need to get down to record low interest rates to dothis deal," said Bert Becker, chief financial officer for the MWD. AsCalifornia Public Finance was going to press Jan. 10, Becker said interestrates were about "20 basis points away from our target."     "There's still some optimism from several economists andbrokerage firms that there's still some hope for a rally," he said from hisLos Angeles office.     Becker, who described the market-sensitive bond sale as a"day-to-day, week-to-week" situation, said he's hopeful the deal will becompleted this month.     Smith Barney Inc. is the underwriter. O'Melveny & Myers andRobinson & Pearman are co-bond counsel. Hawkins, Delafield & Wood isdisclosure counsel and Fulbright & Jaworski is underwriter counsel. O'BrienPartners Inc. is serving as financial adviser.     Bond proceeds will be used for both advanced and currentrefundings.     The refunding will include a 1991 offering that helped pay forwork on the district's Eastside reservoir project and Jensen treatmentplant.

"We're looking for additional people -- and it's a buyer'smarket right now -- so I'm taking my time," said Anthony J. Taddey, seniormanaging director.

Merrill Lynch & Co. topped the list of lead underwriters inCalifornia for full-year 1995 despite its ties to Orange County. MerrillLynch worked on 40 bond issues in California totaling $3.3 billion, givingthe firm a 16.5% share of the market. Issuers the firm worked with lastyear included the State of California, the San Diego County RegionalTransportation Commission, San Bernardino County, Los Angeles County, andthe City of Long Beach.     "We hope to see more issuance at the state level" thisyear, said H. Cody Press III, managing director and manager at MerrillLynch in Los Angeles.     Other players also see increased activity this year.     "I see volume about 10% higher than last year nationally,and maybe a little higher in California because our recovery is underway,"said Anthony J. Taddey, senior managing director at BA Securities Inc. Healso anticipates a very strong note season in California this summer.     Michael P. George, managing director at J.P. MorganSecurities Inc. in San Francisco,  said he expects "clients will continueto be very judicious about bond issuance."     "There will be more strategic financing and less clean,plain-vanilla financings," he said, adding that issuers will be under evengreater pressure to do more with fewer dollars.     Merrill Lynch was followed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. as themost active underwriter in California last year. Goldman worked on 27 dealstotaling $2.3 billion for an 11.4% market share.     PaineWebber Inc. followed with a 10.6% share of the market.The firm worked on 43 issues totaling $2.1 billion in principal amount.     Smith Barney Inc. was the fourth most active underwriter,handling 44 issues totaling $1.8 billion in principal amount. Smith Barneyheld 8.9% of the California market.     Rounding out the top five was Morgan Stanley & Co., whichhandled 10 issues totaling $1.6 billion. The firm captured 8.1% of themarket. Morgan Stanley's 1995 major clients included the City of San Diegoand the San Jose/Santa Clara Clean Water Financing Authority.     Among bond counsel, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in SanFrancisco captured the top spot in both California and nationally.     "While Orrick has been ranked number one for seven of thelast eight years, holding that position for 1995 is particularly gratifyingin light of the nearly 50% reduction in dollar amount of debt issued by theState of California," said Roger Davis, chairman of Orrick's public financedepartment. Davis also anticipates the state will be a more active issuerthis year.     Orrick served on 215 issues with a principal amount of $8.3billion, giving the firm a 41.4% market share. Following Orrick was JonesHall Hill & White; Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth; Pamela S. Jue P.C.;and O'Melveny & Myers.     The most active financial adviser last year was PublicFinancial Management Inc., which worked on 30 issues in California with aprincipal amount of $2.9 billion, giving the firm almost 15% of theCalifornia market.

Among the larger deals underway in California last week was thetentative sale of $200 million in revenue bonds from the Metropolitan WaterDistrict of Southern California. The district was waiting for lowerinterest rates to complete the transaction, which is being handled by SmithBarney Inc. (See story on Page 1.)

The deal was among the first out of the gate this year,coming to market on the morning of Jan. 2.     "We priced it first thing Tuesday morning, right after theholiday," said Richard G. Kiss, a managing director at Piper Jaffray Inc.in San Francisco.     Trading got off to a quiet start that day, but by middayactivity picked up.     "We did exactly the right thing because I don't think wecould have achieved those levels" later in the week, Kiss said, adding thatthe final decision to price Tuesday morning was made at a 6:30 a.m.conference call that day.     Cadmus Hicks at John Nuveen & Co. in Irvine also noted that"the deals priced earlier in the week did extremely well."     Menlo Park wanted to achieve $1 million in present-valuesavings through the refinancing of bonds originally issued in 1988 and1992. The Silicon Valley community achieved that objective by realizing$1.04 million in present-value savings, Kiss said.     Menlo Park originally planned to sell the bonds in thesecond week of December, but the market moved away. Wishing to avoidpricing the bonds during the slow holiday period of late December, the citydecided to wait until this month to sell the bonds.     The original bond proceeds paid for improvements in housingprojects, a senior citizen center, and other capital improvements in theredevelopment area in the city's Belle Haven neighborhood, said UmaChokkalingam, Menlo Park's finance director.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSINGSan Francisco Mayor Willie Brown announced in his inauguraladdress Jan. 8 that he is considering financing $150 million in affordablehousing.      Details were sketchy on how the bond financing would bestructured. In his speech, Brown suggested that some of the money would beraised through a tax-increment bond issue.      Word has it that San Francisco's new mayor is considering a$100 million general obligation bond issue and a $50 million tax-incrementissue, tied to the city's Golden Gateway Project Area.      Brown also noted in his inaugural address that the citymust invest in its infrastructure, with or without state and federaldollars.      Brown's reference to infrastructure is another sign thatpublic finance issues will get more attention from the general public thisyear as San Francisco and other California cities try to meet publicservice demands with increasingly scarce dollars and debt capacity.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURESThe California Assembly elected a new speaker and agreed toplace a $3 billion school bond measure on the March ballot when itreconvened Jan. 3.     The Assembly elected Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, to bethe body's fourth speaker in the last 12 months after ousting BrianSetencich, R-Fresno, who held the position with primarily Democraticsupport.     The school bond measure received a vote of 68-to-6 in favorof placing it on the March ballot. The proposal died in the final hours ofthe 1995 session when Republican lawmakers linked their support of schoolbonds to Democratic support for prison bonds.     The $3 billion bond measure for the March ballot wouldprovide more than $2 billion for school rehabilitation and construction and$900 million for improvements to state college and university campuses.     The outcome of the election is somewhat uncertain,especially given voters' current mood to limit government spending and tokeep tax dollars at the local level, instead of sending them to Sacramentoand Washington.     At the forefront of the effort to persuade voters toapprove the school bond measure will be the California State PTA.     "There are a lot of people who are concerned aboutgovernment debt, and it's not a concern to be taken lightly," Betty DeFea,director of legislation for the PTA, acknowledged. "It's like personal andcorporate debt, however. You have to realize what it is you're going intodebt for and then assess whether it's worth the financial risk."     "Schools and children are worth that up-front investment,"she said. "It's wise not to put ourselves in bonded indebtedness foreverything we want, but some things we need."     Education was also a priority reflected in Gov. PeteWilson's proposed $61.5 billion budget, which was announced Jan. 10. Wilsonproposed spending more money on schools, canceling fee increases atcolleges and universities, and providing a tax cut for almost everyCalifornia resident.     The governor is asking Californians to approve $7.8 billionin bond measures to help pay for new schools, prisons, juvenile jails andthe replacement or seismic retrofitting of state roads and bridges.     State Treasurer Matt Fong and Finance Director Russ Gouldwill be going to New York later this month to discuss the state's financialplans, among other matters.     "While infrastructure needs require $7.8 billion inadditional debt, those bonds will be issued by my office in a prudentmanner, balancing the necessities with our ability to pay for them," Fongsaid.     "Californians may be in a better position to take on morebonded debt because our economic outlook remains positive," he said. "Forthe fifth year in a row, revenues exceed general fund expenditures,demonstrating that government spends within its means."     "The investment community does recognize our state'simproving performance. Often our bonds trade at the double A rate, ratherthan at the single A rating," the treasurer said.Back to Headline List WT02-B38-13IA086-000616-B020-299http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi24.html 205.156.212.5 19970122005000 text/html 30371HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:48:08 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:22 GMTContent-length: 30184Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi24.html Sample Issue Copyright CARD NEWS via NewsNet January 15, 1990 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FRONT PAGE NEWS TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARD MARKET IN 1990s (1422 words) Squeeze on small issuers (1155 words) STATES NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROM REQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS (348 words) CARDS CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINED OUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION (284 words) BRIEFS *New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and (150 words) *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia (204 words) *March 25-28: 1990 ABA Western Regional Conference for Bank (28 words) *May 19-22: IBAA Bancard's National Credit Card Conference (44 words) *May 29-June 1: Smart Card Applications and Technologies (32 words) BACK PAGE NEWS AIR TRAVEL CARD ADDING INTERNATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR WORLDWIDE PHONE CALL CHARGES (411 words) CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARDMARKET IN 1990s     With the credit card industry now in what has been termed"the third decade of card growth," a new agenda of challengesawaits it.  The coming of the 1990s reinforces the rapid pace atwhich change occurred over the past 10 years and how competitivethe current marketplace has become.     The advances made in electronic processing capabilities inthe 1980s have set the stage for what are expected to be evenmore innovative and flexible payment systems ahead.  "As we buildthose, there will be the ability to offer a variety of paymentmechanisms--whether they be proprietary credit or proprietarydebit or just various other forms of credit programs," LarryMyatt, vice president of marketing and product development atSears Payment Systems Inc., told CARD NEWS.     Despite an electronic environment better able to affectchange, by way of providing more options to retailers andconsumers in a shorter period of time, there is still the need tofine-tune and clarify card product strategies.     The proliferation of products in the 1980s was designed tofit various  customer segments, card enhancements, warrantyprograms, airline discounts and frequent flier programs.     But some of what happened has resulted in major internaldivisions.     "We see every element of the business polarized," Alex Hart,president of MasterCard International, said about bank cards.     The industry is divided between issuers and acquirers, asplit seen as possibly eroding future cooperative efforts,according to an examination of card polarization and consol-idation, prepared by Edgar, Dunn & Conover Inc., the SanFrancisco-based management consulting firm.     An increasing portion of the industry is concentrated amongfewer participants in both the issuing and acquiring segments.Consolidation on the acquiring side has resulted inthe entry of third-party processors with little or no interest inthe issuing side of the business.  Moreover, the proposition thatbanking can retain control of the retail payment system in theupcoming years is very much open to debate.  The largest bankcard processor today by a substantial margin is not a bank butFirst Data Resources, a subsidiary--most troubling of all to bankcard issuers--of American Express.      The top 10 issuers of bank cards in the late 1990s probablywill not be banks, noted David Poe, a principal with Edgar, Dunn& Conover.  Of the top 10 acquirers at present, 4 of theprocessors on the acquiring side of the merchant business accountfor some 45% of the volume in dollars, he said.     In addition, processors have developed innovations aimed atcertain market  segments, such as electronic draft capture (EDC)and low-cost authorization.     Non-bank competitors such as American Express and Sears,Roebuck & Co. are gaining control of more point-of-sale (POS)terminals, as several banks have given up the merchant side ofthe business.     The card system is opening up to yet more competition.Namely, Ford Motor Co., General Electric (GE) Credit, HouseholdBank of Chicago, General Motors, and--potentially posing thegreatest threat of all--American Telephone & Telegraph Co.(AT&T).     The acquiring business is consolidating because of theinability of many banks to remain competitive in the merchantmarketplace.  "Rather than sell their portfolios to their bankingcompetitors, most banks have chosen to sell to non-banks," statedCharles Russell, CEO of Visa U.S.A.     One recent exception to that trend was the acquisition byCiticorp--one of the largest card processors--of the merchantcard business of FCC National Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary ofFirst Chicago Corp.  But many industry analysts think themerchant business will remain within banking only in rareinstances such as this.     Sears Payment Systems recently announced it will process the$60 million private-label card portfolio of Lochmere Inc., aretailer In Woburn, Mass.  Invading others' turfs     Deregulation in the 1980s provided the card industrytremendous freedom with regard to pricing flexibility.  Thedecade saw the emergence of annual and  other fees, competitivepricing, and much pressure on interest rates and annual fees fromnew entrants into the marketplace.     During the period, there were also the first signs ofsaturation, slow growth, and lower response rates to mailings.The merger and acquisition mania also began with Chemical Bank'sacquisition of Continental's card portfolio.   Bank cards begantrying to increase their share of the lucrative travel andentertainment (T&E) market long dominated by American Express,which made its own entree into the large, mainstream retailmarkets.     Another development of the 1980s, the issuing of securitiesbacked by credit card receivables, now accounts for billions ofdollars of securitized assets in this country.     Citicorp, which has securitized close to $8 billion in cardreceivables,  now is offering $750 million in bonds in itslargest overseas issue to date backed by receivables generated inthe United States.  Sears also is considering the distributionoutside the country of its own card outstandings.   In thepresent market, the name of the game is differentiation.  "Ourprime directive is to tailor products and services to meet thespecific consumer's needs," Russell said.     Segmentation became a buzzword in the 1980s as it pertainedto gold, affinity, business and student cards.  There was a newfocus on customer service by the card industry and a growth innational solicitations, spelling the end of only regional andstatewide marketing.     Bank cards now face increasing competition from all sides.In already trying to accommodate the demands of individual marketsegments, bank cards are accepted for payment in supermarkets,fast-food restaurants, movie theaters, parking lots, toll booths,and the health-care industry.  Part of the emphasis here is onspeed in the card authorization and purchase process.     When Sears introduced its Discover card in early 1986, thegrowth of consumer credit was at its peak, noted Carl Steidtmann,vice president for senior management and chief economist atManagement Horizons, a division of Price Waterhouse.     In the realm of differentiated offerings, Discover isselling a cashback feature that no other bank or non-bank cardhas.  Potential new products     But we may be entering a period when a similar opportunityexists for the introduction of new products.  The reason is thatthe burst of activity in the early 1990s probably will be thelast peak of credit growth in the 1990s, Steidtmann pointed out.     Others contend that new product introduction remainsincreasingly diffi-cult.  "We're not in the same cooperativerelationship that we all used to be in when everything was donewithin the banking community," said Poe.     In this decade, many observers say, it will be necessary tobetter understand the data reflecting what is taking place withinthe customer base that bank cards now have.  Financialinstitutions will need information even more to manage the riskof credit cards, noted Donald Auriemma, president of AuriemmaConsulting Group in Garden City, N.Y.     The 1990s will see, for the first time in a decade and ahalf, a rising savings rate, Steidtmann said.  This will happenprimarily for reasons related to demographics.     The savers currently are people between ages 45 and 60.  Thesavings rate did not decline due to tax law changes, individualretirement accounts (IRAs), or even societal greed, Steidtmannsaid.  The real reason was demographics because in the 1980s thenumber of people in the key savings sector went down.  In theprevious decade, the growth of installment credit wasunprecedented, driven largely by the demographics of the time anda fairly stable economic environment.  While the economy atpresent is robust, the 1990s has been projected as an era inwhich unemployment and the demand for credit will fall.     With low unemployment, people from a lower socioeconomiclevel will enter the mainstream of the economy, resulting in anincreased penetration of cards.  Aside from more savings, therewill be more looking for ways to reduce one's own creditexposure, Steidtmann said.  "What previously had gone into debtpayment and into the creation of debt will now go into savings,"he added.      Demographics, to the extent they indicate aturning against the credit culture, pose an unpromising picturefor credit in the 1990s.  The growth ofincome also will have an effect on credit in the new decade.There will be average rates of growth in income but a significantchange in the distribution of income.     The demand for credit will decline, not relatively but inabsolute terms.  Households will not have the same demand forcredit as has been the case.     The issue of market share will become critical to third-party, bank, and proprietary cards.  The 1990s should see areduced demand for proprietary cards with the trend towardreducing credit.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990Squeeze on small issuers     Market share will be the essential component in any AT&Tcredit card product that enters the market.  The share and cardbase that AT&T could draw on, in terms of its calling cardpopulation, represents a huge potential marketing advantage.  Ifthe telecommunications giant offers a cobranded Visa card, forexample, it will most likely be at the expense of the cards thatcardholders already have.     In the 1980s, the growth of private-label credit cards wasnot nearly as great as that of bank cards.  There has been a movewithin the large sector of retailers to come back to private-label cards because of the enhanced marketing  capabilitiesprovided to them, such as target promotions and more informationabout the consumers who buy in their stores.     "Our perspective is that private-label credit cards orproprietary credit cards, merchants' own programs, probably willnot grow in terms of total numbers of accounts, as far as thebank card market will grow in the next few years," observed LarryMyatt of Sears Payment Systems.  Third-party bank cards     However, he thinks there is good growth prospect for thosethird-party processors--like Sears Payment--in devising privatelabel programs for merchants, as retailers look at the costsassociated with operating their own programs.  Therefore, a shiftfrom in-house to third-party operated programs is expected.     Those who maintain their own credit card system in-house nowwill look to third-party processors for other ways of maintainingthat capability because of the costs of new systems andequipment.  There is expected to be more movement  toward third-party processors maintaining the retailer card base than anychanges in or out of the private label business.     If strategic alliances can be formed between both creditofferers and retailers, the opportunity may be created for third-party offerings to develop  in the arena of bank card credit.This is probably the one component of the industry that willexperience growth in the 1990s, due to its ability to offer manyof the benefits of a proprietary card at the cost of a bank card,according to Steidtmann.     Such alliances will have to be based on joint marketing, onproviding information through the channel of distribution, thequality of service, the ability to bring customers to a retailerwho would not go there otherwise, and on a much less expensiveeconomic model.     This outcome is not likely to come about unless the view ofcredit and retail executives toward credit moves from competitionand confrontation to one of cooperation, Myatt added.     In terms of other payment mechanisms, many observers see anenormous untapped market for debit cards at the point of sale--inthe form of proprietary debit, automated clearing house (ACH)debit or direct debit.     ACH debit is expected to be a very active means of paymentin the 1990s, Myatt said.  Part of its implementation was delayedover the controversy in-volving Entree, the national POS debitmark that MasterCard and Visa had been jointly developing.     An antitrust lawsuit filed last summer by the attorneysgeneral in New York and in 12 states has stalled that programindefinitely, if not permanently.     ACH debit has been touted as a national debit card operatedthrough a bank card-like mechanism, as Entree was proposed to be.In addition, American Express or Discover could offer thisproduct with their own cards.     The other ACH vehicle is private-label debit, in which theretailer itself--California's Vons Supermarket is one example--isthe card issuer.  In the 1980s, the financial and retail sectorswere hesitant about whether banks would take the lead in debitcards or if that drive would be spearheaded by individualretailers.     It makes sense from a consumer standpoint to be able to havea debit card that can be used at a variety of retailestablishments, Myatt told us.     "Frankly, we have a lot of concerns about ACH-drivenproducts unless they are bank controlled and bank driven," saidMasterCard's Hart.     The origin of a proprietary debit environment is akin toprivate-label credit cards in that the objective is thegeneration of additional sales volume and added customerconvenience.   Proponents see private-label debit making sense insupermarkets where a lot of checks are now written, and atgasoline stations where there already exist examples ofproprietary debit cards.  New decade's trends     Some of the trends in the 1990s will no doubt becontinuations of existing  developments.  Insiders stress thatthe card industry must know the true net costs when features areadded to cards or efforts are made to attract different customersegments.  Additionally, the industry will require better productand customer profitability information, and it is looking towardthe development of systems that allow making those kinds ofdeterminations.     Further segmentation of card products needs to be in termsof segregating  between convenience users and revolvers.Questions to be addressed include  whether to increase spendingallowed on a credit limit, and permitting the use of a card on amonthly basis as a charge card--with a line of credit still thefoundation for an account.     The 1990s are certain to bring a substantial increase innon-bank card competition.  JCB, Japan's largest bank-issuedcredit card, is seeking to be-come a major world player and toincrease its merchant network outside Japan.     The card already is moving to overtake Diners Club.  JCB canoffer the card electronically, can come in and negotiate with arelatively few processors and reach a large percentage of retailestablishments.     One new product likely to emerge in the future is a coinreplacement card, or possibly a pre-paid card, for handling smalltransactions.     From all indications, there is strong interest in the UnitedStates in chip technology and, specifically, in the integratedcircuit chip capabilities of smart cards.  Unlike in Japan andEurope, the cards have no proximity to their source in the UnitedStates, and have been more difficult to implement. Smart cardsoffer potentially many variables and, for that reason, U.S. banksare less inclined to agree on the direction in which to proceed,noted Kevin Wilby, vice president of the retail transactiondivision at Business Modeling Techniques Inc. (BMT) in Rochester,N.Y.  On top of that, the first demand in this country would befor the institution of smart card standards--which poses a muchmore difficult task than the magnetic stripe that reflects astandard format, he said.     Consolidation and internationalization in the industry isexpected to continue, with more pressure to process transactionsinexpensively.  Besides controlling operating expenses, manyofficials see a need for behavioral scoring at the point of saleto minimize the number of declines in the system.  Theenhancement of this intelligence at the point of sale will be afactor in controlling credit losses.     Aside from network and communications enhancements tosupport this new level of intelligence in database management,the focus will continue on making investments in systems and onthe maximizing of efficiencies.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROMREQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS     A new law that took effect last week in New York state,reportedly the first of its kind in the nation, prohibitsmerchants from requiring customers to put their address ortelephone number on sales slips when making purchases by creditcard.     This controversial practice--along with that of recordingcredit card numbers on personal checks when a purchase is made bycheck--has been sharply criticized by consumer advocates, whohave maintained that merchants are exposing customers topotential fraud and are violating their personal privacy (CN,Oct. 30, 1989, p. 1).     The state law will "address the unauthorized disseminationof personal information," said Daniel Feldman, a stateassemblyman who sponsored the bill.  He also introducedlegislation last year that mandated carbonless credit card formsin New York.     While both the Visa and MasterCard associations appeareduneasy over con-sumers being made to write their card number, itsexpiration date and a phone number on checks, they have focusedmore attention on ending the requirement by  merchants that acardholder's phone number be written on a credit card sales draftin order to complete a card transaction.     The Bankcard Holders of America (BHA), a Herndon, Va.-basedconsumer education group, has urged the 2 bankcard associationsand the National Retail Merchants Association (NRMA), amongothers, to clarify and enforce policies to bar the current check-cashing policies of merchants.     Visa and MasterCard spokesmen have said the associationshave a limited ability to take action in response to these checkacceptance procedures.  The bank card industry has rules in placeto protect itself against liability for the use of a credit cardto pay for returned checks.     A number of merchants in the state were convincing customersthat their address and phone number were necessary to make creditcard purchases, Feldman  said, when the information actually wasbeing used to compile mailing lists.    One exception to the lawis that merchants who do not have the capability to verify acustomer's card electronically may still ask for a customer'saddress or phone number.  The penalty for violations of the lawis $250.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINEDOUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION     The Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), the Delaware affiliate ofChase Manhattan Bank, will acquire the credit card portfolio ofBank of Boston Corp. and its affiliate, Bank of BostonConnecticut.  In addition, Chase has acquired the majority of thecredit card portfolio of Investors Savings Bank of Richmond, Va.     The combined outstandings of the MasterCard and Visaportfolios represent  $660 million.  The Bank of Boston portfoliohas $625 million in outstandings, and the outstanding balances ofInvestors portfolio are approximately $35 million.     Last year, Chase also purchased the portfolios of MichiganNational Bank, Meritor Financial Group of Philadelphia, andLeader Federal Savings Bank in Memphis, Tenn.     Bank of Boston, in a move similar to the response of otherNew England institutions to the region's slumping real estatemarket, said it would write off about $300 million in loans forthe final quarter of 1989 and set aside about $280 million forother possible losses.  But the company predicted it would breakeven in the fourth quarter and earn a $145 million profit for1989, due in part to its decision to sell its credit cardbusiness, which has 675,000 cardholders.     Bank officials said the card business, while profitable,would drain financial resources that the bank would rather puttoward marketing other consumer products such as home equity,residential mortgages and education loans.     The Investors portfolio includes approximately 40,000MasterCard and Visa accounts.  The institution also has enteredinto an agent bank agreement with Chase under which it willcontinue to offer credit cards bearing the Investors name andlogo to its customers throughout Virginia.

Unlike the cardassociations, which are pushing stored-value applications, AmericanExpress has installed T&E (green or gold card), Optima and corporateaccounts on one card. Future applications might include electronicpurse and loyalty programmes, according to a source familiar with theprogramme.The microprocessor chip cards are produced by Solaic, a division ofFrench-based Group Sligos, and smart card terminals will be provided byUS manufacturer VeriFone and French producer Dassault Electronique.During the pilot, about 30 to 100 cards are being tested by employees.At the point of sale, a consumer inserts his/her card into a reader/pinpad, enters a personal code and selects to which account the purchasewill be billed. American Express' back office has already certified theVeriFone Omni460 base terminal and the SC450 smart card peripheral.The card is accepted at the company cafeteria but the test will beexpanded to include other sites within the World Financial Center, asource said. A table-service restaurant at headquarters will also testportable terminals manufactured by Dassault.American Express confirmed that since before Christmas, it has beenoperating a small employee test of a multi-application smart credit andcharge card. Fewer than 50 cards were involved, she said, emphasisingthat it was not a significant event in the opinion of the company.American Express has taken a leadership position within the Smart CardForum, a US-based multi-industry group set up to advocate thedevelopment of smart card systems. Robert Wesley, who is head ofinternational smart card business development at Amex, is a member ofthe Forum's executive board and head of the travel and entertainmentsubcommittee.Internally, smart cards comprise one section of an advanced paymentsgroup which also oversees ExpressNet, an on-line service which appearson America Online, a private online computer network.Another key Amex executive, David Boyles, is head of the prepaid cardsubcommittee in addition to leading information technology efforts atthe company's Utah-based Stored Value division, formerly known as theTravelers Cheque group.In addition, Boyles' group has internally posted several job openingsfor the Salt Lake City site, suggesting the division is preparing foradditional work and that smart card efforts may be consolidated inUtah. The Stored Value group oversees travellers cheques, Amex SpecialTeams, which install purse card systems on college campuses, and AmexTelecom, which is getting into the prepaid phone card business.In related news, American Express has secured the co-operation ofMasterCard for terminal interoperability.

Observers are predicting thatgrowth rates will continue in the 50 percent range in 1996.LandBank Visa cardOne of the new players in the market, LandBank of the Philippines,recently introduced its first credit card, the LandBank Visa card onNovember 13.To make the card more accessible to prospective cardholders, the incomerequirement for the card is P120,000 ($4,600), as compared to theindustry standard of P200,000. Explaining the rationale behind thisstrategy, Felicitas Mozo-Dimaano who heads LandBank's card business,said that there is a large well of "cardable people" who can be tapped.The LandBank Visa card entitles cardholders to savings on utility billswhen they use the card. In terms of settlement of their outstandingaccounts, special payment features allow cardholders to opt forpayments for costly items worth over P2,000 to be made in three-monthlyincrements, up to 24 months.In addition, a payment scheme known as Lite Payment Option, allowscardholders to make partial payment of their account of at least 10percent of their monthly purchases and cash advances. Cardholders canalso withdraw up to P20,000 a day from the bank's ATMs and ATMs fromthe Megalink-run network.PVB Visa cardThe Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), one of the Philippines' newestbanks, has also entered the credit card issuing business. An agreementwith Equitable Credit Card Network, an affiliate of Equitable Banking,has allowed the bank to issue a Visa card by using the former's cardprocessing capabilities in its card issuing business.PVB, a private commercial bank owned by 500,000 World War Two veterans,started operations in August 1992. It issues the Classic and theVeteran Gold Card, catering to both the middle and upscale markets.Existing playersAs competition increases, some of the more established players arelooking to consolidate their positions by introducing new products orenhancing existing ones.

In addition, the bank willcontinue to run its successful"Frequent User, Sure Winner" bonuspoint/incentive programme until mid-1996.Citibank, which has 300,000 cards in issue, is banking on its enhancedcustomer service to keep its top position in the market.

According to the survey, only 20percent of the 3 million Bahncard holders have opted for the paymentfunction which has been on offer since last July.It is three years since Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railwaysoperator, introduced the Bahncard, which costs DM220 ($153) and offershalf-price travel for a year.The product quickly attracted a customer base of more than 3 millionand so impressed the banks that they competed vigorously to provide apayment function: Citibank was finally selected as the Bahn'sco-branding partner and agreed to offer either a Visa or an Electronchip at no additional charge.Citibank acknowledged from the start of the marketing campaign lastJuly that the deal would be profitable only if cross-selling activitieswere successful. Since revolving credit is scarcely used, and there isno annual fee for the card, Citibank had no prospects of generatingadequate revenue from the card itself.The bank estimated that 50 percent of existing Bahncard holders wouldopt for either Electron or Visa functions and that 1.5 million to 2million new customers would be won. But Handelsblatt's survey indicatesthat the past six months have fallen far short of those goals.Citibank is refusing to comment on the Handelsblatt survey and alsodeclines to produce its own figures on the "improved" Bahncard, arguingthat the marketing campaign got off to a slow start. Deutsche Bahncommented that the marketing figures could not be analysed properlyuntil the product had been on the market for 12 months.The marketing campaign hit problems from the start. Citibank signed thedeal with Deutsche Bahn on the assumption that all cards wouldautomatically carry either the Electron or the Visa function. But afterprotests from consumer groups, Citibank said the payment option wouldbe provided only if customers expressly asked for them.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Visa has been awarded processing rights to Gesellschaft furZahlungssysteme (GZS), the Eurocard/MasterCard processing centre inGermany.In return, processing houses in the Visa camp, such as B+SKartenservice may process Eurocard/MasterCard payments, although thiswas previously the sole preserve of the GZS.The deal is regarded as a triumph for the GZS, which recognised sometime ago that it would in future have to compete with its member banksand their affiliates for card processing work. The bank-ownedorganisation responded by investing in new processing systems - andapplying for a Visa processing licence.Traditionally, most German banks issued Eurocard/MasterCard cards only,while Visa issuers such as BfG Bank and Berliner Bank were very muchthe exception. But now a number of institutions are offering bothEurocard/MasterCard and Visa. For the processing houses, this is achance to win the processing contracts for both Visa andEurocard/MasterCard, but also carries the risk of losing existingbusiness.The Visa deal is effectively an admission by the GZS that it is nowcompeting with its own member banks for processing contracts and can nolonger afford to exist on Eurocard/MasterCard business alone.In recent months most large banking groups have established some sortof processing capability and, as a result, some savings banks(Sparkassen) are reported to have cancelled their processing agreementswith GZS altogether.But the GZS believes the capability to process both Visa and Eurocardpayments will be crucial in future."Dual processing capability will bea benchmark for measuring the success or failure of card processinghouses," a statement said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

After three months, if the customer hascollected 50 points, then discounts may be given from 5 percent offcosmetics and jewellery to 2 percent off all other purchases."The discounts are the direct benefit to customers after three months,"Bosman said. Other advantages include cardholders receiving the ClicksChristmas catalogue before general release, information on specialsales and promotions and new product launches.South African retailer Dions had a similar loyalty store card a fewyears ago but this was discontinued."In South Africa there are a lot ofprivate label credit cards and some of them are incurring debt, so wedidn't want this problem. We want to use the card as a marketing tooland not be bogged down with maintenance," Bosman said.Interested customers can fill out their enrolment forms in-store wherethey are given a card number for immediate use. The card is then putthrough the cashier's till when paying for purchases and the cardnumber is linked to that sale. The card supplier to Clicks is BN CardTechnologies of Johannesburg.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It will initiallybe offered to selected customers of Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi withthree other Turkish banks coming on stream later this year.According to Derya Goknar, Europay's operations manager for EastEurope, "as time passed it became more difficult to differentiatebetween Gold and Classic cardholders. So we thought we would recreatethe distinction with the Signia card. We believe that in the next threeyears, 3,000 Signia cards will be issued."Europay already has 400,000 MasterCard cards in Turkey of which 55,000are Gold cards. It also has 2 million Cirrus/Maestro cards issued byits 22 member banks."Signia is not just a card product but is being positioned as a privatebanking product," Mehmet Sezgin, Europay's regional business managerfor Turkey, told CI. He added that about five Turkish banks areactively researching ways to offer private banking to their selectedclients. "Signia is the first product offered by those banks wanting toget into private banking and as such is the first product of its kindon the Turkish market," Sezgin said.A minimum credit limit of $50,000 is required in order to become acardholder and each application must be approved by the bank's board ofdirectors."Our market research in the last year-and-a-half gave a positiveoutcome. Yes, there is a market for the Signia card. The packagingaround Gold cards has not been successful and this has been eroding thehigher market segment for Visa and MasterCard," Sezgin added. Hemaintained that Eurocard/MasterCard cards have a transaction value 35percent higher than on Visa cards.It is expected that the annual fee will be set at $500 with an interestrate of 16 percent monthly. Inflation in Turkey is currently running athigher than 100 percent.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

TheEurocard-branded card is said to be generating three times as manysales as other credit cards.The card was launched in March 1995 and allows cardholders toaccumulate points which can be redeemed against the purchase of a Fiatcar or other services, such as Lufthansa flights.Roberto Culasso, product manager responsible for the Targa card at SanPaolo di Torino, said: "The product was the idea of Europay and wasinspired by the General Motors card. It has proved highly suited to theItalian market."The average annual expenditure on the Targa card was running at L2.5million ($1,500) and L3 million. At the end of last year, we estimatedthat average spending on the Targa card was L7 million to L8 million.The definitive figure will not be available until March this year, butI would not be surprised if it was higher than our current estimates,"Culasso said.Meanwhile, the number of Targa cards in issue passed the 100,000 markand additional partners are expected to join the points scheme,bringing the figure to about ten.Europay International pointed to the success of the card to illustratethe wisdom of its decision to work with the Italian banks."Targatypifies Europay's approach in Italy, where we are to committed toworking closely with the banks. We feel this is more effective thanmerely promoting our brand," said Gaetano Carboni, senior area managerin Southern Europe for Europay.Recent figures from Europay show that the Italian market is finallyshowing signs of growth. Transaction volume for credit and debit cardsin the Europay stable increased by 21 percent in 1995, while the numberof payments went up by 31 percent.The number of Europay products increased by 15 percent last year, withthe number of debit cards rising to 3.6 million and credit cards goingto 754,000.Visa, however, continues to dominate the market, with 4.7 million debitand credit cards in circulation and transaction volume of $7 billion.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Its logo is to appear as it does on theInternational Carte Bleue Visa card (at the bottom, on the right, justabove the hologram).The new design is an integral part of the Groupement Carte Bleuestrategy designed to relaunch the Carte Bleue brand in synergy with theprint advertising campaign launched last autumn in national magazines(See CI 142).The redesigning of the domestic-only Carte Bleue card appears as one ofthe major plans in support of the Groupement Carte Bleue's pressadvertising campaign in the national magazines, said the company. Infact, the overall design of the cards belonging to the Carte Bleuerange has to follow a certain logic and be coherent with the clearlydefined brand policy, it added.In addition to the appearance of the Carte Bleue logo on the front ofthe card and to the increased amount of space available for bankbranding, the other components of the changed design are as follows:- the horizontal hologram in the middle of the card is to become asquare hologram in the right-hand column, as on international cards,with the original design: this new hologram will appear on all Frenchbank cards designed for domestic use;- the CB logo, symbol of interoperability and of acceptance amongFrench retailers, will occupy the space at the top, on the right, abovethe hologram.Jean-Marc Bornet, chief executive of Groupement Carte Bleue, told CI:"This change in the visual aspect of the Carte Bleue Nationale (aproduct already in use among nearly 5 million customers), is part ofthe Groupement's long-term policy of concentrating the range of cardson the Carte Bleue brand, which is greatly appreciated by Frenchpeople."This focusing on Carte Bleue as well as the greatly increasedco-operation with Visa are the two poles of a policy designed toimprove the Carte Bleue members' profits through the increase in thevalue of their products".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It has also become one of the leading issuers of MasterCardcorporate cards in the US with 127,000 cards.The Illinois-based finance company initiated corporate card programmesfor its co-branding partners, including General Motors and two of itssubsidiaries, Electronic Data Services and Hughes Corporation.Household also issues cards for Ameritech, Palomar Products, and foritself.As part of the exclusive partnership, Carlson will market its cards tomultinational corporations based in the US starting this quarter, toEuropean countries in the second quarter and in Asia and elsewhere in1997. Household Limited, a credit card bank in the UK, gives thecompany a foothold in Europe. Carlson Wagonlit operates the CarlsonTravel Network, AT Mays in the UK and Viajes Ecuador in Spain.The Household deal is also a victory at the expense of First BankSystems, which was Carlson's co-brand partner from 1993. Thatrelationship ended in December. First Bank remains the leader amongbank T&E card issuers with 575,000 commercial cards and 250,000purchasing cards branded by Visa. American Express, however, dominatesthe commercial T&E market with more than 7 million cards.Carlson Wagonlit, which is based in Minneapolis and Paris reported $12billion in sales last year with 4,000 locations in 125 countries. Theagency will contribute its extensive corporate client list and itstravel service.A Household spokesman said the companies had created a fully integratedreporting package that goes beyond turnkey software provided byMasterCard.Co-branded corporate cards are a rarity, since T&E cards do not earninterest income from revolvers and so do not generate the same profitdynamics as consumer credit cards.Wells Fargo Bank and Cincinnati-based Star Bank last year introducedcommercial cards with travel rewards built in, but neither involved aleading player such as Carlson.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This stands for Citibank South Dakota, one of the New York Citymoney centre's issuing banks.Citibank has solicited customers with an unbranded Visa gold card thatmakes no mention of the bank, with the exception of some fine printamong the terms and conditions.   The offer represents a major shift instrategy for a bank that has heavily promoted its name for years. But abank spokeswoman denied that Citibank was changing its long-termstrategy of promoting the bank brand."It's not a strategy but rather a test to reaffirm how important thebrand is. We do things like this to gauge customer reactions," shesaid. The bank regards the test as being no different than offeringdifferent combinations of fee, service and interest rates to differentcustomers.In 1986, Citibank purchased the Choice card programme which featured arate lower than the standard Citibank Visa card but without any extrabenefits. It was offered to customers with exceptional credit recordsin the era shortly before the upsurge in competition.The CBSD card offered a 4.9 percent teaser rate for six months, noannual fee and up to $15,000 credit limit. The rate increased to 5.4percent above prime.In recent months, Citibank has invested more heavily in its cardsbusiness, which began growing in the latter half of 1995 after severalyears of stagnation. It has also been promoting its name in new ways,dropping its familiar Citibank Visa advertisements in favour of thebank name alone.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It plans to solicit theremainder of its portfolio by offering the same value-added rewardsprogramme for a fee.The result is a seven-tier rewards scheme whereby cardholders canredeem points accumulated through charge activity. The programme, whichfeatures rewards offered by retail, travel and dining partners, mirrorsone offered by its UK-based parent Midland Bank.Peter Davidson, executive vice president and head of consumer bankingat Marine Midland said it is essential to retain lucrative customersalready on the books. "The approach we take in customer management isone of determining who our most profitable customers are anddetermining what it is that attracts those people," he said.Marine Midland divides its portfolio into four categories of revenuegeneration: highly profitable; moderately profitable; marginallyprofitable, or those which cover variable costs; and the unprofitable,which do not cover fixed or variable costs.Davidson said Marine Midland is looking to "put a wall up" around itscore customers. "In most cases, 20 percent of the portfolio generates100 percent of the profits," he said. Those accounts that are marginalor unprofitable should be charged fees or higher rates to either makethem more profitable or encourage the customers to close their account.Because of the fierce competition in the market, it may be very costlyto replace one good customer. "If you have a highly profitablecustomer, that customer may generate upwards of $300, $400 or $500 ayear for the bank. To lose one of those, you might need ten averagecustomers. If you could spend on an existing account what you would ona new account, then that is well worth your while."The MarineAdvantage programme also addresses the attrition ofvalue-conscious customers, those who have been lured away by co-brandedschemes. "We already addressed the needs of price conscious and serviceconscious customers," he said.Marine Midland consumer research found cardholders preferred fun orout-of-the-ordinary rewards, and rewards that are attainable soonerrather than later. This self-branded programme is administered byMaritz of Missouri, a third party that developed card-based employeeincentive programmes.Davidson also said Marine Midland will test ways of getting rid ofunprofitable customers in the second quarter of this year. "Oneapproach is to price them, to the point where they accept the terms orleave - a $50, $75 or $100 fee," he said.All of this suggests that Marine Midland, too, hopes to tap into thebooming credit card business. The bank is just starting to make a dentin the marketplace, growing its loans by $300 million last year to $1.8billion in receivables, placing it among the 30 largest US portfolios."We see cards as a very profitable product, when managed properly, andwe feel it is still a growth business, what with the new uses that arecoming about."Still, Davidson acknowledged several danger signs that have emerged atthe end of 1995: a dip in consumer confidence and a slight rise inpersonal bankruptcies and charge-off rates."It may be time to be alittle cautious and concentrate on finding the best customers that areout there in the marketplace, given signs that the economy perhaps issoftening a little bit. I don't think there are any disasters out thereyet, but it's a good time to be prudent."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"Byall appearances, it's a win-win-win situation for Ford, Citibank andtheir marketing partners," said Bruce Brittain, president of theconsultancy."We have seen a net 7 percent growth in the number of accounts in thepast 12 months and evidence that their revolvers are carrying largerbalances. These are healthy signs for the portfolio," Brittain said.In a separate survey, Brittain also noted that American Express' OptimaTrue Grace has grown 45 percent since April or an additional 500,000accounts. The study suggested that American Express is reaching ayounger, less affluent segment than its traditional business.Meanwhile, the quietly successful General Electric Rewards card mayhave declined as much as 20 percent in the same six month period.Brittain says that once again, changes to the card's rebate schemestrigger cardholder behaviour. In this case, rebates were remitted as anannual cheque starting July 1995, rather than coupons to be used withmarketing partners. If a programme change is to blame, Brittainexplained, then he expects the portfolio numbers to rebound in thecoming months.Petrol rebate cards continue to perform well. Chemical Bank's Shell Oilcard enjoyed a 15 percent increase in accounts in the last nine months.Virtually all of the accounts are new to Chemical's portfolio (soon tobe called Chase Manhattan) and two-thirds were already Shellproprietary customers who were converted.According to the survey, the GE Exxon card has only attracted 250,000cards in its first year, a quarter of the size of the Shell programmeafter the same duration. Brittain found that Exxon, unlike Shell, didnot market the card to its entire proprietary portfolio.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Joseph A Giannone reportsWITH ADVERTISING and other marketing channels growing increasinglycluttered, credit card issuers and organisations are seeking toincrease their profile through sponsorship of major events. Sportingevents are being selected to market cards and the brands as well as tapinto some of the enthusiasm fans have for their sports.Exclusivity does not come cheap, however. According to IEG SponsorshipReport, a newsletter covering the sponsorship trade, Visa Internationalspent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights on theNational Football League, the Elton John tour and some destinationdeals.MasterCard is spending $10 million to $15 million towards the soccerWorld Cup in 1998, the National Hockey League and several golfcompetitions. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 millionin relation to World Cup 1994.Card sponsorships took off in 1984 when American Express was a leadingsponsor to the Olympics, according to Jim Andrews of IEG, a consultancyspecialising in sponsorships. But in 1988 Visa took over leadsponsorship and has subsequently generated great success by exploitingits exclusive sponsorship rights.Sponsorship activity grew heated this year, as the two associations andAmerican Express each landed one among three major sports leagues. InApril 1995, Visa announced its deal with the National Football Leaguewith an estimated value of $50 million over five years. Visa thissummer created tie-ins as the official card of Triple Crown horseracing.American Express in May signed on with the National Basketball League,paying $30 million for three years. It also signed a sponsorship dealwith the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of TexasStadium, though Visa has rights bestowed by the league.The most recent industry deal was scored by MasterCard in December witha four-year, $2 million exclusive deal with the National Hockey League.MasterCard is touting its gold cards at several title golf tournaments,such as the PGA Grand Slam and the Colonial.Likewise, the NHL hockey and NASCAR automobile racing circuit will beused to promote standard cards. Three more golf title sponsorships arepending, a MasterCard spokeswoman said.Visa and MasterCard continued their worldwide sponsorship commitments.Visa paid $40 million for the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.MasterCard seized on World Cup soccer as a global marketing platform.It paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 championships in France,according to IEG. A four-year package of associated sponsorshipsleading up to the games is worth $40 million.Credit card groups are not alone in seizing on sponsorship as a new wayof doing business, according to Jim Andrews, an IEG vice president.Sponsorship spending will top $5.4 billion in the US next year, 15percent more than the $4.7 billion projected to be spent in 1995.Sponsorships have become popular as a rallying point for everything acompany does. For MasterCard and Visa, the World Cup and Olympics haveformed the cornerstone promotions used by members as well as theassociations."In sponsorships, it's not just what you have, it's what you do withit," said Mava Heffler, MasterCard senior vice president in charge ofsponsorships. MasterCard, she said, has expanded its soccer sponsorshipto include a broadcast television soccer report and markets the brandas host of smaller events leading up to the World Cup championships."The current level of activity can be traced to the Olympics, in termsof what it has done for sponsors in a number of ways. Companies havefound that whenever they ran promotions to make donations to the teams,their usage went up," Andrews said.The big winner in all of this, though, may be Delaware-based MBNAAmerica, the second-largest bank card issuer in the US and king ofaffinity credit cards. At the same time as Visa secured the NFL spot,MBNA was chosen as the issuer for 30 professional football franchises.Likewise, MBNA has been tapped by MasterCard to issue cards for all 26hockey teams.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Joseph A Giannone reportsADVANTA IS joining the swelling ranks of US non-bank credit cardissuers that are expanding beyond national boundaries. Last year,Advanta formed a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland to issuecards in the UK. And that, according to Advanta International head JimAllhusen, is just the beginning."International business will be a key part of corporate expansion andit will be a major part of our strategy. We plan to be opportunisticwhen we find markets that are inefficient or stagnant," Allhusen said.Within the US, the limited-purpose credit card issuer based nearPhiladelphia has jumped into the elite top 20 while it continues tooutperform the industry. Advanta managed $11.9 billion in assets at theend of the third quarter, making it the 13th-largest issuer in the US.In the first nine months of 1995, the company added 1 million newaccounts for a total of more than 4 million.The company, which has its roots in making loans to educators inPennsylvania, has recruited several industry luminaries withinternational credentials. Most notably, former MasterCardInternational chief executive Alex "Pete" Hart joined in 1994 and wassubsequently named CEO of the company.Hart has since lured two association colleagues to join him: ArthurKranzley, formerly head of MasterCard's worldwide debit business, whocame on board in the autumn.Earlier this month, the company hired Hung-Fu "Hank" Chiang, who lefthis post as general manager of MasterCard China. Chiang also had workedwith Hart at First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles.Chiang, an American of Chinese descent, will report to James Allhusen,an executive vice president in charge of Advanta International, anewly-formed group. Allhusen, who ran consumer banking and cards forStandard Chartered Bank, came on board last year. His career includesstints in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.Allhusen noted that Hart, Chiang and he all have expertise and contactsin Asian markets. He said people were now in place to develop an Asianstrategy. When asked if a China strategy were in place at Advanta,Allhusen replied, "No, not yet."But company executives speak openly of plans for global expansion byway of joint ventures with indigenous partners in certain high-growthmarkets. Unlike Citibank, MBNA or Household International, which haveset up issuing banks in target markets, Advanta will seek to createventures with like-minded banks as it did with Royal Bank of Scotlandlast year."We believe Advanta has skills within the company which have made itvery successful in the US. We see opportunities in foreign markets touse those same skills to our advantage. My job is to find out whichskills are most transportable across borders and to find partners wecould work with in those markets," said Allhusen, naming RBS as anexample.Royal Bank, he said, "is just as committed to the success of theproposition, has a strong image, a strong brand and an infrastructureto support a cards operation. What we bring is a number of skills thathave not yet been developed in the UK market."In recent months, Advanta has been more aggressive in seekingpublicity, another sign that the company seeks recognition as a leadingcards player.Allhusen said the increase is coincidental, since the company recentlyhas had much to proclaim. Advanta has a motive in trying to earn thefavour of Wall Street to boost its share price, a tactic recentlyemployed by First USA.

The St. Petersburg-based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured productslike checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank willmarket home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might becomethe nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEOof Raymond James Bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically andelectronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial servicesso all (customers') financial services can be received from our firm," shesaid.     The bank's initial target market will be the securitiescompany's hefty customer base of some 300,000 clients.     "We'll be able to offer our clients several productchoices. We have the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweepaccount) option, and the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstadexplained. The Heritage funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.     The company will continue its tradition of not providingadditional incentive to brokers selling top proprietary products."Compensation is consistent for all three product options," Schefstad said.This compensation practice appears to have worked to the detriment of theHeritage fund family, where growth of the individual funds has fallenbehind other brokerage house proprietary funds, despite the company'snationwide branch network.     Schefstad said that James is the only broker/dealer towholly own a full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, whichmust resort to the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the bankingbusiness, James purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of$12 million from the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the companychartered the Raymond James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate inall 50 states.     The bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million inassets and $136 million in deposits.     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has beenwrestling with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies andintegrating the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.     "Because of who owns us, we've had to obtain regulatoryapproval for everything we've done. For example, when we developed ourconsolidated statement, we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosurepolicy and separation of accounts," Schefstad said.     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near itsheadquarters in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank'sefforts taking place electronically, particularly through the nationwideautomated teller machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATMhas yet to gain wide acceptance, but Schefstad said the firm's brokerageclients are sophisticated enough to understand and use direct-depositoptions available through the automated clearing house system.--John J.JedlickaBack to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SECOND PUERTO RICAN DEAL CAPS DECEMBER CALENDAREying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Ricobecame the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt inDecember.     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100million offering of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basispoints over Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. Thenotes, which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language,enabling a public-style execution of the offering without registration atthe Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resultedfrom S&P rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie Astor,chief financial officer.     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low ratesin December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank toissue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's firstindependent bond offering.     Jefferies & Co. captured the leading underwriting positionon the deal because of  its relationship with the bank, and Smith BarneyInc. acted as co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15insurance companies.     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part bythe bank's phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has hadan average return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since thebank's initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciatedin value by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billionasset bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter lastyear.     The deal for First Bank follows a first-time subordinatedoffering by another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in themonth. BanPonce Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in10-year subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparableTreasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston (see CFO Alert12/11/95, P.5)Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SUSQUEHANNA ADDING DEBT TO EQUITY TO FUND ACQUISITIONSeeking to fund its expansion efforts, SusquehannaBancshares Inc. recently issued shares of common stock and is prepping anoffering of senior notes that is expected to hit the market at the end ofJanuary.     "We're in the process of acquiring a thrift in Maryland for$63 million, and we don't have that cash on hand," said J. Stanley Mull,vice president of the Treasury at Susquehanna. The acquisition of FairfaxCorp., located in Baltimore, follows the thrift acquisitions last April ofAtlantic Federal Savings Bank and Reisters Town Federal Savings Bank.     Including the greenshoe option, a total of 1.495 millionshares were issued at $26.50 per share, or $25.31 after underwriting fees,for proceeds of $37.8 million, Mull said. Oppenheimer & Co. led theoffering, followed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. and Legg Mason WoodWalker Inc.     Susquehanna chose Oppenheimer as lead on the deal becauseof advisory services the investment bank had provided in the past, Mullsaid, noting that Keefe, Bruyette added a strong, bank-market name to thedeal, and Legg Mason provided strong distribution in the Maryland area,where many of the bonds were sold. Around two-thirds of the offering wassold at the retail level, and the rest to institutional investors.     Susquehanna anticipates approaching the debt market laterin January to offer up to $35 million in senior debt, the proceeds of whichwill also be devoted to the acquisition, Mull said. He noted that amaturity for the notes had yet to be determined. Oppenheimer and KeefeBruyette will underwrite the offering.     Susquehanna Bancshares Inc., which has $3 billion in assetsin both Pennsylvania and Maryland, operates six commercial banks. Itrecently formed a subsidiary, Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. South, to act asthe holding company for the thrift assets.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BANK BONDS ON TOP: ONE AWESOME YEARReturns on bonds issued by banking institutions climbed toremarkable heights in 1995 -- relatively speaking. Whether they can sustainlast year's pace, however, is another story.     Aggregate total returns reached 21.85%, topped by single-Arated banks, which found a return of 22.11%. Although the total return forcorporates overall was higher at 22.24%, duration adjusted returns,considered a more accurate measure, showed bank bonds besting virtually allother corporate and government securities (see table on P. 2).     Still, the heights to which bank returns climbed arerelative to their starting point at the beginning of the year.     "Banks were cheaper going in, so there was a big upside,"said Anne Robinson, a fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns. She added thatbank spreads widened considerably toward the end of 1994, largely due toFederal Reserve interest rate hikes earlier in the year.     Spreads on bank bonds are strongly correlated to interestrates, due to the interest rate sensitivity of banks' businesses, which mayaccount for some widening of spreads in the third quarter 1995. At thattime, minor concerns of inflation were sparked. Shortly after, however,positive inflation numbers were released, a number of large banks announcedmergers, and there was significant purchasing of U.S. Treasurys by theJapanese central bank, which drove rates down. These factors all worked totighten spreads in the fourth quarter, actually doubling returns from theprevious quarter,  to nearly record levels. However, investors see littleroom for improvement in the bank bond market, at least compared to othercorporate bonds.     "Our view is that spreads are at fairly narrow levels, andthere's not much room for upside," said Mike O'Brien, a banking analyst atFidelity. He noted that while there has been some deterioration in bankingfundamentals, such as credit quality, those fundamentals are still verystrong. "An investor wouldn't be overweighting in the bank sector, butprobably wouldn't be getting out either. The sector may not perform as wellas before, but we don't think it will have problems."     O'Brien further noted that consolidation in the industry,which has been a driving factor behind the rally, appears to be windingdown somewhat, and that upside stemming from ratings upgrades has probablyleveled off.     "The sector is balancing out at high single-A -- it's hardto get excited about the sector," O'Brien said. He noted that Fidelity isfocusing on shorter-maturity debt  --  buying five-year paper rather than20-year -- to guard against spreads potentially widening later in the year.     Robinson generally agreed with O'Brien's prognosis of thebank sector, noting that there is only a 30-basis point spread differencebetween the best and weakest banks. That compares to a 45-basis pointdifference at this time last year.     "We don't see spreads tightening any further. But aninvestor can still make money in banks if rates go down later in the year,"she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996POTENTIAL FUNDING DILEMMA: MIXED MESSAGES FROM FASBBanks that left securities in the held-to-maturity categoryof Financial Accounting Standard 115 during the recently provided transferwindow, with the intention of using those securities later to do repurchaseagreement transactions, may find that strategy closed to them if a proposedstandard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board is enacted in itscurrent form.     The proposed standard was issued as an exposure draftaround the same time that FASB provided banks with a window to transfersecurities currently classified as held to maturity into the available-for-sale category without a penalty. The window of opportunity in FAS 115,Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, closed atthe end of 1995, after which such transfers are strictly prohibited. Theproposed treatment for longer-term repos likely influenced held-to-maturitydesignations under FAS 115 during the restructuring window, and willcontinue to do so.     For example, a financial manager may have intended to use afive-year bond classified in held to maturity as collateral in a repotransaction next year. However, that may not be possible under the samefavorable terms if the proposed statement becomes an accounting standard,and so the manager may have chosen to use one of the other two categoriesinstead.     Banking institutions typically designate securities usedfor longer-term repos into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealizedgains and losses needn't be marked to market. However, the proposedstatement would require any repos with a maturity of three months or moreto be recorded as a sale, and hence marked to market. Banks would therebybe limited to using repos with maturities of less than three months, whichare still liabilities under the proposed statement. The proposed saletreatment for longer-term repos increases volatility in capital and wouldsuddenly have to appear in the income statement when the rule comes intoeffect. The proposed transition date currently is Dec. 15, 1996.     "This is a major concern for our industry," said MartiSworobuk at America's Community Bankers. "Smaller banks and thrifts dependon repos for general banking operations. Many of our members believe thatthe proposed standard would do away with repos beyond three months andincrease their costs by at least 30-40 basis points."     These institutions can also turn to the Federal Home LoanBank system for advances, although that is a more expensive source offunding. In addition, Sworobuk noted, the future of the FHLB as an easilyaccessible and available funding source is uncertain given the currentpolitical climate.     FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit onrepos is a period that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because theBoard believed that the vast majority of repo transactions held far shortermaturities.     "We've since learned that there are more transactions withdurations around three months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, theproject manager at FASB. He noted that the Board generally attempts toderive arbitrary thresholds where there is a low concentration of businessactivity, in order to avoid dramatic differences in accounting requirementsfor many similar transactions. FASB will likely reconsider the three-monthlimit as it continues its deliberations.     Following the comment deadline Jan. 22, FASB will hold apublic hearing toward the end of February. As of the middle of last week,the accounting standard setter had received about 25 comments, most ofwhich were notifications to testify at the public hearing.     America's Community Bankers was preparing last week aletter to FASB in order to express the views of its constituents.  Thetrade group recently surveyed members with assets of $1 billion or more fortheir views on the proposed statement, and found that many banks believethe standard would eliminate a source of cheap, long-term funding. A largesavings bank in Wisconsin noted that it intends to extend its use of reposout to one or two years, and that the proposed change would negativelyinfluence its operations.     "To make a long story short, they're all saying that theywould have to shorten maturities and go to a higher-cost-of-fundingsource," Sworobuk said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BUYBACKS DROP OFF IN '95 MERGER MANIAThe heady volume of stock repurchase programs announced bybanks slackened in 1995 from the previous year, while repurchase programsannounced by thrifts more than doubled in the same period, according toSecurities Data  Co.     The volume of announced programs in 1995 fell 25% from theyear before to just over $20 billion, a drop that surprised analysts, whonoted possible reasons including frenetic merger activity and heady stockvalues.     Observers of the savings and loan industry attributed thenearly 140% increase in the volume of stock repurchases announced bythrifts to factors that have been affecting banks for some time, includingthe need to use capital and control burgeoning earnings-per-share andreturn-on-equity ratios.     Perhaps the most important reason, they said, was to wardoff acquirers seeking assets on the cheap.     Marni Pont, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., saidthat stock buybacks can prohibit banks from engaging in stock poolings, acomplication experienced by First Bank System in its efforts to acquireFirst Interstate. She noted that banks may thus have decided to limit theirbuybacks in favor of poolings, a strategy confirmed by the treasurer of aregional bank whose institution recently chose to cut short its announcedbuyback for that very reason.     Another reason, Pont noted, was the rapidly rising valuesof bank stocks, which, according to Keefe's KBI 50, provided an averagetotal return in 1995 of 60.02%.     Yet despite a total return of 63% in 1995, AmSouth Bancorp.decided to pursue a stock buyback last fall in order provide shares for itsemployee benefit and stock plans.     "You can generate a fairly good internal rate of return(through a buyback) because the increase you achieve in EPS and ROE seemsto offset any cost that you incur through book value dilution," said ListUnderwood, head of finance at the bank.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BANK GROUPS JOIN ARMS AGAINST FILING PENALTIESRepresentatives of the nation's lending industries havejoined together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for a plan theybelieve will raise the penalties for failing to file, or filinginaccurately, so-called "information returns," -- the infamous 1099s.     These forms are used by lenders to report payments ofdividends, interest and interest accrued on accounts but not preciselypaid. For example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit,U.S. government securities or similar instruments.     The Clinton administration proposal sprang out of thebudget stalemate that has persisted over the last several weeks. Theadministration submitted a proposal to the Republican leadership inCongress Dec. 7 as an alternative to Republican calls for deep cuts in thefederal budget. The proposal outlines increases in miscellaneous fees andthe closing of certain loopholes. Aimed more at stirring indigination thanwinning congressional support, the proposal includes several otherprovisions that the administration knew would be opposed by powerfulcorporate interests. For example, it calls for federal banking regulatorsto impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.     The provision at issue appeared to be limited to paymentsfor services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC. However, according toa letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin dated Jan. 2, thelenders said that an explanation provided by the Joint Committee onTaxation Dec. 15 indicated a provision with much broader scope.     Those signing onto the letter include Credit Union NationalAssociation, the American Bankers Association, the American Land TitleAssociation, America's Community Bankers, the Independent BankersAssociation of America, the Investment Company Institute, the NationalAssociation of Realtors, the Public Securities Association and theSecurities Industry Association.     The implication is that even if the proposal had merit, itis unlikely to be supported in Congress--especially in an election year.However, given that this is not a normal budget process, the groups arejoining together to marshall their muscle out of fear that in a late nightdeal, the provision could be swept into a compromise--at great cost tolenders of all stripes.

Citicorp issued $250 million in 10-year subordinated notes.Rated A2/A, the paper priced at 62.5 basis points over comparable Treasurysfor a coupon of 6.375% at 99.672 to yield 6.42%. The issue carries a bulletrepayment.     The deal was led by Salomon Brothers, followed by co-managers Bear Stearns, Citicorp Securities, Goldman Sachs and MerrillLynch.     The new year has been relatively quiet in the bank bondmarket, despite talk the week before last of a stockpile of deals ready tohit the market and take advantage of still relatively low rates. In fact,investment bankers said that more offerings might have hit the market lastweek had the storm arrived in lesser force. Interest rates also jumpedduring the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on consecutivedays.     Still, the Citicorp deal was said to have met with mildresistance in the market, requiring a series of swaps to complete the dealin a timely fashion once the issue began trading.     Sources predicted a number of offerings approaching themarket this week and the next. Meridian Bancorp Inc., headquartered inReading, PA, was rumored to be preparing to hit the market shortly.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR ISSUEAccounting standards-setters in the United States andCanada plan to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draftrules governing when businesses must disclose financial information abouttheir regional operations and product lines.     The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usuallyreferred to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" areslightly less onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-basedInternational Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft couldrequire disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to beissued by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the CanadianInstitute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press forcompanies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.     This difference of opinion has been going for at least ayear, and officials from all three groups are expected to engage in morehaggling on the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposalswill be due June 30.     Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rulepromises to shed more light on how and where banks make their money. Andthe rule became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announcedit would start publishing its group results according to InternationalAccounting Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hiddenreserves to smooth out balance sheets.     Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide atleast one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographicallines. In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internalfinancial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.     The North American approach also starts with the way abusiness views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ...recognizes the fact that this information does not always reflect thedominant source and nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC'sproject manager. "In certain cases, therefore, information needs to bemodified for external reporting purposes."-- Craig WebbBack to Headline List WT02-B38-18IA086-000616-B021-21http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi23.html 205.156.212.5 19970122005202 text/html 28809HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:50:09 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:22 GMTContent-length: 28622Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi23.html Sample Issue Copyright COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNet June 13, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization (781 words) S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume (850 words) Commercial MBS Volume, by Rating Agency (37 words) How the Rankings Were Compiled (223 words) What They Charge (113 words) Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling (158 words) Multi-Family Paper Blows Out (461 words) DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels (219 words) Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros (236 words) Nomura Places Warehouse Paper (147 words) THE GRAPEVINE (532 words) CALENDAR (189 words) CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization   Hoping to resuscitate its real estate lending business, Bank of BostonCorp. is radically altering its operations: From now on, it will onlyoriginate commercial mortgages that can be securitized.   In an exclusive arrangement, the nation's 16th-largest bank has engagedGoldman, Sachs & Co. to structure and distribute mortgage-backed notes thatcan be sold to several classes of investors.   Bank of Boston's move is a departure from the traditional real estateoperations of banks, which have always been long-term holders of commercialmortgages. It's performance is sure to be tracked by regional banksnationwide, many of which are weighing similar plans.   The strategic shift results from months of discussions between seniorofficials at Bank of Boston and outside securitization experts, includingadvisers from Kenneth Leventhal & Co. and the New York law firm of Weil,Gotshal & Manges.   In talks earlier this month with borrowers and other outsiders, Bank ofBoston management expressed a sense of urgency about shifting its approachfrom "book and hold" to "originate and sell." According to a bank positionpaper, failure to adopt a securitization strategy would jeopardize itscommercial mortgage franchise. Under such a scenario, the bank said itwould:   * "Lose a large portion of our asset base in one to three years."   * "Have no competitive term credit to attract new relationships."   * "[See its] revenues decline due to the loss of higher spread credit."   * "Not be in control of our balance sheet as we continue to acquirebanks."   Like many other institutions, Bank of Boston has been a reluctant realestate lender during the early part of this decade - in contrast to itsaggressive style in the 1980s. For the most part, it has been booking mini-perms (three- to five-year loans) that carry strict covenants and recourseprovisions. With such onerous terms, the bank has been losing prospectiveborrowers to its competitors, and the outlook has worsened with theproliferation of Wall Street's commercial mortgage conduits.   Now that real estate values are rebounding, the bank wants to offerfriendlier terms on loans that can be regularly packaged into commercialMBS and rolled off its balance sheet.   In July, Bank of Boston's 90 commercial mortgage originators will starthawking the new product line. It features long-term (five- to 20-year)loans without covenants or recourse provisions. The bank will write$750,000 to $10 million loans. The credits will carry fixed and adjustablerates, amortizing over 20 or 25 years.   The goal: To re-establish Bank of Boston as a one-stop resource fordevelopers and other real estate owners in need of construction, mini-permor long-term financing. The new program is designed to finance shoppingcenters (anchored and unanchored), apartment buildings,industrial/warehouse facilities, office buildings and hotels.   By securitizing these loans, Bank of Boston can continue to build realestate relationships and generate fee income, while meeting managementconcerns about its asset-liability mix, risk exposure and capitalrequirements.   How does the bank plan to profit from its securitization program? Thebulk of its earnings will come from the "positive arbitrage" that is leftover from a loan's interest rate after paying issuance expenses and therequired yield to MBS holders.   The bank estimates it will charge borrowers 275 to 350 basis points overthe Treasury curve and be left with 50 to 70 bp of profit. That projectionis considered somewhat optimistic, given that lenders are being forced tolower their loan prices in order to cope with mounting competition.   On top of the loan spread, the bank will also collect an origination feeequal to 1.5% to 2.25% of the total loan amount, plus a $16,500 applicationcharge.   MBS investors can expect Goldman, Sachs to provide a fairly regular flowof multi-class issues, each backed by at least 30 mortgages. A typicalissue will be made up of a triple-A rated senior tranche yielding 100 to125 bp over Treasuries, a smaller single- or double-A tranche yielding 140to 175 bp over, a double- or triple-B class yielding 300 to 600 bp over andan unrated piece with spreads in the mid- to high-teens.   Spokesman for Bank of Boston and Goldman, Sachs did not return calls forcomment.   Bank of Boston is counting on the securitization program tosubstantially boost its origination capacity from its current annualcommercial mortgage output of about $250 million. It's not known whetherthe bank also plans to securitize part of its $3.5 billion in existing realestate loans, which were not underwritten with MBS investors in mind.Nearly half of its current portfolio is secured by New England properties,with the rest scattered throughout the U.S.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume   Standard & Poor's Corp. was the most active rating agency in thecommercial MBS market in 1993, working on more than half of the year'sdollar volume, according to data compiled by Commercial Mortgage Alert.   Of the $14.7 billion in transactions for which rating information wasgathered, S&P rated offerings valued at $7.6 billion.   Fitch Investors Service Inc. and Duff & Phelps Corp. were neck-and-neckfor second place. Fitch rated issues valued at $6.75 billion, while D&P'stotal was $6.70 billion. Moody's Investors Service Inc. came in last, with$6.2 billion of rated deals.   S&P also ranked first based on the number of deals rated, with 46,followed by D&P (42), Fitch (36) and Moody's (28).   The survey - the first ever to track rating-agency activity in the CMBSmarket - also showed that Fitch's business grew by a whopping 63% lastyear, from $4.1 billion in 1992. The number of deals it rated more thantripled.   Moody's was the only agency to see its volume fall, logging a 12%decline, from $7.1 billion.   Still, several executives at Wall Street firms expressed surprise thatthe agency ended up so close to the pack. Moody's suffered several keystaff defections last year, which limited its ability to processtransactions. The firm estimates that it turned away a couple of billiondollars of offerings that it otherwise would have rated.   What's more, Moody's has taken a strict view on certain types ofcommercial MBS. That strategy has rankled underwriters, opened upopportunities for rival agencies and, ultimately, cost Moody's some marketshare. But because of its stellar reputation among bondholders, Moody'sended up rating most of the year's biggest deals.   Investment bankers weigh a number of factors when selecting a ratingagency, but the requirements of investors tend to be the dominant factor.MBS buyers often insist that transactions be rated by either S&P or Moody's- the two most-established agencies. And for most deals, they want thecomfort of two ratings. This opens the door for the market upstarts, D&Pand Fitch.   Another key factor is service: How quickly and smoothly a deal will berated, as well as the accessibility of analysts to investors. At the end oflast year, when deal volume picked up sharply, the agencies were swampedwith business. Moody's temporarily stopped accepting additional business inSeptember. S&P, which has a much bigger staff dedicated to commercial MBS,was forced to do the same the following month.   Things have calmed down somewhat since the beginning of the year, withdeals usually taking six to eight weeks to go through the rating process.One Wall Street executive commented that all of the agencies still havebottlenecks, but he - and several others - singled out Fitch for providingparticularly good service.   Because the issuer's cost of funds is generally the overriding concernin every deal, underwriters are known to shop for agencies that willrequire the least subordination in order to attain the desired rating. Anincrease in the level of subordination, or other credit enhancementfeatures, can lead to dramatically higher borrowing costs.   The individual bias of each agency is also well known in the market.Moody's, for example, is comfortable with multi-family and retail deals,but is wary of offerings backed by debt on office buildings and hotels.Fitch has led the way on deals collateralized by nonperforming assets, butis especially strict on offerings with single borrowers.   D&P has been regarded as the most lenient and least influential of theagencies. But underwriters said that D&P has become tougher under thedirection of Joseph C. Franzetti, a respected analyst who was recruitedlast September from S&P, where he ran the mortgage-backed securities group.    At the other end of the scale is Moody's, which seems to pride itselfon being the toughest rater. Last fall, for example, it issued a widelypublicized warning to investors about a "marked deterioration in the creditquality" of commercial mortgage issues.   "We're much less concerned with market share than with assigning high-quality ratings," said Tad Philipp, associate director of the agency'sstructured finance group. "We're never going to have the market share ofsome of the other rating agencies."   Despite their frustrations with the agency, investment bankers wouldlove to see Moody's play a bigger role in the CMBS arena, because of itspowerful reputation in other segments of the bond market.   For this reason, some are perplexed by the fact that Moody's has devotedfewer resources to this market than its rivals. After losing some staffersto Wall Street houses last year, Moody's at times found itself with as fewas four or five professionals in its commercial MBS area, down from itsfull complement of seven. The agency is on the verge of filling two newpositions, but it is still out-manned by its rivals: S&P employs about 20professionals, while D&P has 14 and Fitch has 13.   Philipp said that Moody's is committed to the market and expects it togrow. "But we don't feel the need to staff up to handle peak volumes."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Commercial MBS Volume, by Rating Agency                1993      1992    Chg.  1993  1992              ($Mil)    ($Mil)     (%)   (#)   (#)   S&P       7,581.5   6,819.8   +11.1    46    20   Fitch     6,755.3   4,144.0   +63.0    36    10   D&P       6,705.7   5,346.4   +25.4    42    21   Moody's   6,240.7   7,060.4   -11.7    28    19   Source: CMBS DatabaseBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994How the Rankings Were Compiled   Commercial Mortgage Alert used its new CMBS Database to calculate thevolume of business handled by each of the four rating agencies over thelast two years.   The Database, which includes every transaction completed since themarket's inception, carries rating information for the vast majority ofdeals in recent years. All told, there were 123 deals valued at $17.7billion that closed in 1993. But of those, issues with a face amount of atleast $1.7 billion were not rated - $638.4 million in Fannie Mae deals and$1.1 billion in private placements used to finance acquisitions by Goldman,Sachs & Co.'s Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund.   Of the remaining $16 billion in deals, rating information from at leastone agency was gathered for offerings totaling $14.7 billion.   Because of confidentiality agreements, the rating agencies declined toprovide information about private placements, and in some cases thisinformation could not be learned independently. The agencies did provideaggregate data. S&P, for example, said it rated 62 commercial MBS dealslast year totalling $8.2 billion. And Moody's said it rated a total of $7.2billion in deals. However, the survey counted only ratings that could betied to specific transactions.   Agencies were given full credit for the total principal amount of an MBSissue, even if they rated only some classes in a deal.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994What They Charge   Commercial MBS underwriters say fees don't play much of a role in theirselection of a rating agency.   The four agencies each charge about the same - and their compensationpales in comparison to other issuance costs, such as legal fees. The ratingagencies are usually paid six to 10 basis points of the value of the ratedclasses, or $60,000 to $100,000 for a $100 million transaction.   However, the complexity of a deal is also factored in, as well as thegeographic diversity of the collateral. Those factors can push the fee to20 basis points or more.   Underwriters say that Fitch tends to charge more than its rivals, butnot materially so.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling   If Freddie Mac heeds the advice of Lehman Brothers Inc., it will soon becanceling its plans to securitize a $1 billion portfolio of performingmulti-family mortgages.   Last week, Lehman, as financial adviser to Freddie, recommended againstthe transaction - saying the issue did not make economic sense for theagency. The purpose of the offering was to free up capital that Freddiecould recycle back into the mortgage market.   Bear Stearns Cos., which would underwriting the offering, continues tolobby hard in favor of the transaction.   Considerable dissension has developed among senior executives at themortgage agency about whether to go forward with the offering. Theprincipals involved will air their differences at a pivotal meeting that isscheduled for this Wednesday.   Michael May, a Freddie vice president for structured transactions,predicted a final decision would be made within two weeks.   As envisioned, the transaction would have involved  Freddie sellingsubordinate tranches and retaining the senior notes.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Multi-Family Paper Blows Out   Strong investor demand enabled Natwest Markets to rapidly sell $50million in fixed-rate securities backed by debt on apartment complexesowned by Southwest Property Trust Inc., a Dallas REIT.   The two-class offering, priced June 3, was oversubscribed, forcingNatwest to scale back individual allotments in order to give all investorsa piece of the pie.   The senior $50 million class, rated double-A, was priced at par to yield7.824%, or 110 basis points over the seven-year Treasury. The offering alsoincluded an interest-only strip, which was sold to an unnamed investor.   The spread on the senior notes was 20 basis points tighter than thespread on Southwest Property's similar $50 million transaction lastDecember - a time when many more deals were competing for investors'attention. But for the REIT, which initiated the transactions to financethe acquisition of multi-family properties, tighter spreads were smallconsolation for the higher yield it must pay: 7.82% versus 6.54% inDecember.   Both transactions grew out of a $100 million line of credit that NatwestMarkets provided to Southwest Property last year.   The REIT tapped half of the credit line in November to finance theacquisition of six properties. The REIT paid back the bridge loan with theproceeds of the first securitization, which was backed by new mortgages on13 apartment complexes in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona.   Southwest Property drew down the rest of the credit line over the pastfew months to finance other acquisitions. That bridge financing was paidoff with proceeds of the latest securitization, which was backed by newmortgages on 12 garden-style properties in Texas, one in New Mexico and onein Arizona.   The offering carried attractive prepayment protections for bondholders.If the REIT prepays the mortgages, it will have to pay bondholders thedifference between the coupon on the securities and the prevailing Treasuryrate. The yield-maintenance agreement is designed to protect investorsagainst declining interest rates by compensating them for having to re-invest their funds at lower yields. Under these provisions, bondholdersusually receive the difference between the coupon and a rate equal to theTreasury yield plus an additional spread. In the Southwest Property deal,however, investors will receive the difference between their coupon and theflat Treasury rate, making the potential compensation greater than normal.   The class A notes mature in February 2001, but are extendable for twoyears. If the notes are extended, their coupon rate, currently 7.72%, willbe increased to either 9.43% or 375 basis points over the seven-yearTreasury, whichever is higher at the time.   The two Southwest Property transactions were the first commercial MBSdeals handled by Natwest Markets, the New York investment banking arm ofLondon-based National Westminster Bank PLC.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels   The conduit operated by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and EquitableReal Estate Investment Management Inc. is expanding into the hotel sector.   The team, which already originates and securitizes multi-family andretail credits, plans to extend up to $1 billion of hotel loans nationwide.   Equitable believes that the time is right to get back into therebounding hotel sector, which it pulled out of five years ago. This timearound the company will employ more conservative underwriting standards.For instance, it will base lending decisions on the properties' historic,rather than projected, income.   Under the program, Equitable will identify borrowers through itsnational network of investment offices. The loans will be originated byColumn Financial Inc., an Atlanta-based joint venture between the conduitpartners. DLJ will then securitize the mortgages. Equitable Real Estate andDLJ are subsidiaries of Equitable Companies Inc.   The conduit will originate non-recourse loans with 10- to 20-year termsfor all types of lodging properties. Loans will range from $2 million toabout $25 million, with interest rates that are 325 to 450 basis pointsover Treasuries, depending on the debt-service coverage. A 1.75 DSC ratiowould merit a 325 bp spread. But a 1.40 ratio - considered more likely forhotel properties - would result in a 350 to 400 bp spread.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros   Greystone & Co., an investment banking boutique, has started acommercial MBS unit, staffing it with three veterans from the disbandedmortgage operation of Daiwa Securities America Inc.

When Nomura started shopping the double-A notes for Shurgard StorageCenters Inc., a Seattle REIT, it discussed pricing them at a spread of 120basis points over seven-year Treasuries. Some investors said thetransaction, backed by a collateral type still relatively new tosecuritization, would never get done at spreads of less than 130 bp.   But in the end, Nomura was able to slightly better its initial target,pricing the single-class offering at 102% of par value for a 115 bp spread.The offering was helped by its strong bondholder protections and thescarcity of new issues in the market. Still, it took Nomura several weeksto privately place the notes.

Berry, a California bankruptcy attorney, pleaded guilty onDec. 11 to two counts of bankruptcy fraud. According to U.S. AttorneyNora M. Manella, Berry, in anticipation of filing a bankruptcy for hisclient, transferred the client's business assets away from her businessknowing that the assets were collateral for an SBA loan. This action wastaken with intent of concealing the assets from representatives of theSBA and the bankruptcy trustee."This is a particularly egregious case because it involves an attorneywho attempted to use his knowledge of bankruptcy proceedings to profitat the expenses of the U.S. Government," said Steve Marica, assistantinspector general for investigations at the SBA.Berry is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8, 1995. He faces a maximumsentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Melvin Belli Files Chapter 11Melvin Belli is one of the most well-known lawyers in the country. Hisfame was such in the '60s that he actually appeared on an episode of theTV series "Star Trek," as "Gorgon," a creature who made the  children ofone planet visited by the starship "Enterprise" murder their ownparents.As a lawyer, he brought personal injury lawsuits to the publicconsciousness and was a role model for many law students.Now his firm has filed Chapter 11 and Belli has hired San Franciscobankruptcy lawyer Penn Butler to represent him."There are two culprits," Belli said. "One is Dow Chemical who went intobankruptcy and reneged on the $4 billion they had set up to pay [tortclaimants]. I had put out $5 million to $10 million for doctor'sreports, etc. The bank was going to lend us $45 million based on the DowChemical settlement."But when Dow went into bankruptcy, that loan disappeared and Belli foundhimself cash poor."The second [culprit] is the $15 million [I had to pay my wife] in thedivorce," Belli said.Belli said the Chapter 11 is merely buying "the finest personal injuryfirm in the country" some time until everyone can be paid off in full."I have $50 million to $75 million in big cases coming in," he said."The oil case in Alaska, the Marcos case, the implants -- they're allcoming in toward the end of this year and over into the next year. Butwe had some current creditors who wouldn't wait. It was impossible to doanything but go into a Chapter 11."Belli is now an outspoken convert of the bankruptcy system."People don't realize what Chapter 11 really is for," he said. "I havechanged my former opinion of that. I didn't know the difference betweenChapter 11 and ordinary bankruptcy. [Now I say], thank God that we'vegot Chapter 11."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Lenders Worry That Consumers Cannot Afford Increased DebtFor the first time in history, consumers owe more than $1 trillion ontheir non-mortgage installment credit. The outstanding balance on theircredit cards is approaching $400 billion. The most recent statisticsfrom the Federal Reserve show that total outstanding consumer revolvingcredit was 19 percent higher through the end of October 1995 than it wasat the end of October 1994. According to RAM Research's BankcardBarometer, credit card delinquency rates increased from 3.89 percentduring the first quarter of 1995 to 4.33 percent during the fourthquarter of the year.All these numbers have the people who lent the money more than a littlenervous that debtors will be unable to pay their bills."1996 will be a year when we see higher delinquency and loan losses asthe consumer becomes more overextended," predicted John Kirby, seniorvice president in charge of consumer lending for SouthTrust Bank ofAlabama, N.A., in Birmingham, Ala. "Credit cards have been highlysolicited during 1995, leading to a suspicion that a larger number ofcustomers will have more credit card debt than their income provides."Kirby explained that this explosion in credit card availability was theresult of several new lenders entering the market. In order to establishloan volumes these new lenders were very aggressive in the solicitationof business and often offered very low rates. Lenders who did not lowertheir underwriting standards or rates in response to this competitionlost business to the new lenders. Many of those customers who left werebetter credit risks than those who stayed. As a result, all lenders havean increased risk of loss on consumer loans regardless of whether theyextended credit to borrowers that they might have previously rejected.W. Doug King, executive vice president of Wachovia Corp. in Winston-Salem, N.C., agreed that consumers will have increased difficulty payingtheir bills during 1996 and saw it as a continuation of a trend thatbegan during 1995."Over the past several years consumers have taken on a great deal ofdebt. The strained ability to service indebtedness through income, whichis not growing at a rapid pace, makes it very difficult for consumers toaddress unexpected expenses," King said. "In the household environmentof two incomes where one or both consumers have lost jobs due todownsizing, consolidations, or mergers, many have had to take lowerpaying jobs, or are still unemployed. This situation has, of course,significantly impacted the debt repayment ability of those affectedconsumers.King also noted that increases in the prime rate, which went from 6percent to 9 percent in less than a year, significantly impacted theability of consumers with adjustable rate mortgages to finance theirother installment debt.The ease of filing for bankruptcy is another reason why King expects tosee higher consumer loan losses during 1996. "Filing is simple andinexpensive, there is no longer a social stigma attached to bankruptcy,and the judicial system, in many cases, appears to be encouraging the'fresh start' concept of bankruptcy."While these factors would be conditions causing loan losses at any time,the lending practices of credit card issuers have created a fragileeconomic environment for consumers."The credit card industry has flooded the market with a variety ofcredit card offers, most with tempting teaser rates. These offers haveencouraged some consumers to accept higher credit availability than canbe serviced with their income. In addition, the teaser rates quicklyexpire resulting in higher debt service obligations."Credit card issuers offering incentives for credit card use have addedto the problem of consumers taking on more debt than they can handle.While there is nothing inherently wrong with consumers using creditcards that offer rewards, "many consumers are being shocked at howquickly miscellaneous purchases can add up," King said. "For example, insome cases consumers, who have purchased groceries with credit cards,are finding that they do not have the ability to pay off those purchasesupon receipt of the credit card statement, and actually wind up payingfor those groceries over an extended period of time."And King sees the trend of increased consumer loan losses resulting fromlowered credit standards continuing beyond 1996."From a realistic standpoint, due to 1996 budgetary and earningspressures, the possibility of some banks lowering credit standards tomaintain growth and earnings may exist. In the event some banks in theindustry did lower credit standards consumer delinquencies and losseswould clearly move to even higher levels."So, are lowered standards for issuing credit cards going to bankrupt thelenders along with the borrowers? Probably not."The good news is that credit card debt is but one segment of theconsumer debt," said William E. MacDonald III, the president and CEO ofNational City Bank, Cleveland, in Cleveland, Ohio, and the chairman ofthe Consumer Bankers Association."To fairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans from homeequity and personal and revolving credit lines. If you look at the debtservice burden from a macro perspective, including both mortgage andinstallment loan payments, the debt level numbers are not as alarming,"MacDonald said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 19965th Circuit Judges May Prohibit Chapter 13 Plans Calling for DirectPayment of CreditorsBankruptcy judges may deny confirmation of Chapter 13 plans that callfor the debtor to make payments directly to creditors, the Fifth Circuitruled in William C. and Julie C. Reid v. Michael Gross (In the Matter ofWilliam C. and Julie C. Reid), No. 95-40249 (December 11, 1995). The percuriam decision was not released for publication."We write briefly today only to emphasize that In re Foster, 670 F.2d478 (5th Cir. 1982), stands clearly for the principle that thebankruptcy court has broad discretion in determining whether a debtormay act as disbursing agent in place of the trustee, thereby avoidingthe Chapter 13 trustee's fees," the court said. "Although Fosterrecognizes that the debtor should have flexibility in formulatingChapter 13 plans . . . we find no error in the bankruptcy court'srejection of the proposed, amended plan, which, in this instance,included a modification of First Bank and Trust's original loan to thedebtors."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996U.S. Trustees Respond to Chapter 13 Guideline CriticismThe December 21st issue of Consumer Bankruptcy News included an articleentitled "EOUST Hears from Tennessee Legislators." This article alsoappeared in Bankruptcy Court Decisions News & Comment, where it includeda note that bankruptcy judges had also written to the Executive Officefor U.S. Trustees to express concern with the proposed revisions to theChapter 13 Trustees' Handbook and the proposed ethical guidelines. Inresponse to the BCD version of the article we heard from Linda EkstromStanley, the U.S. Trustee for Region 17 (E.D. and N.D. Cal. and D.Nev.), the chair of the Standing Trustee Subcommittee and Ellen B.Vergos, U.S. Trustee for Region 8 (Ky. and Tenn.)."As United States Trustees, and as members of the subcommittee whoparticipated in the drafting of proposed Standards of Conduct forStanding Trustees and proposed Handbook Revisions, we are particularlyconcerned that Chapter 13 administration be ethical, efficient andeconomical for all who come in contact with the system.  This is a goalof all those in the U.S. Trustee Program who have been involved withthese proposals."We feel it necessary to correct some misconceptions circulating aboutthe proposed standards and handbook revisions.  Many of thesemisunderstandings were contained in your recent article entitled'Legislators/Judges Worry about EOUST's Proposed Rules.'"Your article quoted a letter from four members of Tennessee'scongressional delegation who expressed a concern that 'these newregulations would negatively impair the effectiveness of the trustees,and result in major financial losses to the creditors . . .' We submitthat if one reads the proposed standards and handbook revisions, onewill see that this expressed concern is misplaced."The proposals are divided into two portions: the first establishes fiveethical standards; the second gives guidance in incurring expenses andin determining what is reasonable and necessary.  The standards arethose which ought to guide the fiduciaries in the administration of animportant trust.  The standards are, in part, to address abuses.  Forexample, there have been instances where standing trustees have hiredand paid substantial salaries to family members for little or no work.There have been trustee family members who have received excessivecompensation with benefits packages far exceeding those available forcomparable positions in the public and private sectors. Other casesinvolve self-dealing by trustees who have charged trust operations sumsfar above market rates or for often unnecessary expenses. These are ofserious concern.  Every dollar spent on unnecessary expenses comes outof the pockets of the debtors."The 21 U.S. Trustees in the country are charged by law with the duty tosupervise the Chapter 13 trustees in their respective regions. 28 U.S.C.Section 586(b). While the U.S. Trustees have and will continue to dealwith abuses on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Trustees will be aided intheir supervision by definitive standards of which the standing trusteehas received advance notice about expected conduct. Written standardswill protect against claims of arbitrary or disparate treatment and, inpart, are a response to standing trustees' requests for writtendirection."The U.S. Trustee Program is also obligated by law to review and approvethe budgets of each trustee operation.  This duty arises from 28 U.S.C.Sec. 586(a)(1) which expressly limits the use of percentage fees to payfor compensation and the actual, necessary expenses of the trustee."It is up to the 21 U.S. Trustees to act as 'watchdogs' over expensesand to approve only those which meet the actual and necessary test.  Theproposed handbook revisions are to serve as a guide for the regionalU.S. Trustees in determining whether an expense of the Chapter 13trustee in their respective regions is actual and necessary."The proposed standards and handbook revisions are not being offered asan attempt to 'federalize' Chapter 13 trustees' operations, ascharacterized by the Tennessee congressional delegation whose letter wasquoted in your article.  Rather, they are to serve as standards forthose in the system which will remain largely unchanged."Another misconception in your article is that 'the bankruptcy benchclosely monitors the operations of the trustees. . .' While thebankruptcy courts adjudicate the issues which come before it in Chapter13, it is the U.S. Trustee who is charged by law with monitoring thebudget and office operations."When the standing trustee system is examined, it is clear why Congressfelt that supervision and oversight were necessary.  The standingtrustee is a statutory fiduciary whose rights and responsibilities aredefined by statute as well as by the terms of the confirmed plan.  Thetrustee receives payments from the debtor and holds them in trust todistribute according to the terms of the confirmed plan or as otherwiseprovided by law or court order.  To fund the standing trustee operation,the standing trustee receives a percentage of all moneys received underplans.  These fees are held in trust to pay for the collective cost ofadministering all chapter 13 plans."By virtue of appointment by the U.S. Trustee, the standing trustee isassigned to his or her caseload. The standing trustee's compensation andoffice overhead are funded by the moneys paid by debtors through theChapter 13 plans.  Eighty percent of the standing trustees in thecountry are paid maximum compensation of $122,816 in addition to havingall their overhead paid. The overhead and compensation are paid cut ofthe funds paid in by the debtors and not by the trustees.  The standingtrustee is not subject to the vagaries of the marketplace, but receiveshis or her salary and overhead by virtue of the number of case filingsin the district.  Many of these trustee operations are quite large.  Forexample, in the Western  District of Tennessee, the three standingtrustees disbursed over $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1995.  Each yearapproximately $2 billion flows through the standing trustee operations.Clearly, Congress intended that the use of these fiduciary funds besupervised."Your article suggested that 'letters from bankruptcy judges . . . haveargued in favor of keeping the system as it is.'  The fact is that manybankruptcy judges have written.  Some favor the proposals, some want tokeep the system as it is, and others favor some proposals and argueagainst others.  The comments are across the board."Finally, your article, quoting from the congressional letter, cites asan example of increased cost, that the regulations would require thatthe West Tennessee trustees' operations to be split into two distinctoffice requiring the purchase of new equipment and the hiring of newstaff. The actual proposals as written, do not require the splitting,but would prohibit a co-trustee operation to enhance accountability ofthe individual trustee.  There are other more cost effective methods bywhich the same result could be accomplished."The writer of your article suggested that there is a lack of meaningfuldialogue between the U.S. Trustees and the standing trustees which could'harm the system.' In fact there has been extensive dialogue.  Commentsand suggestions concerning the proposals have been sought and obtainedfrom standing trustees, judges, creditors and others in the system.Many U.S. Trustees have held meetings with the standing trustees intheir respective regions to obtain comment and input.  This month thesubcommittee met directly with a cross section of standing trustees fromthroughout the country. Many useful suggestions and comments have beengathered from this process.  The dialogue is ongoing and will beconsidered in revising the standards and guidelines early next year.Additionally, all written comments will be reviewed by the members ofthe Director's Advisory Board in the next few weeks.  The Board iscomprised of bankruptcy judges and United States Trustees.  The Boardwill also hear oral presentations from some of the commentators,including representatives of the NACTT."If your readers would like to receive a copy of the proposals, writeLinda E.

He thendeclared bankruptcy and obtained a discharge of both of the above debtsby concealing approximately $800,000 in assets and income, the U.S.Attorney said. The scheme was discovered by the Agriculture Department'sInspector General.In addition to repaying his loans, Wheeler must pay a $10,000 fine andserve a sentence of two years and 10 months in prison without parolefollowed by three years of supervised release.At the sentencing, Judge Biggers told Wheeler that he would not showleniency to an individual who had willfully committed his crimes andrefused to admit his wrongdoing.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Eleven New Bankruptcy Judgeships RequestedIf you're interested in applying for a bankruptcy judgeship, your jobprospects are looking brighter. Because of the recent rise in bankruptcyfilings, Chief Judge Paul A. Magnuson (D. Minn.), chair of the JudicialConference's Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System,recently requested 11 new bankruptcy judgeships."The bankruptcy courts have made great strides in the efficientprocessing of cases," Judge Magnuson told the House JudiciarySubcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. "Despite our questfor efficiency...we need additional bankruptcy judges to provide for theproper administration of the bankruptcy system now."The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1995 (H.R. 2604), introduced in Nov. byRep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., would establish four permanent bankruptcyjudgeships in the Central District of California and one permanentbankruptcy judgeship in the District of Maryland.One temporary bankruptcy judgeship would be created in each of thefollowing districts: the Southern District of Florida, the EasternDistrict of Michigan, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern Districtof New York, the Northern District of New York, and the Eastern Districtof Pennsylvania.While there currently are 326 authorized bankruptcy judgeships, thenumber of filings increased 8 percent during the first three quarters of1995 compared to the first three quarters of 1994 -- a pattern that isexpected to continue."We are struggling with an overburdened system," Judge Magnuson told thesubcommittee. "We are not asking our bankruptcy judges to do more -- weare requiring it. We will continue to seek ways to improve thebankruptcy system's efficiency, but we critically need these 11additional bankruptcy judgeships."Also testifying in support of the legislation was Judge William E.Anderson (Bankr.

Schmidt of Schmidt Marketing Inc. in Burnsville, Minn.As I travel from law firm to law firm, I often am amazed at thesimilarities in how marketing programs are organized or not organized.In fact, some of the most common marketing structures are downrightdysfunctional.Whether a firm makes its marketing decisions in one of the ways listedbelow is sometimes related to how long the firm has been engaged inmarketing. In other cases, it is a result of the firm's culture and thedegree of individuality that it allows.Since many of these structures actually can produce negative results,poor use of resources, internal competition, ill-designed strategies andpotential conflicts, I would like to use a few borrowed clichis to pointout the characteristics of six faulty marketing programs, and theproblems they may create for you, your marketing director, or your firm.Six Dysfunctional Marketing Programs1. The Squeaky Wheel Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristics: The lawyers who demand the marketing resourcesget them.Discussion: Without a marketing plan or firm-wide goals, decisions aboutallocating marketing resources are made on the basis of demand. So it'spossible that the firm is spending money on lawyers who are ineffectivemarketers, and activities that will not produce results.Result: The firm is not working toward any common objectives, andindividual attorneys use firm resources to build their own practices andpotentially portable books of business.2. The Flavor of the Month Marketing ProgramDefining characteristics: Something more "sexy" or interesting alwayscomes along to capture the attention of the marketing effort.Discussion: In these programs, the attention span of the marketingdirector, marketing committee or marketing partner is relatively short,and new ideas always receive immediate endorsement. One month it mightbe a client survey, the next month a home page, and the next an imageadvertising program, with no real commitment to any direction orstrategy.Result: The firm engages in scattershot initiatives instead of buildinga foundation and conducting the follow-up necessary to achieve realmarketing success.3. The Monkey See, Monkey Do Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: The firm imitates the marketing efforts of itscompetitors or other law firms in its market.Discussion: I can't tell you the number of law firms that have decidedto undertake an activity because another firm is doing it. From hiringmarketing directors to writing newsletters, their strategies simplyreflect those that their competitors employ. My advice is, if anotherfirm has already cornered the market on an activity, your firm should dosomething else; the innovator firm almost always receives the greatestrewards.Result: Since these firms do not take time to determine what they aretrying to accomplish (their objectives), and the best ways to achievethese objectives, their marketing efforts are usually ineffective.4. The Pass the Buck Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: Something or someone else is always holdingthings up in marketing.Discussion: I think lawyers in this type of marketing organization wouldhave a hard time selecting just one response to this multiple choicequestion:"I cannot do [whatever I was supposed to do] because:a. The management committee never responded to my memob. The marketing director never set up a meetingc. The brochure is hopelessly out of dated. My contact never called me back."Result: No one ever takes the initiative or implements marketing ideas.5. The Grass Is Always Greener Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: Other law firms' clients are a lot moreattractive than the ones the firm already has.Discussion: Usually the result of a poorly designed compensation systemproving too many incentives for origination or not enough for clientretention, this type of program encourages lawyers to pursue newrelationships, sometimes at the expense of existing ones. Taken to theextreme, some lawyers refuse to work on matters for the client of acolleague, or to introduce other lawyers into their own clientrelationships.Result: Lawyers are chasing new business while existing (hard-earned)clients slip away.6. The Every Man/Woman for Himself/Herself Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: Everyone in the firm gets equal time andresources for marketing.Discussion: Obviously, not every lawyer has the same skills oropportunities with respect to marketing. While everyone should beencouraged, not everyone warrants the same resources. The internalcompetitiveness and lack of coordination usually found in this marketingstructure can be apparent even to prospects and clients, who may seelawyers from the same firm call on them on consecutive days or notice alack of internal communication. Working together undoubtedly seesgreater marketing success.Result: The lawyers are not taking advantage of their collectivecontracts and ideas, and may even be pursuing conflicting opportunities.ConclusionThere are some firms whose primary goal is just getting the lawyers toundertake marketing activities -- any lawyers and any activities. Andthe last thing a firm should do is construct what the lawyers perceiveto be barriers to marketing, such as processes, controls or approvals.Still without a better system for making decisions about marketingstrategies and resources, many law firms will find their levels ofactivity and expenses going up appreciably without correspondingresults.Back to Headline List WT02-B38-20IA074-000493-B039-147http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi123.html 205.156.212.5 19970122005247 text/html 48323HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:50:50 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:15 GMTContent-length: 48136Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi123.html Sample Issue Copyright THE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNet December 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIES (545 words) SHARE ACCOUNTING CRACKDOWN (316 words) SCOTS SEEK GUIDANCE ON PRELIMS (344 words) GOVERNANCE POLICIES SHOWN TO BE UNRELATED TO PROFITS (562 words) BACKING FOUND FOR DERIVATIVES STATUS QUO (320 words) NEWS BRIEF DIRECTORS' PAY RETREAT BY AUSTRALIAN UIG (90 words) `BLACK HOLE' FEARS PROMPT MD&A PLEA (133 words) CADBURY COMPLIANCE CONTINUES TO CLIMB (166 words) BITTER PILL FOR SUGAR ON PLAYERS' TRANSFERS (189 words) CHARITY GOVERNANCE LAPSES DISCOVERED (303 words) DATA SHORTFALL HIGHLIGHTED FOR ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVES (163 words) LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULED (477 words) BUTTE SPARED GROUND-BREAKING COURT ACTION (548 words) GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998 (611 words) ASB PRODUCES `GENUINE' CASH FLOW STANDARD (393 words) ANDERSEN REJECTS BLAME FOR WICKES (987 words) CONFERENCE REPORT NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONS (625 words) CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIESUK STANDARD setters will face concerted opposition from the brewing andhotel industries to proposed accounting changes which could slash 10percent or more from the pre-tax profits of both sectors.The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) wants to impose a generalrequirement for companies to depreciate the value of their properties.Current rules enable them to avoid this on the grounds that theproperties are either increasing in value or being regularly maintainedor refurbished.Shares in the brewing industry fell recently in anticipation of thechange, even though it would have no impact on a company's cash flow.The proposals are contained in a new ASB discussion paper onmeasurement of tangible assets, which the board expects to lead to anew accounting standard. The paper argues that it is normally"uneconomic" to provide a limitless extension to the life of a propertythrough maintenance or refurbishment.The board also wants all companies to have their propertiesindependently revalued every five years. About 60 percent of companiesrevalue operating properties. These values should also be kept up todate, the board says."Under the present arrangements, companies that revalued theirproperties in the late-1980s at the height of the property boom havesince been able to leave these valuations in their accounts unchanged,"pointed out ASB chairman David Tweedie. One exception to the new ruleswould be so-called "trophy" properties, assets of historicalsignificance which have an unlimited useful economic life and need notbe depreciated. This category might include stores such as Harrods,prime site city hotels or 16th century coaching inns.The possible impact of the proposals is shown in the table, supplied byanalysts UBS Global Research. Scenario 1 is conservative, assuming 25percent residual asset value (being freehold land and remaining bricksand mortar) and a 50-year depreciation charge. Scenario 2 is moreoptimistic at 33 percent residual value, 100-year depreciation onfreeholds and 50 years on long leaseholds.The board has recommended that investment properties should continue tobe excluded from depreciation (assumed in the table). UBS points outthat this will be particularly welcomed at certain companies such asP&O and GUS, where investment properties form by far the greatestproportion of their portfolio. However, the analysts also stress thatthis exemption may eventually be lost under EU accounting plans.Another bright spot for the companies, says UBS, is the paper'sapparent suggestion that an element of repairs and maintenance spendmay be capitalised and depreciated along with the asset.The majority of this spend is currently written off immediately to P&L,UBS points out. Therefore earnings benefits could come via deferral ofa part of the expense, potentially offsetting any additionaldepreciation hit.The proposals have been put out to consultation and a draft standard islikely some time next year.

The AccountingStandards Board's Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) wants to see the realvalue of shares - not merely their nominal amount - charged to theprofit and loss account.The new proposals would apply to Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) aswell as more long-standing types of scheme. LTIPs, a new type ofexecutive share scheme which links rewards to performance, have becomepopular since the Greenbury Committee on executive pay recommended theyshould replace existing executive schemes last year.Companies' use of LTIPs is an ongoing source of controversy. A recentstudy by corporate governance analysts Pension Investment ResearchConsultants found a host of top UK plcs were breaching good practiceguidelines on their use (see TA 5913).Under the new proposals, adjustments would be made to the profit andloss account charge to take account of such factors as: changes in theprobability of performance criteria being met; conditional awardslapsing; or purchases of shares at different prices (either to hedgethe cost of conditional awards or meet the cost of final awards).In cases where options are granted at a discount (ie the exercise priceis below the market value of the shares at the date of grant), the UITFsaid, the discount should be recognised as an expense over theappropriate period. One example is SAYE schemes, where the exerciseprice is normally at a 20 percent discount.Executive share options schemes are unlikely to be affected by theproposals, as Greenbury recommended that executive share options shouldnever be issued at a discount.The proposals have been sent to finance directors of listed companiesfor comments.A deadline of November 7 was set for responses.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

ICAS also wants the figures to be audited.The institute analysed the prelims of 20 top 500 companies and comparedthem with the information contained in the annual report. To itssurprise, the study revealed not all companies included a profit andloss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement in prelims as amatter of course.Every company published a P&L but one omitted a balance sheet and fourfailed to include a cash flow statement. Inclusion of the statement oftotal recognised gains and losses (8), the reconciliation of movementsin shareholders funds (9), and the historical cost profit and lossstatement were found to be still more variable.Analysis of narrative content showed that all but one company in eachcase included a chairman's statement and financial highlights. But only11 and 10 respectively published a financial review or chiefexecutive's statement.ICAS has called on the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop anon-mandatory statement of best practice to improve consistency.The Scots also argue that the market would be better served if the datawere audited."Using audited information would result in the preliminary announcementbeing an extract of the annual report which provides a consistent levelof information across all companies," said Graeme Bissett, convener ofthe institute's Accounting Standards Committee.At present, Stock Exchange rules stipulate that prelim figures musthave been "agreed" with the auditors. Bissett claimed this requirementhad been"intepreted differently by different companies".The ASB is expected to review the subject of prelims soon and ICAS'scomments are the latest contribution to an expanding debate.The Big Six firm KPMG recently argued that prelims could be materiallycurtailed if they were largely replaced by the immediate filing ofaudited statutory results (see TA 5914).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Only in the UK was a "slight correlation"detected.The finding comes in a survey of European corporate governance byDeminor, a Brussels-based consultancy which advises minorityshareholders. The widespread absence of such a link, the companyspeculates, suggests the relationship between corporate governance andfinancial performance could only be proved "in the medium-term". LargeAmerican pension funds have established a link on the basis of muchlarger statistical data, the report points out. This explains why agrowing number of Anglo-Saxon and other institutional investors"explicitly take corporate governance standards into account wheninvesting in European companies", Deminor adds.Overall, the UK was furthest advanced in the field, ahead of (in order)France, Germany and Belgium. Holland was placed last among the fivecountries surveyed. A large majority of Dutch companies, the reportsays, employs fiduciary mechanisms and structures unknown elsewherewhich produce "serious and significant distortions between ownershipand control".Deminor analysed how shareholders were treated in main stock indices ofeach country - FT-30 (UK), CAC-40 (France), DAX (Germany), AEX(Holland) and BEL-20 (Belgium). Publicly available information from atotal of 140 companies was surveyed, including annual reports andcompanies' bye-laws.Scores were awarded against a range of criteria, such as use of boardcommittees and quality of information to shareholders. Final rankingswere then compared with financial performance based on EPS/Stock Priceratio.In addition to the rankings, three other main conclusions emerged. Somecorporate governance issues are neglected everywhere; countries differwidely on certain criteria; and there remains much room forimprovement.Few corporations provided information on directors' independence andthe internal working of the board. On director's remuneration and theissue of board committees, however, a clear divergence emerged.British companies complying with the Greenbury Code reveal much abouthow they pay directors. But in most other countries, with the exceptionof a few French companies, shareholders are given only an aggregateamount of total remuneration. Other countries have also been slowerthan the UK (and to a lesser extent France) to respond to the idea ofestablishing specialised committees for tasks such as directors'remuneration and selection.The UK, Germany and Belgium were found to be the only countries thatlargely adhere to the "one-share - one vote" principle. In France andHolland, shareholders holding multiple voting rights are more common.In most countries, Deminor says, voting at general meetings and filingresolutions remain a problem. "Cumbersome" deposit requirements andproblematic proxy voting are identified as two areas where improvementsare needed. Companies incorporated in special forms (eg Societes enCommandites par Actions in France, Stichting Administatiekantoor in theNetherlands)"are often used to seal off management from shareholders",the study alleges.Despite the wide disparities in performance, Deminor believes across-the-board reform is inevitable.Corporate governance - the top scorersUK                GEC, Glaxo-Wellcome, Hanson, Marks & Spencer,                  BootsFrance            Air Liquide, CCF, L'Oreal, Lyonnaise des Eaux,                  Rhone-PoulencGermany           Daimler-Benz, Lufthansa, Munich Re, Veba, ViagBelgium           Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Bekaert, Generale de                  Banque, Societe Generale de Belgique, UCBThe Netherlands   Aegon, Heineken, KPN, Royal Dutch, UnileverSource: DeminorCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

A survey of 139 organisations which use derivatives has found ahigh-level of consistency in their accounting for the four main typesof derivative instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options).Over 90 percent of respondents match the accounting with the economicsof the transaction, by recognising the effects of the derivativeinstrument at the same time as the hedged item. The survey, by KPMGPeat Marwick, was released on October 11, the deadline date forcomments on derivatives accounting proposals issued in the summer bythe Financial Accounting Standards Board. FASB wants derivatives to becarried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value, asuggestion which has sparked controversy (see TA 5911).Overall, 96 percent of respondents require correlation between theeffects of the derivative and the hedged item, while 91 percent requirethe derivative to be linked to specific assets or liabilities orhomogenous pools.Some 99 percent of those surveyed reported that they requirederivatives instruments to be designated and documented as relating toa particular risk management strategy in order to qualify for riskmanagement accounting.The vast majority of organisations require a specific assessment of therisks being managed for derivative instruments to qualify for specialtreatment, though practice varied in the criteria used to define andevaluate risk. Just 18 percent of respondents believed FASB's proposalswould be an improvement on present practice - though there wasrecognition that modifications were needed."The survey results indicate the respondents utilise a similaraccounting framework," commented Ken Russell, a partner in KPMG PeatMarwick's professional practice department."Guidance from the FASB isneeded to establish specific details of how the existing framework isto be applied."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The study,by Coopers & Lybrand, found that compliance among FT 100 companies hasreached 97 percent.The main area of non-compliance is the code's recommendation ofappointing at least three non-executives. Among smaller listedcompanies, 27 percent failed to adhere to this principle.Elsewhere, the survey comments on the recommendation that directorsshould report on the effectiveness of their systems of internalfinancial control. This has focused the attention of boards on thissubject in a way that has never happened before, it says. However,descriptions of internal financial control were found to vary in lengthand quality, with better companies giving tangible examples of stepstaken.Unsurprisingly, few companies are willing to indicate where there maybe weaknesses. And only a "handful" gave opinions on the effectivenessof internal control systems.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Under the so-called Bosmanruling, clubs can no longer demand a fee for out-of-contract playersseeking to move between clubs in the European Community (see CA 5913).The adjustment reflects Tottenham's assessment of the diminution ofplayer values this may cause.The move reduced the club's net assets from #37.4 million to #25.3million.Tottenham was the only club in England's top division to capitaliseplayer values in 1994/95. The write-down reflects its decision to beginamortising to residual values of zero.Newcastle United, which valued players at #10.9 million in its 1993/94accounts, reacted to Bosman by taking players off the balance sheetaltogether.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Those which do rarely exclude executivetrustees and often include paid executives.The authors, professors Trevor Gambling and Rowan Jones, ask whetherall charities should have an audit committee. They suggest such acommittee could meet a minimum of twice a year with only the externalauditor and non-executive trustees in attendance.The report, sponsored by the Chartered Institute of ManagementAccountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England andWales and the Charities Aid Foundation, raises a number of issues.Not one of the charities surveyed had a coherent policy on theaccumulation and disposal of reserves. Large proportions or evenmultiples of annual expenditure are being either "taken out of thinair" or small surpluses are squirreled away "against a rainy day".The report asks if charities should spend the whole of their incomeevery year, subject to making provision for long-term liabilities andproperly calculated future reserves.New arrangements for financial reporting by charities in England andWales came into force this year. These include a statutory requirementfor the financial statements of unincorporated charities, as well ascharities constituted as companies, to be audited by registeredauditors.The new arrangements also impose a duty on charities' auditors toreport certain matters which may be found in the course of their workto the watchdog Charity Commission. In October, the Auditing PracticesBoard issued new guidance on the audit of charities which takes the newrequirements into account.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

So concludes a new surveyby Edinburgh accounts monitor, Company Reporting.The study found that those companies which include derivatives in theiraccounts do so at nominal value. "From this measure alone an analystwould find it very hard to formulate an idea of value and risk," thesurvey concludes.The ASB published new proposals on the disclosure and measurement offinancial instruments in the summer (see TA 5912). They contain interimrecommendations designed to improve current practice until newstandards appear.The ASB's long-term aim of current valuation was used by only 5 percentof relevant companies analysed."It is clear that present practice issome distance from the ASB's `best practice' specifically in terms ofcurrent value and risk measurement," the report concludes.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULEDA NEW series of actuarial standards will help investors and analystscompare the results of Australian life insurance companies.The first standard, released in mid-October, will force life companiesto revamp the way they calculate profits and their obligations topolicy holders.Actuarial Standard 1.01 on Valuation of Policy Liabilities, produced bythe Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board (LIASB), overlaps with adraft accounting standard released by the Australian AccountingStandards Board (AASB) in August. But AS 1.01 differs in certaindetails, in particular on how to calculate profit margins from lifepolicies.When the AASB released its own draft standard, ED 73, some of thedetails on the calculations - known as "premium splitting" - had notbeen finalised and are not expected to be finalised for another threeyears.LIASB chairman Peter Vinson said the differences between the actuarialand the accounting standard were at the"third level of detail". TheLIASB approach was the result of almost a decade of discussions inwhich he had been involved, he added.Vinson hopes the AASB's approach will eventually dovetail with theLIASB's. He believed it is still quite possible for both sides toadjust their version of how profits should be treated so they ensurethey eventually agree.There had not been sufficient time to ensure the two standards wereidentical where they overlapped, he stressed, as the LIASB had beenrequired to produce a standard to take effect from December 31 thisyear.The new actuarial standard requires profits from a life policy to berecognised over the duration of the policy - rather than be brought toaccount when the policy is signed or be recognised in any other way thelife group chooses. Practices have hitherto varied widely.Known as the Margin on Services (MoS) approach, the method ensures thatthe life groups can only declare profits as they actually deliver theassociated services, and those services are paid for by clientpremiums.The actuarial standard also sets out the method for calculating howmuch money the life company is required to pay out on a policy - itsobligations to the policy holder - and requires that liability to beshown on the books.Vinson said the new standard allowed the performances of life groups tobe compared for the first time. The new standardised approach tofinancial reporting would assist the anticipated future public floatsof several major life companies and add another measure ofcompetitiveness within the industry, he added.Actuarial standards have the status of law in the same way asaccounting standards and actuaries will soon have to deal with asuccession of them. AS 1.01 will soon be followed by standards dealingwith solvency and capital adequacy.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But itappears to have come close on this occasion."In view of [the directors'] undertaking, the panel has refrained fromundertaking proceedings under section 245B of the Companies Act 1985,"the panel said in a statement. Butte responded by saying it was "not inthe interests of the shareholders to pursue this matter any further".The affair concerns accounting for shares in mining company Gem RiverCorporation. A Butte spokesman said the company had received a"considerable sum" in shares in return for organising an explorationprogramme for Gem River in Montana and helping to float the company.Some shares were sold immediately on the Alberta Stock Exchange, but 70percent were "escrowed" and could not be traded immediately because theprogramme's success could not be guaranteed.Despite this, Butte realised the escrowed shares as profits in its 1995accounts. The panel maintained that profit should only have beenincluded on the shareholding that had been realised at the time theaccounts were completed."We knew exactly what was there and believed profit realisation wasreasonably certain," the Butte spokesman said. He also complained ithad taken "some considerable time" for Butte to get a "clear opinion"from the panel on what the treatment should be.The revision has led to a downward adjustment in 1995 profits of#967,000. The spokesman refused to speculate on whether the profitwould be realised in 1996. Butte Mining, which collapsed in 1991 and isnow a litigation vehicle only, is no stranger to controversy. A numberof the company's original directors were later charged with conspiracyto defraud. And in June this year the High Court threw out a #110million-law suit which Butte brought against the Big Six firm Ernst &Young.Butte claimed E&Y predecessor firm Arthur Young had given negligentadvice when it was reporting accountant on Butte's 1987 flotation andin connection with the company's acquisition of North Butte Mining in1988. The company had unsuccessfully tried to pursue the case earlierin the US state of Montana. But the suit was dismissed in 1995 when theMontana District Court determined it had no jurisdiction to hear thecase.Butte resurrected the claim in the UK in the form of a counterclaim toan E&Y writ for unpaid fees. As well as claiming #110 million which thecompany claimed its shareholders had lost as a result of the firm'snegligence, the company's new management claimed an extra #110 millionin what Butte calculated was the interest accrued on the damages.However, Mr Justice Lightman ruled it was not"just or appropriate" forButte to be allowed to resurrect the claim.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998GERMANY HAS moved one step closer to the reform of corporate governancewith a set of proposed changes which may become law in 1998.A parliamentary committee headed by the ministers of justice andeconomics wants stricter controls on statutory audits and heavierresponsibilities for supervisory board members at German companies. Theproposals stop short of any radical change, however, and may well bediluted before they are presented to parliament.On statutory audits, the committee's report is a summary of ideas whichhave already gained broad acceptance with German corporations and arewelcomed by the accounting profession.In future, the statutory auditor of a German company will be appointedby the supervisory board rather than the board of managing directors.That means the auditor's independence need not be reconciled withbusiness interests."It doesn't make sense for the management under scrutiny to decide whataspects of the business should be audited," said a source at thejustice ministry in Bonn.In addition, every member of the supervisory board will have the rightto an advance copy of the auditor's report and the auditor will beobliged by law to attend the supervisory board meeting on the year-endaccounts. Big Six firms in Germany say they already do bothvoluntarily.According to the justice ministry, the committee is also consideringways to make the auditor's certificate more detailed and meaningful.The stock phrases of unqualified approval still used by practically allauditors, including the Big Six firms, include neither comment noranalysis. But no detailed suggestions will be made until discussionshave taken place with accounting profession lobbyists.Other reforms show that the committee's approach is essentiallyconservative. An official petition against the supervisory board willstill have to be backed by 5 percent of voting capital, compared with10 percent before. "We don't want the supervisory board to beundermined by gratuitous petitions," is the view from the justiceministry.The committee has also refused to bow to public opinion by reducing themaximum number of supervisory board positions any individual may hold."It's very difficult to set fixed limits," said the justice ministrysource."It depends on the person's intellectual powers. For somepeople, even one board position would be too many."Only one of the proposals is not already standard in countries withreformed systems of corporate governance. This is that banks which holda shareholding of more than 5 percent in a listed company may no longerexercise their custody clients' voting rights in that company as well.Even institutional investors in Germany typically allow their custodianbank to decide how to use their voting rights, often giving the banksan additional voting strength of several percent. This additionalvoting power makes the banks even more powerful, say critics of thecurrent system.But the government is concerned about the implications. It does notwant shareholder representation at companies' annual meetings todecline, but knows it is unrealistic to expect all investors to dotheir own voting, even by post.One solution suggested by the justice ministry is to give an individualexecutive responsibility for avoiding any conflicts of interest betweenthe bank's voting rights and those of its customers. From the bankscomes a suggestion to set up independent voting companies to handlevoting for custody clients.None of these changes will occur quickly. After lobbying, the draft lawis expected to go to Helmut Kohl's cabinet at the beginning of nextyear and will reach parliament a year later -at the earliest.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Its aim is to improve communication ofinformation on liquidity, insolvency and financial adaptability.The original FRS 1 brought the UK in line with international practiceby scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour ofa cash flow statement. But its practical use convinced the boardfurther changes were needed.Under the 1991 standard, the cash flow statement reported movements incash and cash equivalents (investments with maturities of up to threemonths). But, because treasury management practices differ, the ASBgrew concerned that this may give rise to uncertainty about theinvestments to be included as cash equivalents.Under the revised version, only movements in actual cash (defined ascash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts) will beshown as cash flows.Proposals for reform of FRS 1 published last December in exposure draftFRED 10 have survived with only minor refinements. Other main changesinclude a new section providing expanded disclosures on the managementof liquid resources.The orders and headings for cash flows have been changed to bring theminto line with those used in directors' commentaries (eg the operatingand financial review).The cash flow statement has also been tied in more closely with thebalance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flow on the widely usedfinancial indicator, net debt.Cash inflows and outflows may now be shown net in certain restrictedconditions, for example, if they relate to a constantly renewed short-term facility or a commercial paper programme.The revised FRS1 becomes mandatory on March 23 next year.As The Corporate Accountant went to press, the International AccountingStandards Committee published proposals on accounting for pensions andemployee benefits which are out of step with current UK practice.Exposure draft E54 recommends valuations of future benefit obligationsat each balance-sheet date (not every three years as is standard in theUK). The draft says these should reflect market conditions at the yearend, in contrast with the UK practice of using longer term actuarialestimates.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Paul Rogerson reportsARTHUR ANDERSEN is refusing to accept any blame for failing to spotaccounting errors which led audit client Wickes, the DIY chain, tooverstate profits by #51 million ($80 million).The firm responded defiantly to a letter to shareholders, despatched bythe company on October 16, which claimed Andersen "should have reactedmore effectively" to "warning signals" of false accounting."We were the victims of every auditor's nightmare - a skilfullyexecuted, collusive fraud which deceived everybody," risk managementpartner Chris Nunn said.The incident has once again focused attention on how muchresponsibility auditors should bear for detecting deliberate deception.The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales isconducting a campaign to alert firms to the threat of fraud in anenvironment where financial scandals are increasingly likely to trigger"deep-pocket" negligence claims (see TA 5913).In this case Andersen appears to have escaped a lawsuit. Afterconsulting with its lawyers Wickes has decided to take no action. Butthe company has reserved the right to do so "in the event that furthermatters emerge".Wickes shares have been suspended on the London Stock Exchange sinceJune, when it was first announced problems had been found in the timingof the recognition of profits from suppliers' rebate schemes.The irregularities resulted from discrepancies between the supplycontracts reported to senior management and those actually negotiatedby buying staff.Under arrangements which are common in the retail industry, Wickes andits suppliers negotiated incentive arrangements under which the chainwould be rewarded for achieving target levels of sales of particularproducts with either a discount or a rebate.It also took up-front payments from suppliers for marketing costs or inreturn for shelf-space, often tied to a pledge to achieve a certainvolume of sales.The letter to shareholders, from new chairman Michael von Brentano,follows an investigation into the company's accounts by PriceWaterhouse and lawyers Linklaters & Paines.The probe has confirmed there was "serious mismanagement" in certainWickes operations. Problems were centred on the company's buyingdepartment, where investigators found "deliberate misrepresentation" ofcertain deals with suppliers.The rebates and contributions which senior management required thedepartment to obtain ran into tens of millions of pounds. They amountedto #13 million in 1993 and rose to #30 million in 1994 and #57 millionin 1995.In many cases these sums were booked as profit in the year the dealswere signed rather than spread over the period of the supplyagreements, the investigation found.In some instances the rebates booked to profit were not actuallyreceivable or Wickes was required to meet unrealistic volume targets.Some deals were also found to be uncommercial.As a result of the deception, the group's 1994 and 1995 accountsincluded significant levels of rebates and contributions which had notbeen earned. The necessary adjustments announced by von Brentano haveslashed Wickes's consolidated shareholders' funds by #51 million.The probe found' that "ultimate responsibility" for the debacle must beborne by former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum. Theinvestigators found no evidence that he or any other directors wereaware of the deception.But Sweetbaum and a number of other individuals agreed to repaysubstantial sums in profit-linked bonuses. Wickes has agreed to take nofurther action against them.Andersen approved an accounting policy for supplier rebates andcontributions, but the "underlying substance of many deals did notaccord with it", the report said. Instances came to light in 1995 ofamounts being booked to profit earlier than was justified."The board believes that senior management and the auditors should havereacted more effectively to these warning signals. These matters werenot brought to the attention of the Audit Committee, which was assuredby senior management and by Arthur Andersen that the rebates and thecontributions were shown properly in the group accounts."Andersen is to resign as auditor when work on restating the 1995accounts is finished but Nunn was adamant the firm could not reasonablyhave been expected to do any more to uncover the deception. He pointedto the letter's concession that "false or misleading documents producedto the auditors misdescribed the nature of suppliers' payments andconcealed the true position. "Third party confirmations are the highestquality verifications an auditor can receive," said Nunn.If they are falsified, the auditor has little chance to discover what'sgoing on until the amounts become too big to conceal."Under UK auditing standard SAS 110, auditors must plan and conductaudit work to have a reasonable expectation of detecting a materialmisstatement in the accounts caused by fraud."In 1995 the work that was done confirmed to the best of the evidenceavailable that there were no hidden agendas or conditionalitiesattached to the supplier rebates," said Nunn."Even now, having focused on what we might have done differently, onehas to say the answer is `very little'.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONSThe Hampel committee on corporate governance is proceeding withextreme caution. Paul Rogerson reportsIT WOULD be folly to expect anything too radical from the committee oncorporate governance led by Ronald Hampel. Or so it would seem, judgingby a recent speech by the ICI chairman to a conference attended by 100senior figures from business, academia and the accounting profession.Hampel rarely speculated on how his body might "carry the torch" handedto it by the Cadbury and Greenbury bodies on corporate governance andexecutive pay (respectively). Instead, he focused on what he viewed asthe damaging fall-out of the high profile lately attained by thesesubjects in the UK. A "visitor from Mars" would believe that "a newindustry" had developed in corporate governance, said Hampel. It wasquite worrying, he said, that this had been attended "almost byhysteria". In reviewing the landmark Cadbury code for listed companies,his group seeks to provide an environment in which business can prosperand grow, Hampel said."That is a fundamental behind all our deliberations. We must notstifle, we must stimulate," he said. Responding to a question, Hampeldenied that the Cadbury code is stifling business. But the furore thathas grown up around corporate governance had "denigrated industry" healleged.The Greenbury recommendations on executive pay were squarely in hissights. "All the public debate has been about boardroom excesses and99.9 percent of business has been dragged down with it. It needs to besaid all the time that business must prosper."The Hampel committee has sponsored research into Cadbury and Greenbury.However, Hampel said it would only have two sets of annual reports onwhich to comment on the latter, so it would be "dangerous to be tooprescriptive".The conference, at the London headquarters of the Institute ofChartered Accountants in England and Wales on November 1, coincidedwith the launch of a vast consultation exercise by Hampel. Thecommittee is seeking feedback from a wide range of bodies, includingsome in Europe and North America, on different aspects of its remit.The most important questions to which it is seeking answers areparaphrased below. When responses have been assessed, Hampel aims toissue a draft report in the middle of next year "to see if people thinkour conclusions are appropriate". A final report will follow at the endof 1997.Given the political context of Hampel's deliberations, the subject ofcorporate governance will continue to generate controversy. Theconference coincided with the publication of a report to the committeeby employer's body, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). TheCBI explicitly rejects the concept favoured by the opposition LabourParty that "stakeholders" such as employees, customers and suppliersshould be represented in boardrooms. The interest of shareholdersshould continue to be paramount, it says, dismissing the idea theseinterests could be accommodated in German-style two-tier boards.Hampel may have set a laissez-faire tone for the conference, but it wasnot adopted by every speaker. Anne Simpson, joint managing director ofgovernance consultancy Pension Investment Research Consultants, had "nosympathy" for those who think companies are over-regulated.Shareholders are beginning to turn up at AGMs "to ask questions and notjust eat the sandwiches", she said.Simpson demanded an end to the rubber-stamping of management decisionsin votes and the end of discretionary voting. Increasing shareholderactivity has led some companies to try and rewrite the rules, sheadded. They included British Aerospace, which moved to get rid ofthe"crucial" shareholders vote on its annual report and accounts.Ronald Hampel is a non-executive director of British Aerospace.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The result is that Daimler will have to continuepublishing earnings calculated in accordance with Germany's commercialcode alongside its US GAAP results.The Justice Ministry's decision has serious implications for DeutscheTelekom, which will face the same double book-keeping difficulties asDaimler next year when its shares are listed on the New York StockExchange.Jurgen Funck, state secretary at the Justice Ministry, indicated earlyin 1995 that a concession could be granted from the requirement topublish group accounts that comply with German reporting standardsprovided enough companies wanted to avail of it.In recent weeks, however, the ministry indicated several times thatopponents of the reform had gained the upper hand. Now Herbert Biener,head of accounting standards at the ministry, has made clear that theproposed reform has been defeated."We're not going to make this changejust for the sake of two or three companies," he said.First proposed in March 1995, the proposed concession would haveextricated Daimler-Benz from the double-accounting dilemma it has facedsince its shares were first listed in New York in 1993. Since then,Daimler has been obliged to produce group accounts under both US GAAPand the German commercial code and has come up with earnings figureswhich are sometimes poles apart.Led by Bayer and Schering, the opponents of reform were clearlyunwilling to assist Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Telekom in their questfor foreign capital by agreeing that their US GAAP consolidatedaccounts could be also acceptable for domestic regulatory purposes.They believe that, rather than US GAAP, international accountingstandards (IASs) should become the benchmark for German companiesseeking to raise capital abroad.While Biener believes that corporations and their accountants shouldvoluntarily adopt whatever reporting requirements are demanded byoverseas capital markets, he makes no bones about his preference forIASs. Speaking at a recent accounting conference in Gottingen, Bienerrepeatedly criticised Daimler's technique of double-accounting and thefact that it can produce contradictory results.IASC secretary-general Bryan Carsberg, who also spoke at theconference, welcomed the Germans' support for IASs. But he acknowledgedthe serious dilemma facing companies which will need a listing on theNew York Stock Exchange before IASs are endorsed by the Securities andExchange Commission - which will not happen until 1999 at the earliest.Carsberg said that companies in that position would have no choice butto produce US GAAP accounts, but he hoped that they would use optionsmost comparable with IAS so that it would be easy to change again toIASs after 1999. Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the EuropeanCommission, said it is doubtful that companies would want to return toIASs after adopting US GAAP standards, simply because of the upheavalinvolved.It remains to be seen how Daimler will respond, now that the companyfaces the prospect of having to produce a US GAAP reconciliation for atleast the next four years.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The proposals are contained in exposure draft FRED 10 whichthe standard-setter issued on December 7.Although FRS 1 brought the UK into line with international practice byscrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of acash flow statement, ASB chairman David Tweedie acknowledged that thetime has come for more improvement."The cash flow statement introduced by FRS 1 itself broke new groundand has proved both popular and valuable," Tweedie said. "We have nowgained sufficient experience in its practical use to be able to proposesignificant improvements."FRED 10's main features include a proposal to switch to a "pure" cashflow statement, with the concept of cash equivalents being dropped. Theexposure draft also proposes that expanded disclosures be provided in anew section dealing with the management of liquid resources. FRED 10would change the order and headings for cash flow to bring them intoline with those used by directors in their commentaries on operationsand finances. It would also tie the cash flow statement more closelyinto the balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flows on thewidely-used financial indicator, net debt."Our aim has been to make the cash flow statement simpler to understandand more descriptive of the way business is conducted," Tweedie said."The board believes that the changes represent a significant stepforward, and will be of real benefit to preparers and users ofaccounts. Not least of the improvements is the move to pure cash flowstatements."Comments of the new exposure draft should be sent to the ASB beforeMarch 8.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The working party expects to be able to link the proposedstandard with auditing rules, allowing the audit report to use thewords"true and fair . . . as applicable to small companies".If the proposals find support, the aim is to pass the paper to the ASBwhich has the power to turn the draft into a standard after the usualprocess of seeking comments on an exposure draft. Comments should bereturned to the working party by March 29.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

As many as 70 percent of securities could bereclassified as "available for sale" as bankers seek to maintainfunding flexibility under the new rule, which is an effort to giveinvestors a more accurate picture of a bank's worth.In November, FASB decided to allow banks to move securities from "heldto maturity" to"available for sale" before the end of the year. The one-time adjustments can be accomplished without forcing the institution torevalue all of the securities in its held-to-maturity category.The action already is having an effect. For instance, the First StateBank of Texas in Denton will use the new rule to make a larger share ofits securities available for sale, probably at a 70-30 split comparedwith the previous even split between the two accounts. The 70-30 splitis expected to become common among banks large and small by the end ofthe year.FASB is moving toward making banks mark more of their assets to marketvalues. FASB has also formally issued a draft of a proposed ruleeliminating some of the advantages of securitisations and long-termrepurchase agreements. Under the proposal, a securitised borrowing thatextends over 90 days will be treated as a purchase and sale (seereport, p8).It is all part of a continual, incremental effort to put more of thebalance sheet under mark-to-market rules. Some analysts expect theboard to consider marking liabilities to market sometime next year.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ACCOUNTANTS GIVEN ULTIMATUM ON SELF-REGULATIONTHE GERMAN Government has served notice on the country's auditors thatthey must improve self-regulation to avoid having practice rulesimposed on the profession by law.Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingenin early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting policy atthe Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputychairman of the professional body of German accountants, the Institutder Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).Biener took issue with the profession's new quality standards,introduced just a few days earlier (CAI 64). Even under the new rules,he said, German accountants would still not be obliged to actively seekout evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts."The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said."Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The lawallows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obligedto argue things out with the company."Biener also criticised the IdW for its delay in dealing withshortcomings in the 1994 switch by Bayer, Schering and HeidelbergerZements to international accounting standards. Gross countered that itwas not feasible for the IdW's main practice committee to intervene atan earlier stage, but that the improvements it suggested would beincorporated into the companies' 1995 accounts.Biener acknowledged that Germany's leading accounting firms are world-class, but expressed concern about the profession's rank- and-filemembers. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise toaudits which are just average, rather they should allow accountantswith an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which isup to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died outbecause they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession hasgrasped that message."German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regainpublic confidence. "Our audits have become suspect," Biener said."Sooner or later, German accounts will no longer be accepted by theinternational community."In turn, Biener himself is under pressure from the European Commissionto introduce an accounting regulatory regime along the lines of thosethat exist in other EU member states. Addressing the Gottingenconference, Karel van Hulle, the commission's head of accountingpolicy, pointed out that most EU countries have already establishednational standard-setting bodies that can further Europe's accountinginterests in the deliberations of the International AccountingStandards Committee (IASC).Biener argued that bodies whose agendas are dominated by accountinginterests are not in the best position for regulating the profession.He said that since all accounting firms have their own commercialinterests, they may avoid making initiatives to change the status quo.Biener, therefore, suggested that German, and in turn Europeancompanies, set up a regulatory body modelled on the US FinancialStandards Accounting Board.In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea."Iwon't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] bodyoperates in a sensible fashion," he said. Gross of the IdW counteredthat the main practice committee is already operating as a standard-setter.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This resulted in a confusing system of doubleaccounting, with the company's US GAAP results often differingsignificantly from those calculated under German accountingregulations.Daimler's move is still resented by some of its corporate peers whichhad hoped that by presenting a united front in negotiations with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) they could have won exemptionfrom the more rigorous requirements of US GAAP. Yet at the time of its1993 Wall Street debut, Daimler had little choice; it needed access tocapital, and a New York listing - necessitating US GAAP accounts - wasthe best way to raise it.Liener was forced to resign from Daimler's management board in May 1995and responded by blaming the former chief executive, Edzard Reuter, fora policy of foolhardy expansion. Daimler-Benz is now in seriousfinancial difficulties and announced a loss of more than DM1 billion($692 million) in the first half of 1995.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

With between 120 and 150 partnersbelieved to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000per partner.The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADTfor Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million forBritannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989, which wereaudited by Binder.Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profitswere #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assetswere less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT waseventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit againstBinder in 1992.The judge in the case found Binder had been negligent in its audit ofBritannia and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADTbecause of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off onthe accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop wasasked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accountsgave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishopreplied that he did.Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted aduty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for anyadvice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which heldthat auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless ofwhether they are negligent.Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it willsucceed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparoprinciples apply," a spokesman said.BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of thefirm merged with Arthur Andersen. Other Binder offices merged with StoyHayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some of thepartners joined other accounting firms or went into industry. BinderHamlyn is still trying to determine exactly how many partners areliable in the Britannia case.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Manchester- basedcompany, which was owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and MartinHarrison, was mainly involved in leasing cars, property and computerequipment.Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a duediligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate financeadvice in connection with the transaction.In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations andadvice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceedwith the acquisition."It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisitionSovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the wayit was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position beenrevealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not haveproceeded with the acquisition."In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions ofSch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing, and in 1992 it forcedthe resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance ofits UK operations.Bank Austria also alleges error in a report by PW which stated thatSovereign made a profit of #3.4 million in 1991, when according to thebank it actually made a #1.4 million loss.However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted areal due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said thefirm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisitiontook place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuationat the time of the purchase."We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defendthem," Hainsworth said."If it is being alleged that we valued thecompany at between #30 million and #40 million for the purposes of thetransaction in June 1990, then emphatically we deny it."The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The casecould take two years to be heard.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED KINGDOM:  AUDITORS TO SEEK OFFSHORE LIMITED LIABILITYUK ACCOUNTING firms are set to follow the lead of their US counterpartsby setting themselves up as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). Themove is designed to protect their partners' personal assets in theevent of being successfully sued for negligence.Unlike the US Big Six, which took advantage of legislation introducedin the state of Delaware to become LLPs, UK accounting firms would haveto register their businesses offshore because UK law restricts limitedliability protection for partnerships.Attention is focused on the Channel Island of Jersey whose Parliamentis considering whether to recognise LLP status. While a dependency ofthe British Crown, Jersey does not form part of the UK and has ameasure of administrative independence, including its own legal and taxsystem.In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's Parliamentary Financeand Economics Committee said it would propose a bill to the island'sParliament permitting the creation of LLPs. Price Waterhouse and Ernst& Young have announced that they would register their UK practicesoffshore in Jersey if the island chooses to recognise LLP status.Under the proposed law, an LLP would remain liable for its debts, butindividual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligentact would have their personal assets protected from debts arising fromthat negligence.Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner, andall LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLPwould be required to provide a #5 million ($7.7 million) financialprovision - a sort of bond - for judgments against the partnership. Thedraft law will be debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey,during the first quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to thePrivy Council for sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-end."We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liabilitypartnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Ysenior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number ofclients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and therewould be no change to their UK tax arrangements. The Jersey option isclaimed to be cheaper than incorporating as a limited liabilitycompany, an option chosen by KPMG for parts of its UK audit practice in1995 (CAI 62). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates thesaving could be as much as 10 percent of pre- tax profits, comparedwith the cost of KPMG's chosen route.Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new lawin Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects andsurveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey."At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then youare liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to thatnegligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of CharteredAccountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change theprinciple of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Actof 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These thingstake time, and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law forpartnerships, which dates from 1907, as"not relevant to modern times".Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary legislationwould be needed to change it, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Addressing a recentconference in New York, Sutton said investors need help inunderstanding the risks and complexities."Futures are accounted for differently than swaps. Swaps are accountedfor differently than foreign currency forwards. And foreign currencyforwards are accounted for differently than foreign currency options,"he told the annual conference on current financial reporting issuessponsored by the Financial Executives Institute.Sutton indicated that businesses need a single, articulated set ofguidelines to use. "There's no guidance at all in many areas," he said,adding that"the accounting literature for swaps is badly outdated". Hesaid the most recent guidance can be found only in a brief 60-wordconsensus published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)more than ten years ago.FASB is currently considering two other methods for accounting forderivatives. One would require valuing derivatives at market andcharging value changes against income if the derivatives are activelytraded, or against equity if they are long-term holdings. The othermethod would charge all changes in the values of derivatives againstincome.The SEC, meanwhile, is preparing a proposal that will mandate improveddisclosure about accounting policies, require quantified informationabout market risk and make companies analyse and state theirderivatives strategies. Release of the document was expected before theend of 1995 after receiving the approval of the SEC chairman.Sutton said the new disclosure requirements would essentially codifymany existing practices. Most companies that report derivativesexposure use one of three methods: value-at-risk; an interest ratesensitivity analysis; or a table of raw data showing present and futurecash flows.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ACADEMICS CRITICISE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSALSTWO CANADIAN academics have told the federal government that many ofthe traditional proposals aimed at improving corporate governance willnot work. They suggest alternative measures that run counter to recentsuggestions, including Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) recommendationsadopted in 1995.Their report was commissioned by the federal government as backgroundfor debate on the upcoming review of the Canada Business CorporationsAct, planned for 1997.Ronald Daniels, dean of law at Toronto University, and Randall Morck, abusiness professor at Alberta University, believe that issues such asthe size of boards of directors or the level of insider ownership of acompany are largely irrelevant.The two professors say the government should neither encourage ordiscourage insider ownership of companies because there is no evidencethat concentrated ownership leads to a poorer performance. They alsosuggest that there is no point in separating the roles of chiefexecutive and chairman of the board and say governments should not tryto control the size of boards.In contrast, the TSE has said that companies should not have large,unwieldy boards, has called for the separation of the roles of chiefexecutive and chairman, and wants the board composed largely of outsidedirectors.The professors would, however, like to see increased focus on what theyconsider the root of one of the most important corporate governanceissues: non-arms'-length transactions between related companies, alsoknown as self-dealing. "This deals with the actual problem, not withthe symptoms of the problem," Morck said.The professors recommend that all companies with a dominant shareholderset up a special conduct committee of entirely independent outsidedirectors to review any proposed internal transactions.While they do not see the need to change current laws requiring atleast two independent directors on every board, they want thegovernment to tighten the definition of independence. They point outthat many so-called outside directors are company lawyers, advertisingexecutives or senior managers of companies with close businessrelationships. "Outside directors should be outsiders," Morcksaid."They should have no relationship whatever with the company."The professors also recommend that directors be paid only in stock orstock options, because that would align their interests with those ofthe shareholders. They also want directors to be held liable in class-action suits by shareholders, but only after the government has clearlydefined the limits of that liability, which they say should not extendbeyond the change in value to a company measured by the value of thedecline in share price.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Bank of Montreal and manufacturer NovaCorp were lauded for their "clear, effective" annual reports, describedby the judges as "shining and brilliant".Awards are handed out in 13 categories, including various resourcegroups, manufacturing, hi-tech, media, telecommunications, utilities,merchandisers, financial institutions and conglomerates. As well, thePost bestows annual environmental awards.The tie seems to reflect the overall improvement in the quality ofannual reports, said Philip Creighton, co-ordinator of the judges whorepresent the awards sponsors, the Canadian Institute of CharteredAccountants, the Canadian Investor Relations Institute and the TorontoSociety of Financial Analysts."The field is getting better," Creighton said, adding that there isstill room for improvement. For example, in the hi-tech sector - a newclass this year - it was often difficult to tell what a particularcompany was selling."I think it depends on how mature the industry is and how long it hasbeen worrying about these problems," Creighton said. "The basicindustries have made tremendous progress in being able to write abouttheir processes in a fashion that is understandable and in supplyinginformation. I can remember when all those industries were as bad as hi-tech is now."The Bank of Montreal was chosen as the winner in its category and forthe Award of Excellence because of its excellent separate financialgoals and measures section, which "provides insight into the bank'sperformance . . . The only weakness noted is consistent with all thebank reports reviewed - very limited revenue, cost and capitalsegmentation information."Nova Corp's report was praised as "a brilliant annual report loadedwith extensive disclosure and meaningful segmented information on alloperations".The Award of Excellence in the environmental awards went to NorthernTelecom. "Not only has Nortel issued an interesting and informativereport, but it has distinguished itself from other companies throughcontinued efforts to improve the quality of its environmentalreporting," the judges said.They particularly liked its"Lifecycle" approach, which looks at thecompany's products from concept to consumption, and clearly describesthe potential impact those goods have on the environment. And thejudges were especially pleased with Nortel's decision to produce fewerhard copies of the environmental report, making it available on thecompany's World Wide Web site instead.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The committee was set up a year ago in response torecommendations made by the TSE's corporate governance study."Although [Canadian] disclosure requirements are currently high, thereis enough non-compliance to cause concern," said Thomas Allen, acorporate lawyer and chairman of the committee. "The remedies toparties who are injured by lack of disclosure are clearly inadequate."Allen said his committee's recommendations would give those sufferinglosses as a result of inadequate or misleading disclosure reasonableopportunities to recover those losses.The committee also suggested that companies pay a minimum fine of C$1million or 5 percent of their market capitalisation - whichever ishigher - for misinformation. As well, major shareholders would beliable for unlimited sanctions if they knowingly influence companyofficials to release inaccurate information.Another recommendation was to broaden civil liability to include so-called continuous disclosure documents, such as quarterly financialreports and press releases. Currently, companies and directors areliable only for incorrect information in a prospects or takeovercircular.Moreover, investors would be able to seek damages from experts, such asconsultants, if their advice leads to misinformation. The liabilityceiling for experts would be the greater of C$1 million or three timesthe annual fees they receive from the company."We think [the penalties] are enough to get corporate Canada'sattention but not so much that it risks dramatically injuring corporateCanada," Allen said.He acknowledged that the recommendations will force companies to spendmore money to ensure that corporate documents are accurate. "We thinkthat the cost, whatever it is, is more than offset by the benefit toCanadian markets of the repute in which they will be held by virtue ofenhanced disclosure."Although Edward Waitzer, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission,hailed the report as "an outstanding piece of work", one of the TSEcommittee members thinks it does not go far enough. According toToronto lawyer Philip Anisman, C$25,000 "would not provide a level ofcompensation for investors that would warrant a class, or even anindividual, action".In a dissenting statement on the report, Anisman wrote:"It is alsoquestionable whether it would provide adequate deterrence. The ceilingon directors' or officers' liability should be the greater of at leastC$100,000 or their total compensation during the year preceding thedisclosure violation."Anisman also pointed out that the committee's recommendations containseveral loopholes that lessen the impact of the sanctions. For example,they exclude professional advisers, such as accountants and lawyers,from liability.The public has until March to comment on the proposals.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The conference will also address the Internet's manysecurity issues and concerns."The Internet is an open system and wasn't designed to be secure," saidJim Kates, the consultant in charge of conference activities. "Peopleusing the system usually aren't thinking about whether the data theyare transmitting is confidential or sensitive or not," he said, addingthat there are few products on the market today that can help keep asystem secure.Kates said this is especially problematic when the Internet is used forelectronic commerce. A system still needs to be devised for the sale ofsecurities and the transmission of confidential information that relieson mutual integrity and mutual authentication of buyer and seller andwhere the integrity of the data remains authentic, he said."There are some security products on the market, but they can beillegally accessed," he said. "It's useless to perform a transaction ifat any point in time it can be intercepted and changed."Kates said that, as for now, an auditor's best use of the Internet isas a reference source or marketing tool. "An auditor completing anenvironmental audit can find information on how to dispose of wastemore easily," he said. "Or a firm can search the net to find out howits new product stacks up against potential competition."There's a bulletin board where auditors can discuss audit issues.There are search utilities an accountant can use that will seek outinformation for him, by using key words, like `bank securities fraud'."IIA, like all major accounting bodies, has its own on-line base forsending pictures and text to members and other interested parties.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FASB SEEKS STANDARDISATIONJames R Peterson reports on FASB's efforts to develop accounting rulesfor the booming market in financial assetsTHE US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is close tocompleting a major effort to standardise accounting for transfers offinancial assets. A preliminary draft of the proposal has beenavailable for comment since October, and the board is encouragingparticipation at a hearing on the proposal scheduled for late February."The proposal breaks new ground in resolving long-standing questionsabout whether transactions should be accounted for as securedborrowings or as sales," said FASB project manager Halsey Bullen. "Theboard wanted to develop an approach that would be responsive todevelopments in the financial markets and have some consistency andrigour to it," he told CAI."There are any number of financial assets traded in today's boomingfinancial markets," he said. "This proposal will enable people to findsound answers to questions on how to account for new kinds oftransfers, such as securitisations, where you take a set of assets andtailor them to an investor's desire for a certain predictability incashflows and control over risk."The proposal covers transactions which until now were treatedseparately in accounting, such as securitisations, sales of partialinterests, repurchase agreements, securities lending, loan syndicationsand participations, sales of receivables with recourse, and servicingof mortgages and other loans.The document states that "the new standards would provide accountingand reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assetsand extinguishments of financial assets." Those standards would bebased on consistent application of the accounting method known as the"financial components approach", which has to do with the issue ofcontrol, a word that is central to any understanding of the newproposal.If a company has surrendered control over the transferred assets, thetransaction would be considered a sale. Otherwise, it would beaccounted for as a secured borrowing.A company would have to recognise all financial assets and servicing itcontrols and the liabilities it has incurred after a transfer offinancial assets. It would also have to remove from the balance sheetthose assets it no longer controls and those liabilities that it hassatisfied.In FASB's proposal, a lender has surrendered control only if all of thefollowing conditions are met:* The transferred assets have been isolated from the lender beyond itsreach and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership.* The lender obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferredassets.* Any agreement to repurchase the assets can be satisfied by deliveryof assets that are readily obtainable.* The transfer is not temporary.The plan would require that liabilities entered into as part of atransfer of financial assets initially be measured at fair value, ifpractical. It would require servicing assets to be measured byallocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold andretained interests based on their relative fair values on the transferdate.The FASB proposal also addresses the issue of loan impairment. After atransfer, servicing assets and liabilities would be subsequentlymeasured by amortisation over the period of estimated net servicingincome, with impairment to be recognised if the carrying amount ofunamortised servicing assets at risk exceeds their fair value.The proposal would allow elimination of a liability from the balancesheet only if a debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of itsobligation for the liability, or if a debtor is legally released fromprimary obligation for the liability by the creditor or by the courts.Bullen expects the proposal to spark some controversy. He saidcompanies that find they must report as a sale what they've beenreporting as borrowing will not like it because they may have torecognise a loss.The proposal could also dampen the use of "repos", or repurchaseagreements by banks. FASB wants to reclassify all repurchase agreementsmore than three months long as sales. At present, repos, in which oneparty sells securities to another and agrees to buy them back at aspecified price at a specified time, are treated as collateralisedloans.Banks are currently able to classify repos as "held to maturity" and donot have to mark them to market prices on a regular basis. If repos areclassified as sales, banks would have to mark the securities they sellto market and account for any gains or losses.Bullen, meanwhile, expects some heated discussion about FASB's plan toeliminate the distinction between normal servicing and excess servicingof mortgages. This change might allow an inefficient mortgage servicerincurring costs exceeding receivables to account for the transaction inthe same way as a more efficient servicer.While constructing its new approach, FASB looked closely at theInternational Accounting Standards Committee's proposed internationalaccount standard on Financial Instruments, which would permitderecognition of financial assets and liabilities upon transfer of"substantially" all underlying risks and rewards.FASB found this standard insufficiently consistent because it is opento varied interpretations.When approved, the proposal will supersede a number of FASB standards,including Statement 76, Extinguishment of Debt, and Statement 77,Reporting by Transferor for Transfers of Receivables with Recourse.It would also amend Statement No. 115, Accounting for CertainInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities, to clarify that a securitymay not be classified as held-to-maturity if it can be prepaid orsettled so that the holder of the security would not recoversubstantially all of its investment.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

JamesR Peterson reportsSHAREHOLDERS WILL see their dividends from US oil and gas stocksreduced as companies come to grips with a new standard, Accounting forImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, from the Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB).The move is unlikely to cause unusual concern, however, because theeffect on dividends will be temporary, affecting earnings in a singlequarter, and because the new accounting rule ultimately will allowshareholders to better predict a company's future earnings.Texaco is taking a fourth-quarter charge of $640 million, whichanalysts say will swing the company's quarterly results into a loss.Earlier this year, Burlington Resources, Ashland and Phillips Petroleumrespectively took $304 million, $90 million and $49 million in charges.Besides Texaco, at least two other oil giants, Mobil and Chevron,expect to take big charges related to the new FASB rule.The new rule, Standard 121, was implemented so that investors couldbetter assess the true worth of a company's assets. The new rule callsfor all US companies to compare the future expected values of assetsagainst current book value. If the future values are less than book,the company must write down the value of that asset.Oil and gas companies are particularly affected by the rule changebecause it is the first time they have had to assess each of theirproducing fields on a case-by-case basis. Under a previous informalSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule, oil fields wereevaluated on a nationwide or worldwide basis. The SEC allowed the firmsto offset those fields that had a value less than book against otherswith higher values."Aside from the SEC rule for the oil and gas industries, there was nostandard for impairment of fixed assets until FASB adopted the currentstandard last spring," according to FASB project manager Carmen Bailey,who said it is hard to predict which other industries are facing largewrite-downs.George Batavick, Texaco's assistant comptroller, emphasised that thecompany's fourth-quarter write-down is a one-time-only, non- cash eventand that the assets in question are only technically impaired. "Theassets are producing positive earnings and positive cash flow," hesaid. "But since the cash flow on an undiscounted basis would notrecover the investment that is on our books, the FASB rule necessitateda write-down.""Under the old SEC rule, we looked at our producing oil fields in theaggregate," Batavick explained. "In the aggregate, we had highinvestment fields being paired with low investment fields and the cashflows exceeded the total investment. However, on a field-by-fieldbasis, the individual cashflows of particular high investment fieldswere not recovered by the cashflows."The write-down was based on Texaco's estimate of the current and futurevalue of each of its oil fields. "If you have acquired a property whenits price was high, and today's prices are lower, the carrying value ofthe asset must be reduced to come into line with today's prices andwhat we expect the value of the property will be in the future."Batavick said the question of valuing assets becomes a problem when acompany acquires a large firm with highly valued assets. Key toTexaco's write-down is its recent acquisition of Getty Oil Company."Investors ought to feel more secure," he said, "because the write-downwould otherwise have been reported as a depreciation expense in futureyears."The new rule establishes standards for "impairment of long- livedassets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to thoseassets to be held and used", and also for"long-lived assets and certainidentifiable intangibles to be disposed of".The original scope of the FASB project was limited to accounting forthe impairment of long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles. Theboard decided to include goodwill related to impaired assets afterdeciding that long-lived assets could not be tested for impairmentwithout also considering the goodwill arising from the acquisition ofthose assets.The board also decided to include depreciation in the scope of itsproject because it found that the choice of depreciation method andestimates of useful life of an asset could have an impact on whether animpairment exists. FASB suggests that an asset's depreciation methodshould be reviewed periodically and changed if current estimates of theasset's value differ significantly from previous estimates.The history of Standard 121 extends to July 1980 when the AccountingStandards Executive Committee of the American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants (AICPA) urged FASB to provide more accountingguidance for the impairment of fixed assets. No action was taken untilthe mid-1980s when FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) took up theissue. EITF members, noting a significant increase in the size andfrequency of write-downs of long-lived assets, suggested there was aneed for a single rule.In 1989, a report by the Institute of Management Accountants revealed acontinuing steady increase in write-downs and called for moreauthoritative guidance on accounting for impairment of long-livedassets.As a result of these recommendations, FASB added a project to itsagenda in 1988 and issued for comment a discussion memorandum,Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and IdentifiableIntangibles. The final exposure draft, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,was issued last year and the new standard was adopted last March.Standard 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal yearsbeginning after December 15 1995. However, some firms, like Texaco,have chosen early application of the rule.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITHFollowing publication of an extensive study of international accountingpractices, Gerry Acher, KPMG's head of audit and accounting in the UK,traces the background to the IASC's new- found prominenceIT IS increasingly recognised that international accounting standardsare a force to be reckoned with - as demonstrated by the publication inDecember of TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting - and the man whoignores them risks being left by the wayside while others set the pace.In essence, their importance arises because international standards areneeded and international accounting standards (IASs) fit the bill,having been markedly improved in recent years.When the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) wasfounded in 1973, part of the dream was that a single set of standardswould allow a company to raise finance anywhere in the world. Thatdream has become a pressing need. Companies around the world grapplewith other people's standards in order to tap foreign capital markets.In particular, entry to US capital markets is open only to those whoprepare their financial statements in accordance with US accountingprinciples, or who reconcile their domestic financial statements tothese principles. There are a few exemptions from this for specificareas of accounting.What irks companies is not so much the differences in the rulesthemselves as the fact that they are another country's rules; the firmshave had no input to the development of these rules, and there is alittle bit of national pride at work. For example, some Europeancountries feel particularly aggrieved when they are required to use USGAAP.With the world as its constituency, the IASC does not have thisproblem. Almost everyone has reached this conclusion. The GermanGovernment has let it be known that it will tolerate the use of IASsfor domestic purposes. The issue is also under consideration in France.The European Commission has also softened its stance. There were earlymutterings of a Euro-ASB, but in the end, reason triumphed over badhabit. The commission wants to work with the IASC and to allow Europeancompanies to prepare their consolidated accounts under IASs.Most significantly, however, capital market regulators across theworld, in the form of the International Organisation of SecuritiesCommissions (IOSCO), have reached a milestone agreement with the IASC.IOSCO agrees that the current list of IASs contains a nucleus ofacceptable standards. Moreover, it will work with the IASC to try toensure that 15 new or revised IASs, to be issued by 1999, will also beacceptable to IOSCO. If that can be achieved, IOSCO will endorse theIASs for use in listings anywhere in the world. In theory this includesNew York, and the achievement of this is a prime goal of the exercise.London already accepts IASs.ImprovementThat IASs have reached this position is a testament to theirimprovement in recent years. At one time they were thought of as thelowest common denominator. But during almost ten years in office, DavidCairns, former IASC secretary-general, steered the organisation througha major revisions project, cutting out many of the optional treatments,and bringing it to the top table among the standard-setters.Cairns's successor, Sir Bryan Carsberg, who brings to his roleconsiderable authority and experience in the accounting and politicalfields, now talks on equal terms with his counterparts at, for example,the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the American FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB). In the list of five bodiescollaborating on recent international studies on future events, hedgingand provisioning, you will find the IASC.National standard-setters want international convergence as far aspossible, and not purely from a theoretical viewpoint; convergence hasstrong practical attractions too.First, there are obvious advantages in borrowing, or participating in,others' research. Countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong take thisapproach to its ultimate conclusion and base their accounting systemsdirectly on IASs.And second, there are real benefits for preparers and users. It wouldbe a genuine convenience for international groups to have the same setof accounting principles for local and group reporting. When companiesdo cross-border mergers and acquisitions they become users ofaccounting information. If the two parties spoke the same accountinglanguage it would be one less obstacle to deal-making. And it would begood economics. The better everyone understands the information, thebetter the resource-allocation decisions will be.How are standard-setters pursuing this goal? They now look to theIASC's work as the reference point. The UK's ASB does this. Most of itsproposals regard developments at the IASC. For example, the draftStatement of Principles owes much to the IASC's Framework. In addition,the appendices to FRS 4 and FRS 7 go to the trouble of explaining whyit was felt necessary to depart from IASs in those standards. But we donot just respond to the IASC; with Sir David Tweedie newly appointed tothe IASC board, the UK's standard-setting body is strongly representedin the process.PrinciplesI am particularly pleased that principles rather than rules are thebasis of the international standards. We must fight to retain thisgeneral approach, and not allow the standards to drift towards a cook-book approach. The differences from our own standards are limited,although sometimes significant.For example, the IAS definition of a merger is very similar to theUK's. And like FRS 6, merger accounting must be adopted if thedefinition is met; acquisition accounting applies in other cases.Acquisition accounting itself is very similar but, crucially, it wouldaccommodate the acquirer's intentions, such as reorganisations, in thefair value exercise. The end product of this is goodwill. Here a majordifference crops up.Under IAS 22, positive goodwill must be capitalised and amortised overup to 20 years. Negative goodwill is used to reduce the values assignedto the non-monetary acquired assets and any remaining amount treated asdeferred income, to be spread over up to 20 years. Alternatively, thewhole amount may be dealt with as deferred income.The UK approach is largely to write off goodwill directly to reserves.While this is under review, it seems likely that even if the UKrequires goodwill to be capitalised, the amortisation requirement willdiffer significantly from that of IAS 22.It is important to be aware of such differences and of the futuredirection of the international standard-setters. If convergence ofstandards - or at least an acceptable set of international standards -is to be achieved, more interest in their development is necessary thanhas been shown hitherto.Staying with intangible assets for a moment, development costs areanother area of difference. Under IAS 9, if certain conditions are met,then development costs must be capitalised (and subsequentlyamortised). For those who think that the IASC takes its lead from theUS this is a salutary lesson; under US GAAP, development costs arenever capitalised.Like the UK, IAS 16 permits fixed assets to be revalued. Unlike the UK,it requires revaluations to be done on a class-by-class basis and to bekept up to date. If such a requirement was in force in the UK then manyof the anomalies of its present mixed system would be alleviated.Accounting for financial instruments - including derivatives - is aproblem for everyone. At present, the IASC has a standard coveringdisclosure and presentation (IAS 32). No standard-setter yet has acomprehensive measurement standard. The IASC aims to have one by June1997. In the meantime, IAS 32 should keep preparers, auditors and usersoccupied. Its disclosures of credit risk, fair values and hedges aredemanding and informative. Its presentation rules are innovative.Freed from the constraints of a legal framework, the IASC is able torequire companies to report preference shares that contain anobligation as debt. On top of that, hybrid instruments, such asconvertible debt, are to be split into debt and equity elements andseparately accounted for.Some of the other differences from UK standards are as follows:* Jointly-controlled entities may be proportionately consolidated;jointly-controlled assets must be proportionately consolidated. (Onlyunincorporated joint ventures may use this treatment in the UK).* The cumulative exchange differences on the net investment in aforeign entity are presented as a component of equity. They aresubsequently taken into the calculation of profit or loss on anydisposal of the foreign entity. There are no such requirements in theUK.* When translating the financial statements of a foreign entity, theprofit and loss account should be translated at the actual or averagerates. The UK also permits the closing rate to be used.* The minority interest in a subsidiary may be based on the relevantshare of the pre-acquisition book values of the subsidiary, as opposedto the fair value as mandated in the UK.* The current portion of long-term debt may be excluded from currentliabilities where the company can and intends to refinance it on a long-term basis. This is not generally possible under the UK's FRS 4.* Only a major line of business could qualify as a discontinuedoperation. The UK definition refers to a material effect on the natureand focus of operations. Moreover, the discontinued operation's profiton ordinary activities - that is, before extraordinary items and thusafter interest and tax - must be disclosed. Discontinued interest andtax need not be disclosed in the UK.* Extraordinary items are more possible. IAS 8 cites earthquakes andexpropriation of assets as examples. Such events would be withinordinary activity under the UK's FRS 3.As mentioned earlier, 15 new or revised standards are expected from theIASC by 1999. In part these will fill gaps in the portfolio - forexample, at present there are no comprehensive standards onpresentation (i.e. the form of accounts) or on earnings per share. Butthere are also some contentious issues in the pipeline. In addition toa measurement standard for financial instruments, a revised standard ondeferred tax (due soon) and a new standard on intangibles (due in June1996) are on the way. These last two present difficulties ofharmonisation.FundamentalThe UK and the US use fundamentally different bases for bothrecognition and measurement of deferred tax. The UK recognition basisis the well known timing differences approach, whereas the US seeks torecognise the tax that would arise on a realisation of all of theassets and liabilities at their book values, known as the temporarydifferences approach. The UK, increasingly the international odd-man-out, provides only partially for timing differences; the US provides infull for its temporary differences.There is no synthesis of these two systems; whichever way the IASC'sjudgment goes - and the indications are that they will find in favourof the US bases - discord will be the result.With intangibles, the issue is the extent to which they can beseparated from goodwill. In the UK, the current proposal would allow,for example, an acquired brand to be separated out where its fair valuecould be reliably measured. The IASC's proposal (E50) agrees inprinciple. However, it does not regard a measurement based ondiscounted future revenues - as is typically the case for brands - assufficiently distinct from the measurement of goodwill to meritseparate recognition.The IASC has come a long way. In the field of accounting developmentsit has moved, unnoticed by many, from the rearguard to the van. But thecampaign is not over yet. If the world is to move forward we mustachieve the goal of listing on a US exchange under IAS. This is whatthe IASC is fighting for; it deserves our attention, co-operation andsupport.TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting is published by Macmillan, price#350, and provides a fully-comparative guide to official accountingrules and their practical applications for 14 national regimes, plussystematic explanations of IASC standards and the 4th and 7th EUdirectives.

But, as CAI reports, an early resolution of the  complexissues involved seems unlikelyMORE THAN a year after a group of creditor banks announced a DM255million ($180 million) lawsuit against Price Waterhouse over its auditsof two German companies brought to the brink of bankruptcy by allegedfraud, the court case opened in Frankfurt at the end of November.But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, thejudge quickly proposed an adjournment until after former executives ofthe two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat, have been triedon charges of criminal fraud.The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for severalyears because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes toprove that the former executives of credit factoring company, Procedo,and its biggest customer, sports-surface manufacturer Balsam, engagedin fraudulent transactions that led to the collapse of both companies.Muscat, who advised both companies, is accused of "deliberateinvolvement" with the alleged frauds.Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his caseagainst PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partnersacted with the intention to defraud, rather than just negligently. Buthe is unwilling to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to aprolonged adjournment. After both sides had consulted with theirclients, the court planned to reconvene on December 19 to make a finaldecision on the adjournment.The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of "intentional misconduct"in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approvingthe accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added anew claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval withoutactually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.The alleged fraud centres on Procedo's factoring transactions withBalsam which led it to advance cash to the manufacturing company inreturn for collecting its trade receivables. Prosecutors claim thefactored invoices were doctored to make Balsam's turnover look biggerthan it was. Balsam filed for bankruptcy in June 1994 after its topmanagement was arrested on suspicion of fraud, a move that precipitatedProcedo's petition for protection from its creditors. The biggestcasualties were the companies' bankers which claim to be owed DM2.3billion.PW's involvement stems from its audits of Balsam, which it undertookjointly with a Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, FMP. Muscat, a partner inboth PW and FMP, audited Procedo in an individual capacity. He wasarrested in August 1994 on charges of fraud.In an interview with CAI, PW's senior partner in Germany, WolfgangKrause, said his firm may have to be bailed out by PW's European firmif the creditor banks are awarded the legal damages they are seeking.Krause said PW Europe would "naturally" provide financial support sincethe German practice has no funds to pay an out-of- court settlement,let alone the full sum of DM255 million for which it is being sued. "Wedon't have any possibility to build reserves," he said, citing the highcost of personnel, information technology, training and liabilityinsurance in Germany.That insurance, however, is unlikely to cover the millions PW could endup paying as a result of the Balsam/Procedo lawsuit. In remarks aboutthe German accounting profession in general, Ulf Pohl, managingdirector of Wirtschaftliche Versicherungsstellethe, the leadingprovider of professional indemnity insurance cover for accountants inGermany, said firms invariably take up "substantially less" than themaximum cover of DM70 million that he offers.Moreover, Pohl said German corporate law makes it impossible foraccountancy firms to insure against "intentional misconduct" by theirpartners. In the Balsam/Procedo suit, PW and six of its partners areaccused of precisely that misdemeanour.While the court action is now under way, PW still hopes it can reachagreement out of court. "Our legal counsel is strongly urging us to seethe case through, but we don't want this business to go for another tenyears," Krause said.Meanwhile, there is little evidence that PW has been damaged by theunfavourable publicity generated by the lawsuit. Only six partners haveleft or retired (including Muscat and Gerd Frielingsdorf, two of thosenamed in the suit), and fee income continues to rise.Provisional figures for the year to the end of last June showed grossrevenues of DM253 million, up 5.4 percent from the previous year.Revenues for 1995/96 are projected at DM275 million.Those figures make PW the smallest of the Big Six in Germany, butKrause explained that the firm's approach to the market differs fromthat of its larger competitors. Its share of statutory audit work isprobably smaller than that of any other major German firm; instead itfocuses on audit-related projects such as due diligence, treasurymanagement, internal audit consulting and balance sheet planning forcompanies which are not statutory audit clients.Like PW firms in other markets, the German firm likes to regard all itsprofessionals as"consultants". Many assignments are awarded inconnection with mergers and acquisitions where PW's corporate financesubsidiary has acted as a consultant. In fiscal 1995, audit workaccounted for 40 percent of fee income compared with 43 percent theyear before. At other Big Six firms in Germany, the figure is around 60percent.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

After years ofdancing round the issue, the world's stock market regulators finallycame to an agreement with the International Accounting StandardsCommittee (IASC) on a timetable for a set of core standards that wouldbe acceptable for cross-border listings and capital raising.Having been dismissed for years as a well-intentioned but ineffectualstandard-setter, the IASC could not conceal its delight. AustralianMichael Sharpe, who took over the role of IASC chairman on July 1,hailed the agreement with the International Organisation of SecuritiesCommissions (IOSCO) as an "historic moment"."Companies should now feel confident that the IASC and IOSCO are fullycommitted to developing IASs that will be acceptable everywhere in theworld and recognise the efficiencies that may be obtained from usingIASs," he said. "At the moment, companies using IAS standards can raisecapital on many global stock exchanges. Now they know that they will beable to access all of them in the not-too-distant future. Not justwhole companies, but whole countries will now move to IAS rules."Amid the jubilation, however, the huge task facing the IASC between nowand the end of the decade must not be underestimated. Included in the15 standards that the IASC has agreed to issue or revise at IOSCO'sbehest are some of accounting's most controversial issues, such asfinancial instruments, intangible assets and leasing.Even if the IASC manages to stick with its ambitious timetable, its newand revised standards would still have to be endorsed by IOSCO'stechnical committee before they can be recognised as acceptable forcross-border listings in all capital markets. The final hurdle will begetting the national securities regulators to recognise IASs in theirrule books.The stance adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),which regulates entry to the world's biggest capital market, will beespecially important. Domestic US companies are determined that theyshould not have to compete head-on for the same capital with foreignregistrants that are not subject to the full rigours of US GAAP.Research unveiled in the spring of 1995 suggests, however, that the gapbetween IASs and US GAAP may not be as wide as is generally thought.According to Trevor Harris, the accounting professor at New York'sColumbia University, who undertook the study: "We found that at leastfor firms utilising the IASC's revised International AccountingStandards there are few instances, especially from an investor'sperspective as opposed to a technical accounting perspective, where thecompanies' compliance with IASs would not meet US GAAP."Harris also noted that endorsement of IASs would not necessarily weakenthe SEC's hand. "If the SEC believes a company is hurting investors byobfuscating the information, despite apparent compliance with IASs,then it can still impose its regulatory control if the company isregistered," he said.With so much attention to keeping the Americans on side, some of theIASC's other power brokers are concerned that their interests are beingpushed to one side. Those concerns have been heightened with therealisation that political squabbles about the future direction of IASsare being overtaken by events on the ground, as more multinationalcompanies switch to US GAAP in return for entry to the New York StockExchange.The hegemony of US GAAP led the European Commission, in particular, tosignal that it might intervene to halt the slide. Addressing a meetingof European accountants at the end of 1994, John Mogg, the commission'sdirector general for the internal market and financial services, said:"We must recognise that Europe cannot escape its own responsibility toshape accounting standards. We cannot be merely reactive to thesolutions put forward by others."Mogg's sentiments were amplified by Karel van Hulle, head of thecommission's accounting standards unit. After acknowledging theshortcomings of the commission's existing accounting directives duringan address to the European Accounting Association in May, van Hulleadded: "We have to change our approach in the area of financialreporting or the European input into the debate will diminish. Idisagree with those who argue that this is a good thing. Something hasto be done to prevent the directives becoming a burden on progress."Such talk raised fears inside and outside Europe that Brussels waspreparing to go it alone in harmonising the accounting practices of theEU's 15 member states. Those fears, however, were eventually put torest at IOSCO's annual conference in July, when Mario Monti, thecommissioner responsible for accounting policy, signalled that Brusselswould seek to work through the IASC as the best way to harmoniseaccounting practices both within the EU's member states and with theoutside world."Agreement on IASs would enable us to enter negotiations with otherregions aimed at securing mutual recognition of public offer andlisting prospectuses based on these same IASs," Monti said. "We believecompanies should only be required to prepare one set of consolidatedaccounts, and we plan to examine the possibility for European companieswith an international vocation to prepare their consolidated accountson the basis of IASs."Brussels' embrace of IASs is also mirrored by a realisation among someheavyweight EU member states that, rather than fretting from thesidelines about the IASC's perceived Anglo-Saxon bias, it is better tomake their voices heard by playing a more active role in thedeliberations of the global standard-setter. Most European countries,however, are hampered by the fact that they do not have strong standard-setting bodies, such as the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) orthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the US, which couldfly their flags at the IASC.France, for one, is set to remedy that situation with the announcementby economy minister Jean Arthuis that he plans to set up a state bodywith the power to issue binding pronouncements on financial reporting.Addressing the 50th congress of the country's professional accountancybody, the Ordre des Experts Comptables, Arthuis warned that France'sexisting accounting regime, which is based on legislation rather thanprivate-sector standards, "is threatened with sclerosis".A key feature of Arthuis's proposed Comite de la ReglementationComptable (CRC) is that its pronouncements would draw heavily on IASs.That could remove a big obstacle facing capital-hungry Europeancompanies: the need to prepare multiple, and often contradictory,accounts to satisfy the needs of both domestic regulators and overseasstock markets. "I would like to say that I find this ambiguoussituation unacceptable," Arthuis said. "It leads to questions about thetruthfulness of the accounts of large French companies and isdetrimental to their credibility."The half-year results of Pechiney provided a prime example of whatArthuis was referring to. In the run-up to its planned Novemberprivatisation, the aluminium and packaging group switched to US GAAPand reported a Fr658 million ($130 million) profit for the six monthsto the end of June.But France's stock market regulator, the Commission des Operations deBourse (COB), took exception to Pechiney's new accounting policies,highlighting the fact that if it had stuck with local reportingrequirements it would have reported a small loss for the period. Theuncharacteristically public rebuke from the COB came at a bad time forPechiney, as its shares were already facing general indifference frominvestors.Pechiney's predicament is familiar to companies in neighbouringGermany. Because its accounting traditions are so out of step with whatis demanded by international investors, Germany has been forced toundertake a fundamental rethink of its approach to financial reporting.A radical solution emerged from Bonn in the spring of 1995 when justiceministry official Herbert Biener proposed that German companies withglobal ambitions could be allowed to use IASs or US GAAP for theirconsolidated financial statements and would only have to respectdomestic accounting requirements in individual company financialstatements.Biener's proposals come at a time when another German company - thistime the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom - ispreparing to follow the lead of Daimler-Benz and list its shares in NewYork. Unless Biener's proposal finds its way onto the statute books byearly next year, however, Telekom will find itself in the samepredicament as Daimler: having to issue two different sets of groupresults, one that complies with German accounting regulations, theother with US GAAP.For both companies, a crucial aspect of Biener's proposal is that USGAAP would be an equally-acceptable alternative to IASs as a basis fordrafting consolidated accounts. Their interest lies in removingobstacles to listing their shares in New York, and the SEC will notaccept accounts drawn up on the basis of IASs.Such a radical solution, however, is causing unease in some quarters ofGermany's corporate establishment. Companies like Bayer and Hoechsthave never accepted what they see as Daimler's capitulation to theexcessive demands of the SEC in terms of disclosure. Instead, theyfavour IASs (Bayer adopted IASs for its 1994 accounts; Hoechst plannedto do so for its 1995 financial statements) because, unlike theformulation of US GAAP, Germany has an input into IASs andrepresentation on the board of the IASC.Sharpe summed up their fears in an address to the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges at the beginning of October. "I believe that itis unacceptable that a sovereign state de facto delegates to anotherstate the drawing up of their accounting standards," he said."Delegating to an international institution in which many sovereignstates have their say is one thing, whereas delegating to another stateis quite another."Germany is also divided on the need for a national standard- settingbody along the lines of France's proposed CRC. According to JohannesMaret, Arthur Andersen's senior partner in Frankfurt: "A standard-setting body would be responsible for exacting greater influence in theformulation of IASs and checking whether these were compatible withGerman law."On the other hand, Dietrich Dorner, outgoing president of theprofessional body for German accountants, the Institut derWirtschaftsprufer, believes the need for a consensus approach instandard-setting would weaken the standard of financial reporting inGermany."I'm not optimistic that [a standard-setting body] would be any betterthan what we have at the moment," he told CAI in November. "It wouldpronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effectwould be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."Whatever route German companies eventually take to make their accountsmore useful to international investors, it is clear that the existingpractice of making generous provisions for a wide variety of possibleliabilities and losses will have to be curbed. While billed as anexample of German accounting's conservative bent, over-generousprovisions are also a classic devise for smoothing earnings bydepressing profits in good years and bumping up the bottom lines whentimes are bad.The IASC took aim at that practice at the end of November with adiscussion paper which proposes that provisions for future operatinglosses should be banned except where they result from contractualcommitments. A similar line was taken in separate documents issued bystandard-setters in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, which hadworked with the IASC on the provisions issue.Unveiling the UK discussion paper, ASB chairman David Tweedie said:"Some will say the restriction on provisions is imprudent but we don'twant phoney liabilities . . . with forecast future losses we sometimesget into psychoanalytic accounting; it's like trying to read your mind.If you want to recognise [future losses] let's have a detailed planfirst. You can't smack in phoney liabilities because you intend toreorganise."Such thinking goes against the current trend in the British bankingindustry, which took advantage of record profits in 1995 to bump up bad-debt provisions. Such efforts to iron out the cyclical swings thatcharacterise bank earnings have the blessing of regulators. "It seemsto me preferable to recognise that expected losses, particularly ifthey can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, have been incurred whena loan is written rather than waiting until the loss materialises,"according to Bank of England executive director Brian Quinn.And awash with profits, the banks have been more than willing to heedQuinn's advice. Barclays Bank introduced so-called defaultprovisioning, involving up-front provisions based on expected lossesover the life of a loan; Lloyds Bank opted for a once-off #120 million($200 million) boost to its general provision for bad debts based onfears that higher inflation would hasten another economic downturn anda desire to avoid having to raise provisions sharply in the future.Financial instruments are an accounting issue guaranteed to dictate thepace for both banks and their large corporate clients for some time tocome. Following explosive growth in the use of derivatives in recentyears, calls for tighter regulation of the market have been matched bygreater urgency in the push to develop accounting standards that candeal with the complexity of financial instruments.Even before the dramatic collapse of Barings Bank in February, the IASChad declared that its financial instruments project "remains theboard's single highest priority for 1995 and beyond". That culminatedin the May publication of IAS 32, which deals with disclosure andpresentation issues. The fact that the standard had been in thepipeline for six years, and that measurement and disclosure offinancial instruments remain to be tackled, demonstrate the complex andcontentious nature of the issues involved."Both investors and lenders need to have a much better idea of whetherrisky derivatives are being used," said IASC technical director LieselKnorr when the standard was unveiled. "The disclosures which we are nowasking for will make it much easier to assess the risks that companiesrun when they use financial instruments such as derivatives."Meanwhile, progress on the second phase of the financial instrumentsproject, dealing with recognition and measurement, continues slowly,with the next milestone expected to be a discussion paper to be issuedby the end of 1996.That perennial bugbear of the accounting industry - goodwill andintangible assets - continued to grab the headlines in 1995. The yearkicked off with drugs company Wellcome using the UK's lenient goodwillrequirements as part of an unsuccessful challenge to a hostile takeoverbid from pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo. Wellcome charged that Glaxo's bidcould prejudice rival bidders from overseas because they would have toamortise the ensuing goodwill against future profits, whereas Glaxo, asa UK company, could choose to write-off the goodwill immediatelyagainst reserves.Australia's Pacific Dunlop also pointed to what it perceives as theUK's unfair advantage in goodwill amortisation in a row with regulatorsduring 1995. With the Australian Accounting Standards Board expected toissue an exposure draft by year's end that requires goodwill to beamortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years, PacDun noted thatthis is more onerous than the treatment permitted in the UK or in theUS and Canada, which allows goodwill to be written off over 40 years.PacDun's concerns, however, could prove short-lived, at least asregards the UK. In June, the ASB issued a working paper that proposesthe abolition of reserve accounting for goodwill. Tweedie outlined theproposals as follows: "For companies wanting to take thestraightforward option, intangible assets and goodwill may becapitalised and depreciated over a maximum of 20 years with only aminimal annual recoverability review. On the other hand, for companieswishing to show the critical value to their businesses of intangibleassets and goodwill, there will be no need to make an arbitraryamortisation charge each year. Instead, continuing value can bedemonstrated by a review of future cash-flow forecasts."That approach differs from exposure draft E50, issued by the IASC inJune, which rejected the ASB's view that some intangibles need never beamortised. The eventual shape of a revised UK goodwill standard,however, remains anyone's guess.As part of a lengthy process to ensure broad-based support, the ASBheld its first-ever public hearing at the beginning of October at whichits goodwill proposals were put to the floor. With little consensus onthe specifics of the standard-setter's proposals - most disagreementcentred on the ASB's proposed impairment tests to determine if goodwillshould be subject to a once-off write down - a standard remains sometime away.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Interest in applications such as image archive and retrieval,image positive pay and CD-ROM delivery will continue to skyrocket,predicts David Medeiros, a consulting analyst with The Tower Group,based in Wellesley, Mass.     The coming year also could bring wider acceptance of the Internetfor transmitting sensitive data; the long-awaited introduction ofRapid*EDI; less interest in electronic data interchange (EDI); andmore banks using electronic check presentment (ECP), say consultantsin assessing last year's trends. Banks Offer Image Processing     "As soon as enough large banks have installed image-based cashmanagement, corporate banking customers will come to expect it.  Ifyour bank's not offering it, they'll find [a bank] that is," Medeirosnoted.     Indeed, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, Bank of Boston andChemical Banking Corp.'s New York-based Geoserve division came tomarket in recent weeks offering check images on CD-ROM (CORP, Dec. 27,p. 7).     Chemical also announced plans last year to integrate imaging intoall phases of its check operations, including proof-of-deposit andarchiving.     The technology allows firms to use search and retrieval softwareto pull up a check image on a personal computer screen, as opposed tofinding the image on microfilm or pulling a paper check out of astorage box, the banks say.       "Many [banks] anticipate that they will be able to resolvetelephone inquiries while the payee or customer is still on thephone," added Mary Ann Hardy, an image product manager at Bank ofBoston.     Similarly, many banks began offering image-enabled wholesalelockbox processing last year, including Harris Bank, based in Chicago(CORP, Dec. 27, p. 7).       The bank says the technology will streamline its operations andprovide customers with reduced storage needs and immediate access tocheck and remittance images for faster accounts receivable-posting andreconcilement.     Using the lessons of history, here's a look at the major storiesof 1995 and how they'll relate to the decisions you'll be making thisyear:          *  Best Marriage of Technologies:  Interbank check imaging.  Bycombining check imaging and electronic check presentment (ECP), theFinancial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) developed a paperlesscheck clearing process to reduce check fraud and provide faster accessto funds (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 1).  Banks also will benefit from faster,cheaper check clearing, FSTC says.     Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, Bank of Boston, Citibankof New York and Chemical, exchanged digitized check images acrossdissimilar systems as part of a pilot sponsored by FSTC.  "Theultimate aim of interbank check imaging is check truncation," notesone FSTC member.      The next steps for interbank check imaging involve addingsecurity features, anticipated industry standards, and remote storagecapabilities.     *  Biggest Development in Electronic Commerce:  The multiple newproducts promising hardware-based encryption and back-end support forInternet commerce.     "There has been a lot of hype about the potential for break-ins,but now with recent [product] developments, the Internet is viable,"explains Iang Jeon, senior analyst with Forrester Research,headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.     For example, the Templar Certification Program, introduced lastyear by Premenos Technology Corp. of Concord, Calif., allowselectronic data interchange (EDI) vendors to incorporate Templar withtheir translation software to offer secure Internet EDI.  Similarly,the Internet Services Roadmap from Digital Equipment Corp., based inMaynard, Mass., offers a set of secure Internet services for users andservice providers.     Other companies that introduced new products last year forsensitive data transmission over the Internet include RSA DataSecurity and Netscape Communications Corp., both of Redwood City,Calif., and Atalla Corp. in San Jose, Calif. (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 1).     *  Most Talked About Product:  Rapid*EDI.  The low-cost financialdata interchange system was scheduled to pilot in July but hit a snagwhen Sterling Software of Dallas pulled out of the project (CORP, May31, p. 1). MCI Communications Corp. of Arlington, Va., then choseCertiSoft Solutions of Englewood, Colo., to produce the software(CORP, Oct. 18, p. 8).      The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) hadawarded MCI the contract for this project in 1994 to provide a cheap,Windows-based EDI service in hopes of boosting financial EDI volumeson the automated clearing house network (CORP, Dec. 14, p. 1). Regardless of the delay, NACHA believes it has achieved part of itsgoal of encouraging the development of financial EDI:  There are nowat least five low-cost financial EDI packages on the market.     *  Most Surprising Trend of 1995:  Only a handful of banks rushedto take advantage of newly loosened interstate banking rules.  SinceOctober, bank holding companies have been allowed to unify multistateoperations on a single platform.  But "I don't see [many] banks doingit," notes Connie Beck, executive vice president with NationsBank,headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.  "We see it as one of our keycompetitive advantages for [the next three years]."     Indeed, banks have claimed for years that putting their corporateproducts on a single platform would allow them to slash costs, reduceerrors and add new technologies more quickly.  But Cynthia Glassman,managing director with Furash & Co. in Washington, D.C., speculatesthat some large banks may be tied to the strategies they developed inthe era of restrictive geographic boundaries -- emphasizing localservice, granting local bank presidents autonomy to react to regionalconditions, and encouraging internal competition to push down costs.      Glassman warns that this may not be a viable strategy in 1996. "Entrepreneurs like to deal with the president of the bank, andthey're not going to do that with a big, nationwide bank," she said.     *  Sign of Things To Come:  The EBT Council held its inauguralmeeting in 1995 (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 1).  The group was organized byNACHA to help facilitate the Federal EBT Task Force's plan for anationwide infrastructure that will enable EBT processors to handletransactions across the country, allowing for the portability ofbenefits.  The EBT Council also will take up the continuingcontroversy over bidding procedures used to award EBT contracts.     *  Biggest Bank Merger of the Year:  Chemical and Chase.  The $10billion merger, due to be finalized this summer, will create a titanin the fields of transaction processing and funds transfer services,industry watchers predict.       The "new" Chase will have a strong international presence,greater role in electronic funds transfer and more resources tobankroll bold technological experiments.  In the New York area alone,the combined banks will account for 35 percent to 40 percent of thewholesale banking markets, estimated one analyst who asked not to beidentified (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 1).     In addition, Yun Jae Chung, a banking analyst with NatWestSecurities Corp. in New York, says the banks generated about $1.9billion in 1994 from their transactions processing businesses alone.      *  Most Daring Prediction for 1996:  EDI is dead.  "Not only haveEDI implementations flattened, they've trailed off," notes MikeAlfonsi, who manages the treasury consulting practice at CoreStatesBank, based in Philadelphia.  Alfonsi anticipates little growth in EDIat the current price of implementation.  "We've a hit a wall withcost," he claimed.     Another consultant, who asked not to be named, added that EDI istaking on another form.  Moving transaction data electronically isavailable through procurement cards, lockbox imaging and E-mail, saysthis consultant, who claims:  "Over the short run, no one is going tomake a lot of money on EDI."      Beck counters that "more and more companies have the systems inplace to really leverage EDI, some of them are increasingly making itmandatory."     *  Top Advice for 1996:  Get your feet wet with ECP if youhaven't already, recommends Steve Takahashi, group senior vicepresident for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashibelieves more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin toexchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boostproductivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage ofECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.       "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gonelive," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to sendbut not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchangingECP items early this year.  (Dave Medeiros, The Tower Group, 617/235-5777; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services Company, 312/904-7477; Bankof Boston, 617/434-6883.)  Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE EFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996NACHA, EDIBANX DISCUSS LINK TO SPUR EDI IMPLEMENTATION       The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and theEDI Bank Alliance Network Exchange (EDIBANX) are considering ways totie the two networks together to facilitate more widespread use offinancial electronic data interchange (EDI).       "One of the problems with financial EDI right now is that notenough people are doing it," observes Scott Lang, staff director forNACHA's Bankers EDI Council.  Both groups hope that by interconnectingthe networks they'll be able to boost bank revenues and lower costs byincreasing financial EDI volume.        The Bankers EDI Council moved last October to create the EDIIntegration Task Force to formally take up the issue.  Comprised ofrepresentatives from NACHA, EDIBANX, the Federal Reserve System, NewYork Automated Clearing House (NYACH), VisaNet and the leading EDI-capable banks, the task force was scheduled to hold its first meetingas we were going to press, at the NACHA/Treasury ManagementAssociation Financial EDI Conference in Nashville.       EDIBANX and NACHA representatives, however, have been meetinginformally since June.  The early NACHA model to emerge from thosetalks has certain ACH operators acting as ambidextrous "gateways,"able to handle both the native X12 format from the EDIBANX network andNACHA's CTX.  These gateway operators would wrap an incoming EDIBANXtransmission in the CTX envelope for delivery on the ACH network, andwould similarly unwrap any outgoing transmission for delivery on theEDIBANX network.       Establishing the technical infrastructure, value-added featuresand protocols may prove the easiest issues of this partnership.  Thetougher call will be whether EDIBANX will retain its franchise.     EDIBANX "wants the traffic to go one way.  If that's somethingthey insist upon we'll probably never get anywhere with thesediscussions," says George Thomas, senior vice president with theNYACH.  But EDIBANX will lose its exclusivity, and possibly itsmembers, if the network has to accept EDI transmissions originated onthe ACH system. EDI Implementation Moving Slower Than Expected     The EDIBANX network, which is operated by the Chicago ClearingHouse Association, went on-line in October 1994 but quickly lostmomentum due to the slow pace of EDI implementation.  By summer 1995,EDIBANX and NACHA had begun informal talks to explore the possibilityof working together to boost corporate-to-corporate electronicpayments.       "I'm not sure I can put my finger on any one reason why it'smoving slowly," says Mark Stuparich, vice president of New York-basedChase Manhattan Bank, which has put off its EDIBANX implementation dueto weak customer demand.  "The volume has not been growing as rapidlyon the EDIBANX network as we had hoped, and so the incentive for us tomove has not been as great," he explains.       One incentive that has failed to materialize is cheaper pricing. EDIBANX had assumed there would be sufficient network volume tojustify fixed prices. Chase, and other banks with large-scaletransactions, anticipated significant savings over CTX pricing whichvaries depending on the addenda size.  But Stuparich says "the volumesaren't there yet in the EDIBANX network, so it's probably not evenfair to try to make a comparison."     "To the extent that implementation of the EDIBANX product isslower than anybody expected, it's probably pretty much in line withthe slowness of the rest of corporate electronic trade payments, saysRichard Bort of Richard Bort & Assocs., a consulting firm in ShermanOaks, Calif.     "I got involved in financial EDI in 1986 and from that timethrough today, we've been saying:  'It's coming!  It's coming!'  Butthe implementation of corporate electronic trade payments has beenmuch slower than anybody had ever thought it would be," he says.      NACHA's Lang suggests it has been difficult, if not impossible,to achieve a critical mass of EDI trading partners because not enoughfinancial institutions are EDI-capable.  The Chicago Clearing Housethought it had the answer with EDIBANX, which got rid of the NACHA CTXenvelope to simplify the EDI format and provided a guide to EDI-capable trading partners.  But companies have apparently not rushed totake advantage of the value-added features.                 "You'renot going to get companies to switch banks just so they can get  EDI," says NYACH's Thomas.  "What you have to do," he says, "issomething NACHA is doing with the Rapid*EDI program:  Provide a low-cost vehicle to make virtually every financial institution EDI-capable."     The Rapid*EDI software is a scaled-down, turnkey package, whichenables small-to-medium-sized financial institutions to receive EDI.       Today EDI is a risky business on the ACH network as fewer than 10percent of NACHA-member banks claim to be EDI-capable, says Chase'sStuparich.  By contrast, EDIBANX provides a guarantee that thereceiving bank will be able to properly handle a transaction.       In addition, the EDIBANX network provides syntax editing,validation and acknowledgements, all of which NACHA has been pushed bymembers to provide.       "They both have something to gain by having a partnership," saysStuparich.  "What NACHA has to gain is some of the enhancedcapabilities that were built into the EDIBANX network.  I think whatEDIBANX has to gain is rapid access to a large volume oftransactions." Is There Sufficient Demand for EDI?     While the obvious synergies  prompted creation of the EDIIntegration Task Force, it remains an open question whether the twonetworks together will generate any more EDI traffic than they've beenable to achieve separately.       Though less elegant than the native X12 format used on theEDIBANX network, NACHA's CTX envelope provides the essential EDIcapability.  And even though the CTX is limited to 9,999 addendarecords, "that hasn't been a major stumbling block in the typicalaccounts payable world," says Stuparich.     "There are a number of reasons why EDI is difficult; financialEDI is yet a little bit more difficult," says Bort, who suggestscorporate treasurers and chief financial officers are still notconvinced they need to bother with electronic trade payments.  It willcome, says Bort, if reengineering catches up with corporatedownsizing.     "Companies that do it right reengineer.  They find better ways toget from point A to point B," and that includes implementingelectronic corporate trade payments, says Bort.  But, he adds, "that'snot the way corporate America has done it.  They chop the peoplefirst.  Then they haven't got enough people to figure out how do we dothis thing called 'EDI.'"      NACHA and EDIBANX have the people to figure it out, but arehaving some trouble figuring out how to do it together.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE EFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996CHECKFREE, SERVANTIS COMBINE TO LEAD ELECTRONIC COMMERCECheckfree Corporation gave electronic commerce a boost when theColumbus, Ohio company agreed to acquire software developer ServantisSystems Holdings Inc., says one analyst.  The deal makes "Checkfree amore effective player, and whenever you have more than a couple ofplayers that are capable it pushes things more quickly," observesDavid Weisman, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based ForresterResearch.     The acquisition of Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis provides thethird leg of the triad that Checkfree has been methodicallyconstructing, says Michael Sapienza, Checkfree vice president formarketing.  That triad consists of electronic consumer-, business- andbanking-services.  But until recently, Checkfree was a little wobblyon both the banking and the business legs.  Checkfree Alliances Corral the Market     In a matter of months, Checkfree has gone from a consumer billpayment service to the dominant presence in electronic commerce,according to one financial analyst who says, "nobody is even remotelyclose to them."      Prior to acquiring Servantis, Checkfree's focus was electronicbill payment and invoicing.  Missing from that strategy were front-and back-office banking capabilities.  "You need to do all thosetransactions between the bank and its customers.  Checkfree never hada very good solution for that, which is part of the reason thatMasterCard moved on," says Weisman (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 8).     For almost three years, Checkfree and MasterCard were connectedat the hip.  "We were their exclusive electronic banking and billpayment service provider and they were our exclusive distributionchannel to financial institutions," explains Sapienza.  But neitherpartner was satisfied with the arrangement.     Since the expiration of the MasterCard deal a year ago, Checkfreehas been aggressively signing up partners.  Milwaukee-based FiservInc., Automatic Data Processing Inc. of Roseland, N.J., Plano, Texas-based EDS and Cybercash of Reston, Va., have tightened Checkfree'shold on electronic bill payments and invoicing.       "The amount of resources it takes to do hundreds of thousands ormillions of bill payments makes this an economies of scale game.  AndCheckfree has a lot pumping through it," says Forrester's Weisman, buthe adds the company was still missing a good home banking platform.     With Servantis, Checkfree not only gets home banking andcorporate cash management products, it also gets MasterCard back.  Thecard association aligned with Servantis earlier this year tofacilitate MasterCard's wholesale banking product, MasterBanking.     "We view the Servantis ... banking transaction processingbusiness, and its software and mainframe hardware, as being a superiortechnical solution to that at Checkfree," says A. Christian Frederick,Mastercard's senior vice president of remote banking and strategicplanning.  "It is quite evident that Checkfree has validated that[opinion with this purchase.]"     How effective Checkfree will be in leveraging its purchase ofServantis is still an open question.  "How to best integrate the twocompanies is something that is not 100 percent figured out yet," saysCheckfree's Sapienza.  Who stays and who goes, for example, will bedecided over the next 30- to 60-days, says Sapienza.       Another concern is the role Servantis majority owner Welsh,Carson, Anderson & Stowe will play at Checkfree.  Because the purchasedeal is being done with both stock and cash, the New York-basedventure capital fund will end up owning more than 20 percent ofCheckfree.  (A.

For instance, Sterling Software of Dallas, and VeriFone ofRedwood City, Calif., joined Visa International of San Francisco andMasterCard of Purchase, N.Y., in releasing electronic commerceproducts last year.       Sterling announced COMMERCE:Connection, a suite of products thatincludes Windows-based electronic data interchange (EDI) andtranslation software (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 8).  Visa and MasterCardjoined forces to support a single, secure specification for bank cardpurchases on the Internet (CORP, July, 12, p. 4).

Other new product releases in 1995 included:     *  More Choices for International Clients.  Cut-throatcompetition in the states forced many vendors to expand theirmarketing efforts overseas.  For instance, Citibank introduced aEuropean lockbox service that offers multi-currency, multi-countrycollections from a centralized facility (CORP, Nov. 15, p. 4).

"It iseven occurring with entry-level jobs, and that is pretty scary."Providian Corp., Capital One, and AT&T Universal Card Services are the onlymajor issuers that have gone this route for positions below top portfoliojobs, but recruiters worry the practice may spread.  "Providian is extremelylitigious, and they have sued a manager two years after he left, and a juniorperson was threatened with a suit," says a recruiter who requests anonymity.She frets those kinds of actions will have a "chilling" effect on job-changingin the industry.A Providian spokesperson won't comment on any legal actions taken by thecompany, but adds, "We don't require non-compete agreements, and we neverhave."  However, all employees are required to sign a confidentialityagreement as a condition of employment.Confidentiality and proprietary agreements usually are sufficient to protect acompany's interests, notes Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of humanresources at Capital One Financial Corp., but there are some extremelysensitive areas such as modeling that rate special treatment.  "As competitivepressure increases, non-compete contracts have the potential to become fairlycommon," he says.  "Companies in trouble will make outrageous salary offers toget trade secrets if they feel they need them for survival."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Card Executives' Platinum PaychecksIn the not-too-distant past, before the shareholder- rights movement began andcorporate directors found themselves staring down the barrel ofmulti-million-dollar lawsuits over executive compensation, corporations had afree hand to reward senior executives as the board saw fit, sometimes in spiteof company performance.  Shareholder militancy and Internal Revenue Servicerule changes have changed all that, and boards of directors go to great painsto justify the pay they grant to upper management.  Bonuses and long-termincentive payments are playing a bigger role than ever before, much to thechagrin of executives at floundering companies.  But for the fortunate few inAmerica's growth industries, the rewards have never been greater, and fewindustries in the 1990s can match the growth record of the credit cardbusiness.In the coming months, compensation committees will be reviewing 1995performance and determining how to reward the officers who produced thoseresults.  If last year is any indication, that will mean hefty paychecks forcredit card executives, both those who manage portfolios and those in relatedservice companies.Performance-based pay is resulting in a windfall, as proxy statements makeclear, with many of the industry's top executives clearing more in bonus paythan base salary.  And bonuses tell only part of the story:  betweenrestricted stock grants, options, and assorted perks, card bosses findthemselves in a position that Jay Gatsby could appreciate.And why not?  Industry growth continues apace, and the competition that occursat the account level carries over to the executive suite.  If corporationswant to keep dancing with the guy they brought in-and almost all of the top 20card executives are men-they had better be willing to match or exceed what thecaptains of their ships could command elsewhere.The same reasoning is being applied at second and third levels of management,and even below.  Pay for performance, skill-based pay, and relatedcompensation approaches are translating into fatter paychecks for more people.By the same token, employees at under-performing firms are faced with staticbase pay and a bonus cupboard that's fairly bare.Meanwhile, democracy is coming to card shops in that more employees aregetting bonuses and stock options.  But that also means that many employeesnow face new financial risks.Compensation PacesettersTo get a measure of the current state of the card industry's paychecks, CreditCard Management reviewed 1995 proxy statements issued by more than 30 publiclyheld card issuers, bank holding companies, and card-related service firms.Those reports dramatize the increasing importance of bonuses based oncorporate performance.  Last year, a third of the card industry's topexecutives received more money in bonuses than base pay; on average, bonusesequaled 89% of salary.  Two years earlier, only 11% of those officers receivedmore in bonuses than salaries, and the average bonus was only 60% of base.Those who successfully enhance shareholder value stand to reap substantialrewards.Executives from so-called pure-play card companies dominate the list, in partbecause of the enormous growth experienced by firms such as MBNA Corp.  andFirst USA Inc., but also because of the nature of proxy statements.  Only thefive highest-paid officers are presented in those reports, and very few creditcard executives number in those ranks at bank holding companies.  Citicorp'sRoberta Arena may direct a $35 billion asset, but unless one's title includesthe word "chairman" at Citi, an individual will not be in that group.  Asexecutive vice president of bank cards, Arena rates an honorable mention inCiti's proxy, along with a score of other execs, but that only means hersalary and bonus were somewhere south of $1.7 million in 1994.Multi-Tiered RewardsSince taking over American Express Co.  in the wake of 1991's Optima debacle,Harvey Golub has engineered a noteworthy turnaround at thetravel-and-entertainment card king, refocusing attention on the core businesswhile tripling net income over 1992's level.  A bonus that's 255% of base payvaults Golub to the top of the card pack in terms of 1994 income, and two ofhis lieutenants join him on the list of the industry's 10 best-paidexecutives.  In contrast, the failure of Golub's predecessor, James D.Robinson III, to achieve financial objectives in 1992 cost him a substantialpart of his bonus and, ultimately, his job.Salary and bonus alone ignore substantial additional pay, including long-termincentive payouts to Golub of $1.8 million in 1994, vesting in restrictedstock grants, and stock options that have boosted his stake in AmEx to 227,162shares with an option for 752,500 more.Not far behind was Charles M.  Cawley, whose salary and bonus more thandoubled to $2 million.  Not coincidentally, corporate net income increased$58.8 million to $266.6 million.  Cawley was rewarded with an additional$1,025,000 in restricted stock.Paychecks for card issuers are fatter than their vendor counterparts, with oneexception:  Pat Thomas, chairman of the recently-merged First FinancialManagement Corp., stands head and shoulders above the field, with bonusesaccounting for the bulk of his $6.8 million package for 1994.  That'ssignificantly above the chairman of First Data Corp., the firm that acquiredFFMC, parent of National Bancard Corp.  (NaBanco), Telecheck, NationwideCredit, and other payment-industry companies.Besides its richness, Thomas's deal with FFMC was an anachronism in an erawhen the compensation committees of corporate boards set executive wagepackages.  Thomas enjoyed a personal-service contract that stipulated a bonusof the lesser of 2.5% of corporate income before taxes or the market value of94,500 shares, with a minimum bonus of $1.8 million.  He also received optionson 500,000 shares, participation in incentive plans, and various perks,including payment of premiums on $5 million worth of life insurance andpersonal use of the corporate jet, a $59,073 value in 1994.FFMC had 1994 revenues of $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior year andconsistent with a 29% compounded growth record over the previous five years.Bonuses at RiskIn contrast to Thomas's bonus, Henry C.  Duques, chairman of First Data,technically received no bonus, but that's deceptive.  Duques's packagereflects a growing management trend toward risk-based rewards for managers.Some corporations, including Household International, are requiring seniorexecutives to purchase stock, and others are granting all rewards in the formof stock and other instruments whose value is determined by companyperformance.In Duques's case, a 1994 performance grant worth $3 million was granted.  Halfof that amount was in the form of options on 372,088 shares at $40.31; inmid-1995, shares were trading at $63, a nifty $8.4 million gain if the optionwas executed.  The other $1.5 million is dependent on First Data's return onequity in 1995 and 1996.A similar calculated gamble is being taken by Capital One Financial Corp.'stop executives, Chief Executive Richard D.  Fairbank and President Nigel W.Morris.  In September, the two agreed to forego cash bonuses and stock optionsuntil the turn of the century in exchange for a one-time grant of 1.5 millionand 1 million shares, respectively, at $29.19 per share.  Half the optionvests only if the share price reaches $37.50; the balance vests in incrementsup to $50.Their potential $52 million windfall in five years comes at the cost ofgenerous bonuses in the past.  In 1994, when Capital One was spun off bySignet Banking Corp., Fairbank netted $8.08 million and Morris $4.35 millionin cash and restricted stock.Golden HandcuffsStock performance is a major factor in most executives' incentive plans.Typically, a hypothetical investment of $100 in the corporation's stock iscompared over time to a similar investment in a peer group's stock or ageneral index.  If target prices are exceeded, the pool of incentive pay goesup accordingly; if objectives are not reached, some or all of the pool is injeopardy.Earnings per share or net profits often determine to what extent executives'incentive pool will be funded.  Often, disbursements are in the form ofrestricted stock that vests in three to five years.  "It's more of a goldenhandcuff than a lucrative element of the compensation package," says Donald M.Cunningham, principal of Tulsa, Okla., recruitment firm BankSearch Inc.A 25% gain in stock value in 1994 was sufficient cause for rejoicing bymarketer Ideon Group Inc.'s directors to boost bonuses beyond the maximums setin 1993.  Maximum incentives of 30% to 120% of base pay had been set from themanager to the chief-executive level, but the compensation committee was sopleased with the organizing work for the cobranded PGA Tour Partners card thatit awarded bonuses of 160% of base, and 190% in the case of Chief ExecutivePaul G.  Kahn.Unfortunately for Ideon, the PGA card has not lived up to expectations, andthe firm has had a shaky 1995.  Top management shares the down-side risk,which was not the case under former Chief Executive Steven J.  Halmos, whoresigned in late 1992, when the stock lost 13% of its value.  Halmos received$2.65 million in salary and no bonus in 1991 and 1992, but that compensationapproach ended with a 1993 amendment to the federal tax code.  The amendmentrestricts the deductibility of compensation over $1 million unlesspre-established performance goals are met.  That's why corporate boards now goto considerable lengths to justify executive pay in proxy statements.Top executives who derive all of their compensation from base salary are ararity, and the same is becoming true of lower-level managers.  Restrictedstock seldom is part of compensation at the second and third tiers, but stockoptions and other perks are beginning to filter down.  Signing bonuses andgenerous relocation packages are becoming more prevalent, recruiters report,particularly for positions with highly valued skill sets.  BankSearch'sCunningham cites the case of a collections supervisor who received perquisiteswith little or no relation to the job.  "An auto came into play even though itwas apparent he was desk-bound," Cunningham recalls.Comparative Pay ScalesWith the vast majority of management jobs in the $50,000 to $150,000 range,credit card recruiters focus their energies filling those posts.  Widedisparities exist for comparable positions in different geographic areas andbetween banks, but generally managers at the low end are garnering bonuses of5% to 7% of base, vice presidents and assistant vice presidents typically fallin the 10% to 15% range, and higher-level executives can realize up to 30% ofbase in annual bonuses, recruiters say.A risk analyst probably will enjoy slightly higher pay by working in a cardprogram as opposed to mortgage lending, auto loans, or some other area of abank, but the main distinction is demand.  While he predicts "tremendousgrowth both in terms of the number of jobs and the compensation" for debitcard marketers in the next five years, headhunter George C.  Genel concedesdebit counterparts "are probably paid a little less" than their oppositenumbers in credit.Even in customer service and collections, "credit card people tend to be paidbetter than their retail-banking counterparts because they're recognized asmore crucial to the success of the card business," suggests John D.  Walp, whorecently left CoreStates to become director of compensation and human resourcesystems at Advanta Corp.  "Customer-service staffers do double duty becausethey also act as salespeople, whereas their counterparts in a branch may onlyanswer questions."  Collections on unsecured loans also are more sensitivethan an auto loan for which the bank has recourse, Walp adds.Nonbanks and pure card issuers such as Advanta rate an edge in pay over theirbank counterparts, recruiters indicate.  GE Capital Corp.  is consistentlycited as a leader.  "They want the best people, and they live in an expensivemarket (Connecticut)," explains New York recruiter Nancy Griffiths.Marketers in DemandWith competition heated for new accounts, card marketing specialists are oneof the industry's hottest commodities, with top people almost findingthemselves in a bidding war for their services, Cunningham notes.  Salaryspikes in the 30% range have occurred over the last two years forproduct-management and marketing jobs, he says.  One prospect he was wooingwas offered a 25% pay hike to $93,500 in a less-expensive market, but turnedit down, believing an even more attractive offer will soon come his way.Recruiter Donald D.  Duggan of Westminster, Colo., says that prospect may beright.  A marketing manager he recently recruited also received a 25% raise, a$10,000 signing bonus, a guaranteed bonus of $10,000 the first year, and arelocation package "that will put $4,000 to $5,000 extra in his pocket," saysDuggan."The business has gotten more sophisticated, and complexity has made thesecond- and third-level managers more valuable," agrees recruiter Judy Collinsof Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest.  Ten years ago, she was placingcredit policy and risk managers in $45,000 jobs; today, the same positionscommand $70,000 to $80,000.Equity PositionsSigning bonuses are becoming quite common, according to Genel of ThousandOaks, Calif.  "Most companies will purchase the old home of a person who hasto relocate after 60 to 90 days, and perhaps pay the points and fees to closeon the new house," he adds.  "Bonus programs that used to top out at 10% noware at 12% to 15%, and people are reaching those caps."The biggest potential bonus is equity in the card portfolio itself.  Companieslike Capital One have a distinct advantage over banks in tendering that bonusto the rank and file.  Once its initial public offer was complete and its fatewas no longer tied to Signet's, where poor performance in other business linescould mitigate sterling card results, Capital One had the latitude to rewardrisk-taking that boosts the bottom line in a way banks cannot, Dennis H.Liberson, vice president of human resources, says.  It began last March byunveiling a stock option plan called OneGrant that extends all the way down tothe mail room.OneGrant entitles every full-time worker to buy up to 200 shares at thethen-current price of $19.31 per share.  Half the options vest after two yearsand the balance in March 1998.  And while many option offers expire in threeto five years, Capital One employees have 10 years to exercise them.OneGrant "whetted associates' appetite" for the employee stock-purchase planthat came next, according to Liberson.  All staff members can now designate upto a 15% payroll deduction for the purchase of Capital One stock at 15% belowthe market price.  By year-end, participation had climbed to more than 800employees, almost a quarter of the work force.At one point last year, employees had realized paper profits of about $2,000apiece on their options.  A subsequent price dip all but wiped out that gain.Management recognizes the need to balance the goal of building anentrepreneurial spirit with the demoralizing effect plummeting stock pricescan have, particularly on young staffers inexperienced in the ways of themarket.  "We knew a correction would come, but that long-term we could drivestock appreciation," Liberson says.  That's why the company limited the amountthat employees could invest, even in the case of middle- and upper-levelmanagers.Non-Financial GoalsA third program dubbed Entrepreneur Grant rolled out in September.  The 50 topmanagers, excluding Morris and Fairbank, could swap up to 25% of their basepay and bonuses over the next three years in exchange for stock options; 43took advantage of the offer and eventually will own about 286,000 shares.Participation was unanimous at the senior level, Liberson reports, though somemanagers with less disposable income elected not to enroll (the programincluded managers in the $50,000 to $60,000 range).  "A mandatory stock-optionapproach would not work very well because it could create financial stress forsome associates," Liberson explains.  Likewise, granting restricted stock toexecutives would not motivate them as much to drive up stock prices as anoption plan in which their own cash is at risk.Bonuses can be paid to virtually every AT&T Universal Card Services Corp.employee, though they have less to do with financial performance than how wellcustomer service is delivered.  "We can measure 100 different processes daily,from telephone response time to the accuracy of invoices, and everymeasurement has a defect standard," says Ira S.  Walter, UCS's director ofhuman resources development.  A bonus is paid quarterly based on the number ofdays the standard was met; bonuses typically are in the 8% to 10% range forcustomer-service operators.Financial performance comes into play in management ranks, but even therecustomer service impacts pocketbooks.  "Every single employee, including theCEO, has an element of their bonus that depends on customer delight," saysWalter.  "What determines long-term success is customer loyalty, and we wantto engage everyone in that focus."Bonuses of 30% for senior-level positions at AT&T are common, recruitersindicate.  Walter declines to comment on specifics, but says, "we are willingto pay significantly more than the competition if they earn it.  Weparticipate in salary surveys to determine compensation rates, so we knowwe're competitive."Downside of RiskAlthough Advanta has several lines of business, three-quarters of revenuesderive from credit cards, so performance in that arena dictates overallperformance and share value.  Employees at every level are invited to take anownership position through a stock purchase plan and a 401-k plan thatincludes Advanta stock as an investment option.  The stock purchase provides a15% price discount and is limited to 15% of compensation.  "The trenddefinitely is to be more inclusive in making bonuses an integral part of thecompensation package, so that pay has some risk involved, based on companyperformance," Walp says.Jack B.  Hofmann, Advanta vice president of human resources, willingly acceptsthe risk of staff angst if the stock takes a bath.  "We're not the kind ofplace that attracts people looking for security," he says.  "We generallyattract people who are willing to put their pay at risk.  That makes for amore highly motivated work force."The danger is that employees may end up sharing risks in market forces overwhich they have no control.  A case in point is the collections area, whereconsolidation is occurring at a rate significantly above that of cardissuance.  Smaller firms are ill-equipped to compete, and shareholder value isplummeting for some.  A $100 investment in Payco American Corp.  in 1990 wasworth $59.14 at the end of 1994, and that drop is reflected in the pay of topexecutives.Top managers at Payco saw their bonuses slashed 10% last year, resulting in 4%declines in total compensation for the two top executives.  Stock optionshaven't been a factor in their packages since 1992.  And while there'sjustification in holding a president and chairman accountable for a decline incorporate profitability, the connection becomes more tenuous when people havea limited impact on strategic success.That may have been part of the thinking of Hatim A.  Tyabji, president andchief executive of terminal maker VeriFone Inc., who asked his board to forgocash bonuses for himself and other executives after earnings and stock pricesdipped in 1993.Though VeriFone's performance improved in 1994, Tyabji made the same requestlast year.  Instead, he asked that cash bonuses be used for a cash andtime-off bonus program for all employees.  The board agreed and also grantedstock options to the executive officers.VeriFone's balancing act is instructive for all corporations as incentive paycontinues to get pushed further down the line.  Everyone enjoys sharing therewards, but there's a limit to the amount of risk that can be imposed on therank and file.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Sweeter Deals for Entry-Level WorkersCompensation that reflects shareholder value is a given for occupants of theexecutive suite, but the same philosophy is being extended all the way down toentry-level service workers at some card shops.Performance bonuses are most common in collections and recoveries, an areawhere the cost-effectiveness of rewarding top performers is easily measured."It's easy to create incentives to make sure your top performers get the mostpay in that area, but it's more of a challenge to incent strictcustomer-service jobs," says Kathy A.  O'Doherty, human resources manager forFirst Chicago Corp.'s First Card operation.Advanta Corp.'s Jack B.  Hofmann isn't so sure.  "There are all kinds of waysto make call-center jobs fun while linking them to clearly defined outcomes,"the vice president of human resources believes.  Trips and prizes, in additionto cash, are all part of the incentive mix for hourly employees at Advanta."People are motivated by more than money," Hofmann says.  "They want to bechallenged and recognized."Customer service and other hourly positions are pegged to the going wage ratein a geographic market, not to any prevailing industry rate, points out JoAnne R.  Moeller, who oversees compensation for Banc One Corp.'s 50,000employees.  But being competitive isn't enough when full-tilt expansion is onthe agenda, and that's the challenge faced by Capital One Financial Corp.,which intends to add 1,000 entry-level jobs in the Richmond, Va., market alonethis year.To increase the desirability of Capital One over other local firms, thecompany is rolling out a benefits package that includes health insurance forall associates working 20 hours or more per week, and three weeks vacationafter a year.  "We're competing for people in a very tight labor market,"explains Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human resources.Thus, Capital One decided to reallocate resources to reward people more in theearlier stages of their careers rather than on the basis of seniority andposition.  By slashing employee attrition and going to more of a managedhealth-care approach, Liberson expects the new benefits package to end upcosting the same as the program it replaces.Liberson also expects retention of longer-term employees to be aided by thestock-option plan Capital One introduced in March.  Besides giving employees avery real stake in the company's performance, that program is creatingstock-ticker watchers out of 20-something workers with no investmentexperience.The change is reflected in the types of questions top executives hear atmonthly "town meetings" for employees at various Capital One facilities."They're fielding fewer questions on mundane, trivial personnel stuff, andmore on the company's business strategy and stock price," reports Liberson."The climate is different."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Number-Crunchers Are a Hot CommodityFor young people interested in a career in credit cards, here's a word ofadvise:  buy a calculator, get a pocket protector, and master the art ofmathematical model-building.  The credit card industry wants numbers people,and it's bidding up the price for good ones."The competition this year for credit policy and risk specialists is tougherthan I've ever seen it," one frazzled card recruiter reports.With one eye on rising delinquencies and the other on analysts' resumes,portfolio managers are trying to hire the experts who can minimize losses and,hopefully, boost profits.  Helping to make these skills white-hot iscompetition for those experts from new quarters.  Long-distance telephonecompanies and utilities are discovering a need for risk-management help, andthey are bidding for the services of the banking industry's stars in riskscoring, credit policy, and modeling."Data is data, and if you can leverage it into a model that reduces losses orincreases profitability for an issuer, that can mean millions of dollars to acompany," says Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc., a New Yorkfirm specializing in placing people in analytical functions.  "An analyst withone year's experience can pretty much move anywhere in the country."Recruiter Judy Collins of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest points to thework of Fair, Isaac and Company and CCN-MDS in modeling for sparking the jobboom.  "The tools became available for this business, and that is creating thedemand for people with backgrounds in math, computer science, or some othernumbers-type of degree," she says.On the other hand, people with general management backgrounds may find thegoing rough in the coming years.  "It's a soft market for people-to-peopleskills," Collins notes.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996The Nine Lives of Dale BrowningYou might say, card industry utility man D.  Dale Browning can't resist achallenge.When asked by friends to evaluate Golden, Colo.-based ProCard Inc., astruggling procurement card company they were thinking about investing in,Browning quickly accepted.  After weeks of review of the ProCard operation andits strengths and weaknesses, Browning returned to his friends with a 30-pagereport, a two-hour presentation, and the conviction that ProCard hadpotential.  "The more I studied the company, the more I concluded that it hasa very, very good product," he says.  "But it had not been marketed properlyand not enough money had been put behind it."So, when his friends asked Browning to invest in the 6-year-old privately heldcompany, "I thought about it for a week," Browning says.  "Then I said Iwouldn't make an investment unless I could manage the company.  They agreed."Once again, the industry veteran found himself in the middle of an emergingmarket:  the corporate purchasing card arena.Indeed, it came as no surprise to friends and industry observers that Browningjumped at the chance to pump new life into ProCard.  Browning has decades-longexperience in all facets of the card business, is familiar with procurementcard programs, and has a track record of operating successful card programs,says Denny D.  Dumler, president of Visa Plus, Visa's on-line globalautomated-teller-machine network.  Dumler worked closely with Browning fornearly 25 years, first at Rocky Mountain Bankcard System and later at Plus."I can't think of anyone better equipped" to run ProCard, Dumler says.  "He'sa real giant in the industry."A PioneerBrowning's professional life has been one of breaking new ground, first inbank cards-in 1969, he participated in the creation of BankAmericard, theforerunner of Visa-and later in electronic banking and debit cards-he servedon a committee that designed the first off-line debit card, which evolved intothe Visa check card.And Browning's accomplishments didn't stop there.  During his 25-year tenureat Colorado National Bank, he made the Denver-based bank a force to bereckoned with in both consumer credit cards and electronic banking.  In 1968,he founded Rocky Mountain BankCard System, the card issuing subsidiary ofColorado National Bank, and one of the largest bank card processors in thewestern United States.  While there, he helped develop a card program for theU.S.  government, a prototype for what is now known as a procurement card.Browning followed that in 1982 with the creation of Plus System Inc., aregional electronic banking network which later evolved into the firstnational automated-teller network in the U.S.  And he served as president ofCNB and Rocky Mountain from 1986 until November 1993.  He continued as chiefexecutive of Plus until 1993 when Visa took over that company.At that time, Browning became senior consultant to Visa International.  Andwhen offered the opportunity to take over ProCard, he couldn't refuse.  "Themore time I spent at (ProCard), the more intrigued I was with the software,"he says.  "The software was quite flexible.  The enhancements they wereworking on would greatly increase their ability to compete and handleadditional volume."  ProCard's PC-based software provides an integratedpurchasing card management system designed to reduce the administrative costsof procurement card programs.In addition, Browning says, "I was impressed with the people who workedthere."To be sure, ProCard-which provides backroom support for banks offeringcorporate card products and services-has a lot going for it.  An early entrantin the corporate purchasing card arena, it serves four banks nationwide-FirstNational Bank of Chicago, National City Bank, NationsBank, and Cass Bank, thenation's largest freight-payment provider.  In September, when Browning tookover as president and chief executive, some 420 corporations, including 100Fortune 500 companies, used ProCard services.  During the first few monthsunder Browning, ProCard added about 120 new corporations and was indiscussions with about a dozen others.Different DirectionBut ProCard was a victim of its own success:  It had trouble keeping pace withthe demand for its services.  In early September, the company had a backlog of80 corporate users waiting for software to link the ProCard system to theirgeneral ledgers, Browning says.  And that slowed system growth in both volumeand number of customers.Despite these problems, however, ProCard is the right product for the righttime, Browning says.  "The timing is right," he says.  "Within the last year,there have been more banks committed to procurement or purchasing cardprograms than in all the years prior.  It's going to be like a snowball goingdownhill."  Indeed, the volume on ProCard cards alone is increasing by 20% amonth compared to a year ago, Browning adds.But before ProCard can reach its potential, it needs to head in a differentdirection, Browning says.  Under the strategy mapped out by ousted founder andformer chief executive Stanley Anderson, client banks had to conform toProCard's requirements.  For example, ProCard worked exclusively withMasterCard International.  "This company is no different than other softwarecompanies," Browning says.  "It should support all products irrespective ofhow they're branded in the marketplace."  ProCard now works with both the Visaand MasterCard associations.Anderson says he planned to make ProCard brand neutral, but was initiallylimited to MasterCard because ProCard was using software from Columbus,Ga.-based processor Total System Services Inc.  that was compatible only withMasterCard's system.ProCard also used to work exclusively with a single processor-Total System,another fundamental mistake in Browning's eyes.  "A company should beresponsive to the needs of the banks, not make the banks go with itsprocessors," he says.  ProCard is negotiating agreements that enable it tolink up with any processor.What's more, ProCard formerly required clients to buy the entire procurementcard package, from software to training to client services, Browning says."We debundled all that," he says.  "A bank can select and choose what servicesit wants to buy.  It doesn't have to buy the whole package."The ProCard package enables banks and their corporate clients to review, edit,audit, and reconcile bank card transactions on a daily basis andelectronically post the purchases to the companies' general ledger systems.European RetreatAfter assuming control of ProCard, Browning also shut down the company'sEuropean office.  "In my view, we hadn't capitalized on the opportunities inthe U.S.  For this company to take on the responsibility (of the Europeanmarket) meant we'd have to expand at the expense of the U.S."  Ownership ofthe European operation-Ireland-based ProCard Inc.  Ltd.-was awarded toAnderson when he left the company in July.But even this shift in underlying philosophy isn't enough to guarantee successfor ProCard.  In its rush to meet customer demands for specialized informationreporting, ProCard "spent quite a bit of money putting in fixes to systems"rather than looking at what enhancements the program might need in the longterm, Browning says.  "Now we're reallocating resources on working on acompletely new system with all the enhancements," he says.ProCard is expanding beyond transaction processing to providing value-enhancedfunctions, for example, breaking out information for corporations required toreport on transactions with minority vendors.  Those enhancements arescheduled for release in mid-1996.Already, ProCard has corrected many of the problems resulting from its rapidgrowth.  Since taking over at ProCard, Browning has funneled more resources toupgrading software and hardware to cope with the expected growth in volume.The new product system-expected to be in place by the middle of thismonth-will handle four times the volume and do it in half the time, Browningsays.And the company also has eliminated the 3 1/2 month backlog of some 90corporate clients waiting to come up on the ProCard system by hiring 10additional computer programmers.  "Now we have a backlog of 30 companies,which is super.  That's as fast as we can do it," Browning says.  "Theturnaround from the time the corporation signs and the custom programming isless than four weeks."ProCard has also added new staff to go out to the corporate clients and traintheir employees.  And the company is setting up a customer-service center thatwill take calls directly from the banks' procurement card customers, ratherthan having the corporate customers call the bank first.  "The bank won't haveto build its own infrastructure," Browning says.  "The bank tells us how theywant the calls handled.  And the (corporate) customer will think he's dealingwith the bank."With all these changes, Browning says he believes ProCard will be able tocapture a large share of the procurement card market.  But he concedes that itwill take time to get ProCard back on track.  "In a couple of years, we'll getthe company going down the right path," he says.If that happens, Browning will have yet another success story to add to hislist of accomplishmentsBack to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Catch-Up Time At MasterCardIn an exploding U.S.  debit card market, the contest for bank card associationsupremacy is turning into more of a rout than a race.  For while MasterCardInternational and Visa U.S.A.  offer similar products and both haveimplemented aggressive marketing strategies, Visa has solid control of theoff-line card market, and is processing millions more on-line point-of-saletransactions monthly.  Now MasterCard, with new leaders at its debit helm, istrying to pull something out of its hat that will cut into Visa's lead.Through the first half of 1995, 5.8 million MasterMoney off-line cards hadbeen issued by 665 financial institutions, compared to 25.1 million Visa checkcards by 1,808 issuers.  MasterCard refuses to release transactions figuresfor its Maestro on-line debit product, but analysts believe it is low.  Visa'sInterlink, meanwhile, is the largest on-line POS network, processing more than15.8 million monthly transactions.It's against this background of Visa dominance that Purchase, N.Y.-basedMasterCard is launching different marketing projects while simultaneouslyadjusting to management changes.  Last summer it was announced that G.  HenryMundt III, president of MasterCard's Cirrus System Inc.  global automatedteller machine network, would become executive vice president of MasterCard'sGlobal Debit Services Group, replacing John O.  Smith who planned to retire atyear end.  Steven L.  Van Fleet is replacing Smith as general manager ofMaestro International.And in October, Arthur Kranzley, who headed Maestro in the U.S.  since itsformation in 1993, left to become senior vice president for Horsham, Pa.-basedAdvanta Corp., a non-bank financial-services provider and a major credit cardissuer that employs former MasterCard chief Alex W.  "Pete" Hart.  Kranzley'sreplacement has not been named.Hard PressThough Mundt emphasizes that the personnel moves will not affect MasterCard'sstrategies and that most of the MasterMoney and Maestro management teams areunchanged, analysts still expect it to be years before MasterCard is able tosignificantly reduce Visa's debit lead in the U.S.  Observers attributeMasterCard's position to its previous debit strategy that emphasized Maestro'sinternational expansion, rather than MasterMoney's or Maestro's domesticgrowth.  Most U.S.  card issuers give off-line cards marketing prioritybecause the products generate much larger interchange revenues ("The DebitCard Balancing Act," December, 1995)."When MasterCard was building up Maestro, Visa was putting the hard press onthe Visa check card," says D.  Mark Jackson, vice president of St.Louis-based Boatmen's Bancshares, a leading MasterMoney issuer.  "AfterMasterCard redirected it focus, Visa check card already had a huge lead.  Andonce a bank is issuing cards, it is hard to get them to change brands."Visa gained its off-line advantage in spite of MasterMoney's interchange feeschedule that generates higher transaction revenues for issuers than does theVisa check card.  On a $100 non-supermarket purchase, MasterMoney acquirerspay card issuers between $1.31 and $1.69 for electronic transactions, comparedto $1.08 when a Visa check card is used.Among the strategies used by Visa to expand Visa check card issuance aremarket launches in specific cities that feature month-long advertisingcampaigns utilizing such vehicles as newspapers and radio.Assisting IssuersWith Visa dominating the off-line market, MasterCard finds itself workingharder to expand its presence.  The association is running televisioncommercials that explain how MasterMoney operates.  And MasterCard's 1996focus will be to assist issuers in broadening their card bases, and triggeringmore activity.  Initiatives will include regional and local advertising,including direct mail."The bottom line is that Visa and MasterCard have good off-line debit productsand there is a still huge, uncommitted, market out there," Mundt says.  About65% of financial institutions are not yet issuing off-line cards.But while MasterMoney is gaining strength domestically, Maestro's strongestimpact has been overseas.  Though only about 13 million Maestro cards havebeen issued in the U.S., 100 million cards are committed worldwide.  Maestrois particularly strong in Latin America, where 5.5 million cards have beenissued in the last two years in such countries as Argentina, Chile, Ecuador,Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.This strong international activity eventually will spread to the U.S., Maestroexecutives believe.  Mundt projects Maestro's growth rate will exceed that ofCirrus.  The ATM network, which had volume of just 60,000 transactions duringits first year in 1983, is expected to have processed more than 300 milliontransactions in 1995.  Maestro has more than 55,000 merchant locations,compared to more than 64,000 for Interlink.Shifting EmphasisTo stimulate Maestro expansion in the U.S., MasterCard is shifting itsemphasis from issuers to signing merchant acquirers.  The association's goalis to have the nation's top 50 credit card acquirers processing Maestrotransactions this year, up from 36 in 1995, and it is aggressively lobbyingindependent sales organizations to sell Maestro to merchants.  Maestro alsoteamed with terminal vendor VeriFone Inc.  in 1995 for a so-called TravelDestination Program.  In that program, acquirers in key traveler locationsthat sign merchants to accept Maestro receive such awards as VeriFoneterminals and personal-identification-number pads.MasterCard expects 5,500 PIN pads and 400 terminals sets will be distributedin the program.  Analysts estimate more than $200,000 worth of hardware willbe awarded.Merchants also will receive price breaks on terminals as an incentive toupgrade or trade in devices so they can support such products as debit cardsand smart cards, and electronic-purse and cardholder- loyalty programs.Merchants and acquirers that move from paper-based systems to electronics alsowill receive processing discounts.  Furthermore, Maestro is targetingmerchants that traditionally have shunned debit cards, including such chainretailers as apparel and shoe stores, lower-cost hotels and motels, andcar-rental agencies.  MasterCard is launching a pilot with its St.Louis-based BankMate shared regional network and Enterprise Rent-A-Car fordebit card acceptance in 20 Midwest locations.  "There is a huge market formerchants where the customer has to pay in advance," says Carl Stefanelli,Maestro vice president.MomentumBy getting more merchants on board, Maestro is trying to ride an expansionwave created in 1995 when San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, a foundingmember of Interlink, left the Visa-owned network for Maestro.  Wells is thethird-largest on-line card issuer as well as the third-largest debit acquiringinstitution.  Factors that prompted the move included MasterCard's long-termstrategies, pricing, service levels, and partnerships."MasterCard is very focused on the on-line product, which is what Wells Fargoneeded for our customers," says Debra B.  Rossi, Wells Fargo senior vicepresident, adding that the association doesn't short the MasterMoney card,either.  "They don't rob Paul to pay Peter," she says.Yet, even with its initiatives, Maestro still has a long road to travel beforeit matches Interlink's activity.  When both networks went national in 1992,Interlink already was the largest regional POS network in the United States,with strong name recognition and activity on the West Coast.  Maestro startedfrom scratch."Maestro's problem is that it lacks the visibility of Interlink," says anindustry consultant familiar with MasterCard who insists on anonymity.  "Itwill be more difficult for them to expand in the U.S.  than even for theregional networks, which already have a solid market penetration."But with its strong international presence and new domestic tactics,MasterCard's debit movement could just be starting to hit stride.  "Ourstrategy is the right strategy for a global basis," Mundt says.  "On-line,PIN-based debit is where people want us to go."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Throwing Down The GauntletThe foreign invasion of the burgeoning point-of-sale market in the UnitedStates is getting stronger with the entry of another international powerhouse.Scotland-based De La Rue Fortronic, which controls a large chunk of theEuropean terminal market, has begun a North American operation in Hartland,Wis., with a strategy of opening additional U.S.  offices and creating anational sales force.De La Rue is joining the stream of international vendors positioning for theexpansion of smart card programs.  While the company has shipped more than400,000 terminals overseas and controls 45% of the United Kingdom market, 35%of the German market, 60% of the Norwegian, and 70% of the POS terminal marketin the Netherlands, De La Rue's U.S.  presence is slight, with its terminalsjust being used in small pilots.  But the company could soon become a NorthAmerican fixture.More than 50% of De La Rue's revenues are projected to be generated from theU.S.  within five years.  It expects to open offices on the East and WestCoasts, with a sales force situated throughout the continent.  "We're not aflash in the pan," says Phillip Johnston, De La Rue Fortronic president.  "Wehave the money and backing to make a big impact."Laying a FoundationDe La Rue already has started laying the foundation for its North Americanpush.  Currently, it is the only supplier of devices for London-based Mondex'selectronic purse program, and Wells Fargo Bank is using De La Rue terminalsfor its employee test of the Mondex system in Wells' San Franciscoheadquarters ("Mondex Leaves the Station," October, 1995).  Guelph, Ontario,will launch a city-wide Mondex pilot next year.  De La Rue also expects tosupply at least half the terminals for Visa's stored-value program that willbe launched in Atlanta in July in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.More than 5,000 merchant locations are expected to accept smart cards in theAtlanta area.Yet, in addition to smart card tests, De La Rue is moving into more mainstreammarkets.  It is selling an unspecified number of its F95 POS devices andsoftware to Atlanta-based processor Nova Information Systems for deployment inhotels and motels.  Nova recently combined its merchant bank card businesswith First Union Corp.'s and First Fidelity Bancorporation's, creating thenation's eighth-largest merchant-processing operation servicing more than90,000 retailers.Nova selected the De La Rue devices because the terminals have memory that isseveral times greater than other vendors' devices that sell for a similarprice, says Joseph P.  Cohane, Nova vice president.  The enhanced capacitywill permit Nova to support a variety of applications on a single device, suchas frequent-user programs and check-guarantee services.The processor also wants to support smart card programs, and De La Rue devicesare successfully operating in European chip card programs, such as Mondex inEngland, Cohane says.Starting from ScratchBut while De La Rue is the latest in a growing list of foreign-based vendorspushing into the North American market, the company is following aless-traveled path by starting its operation from scratch instead ofpurchasing an established American company.Before setting up shop in the U.S., De La Rue's terminals were distributeddomestically by Hartland-based Direct Data.  When Direct Data ceasedoperations last September, De La Rue created its own U.S.  operation to havestronger control over the sales and marketing of its devices.  Its Hartlandheadquarters will handle sales and marketing, software development, productmanagement, distribution, and customer service.  Terminals will bemanufactured near De La Rue's Dunfermline, Scotland, world headquarters.Even as De La Rue gets its house in order, executives say the company alreadyis well equipped to take market share away from the U.S.' two largest andbetter-known terminal vendors, Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone Inc., andPhoenix-based Hypercom Inc., in addition to other players that have increasedtheir marketing efforts in the last year, such as Minneapolis-based DataCardand Redwood City-based Atalla.  The company has deep pockets, a strong productline, and international success.  Its parent company, The De La Rue Group, hadoperating revenues of $1.2 billion last year with a profit of $230.4 million.De La Rue Fortronic generated $45 million in revenues.The company also can leverage a 600-person service organization situatedacross the U.S.  that currently services the The De La Rue Group's otherbanking products, such as coin counters.  Johnston says De La Rue willemphasize its full range of offerings to prospective customers, includingsmart card applications; open architecture, which permits terminal users tocreate their own software programs; and loyalty programs that can be tailoredto support individual retailers.  "We're the experts in smart card technology,and if we didn't think we could gain major footing in the U.S., we wouldn't behere," Johnston says.Despite De La Rue's aggressive push into the U.S.  market, some of its moreestablished U.S.  competitors do not expect to change strategies to competewith the upstart.  "I don't think (De La Rue) brings much to the party interms of technology," says Albert Irato, Hypercom president.  "It will have noimpact on us whatsoever."The Line-UpDe La Rue's main products include the F95 terminal, which features 640kilobytes of memory, an integrated printer, two-line display, and an optionalsmart card reader.  Most terminals shipped over the last few years have only32 or 64 kilobytes of memory.  Devices with greater memory can support morecomplex and a greater number of applications, such as frequent-shopper andsmart card programs, in addition to standard debit and credit.  The terminalsells for under $400.The F105 product, which is being used in the Mondex program, features adisplay which permits consumers to view the balance remaining on theirstored-value cards.  The device is priced at approximately $500.In addition to supporting Mondex, which has 8,000 cardholders and 750merchants participating in an electronic-purse program in Swindon, England, DeLa Rue has supplied more than 2,000 F95 devices to Shell Oil Co.  that arebeing used in a British customer-loyalty program.  De La Rue also will supplyterminals for Visa smart card pilots this year in Australia and Canada.But while De La Rue is active internationally, its key aim is to import thatsuccess to the U.S., and some analysts believe the company has the ability togain a domestic toehold.  "It will be an uphill battle for De La Rue, but theyhave the resources and a good track record in Europe," says Jerome Svigals, aRedwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.  "There is a big market andDe La Rue could very well be a successful contender."-Richard MitchellBack to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Some More Elbow Grease, PleaseFaced with fiercer competition than ever, credit card marketers returned tothe basics when they advertised their products in 1995.  The mind-numbingonslaught in 1994 of ill-conceived television commercials featuring big-budgetspecial effects and print ads narrowly focused on price ("The Best of a BadLot," December, 1994) were replaced by higher-quality work that deftly putbrand image first and product information second.That's not to say card marketers have abandoned playing up key selling points,such as interest rates and rebates, in their ads.  On the contrary, thatnuts-and-bolts technique flourishes in direct mail, where introductoryinterest rates and other cardholder perks routinely appear on the front ofenvelopes to draw consumers into the offer.While the entries submitted for this year's Credit Card Management CardIndustry Marketing Awards earned higher marks from the marketing experts themagazine assembled to judge them, the overall quality of the entries fellshort of winning the judges' highest praise.  Card marketers have plenty ofroom for improvement, the judges say.Judging the television commercials and print ads was Richard Kimmel, presidentof Chicago-based Kimmel & Co.  J.  Randy Howell, vice president and senior artdirector for Chicago-based DraftDirect Worldwide, judged the direct-mailpieces.The ads submitted in the print and television categories that failed to earn athumbs up were sunk by story lines irrelevant to selling credit cards,non-distinctive brand positioning, and poor execution.  "Consumers simplywon't take time to unravel the message of a poorly constructed ad," Kimmelargues.At the same time, many of the direct-mail entries were weakened by verbosecopy and one-size-fits-all product positioning.  "There are really no ruleswhen it comes to the creative side, but successful direct marketers know theirtarget audience and don't make the package threatening or difficult tounderstand," says Howell.Given the shortcomings of this year's contestants, only four entries earnedrecognition in the television and print categories, rather than the usualfive.  Nonetheless, our judges, both professional marketers, still foundseveral gems that clearly stated the brand image of the card and which weresupported by lucid copy points."Effective advertising takes a unique position in the marketplace," saysKimmel.  "Unique positions can be successfully defended because they areunlike those taken by competitors.  Consumers remember uniquely positionedcampaigns."The surprise of this year's judging is that for the first time in theseven-year history of the competition, neither American Express Co.,MasterCard International, nor Visa U.S.A.  earned first-place honors in thetelevision category.  That distinction went to Citibank, which also netted tophonors in the print category.  Stern's, a division of Federated DepartmentStores Inc., finished atop the heap in direct mail.  All observations arebased on our judges' comments.Category:  Television CommercialsTelevision is one of the most power advertising mediums available because itcan use emotion and information to seize, define, and fortify a product'sposition in the marketplace like no other medium, says Kimmel.  This year'swinning television ads do just that.  "Establishing a unique position is themost important task of any ad campaign," says Kimmel.First Place:  "Tuxedo,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.After years of being a bridesmaid, Citibank finally gets to the awards altarwith this story of a T-shirt and jeans guy who doesn't spend a lot of money onclothes, but who decides to go all out for his wedding day by purchasing atuxedo.  He pays for the tux with, you guessed it, his Citibank card.  Whyshould viewers care?  Because Citibank was conscientious enough to call theyoung man to make certain that the charge for an expensive tuxedo, an atypicalpurchase for him, wasn't fraudulent.  It's the kind of service people don'texpect from a card issuer, but which makes the bridegroom very happy."This is the type of ad that takes a position in the market and builds a brandimage," says Kimmel.  "Citibank not only says it has a good product, it does awonderful job of telling people they give them something more than a creditcard-they serve the customer.  It's a well-executed commercial."Second Place:  Toys 'R Us Visa,Bank of New York.  BBDO New York.Ad agency BBDO uses clever camera angles and a play on words to bring afun-and-games perspective to a credit card that earns cardholders discounts ontoys based on their spending.  The slick-looking sports car the narrator issitting in as he informs prospective customers they can earn discounts towarda new car when they buy a set of tires turns out to be an optical illusion.The auto actually is a toy photographed to look like the real thing.  So, too,is the boat hitched to the car, which the narrator says also can be bought ata discounted price.After dazzling viewers with this photographic hocus-pocus, the narratorsuccinctly explains the card's benefits-discounts earned on Toys 'R Uspurchases for each transaction.  "The photographic sleight of hand is veryappropriate and doesn't divert viewer's attention from the sales message,"says Kimmel.  "The benefits of the card are clearly spelled out.  It's acharming piece of work."Third Place:  "Vacation,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.This story of a dad doing his job as a father is the follow-up to Citibank'stop-ranked "Tuxedo."  There's Dad talking about a recent family getaway.  Oneday the wife informs him the family needs a vacation, the next day Dad ispacking everyone up for a road trip-it's his job.  Once on the road, thefamily spends "a gazillion dollars" buying cheap souvenirs that will wind upcollecting dust in the closet.  Dad begrudgingly pays for it all because it'shis job.  Soon afterward, the family car breaks down.  Dad gripes and moans,calls a tow truck and pays for the repairs-it's his job.  Dad's choice ofcurrency?  His Citibank card, which takes care of all his credit needs-that'sCitibank's job.While this commercial effectively builds on the brand positioning in "Tuxedo,"it could have more clearly explained the benefit of packing a Citi card whenmishaps occur, says Kimmel.  "You're guessing at the what the benefit is," heexplains.  "It's not clearly explained how Citibank solved the problem in away no other issuer can.  But it's still a good piece of work."Fourth Place:  "Locked Out,"American Express.  Ogilvy & Mather.Celebrities make effective product endorsers, because the sight of theminstantly grabs viewers' attention.  In this spot, comedian Jerry Seinfeldengages in a ridiculous romp after locking himself out of his apartment whilepreparing for a date.  Dressed only in a bathrobe and with just minutes beforehis date arrives, Seinfeld, who just happens to have his AmEx card, dashesacross the street to buy a suit.  Emerging moments later in his dapper duds,Seinfeld pulls together all the pieces he needs for a magical evening.  Inwhirlwind fashion he tracks down a locksmith to open the door to hisapartment, purchases a bouquet of flowers and hires a quartet.  He even buysan umbrella when an unexpected rain shower kicks up.  All the purchases aremade possible by his AmEx card.  His apartment door unlocked moments beforehis date arrives, Jerry has enough time to ice the champagne for his bignight.  Too bad the door lock jammed, and he can't let his date in.While this ad scores high marks for clearly telling viewers in a creative waythat having an AmEx card can get them out of tight situations when they haveno cash, Seinfeld's trials are too far-fetched to convincingly support thatidea, Kimmel argues.  This ad has the ingredients to have placed higher, butin its current state it is not in the same league as the top three finishers.Category:  Print AdvertisingCritics who argue print advertisers need to shift their focus away from imagetoward price may want to rethink their case.  Consumers don't respond to thehard sell from print ads.  Instead, they expect print ads to tell a visualstory that establishes a brand image.  "You can't shout numbers at people whenthey aren't listening," says Kimmel.  This year's print ad winners do nothingof the sort.First Place:  Citibank.  Lowe and Partners/SMS.Citibank strikes gold again with this clever play on the old adage that peoplecan't judge a book by its cover.  Two photos, one of a menacing motorcyclerider and the other of a nerdy looking fellow, are juxtapositioned to make astrong point about the value of Citibank's photocard.  The headline next tothe biker's photo says, "This is you."  The photo next to the nerd says, "Thisis the creep who stole your wallet."  The copy at the bottom of the adexplains that a Citibank photocard provides cardholders with the security ofknowing that if their card is ever lost or stolen, con artists will have atough time using it.  "The ad gets to the point, explains the value of theproduct, and does so with a sense a humor," says Kimmel.Second Place:  F&M Bank, Winchester, Va.  Barber Martin & Associates,Richmond, Va.The strength of this ad is its headline, "The Credit Card For People WhoThought They Couldn't Get One."  It quickly grabs the reader's attention anddraws him into the copy points, where the value of the product is clearlyexplained.  A brief description of how a secured card works is also included.Since the only graphic elements are a photograph of an F&M card and the bank'slogo, the art direction doesn't get in the the way of the message.  "This adis clear and distinctly positions the product," says Kimmel.  "The headlineaddresses the target audience.  It's not the most charming or personable ad,but it is effective."Third Place:  The Associates National Bank.  Parrish Wickersham & Partners,Dallas.This ad targeted at the coveted college-student market uses flippant MTV-stylegraphics and a pointed headline, "Are You Ready for the Real World?"  to grabthe reader's attention.  The centerpiece is a picture of the Earth, over whichseveral statements about the everyday financial problems facing collegestudents are pasted.  Smack dab in the middle, in bold type, is the headline.Succinct copy explains why students can benefit from an Associates creditcard, which sets up the tag line, "Real Plastic for the Real World.""This ad is irreverent enough to spark the curiosity of college students,"says Kimmel.  "It is pointed and makes the product sound useful enough to meettheir needs."Fourth Place:  Old Kent Bank.  Felder Communications Group, Grand Rapids,Mich.This ad hawking Old Kent's Card Miles program, through which cardholders canearn discounts on airline tickets, gets right to the point.  Key sellingpoints are summarized in bullet fashion-free airline tickets for all U.S.airlines can be earned with 20,000 Card Miles, and there are no blackoutperiods restricting the use of the tickets.  Copy points that explaincardholders earn Card Miles points for all transactions, even for everydaypurchases such as gas, groceries, or dry cleaning, rescue a headline that istoo pointed-"Turn groceries into free plane tickets."  A winning effort, butplenty of room for improvement, says Kimmel.Category:  Direct MailDirect mail is the medium for the hard-sell, because consumers expect to bebombarded with special deals through the mail.  The key, however, is not tocreate a piece that makes consumers feel unimportant by using transparentflattery or pitching an offer that they may feel is unaffordable, which inturn makes them feel inadequate.  "Effective pieces address who theircustomers are and what they want," says DraftDirect's Howell.  "Know yourmarket."First Place:  Stern's (a division of Federated Department Stores Inc.)Heinrich Marketing.What puts this piece above the competition is the simplicity of its message.The oversized envelope displays part of a $20 bill in a window, whichimmediately implies the offer brings savings.  To the left of the window is agreen border-the color of money-with the headline, "What You See Is What YouGet."  At the bottom of the envelope is a tag line, "Extra Cash the Next TimeYou Shop."Inside, the letter features a $20 coupon good toward Stern's charge cardpurchases.  The letter clearly lays out the benefits of accepting Stern'spreapproved credit offer:  a $20 coupon, and an additional 20% off purchasesthe first day the card is used.  A postscript at the bottom of the page liststhe location of the Stern's store nearest the prospect.  The back side of theletter displays a map listing the addresses of the 27 Stern's stores in NewYork and New Jersey.  "This offers implies real value without talking down tothe customer, and summarizes the key points," says Howell.  "There is noguessing as to what the offer is about."Second Place:  Bank of New York.  Gillespie Advertising Inc.This entry for Bank of New York's Toys 'R Us Visa earns high marks for its useof four-color printing and the continuity of its marketing message throughoutthe entire package-"Turn everyday spending into free toys."  The message isrepeated on both sides of the envelope.  Inside, a four-color, tri-fold flierfeaturing silhouettes of children playing and the Toys 'R Us logo explains howcardholders earn a 3% rebate on Toys 'R Us purchases and a 1% rebate on allother purchases.  The rebates are redeemable toward discounts on futurepurchases at Toys 'R Us as well as Kids 'R Us clothing stores.The flier also mentions a program to earn discounts on family vacationsthrough Toys 'R Us.  The letter features the added caveat of a $10 Toys 'R Uscoupon for accepting the preapproved offer.  "It's a gorgeous package," saysHowell.  "There is continuity to the message in all the elements, and theoffer gets right to the point."Third Place:  REI/SeaFirst Bank.  Hunt Marketing Group.Using a plain, brown envelope with forest-green lettering and brown paper forthe letter gives this piece an understated look that plays to the austerity ofits target audience-outdoorsmen.  The envelope succinctly highlights the keyfeatures of the offer:  no-annual fee, a 9.9% introductory interest rate, a 1%rebate on purchases, and preapproved credit.Inside, the brown-toned flier talks about Jack, a customer who earns 1%rebates for purchases charged to his REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.)  goldMasterCard, in addition to the rebates he earns as a member of REI's dividendprogram.  These perks enabled Jack to not only buy a new parka for his wife,but for himself, which makes Jack a "very happy camper."  "The color of thispackage is not atypical, which helps it overcome initial consumer resistance,"praises Howell.  "It has a simple, responsible look that appeals to itsaudience."Fourth Place:  Marine Midland Bank.  Marketing Resources.This piece for Marine Midland's Humane Society Visa earns high marks for itsunconventional envelope headline, "The Visa Card Most Preferred by EveryoneFrom Alligators to Zebras."  Supplementing the idea are pictures of theaforementioned animals.  A teaser rate of 9.9% and preapproved credit also arehighlighted.  Additional selling points, such as emergency card replacementand a 24-hour toll-free customer-service number, are bulleted.  Inside, atri-fold flier and letter explain the card's services, and how the HumaneSociety benefits from the card's use.  "The package has a little fun with theidea of helping protect animals, and plays with the idea of coveringeverything from A to Z with its envelope message," observes Howell.Fifth Place:  Humane Society/PNC Bank.  Marketing Resources.Unlike television and print advertising, where brand image is more critical,numbers can still make the biggest impression in direct mail.  The strength ofthis entry is its envelope, across the top of which are emblazoned threefigures, 8.75%, $0 and $5,000.  The numbers are designated, respectively, asthe introductory interest rate, annual fee, and maximum credit limit for thecard being pitched.  Underneath these figures is the headline, "Sometimes thenumbers speak for themselves."  Inside, a tri-fold flier, featuring aquestion-and-answer section, addresses pertinent information about the card.The letter includes a chart comparing interest rate charges paid on higherrate cards to those on the PNC card for the same balances.  "This is aneasy-to-read piece that telegraphs the sales message and gets people insidethe package," says Howell.  "The flier tackles marketing points about the cardthat may have fallen through the cracks, but the numbers say it all."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Love Letters From Wall StreetDespite the continued growth of major credit card issuers, Wall Street iskeeping one ear cocked for the first sounds of retrenchment in the extremelycompetitive card issuing market, which explains the lukewarm reception to someof the issuers' stocks.  But the same apprehension doesn't apply totransaction processors, who are emerging as favorites of the investmentcommunity.  Analysts have awakened to the realization that no matter whosecard consumers decide to carry and whether or not they pay balances off everymonth or heap on more revolving debt, processors stand to gain from electronicpayment's growing share of consumer spending.Though some processors are heavily dependent on a few large customers, buyrecommendations far outweigh hold positions, and nobody is urging investors tosell.  As a consequence, stock prices for these firms are posting someimpressive gains, and analysts are bullish about the long-term outlook forcard processors.From Wall Street's perspective, these are computer-services firms, and in thatcategory they are stars.  Recurring revenues are part of the appeal:  whereasa software firm starts off each quarter with zero revenues, processors cancount on a steady income stream from merchants locked into multi-yearcontracts.  Those revenues will only go up, too, as plastic increases its 7%share of consumer discretionary spending.  And processors are positioningthemselves as turn-key payment solutions, with check-verification andguarantee services, debit card acceptance, and any other non-cash paymentoption that surfaces, such as corporate purchasing cards and stored-valuecards.The processing business has fundamental strengths that appeal to manyinvestors.  The consolidation that is occurring among processors means abigger slice of an expanding pie for those that remain.  New competitors facehuge barriers to entry, and the economies of scale keep getting better.The 800-Pound GorillaThat said, observers nonetheless are keeping an eye on firms such as AT&T Co.and Microsoft Inc.  that might try to make a name for themselves in cardprocessing.  MCI Telecommunications Corp.  gained a stake in 1993 when itbought BT North America's processing operation.  More recently it acquired SHLSystemshouse Ltd., a Canadian systems integrator, says Patrick M.  Burton,information processing analyst at Lehman Brothers.  Still, new entrants arealmost obliged to find a strategic partner to compete, and the business's highcapitalization costs primarily benefits leading processor First Data Corp., hesays.Indeed, the arrival of processing's proverbial 800-pound gorilla didn't dampeninvestors' enthusiasm.  In the wake of Hackensack, N.J.-based First Data'spurchase of First Financial Management Corp., analysts retained their upbeatprognostications for the other players.  And why not?  The only processorsthey expect to take it in the neck, at least in the short term, are merchantbanks such as First National Bank of Omaha and Bank of America that competewith FDC in the merchant end of the business.Analyst Steven S.  Birer of Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco, has buyrecommendations for First Data and Riverwoods, Ill.-based SPS TransactionServices Inc., noting the latter has been priced as an issuer since itsacquisition a year ago of electronic giant Tandy Corp.'s card portfolio, andthose price-earnings multiples typically are half the ratios of processors.Value-Added ServicesMeanwhile, FDC's versatility as both a merchant and cardholder processor hascaptured investors' imaginations.  A wide range of value-added services cannow be promoted, including cash management and others that traditionally havebeen the province of banks.  By virtue of its position as the largest merchantand cardholder processor, FDC is in a position to offer services that otheracquirers have shied away from because of consumer privacy concerns, saysanalyst Gregory M.  Gould of Goldman Sachs & Co.  For example, a deal could bestruck with a department store whereby cardholders invoiced by FDC wouldreceive on-the-spot discounts at those stores' cash registers, assuming FDCdrove them.Since its spin-off in April 1992 from American Express Co., FDC has made fivesignificant purchases in the processing field:  NationalCard/NationalCheckProcessing Systems, TeleMoney Services, Envoy Corp.'s card business, CardEstablishment Services, and First Financial, parent of National Bancard Corp.(NaBanco), the nation's largest merchant acquirer.  Between NaBanco, CES, andits own in-house merchant-procession operation, "they must be approaching 30%of the market," estimates Richard Robida, vice president and merchantprocessing specialist with Speer and Associates.For the time being, the situation at FDC is chaotic, with customers frustratedand confused about which subsidiary is doing what, Robida says.  "For the mostpart, the FDC/FFMC merger activities are happening behind-the-scene and ourclients' daily operation and service are not affected," a First DataSpokesperson responds.  "Also, we're working hard to keep our clients,employees, and shareholders informed about merger activities throughout thetransition."But, once the latest merger is digested, banks that compete with FDC will facea tough choice:  "Either they can become a low-cost provider and slug it outfor share, or adopt an exit strategy," he says.Hambrecht & Quist's Birer altered his rating on National Data Corp.  to holdafter the FDC-First Financial merger was announced, reasoning that corporatemarriage "significantly changed the playing field."Banker Exodus?It's not just the analysts who have such opinions.  "The merger of First Dataand First Financial is going to create a significant amount of introspectionfrom the true bank card acquirers," suggests Richardson M.  Roberts, founderand chairman of PMT Services Inc., who predicts many of them will concludecard processing is divorced from their core business.  "This is more atelecommunications business than a banking business.  It's not about makingloans, it's not just credit cards, it's a lot of other payment settlement."If and when the major bank-owned merchant portfolios come into play, "I assureyou we'll be looking at them," says Roberts, who has been building a war chestto make such a bid.PMT, a Nashville-based independent sales organization that does business asU.S.  Bankcard Center, received a warm reception last year when it became thefirst ISO to make a public stock offering.  It priced at $8 a share in August1994.  A second offering of 1.875 million shares in mid-September of 1995 soldat $22.50 per share.  Six weeks later, the stock was hovering around $26.Leveraged GrowthWhile allowing that quasi-processors like PMT inhabit a risky market nichesusceptible to high merchant turnover, analysts like their short-termprospects.  Smith Barney rates PMT as a high-risk stock that will outperformthe market; Montgomery Securities rates it a solid buy.Capital raised in its two stock sales gives PMT the ability to buy out morecompetitors, something the firm has done 20 times in recent years.  The onlydifference is, now it is able to buy bigger firms that cater to higher-volumemerchants than PMT traditionally has served.  That should give PMT moreleverage to drive down transaction costs while it improves service levels toreduce merchant attrition.Although most merchants are authorizing transactions electronically now, "athird of them are still paper-based, so there is still great room for growth,"Roberts says.  He estimates 800,000 to 1 million U.S.  merchants remain to beconverted.With so many merchants likely to go electronic in the near future, Robertsexpects volume gains over and above the 15% to 20% annual transaction growthforecast through the end of the century.  "At that point, credit cards willonly represent 17% of consumer payments," leaving room for considerablegrowth, he points out.Roberts was left with paper wealth of almost $18 million after selling$675,000 worth of stock in September's offer.  He started the company in 1984at age 26.  "Our success has convinced others that this is a greatopportunity," he says.Uneasy AcquisitionAmong the independent sales organizations eying a public stock sales, analystssay, are Nova Information Systems Inc., which backed away from an initialpublic offering last spring, and Gensar, which acquired the processingoperations of TransNet Inc.  three years ago.  Nova in November took overFirst Union Corp.'s merchant portfolio, which had $2.8 billion in chargevolume in 1994, in return for First Union taking a 35% equity stake in theprocessor.One of the few processor sour notes in 1995 was sounded by retail cardspecialist SPS Transaction Services, and that occurred through no fault of itsprocessing business.  Analysts fingered the recently acquired, $920 millionTandy credit card portfolio for the blame.  That situation only fortifiedinvestors' reservations about the card-issuing business:  even as the marketin general and the pure card issuers in particular continue to defypredictions of a slowdown and post huge gains, issuing's inherent risk makesthem skittish.  The stock prices of issuers often take nose dives when reportsabout higher delinquencies, chargeoffs, and bankruptcies come out-and suchreports may increase in the coming months.By comparison, processors' predictable earnings are a safe haven for anyoneinterested in investing in the card industry.  "SPS's stock had gone to $30,but they had a little bit of a stumble with the Tandy portfolio and theyfailed to hit their earnings projections," points out Burton of LehmanBrothers.  "They need to regain their earnings momentum."  SPS had beenselling at about $26 a share in November, the same price it was at 12 monthsearlier when it split two for one.Among the current crop of publicly traded processors, Atlanta-based NationalData Corp.  is the only one that isn't drawing raves from Wall Street.Montgomery Securities' Richard K.  Weingarten rates NDC a buy, but others inthe investment community are more reserved.  "It's not that there's aparticular problem," says Interstate Johnson Lane's Sandra Barker, who pickedup NDC two years ago and has rated it a hold ever since.  "It's more avaluation comment than anything."  With the stock's price up about 40% in1995, the P/E ratio is down to about 22 times 1996's projected earnings,Goldman Sachs' Gould says.NDC has slipped to a second-tier player in the front-end terminal drivingsegment of the processing business, Speer's Robida says, with only Visa'sMerchant Bank Services and MasterCard's MAPP still able to challenge FDC forsupremacy.  Visa is aligning itself with Total System Services Inc.  as thebankers' alternative to FDC.  NDC used to have a similar strategic alliancewith Total.  NDC also has been slow to move from a voice-authorization networkto an electronic authorizer, he adds, and that has hurt it, along withbusiness decisions in the past that alienated many bankers."That's absurd," responds a NDC spokesman, adding "the bulk" of NDC'sprocessing volume is electronic.  "You have to have some voice authorizationbecause your customers want it," he adds.The richest processor stock is Columbus, Ga.-based Total, which trades atabout 50 times earnings.  Twelve years after its IPO, Total's parent, SynovusCorp., still owns 81% of the stock.  Its high valuation makes Total the onlyprocessor that Weingarten rates a hold.Bullish OutlookWeingarten forecasts 20% to 30% earnings growth for all of the half-dozenprocessors he follows.  He characterizes the category as the new breed ofstock leaders, able to outperform the market year after year.  "Incentivecards have helped processors gain tremendous share, but the real driver iswider merchant acceptance," he says.  "When credit card growth slows, otherbusinesses like health care, stored-value cards, and electronic commerce willstart to feed in.  Twenty percent growth will continue for years."Lehman's Burton is a little more restrained in his prognosis, but he too isupbeat.  "The shift from cash and checks is continuing, and it could beaccelerating," he says.  He gives First Data and Check Free strong buyrecommendations, expects SPS to outperform the market, and rates St.  Paul,Minn.-based Deluxe Corp.  (which acquired Financial Alliance ProcessingService, an ISO and processor) a hold.Analysts fret about the impact on a processor if a large account should bolt.Montgomery already has factored in the eventual loss by SPS of Lechmere, anortheastern retailer that was acquired by Montgomery Ward a year ago and isexpected to take its processing business to GE Capital after court proceedingsare settled.No other client danger flags are being raised, however.  Total relies on theAT&T Universal card for a large share of its processing volume, but along-term extension last year gives the analysts comfort.  "It would concernme more if the contract was coming up for renewal," notes Larry Hickey ofFirst Analysis Corp.  With NationsBank and Bank of America now working withTotal, the company isn't overly dependent on any single client, he points out.The riskiness of credit granting keeps investors up at night and makes themskittish about the pure card stocks like Advanta Corp., MBNA Corp., First USAInc., and Capital One Financial Corp.  The processors, on the other hand, area safe harbor and a good way to cash in on plastic's transformation to a majortransaction device.  As one analyst observes, "Boring is beautiful."Indeed, the boring predictability of card processors' growth rates and marginsof 20% for the foreseeable future make this one of the most appealing classesof stock on Wall Street.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Detente for Lawyers And Collectors?Three years ago, they were the new kids on the block.  But now, electronicattorney collection networks are proving themselves by boosting recoveries ofcharged-off credit card debt and relieving card issuers of some of their legalburdens.  And collections agencies, many of which vehemently opposed thelawyer networks muscling their way onto collectors' turf, now are beginning toaccept the newcomers.In fact, it's going beyond mere begrudging acceptance.  Some collectionsagencies themselves have already formed or are planning alliances withattorney networks.  And at least one agency might even create its own attorneynetwork.  "They're not mutually exclusive anymore," says Warren S.  Rosenfeld,managing partner of McNeily, Rosenfeld & Associates, a Washington, D.C., lawfirm that operates the Rosenfeld-Net.Equifax Inc., the big credit-reporting agency that also owns a majorcollections company, Equifax Risk Management Services, crystallized the newattitude last October when it formed a venture with Rosenfeld's firm calledLitigation Access Web.  "The backdrop is the collection agencies have feltthis was our turf and were very reluctant to send any accounts out, or referto attorneys," says Lyle F.  Herrmann, Litigation Access Web product manager."And the attorneys were saying, 'why use collectors?' There was some fingerpointing and bragging rights-me, me, mine, mine, mine.  But there is aneffective place and role for the agency-type collector, and there is aneffective role for litigation."Moving CloserThe folks who give the collections agencies and lawyers their business arevoicing similar opinions.  "Both sides are moving closer to each other," saysEugene V.  Brugger, recovery manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Bank OneColumbus, which uses the National Attorney Network for part of its recoverywork.  "I think there's a realization that there's money to be made bycollaboration."Besides NAN and Rosenfeld-Net, there are now several other attorney networks(box, page 52).  They include the National Association of Retail CollectionAttorneys' NARCA-Net; Dozier Legal Network, a subsidiary of the Richmond,Va.-based Dozier and Associates P.C.; and the network run by the AmericanAssociation of Collector Attorneys.While the networks vary in the range of services they offer and technologicalcapabilities, the common thread is that they allow card issuers to placecharged-off accounts and supporting documents with law firms electronically.That reduces the paper burden, and some networks make it easy for issuers,using computers and software linked to the networks, to keep track oflitigation and the performance of each firm.The networks also can quickly place accounts with their law-firm members,which means issuers' lawyers can devote most of their attention to monitoringwhat the firms acting on their behalf are doing rather than hunting forcompetent attorneys wherever they have deadbeat customers.  "We're dealingwith one attorney instead of 50 attorneys in 50 different states," says EdwardJ.  Casey, collection and recovery manager for Bridgeport, Conn.-basedPeople's Bank, which uses Rosenfeld-Net.  "It takes a big burden off of us."Growth IndustrySensing a growing need for such tracking and oversight services, the attorneywho founded the Dozier Legal Network, John W.  Dozier Jr., stopped doingactual collections work last year when he founded his namesake network.  "Wecame to the conclusion that in order for this to work, we (shouldn't be) a lawfirm trying to run a computer network, we needed to be a technology companyproviding a legal application," says Dozier, who hopes to have more than 400law firms affiliated with his network by year's end, compared with 70 at theend of 1995.Indeed, the attorney networks almost unanimously are reporting strong growth.AACA's network placed 16,000 accounts worth about $70 million last year, butPresident Raymond J.  Cook projects 30,000 accounts and $140 million inplacements this year.  "Credit grantors want to try something different thanthe traditional 'we'll place it with a collection agency approach,'" Cooksays.Despite the networks' growth, one factor reducing tensions between the lawyersand the collectors is the overall growth of the card industry.General-purpose card receivables grew 20% in 1993 and 19% in 1994, and 1995'sgrowth will probably come close.  Such huge growth means lots of charged-offdebt even though credit quality, while showing some signs of fraying, still ishigh.  In fact, card issuers probably can expect to recover about $2 billionthis year.Thus, even some collectors who expressed deep skepticism about the newattorney networks ("This Is No Lawyer Joke," April, 1994) profess today thatthey're not too worried.  "From my personal perspective, they've not takenanything at all (from us)," says Craig J.  Costanzo, chairman and chiefexecutive of Management Adjustment Bureau, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency thathandles about $100 million in charged-off card debt annually.  "There's justso much business out there, it's unbelievable."Doubling RecoveriesWhile a majority of the attorney networks have only brief track records, someare starting to rack up impressive numbers-and thus forcing collectionagencies to take notice.  GE Capital Corp., the nation's largest third-partyretail card issuer, started placing accounts for legal action throughAtlanta-based NAN in 1994.  For the first nine months of 1995, recoveriesthrough NAN were 106% higher than they were for accounts placed forconventional legal action in the same 1994 period.The reason?  The electronic network makes it easy to monitor each account'sstatus, and to compare the performance of the approximately 70 law firms GECapital uses nationwide.  With more than 300,000 charged-off store cardaccounts being placed for legal action yearly, fewer cases are getting lost inthe shuffle, says Mary K.  Kinsey, senior vice president of collectionsservices for GE Capital Credit Services.  "It really forces them (law firms)to look at every single account," she says.Money on the TableWhile there are wide variations among individual issuers, collections expertsestimate that less than 5% of charged-off accounts-perhaps even as low as2%-result in litigation.  But some observers say that as many as 10% ofdeadbeat accounts should be litigated-a goal that's hard for national issuersto hit as they struggle to manage dozens of law firms handling thousands ofcases.The attorney networks say they can get the cases into court that should be incourt.  NAN's president, attorney Douglas W.  Wallace, says his network isaiming for $1 billion in placements this year, compared with 300,000 creditcard claims for just over $500 million in 1995 and 120,000 claims for $240million in 1994, the network's first year.  He estimates about 70% of thecases referred to the 165 law firms in the network result in lawsuits.  "It'sa given that legal action is more effective than any other form of recovery,"says Wallace.Adds St.  Louis collections attorney Donald B.  Kramer, president of Kramer &Frank P.C.  and founder of NARCA:  "Credit card issuers are used to getting a6% recovery from collections agencies.  Attorneys can double or triple that aslong as they give the attorney enough time.  The agencies pour out thepressure in the first 60 days, but if you look at the end of two years, theyattorneys absolutely kill the agencies."Collection agencies, meanwhile, disagree with the practice by some issuers tosend certain deadbeat accounts directly to lawyers, even though agencies mightproduce as good or better recovery rates.  "I think clients are making a poordecision in sending straight to a network," says one collections executive whoinsists on anonymity.Though collections agencies may disagree with the attorneys' bluster, growingnumbers are acknowledging that lawyers have an increasingly important role inrecovering bad debt.  "I do believe that agencies, by not aligning themselveswith attorneys, are leaving a lot of money on the table," says Douglas B.Schultz, chief executive officer of United Recovery Systems Inc., a Houstoncollections agency which does work for seven of the 10 largest card issuers."I do see attorney-agency alliances in the future."With that in mind, Schultz is considering a partnership with one of thenetworks, though he hasn't decided on which one.  He might even form his ownnetwork.Profit IssueAnd while Schultz can get along with lawyers, he nonetheless has somemisgivings about a formal business partnership because of the profit question.If the issuer-client lets his agency keep 35% of the recovered debt, but thelawyers take 25%, "that leaves only 10% for me," Schultz says.  And that thinmargin could be reduced even further depending on which party has to absorbthe court costs, he adds.Still, Schultz thinks allying with attorney networks at the very least makessending paperwork back and forth easier-and thus makes clients happier.  Andif he can show card issuers that his recovery rates are going up because ofmore legal action, so much the better, because it will bring more volume tothe agency.  "I don't think there's that much profit for the agencies, butit's another option," he says.Equifax retains an average of 33% of recoveries and hopes to make its newLitigation Access Web service profitable by asking clients to absorb the courtcosts.  As of early December, some 800 accounts had been referred to the legalservice, but Equifax's Herrmann says it's still too soon to quote recoveryrates.Clearly, however, Equifax is looking to feather its already large collectionsnest-$3 billion a year in placements, about a third of which is card debt-byadding the legal network to its roster of services.  "We wanted to prove tothe industry that we could take the high road to have our collection-agencybusiness work hand-in-hand with an attorney network," says Herrmann.Equifax's basic criteria for referral to the network hinges on the accountbalance (less than $1,000 is less likely to be litigated), the span of timesince a payment, and whether the debtor has a valid address and is employed.Debtors with jobs and assets upon which a court can slap a lien, such as ahouse, are most likely to be sued.Issuers and attorneys still have to be very careful about which consumers theyintend to sue.  Management Adjustment Bureau's Costanzo, who still remainswary of the attorney networks, notes that the federal Fair Debt CollectionPractices Act makes it illegal to threaten lawsuits unless the threat isfollowed by action.But Banc One's Brugger says that his bank, for one, is scrupulous about whatit tells debtors.  "The only time we'll tell customers we're going to sue themis if we have the intent," he says.Ironically, the number of Bank One's lawsuits against cardholders has gonedown recently, according to Brugger who did not cite specific figures.  Heattributes that to more diligent work by the attorneys early in the process.Even Costanzo concedes that correspondence from an attorney can scare paymentsout of recalcitrant debtors.  "The fact that they send a letter out on anattorney letterhead is very helpful," he says.And as that notion gains more and more currency among issuers' collectionsmanagers, the future looks increasingly bright for the attorney networks.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Send In the RepairmenIt's been well over a year since major amendments to the federal BankruptcyCode took effect.  The amendments were hailed by many creditors, includingcredit card issuers, as important changes which would both curb bankruptcyfilings and significantly enhance bankruptcy recoveries.  To date, neitherbenefit has materialized, although some of the amendments have had positiveresults.Indeed, bankruptcy filings have been on a 12-month increase.  When the final1995 numbers are made official, total filings for the past year will likely bein the neighborhood of 920,000, which would be the third-highest yearly totalever.  The rate of increased bankruptcy filings for the past four quartersechoes the bankruptcy explosion of the mid-1980s.The 1994 Bankruptcy Code amendments also have yet to significantly increaseper-case recoveries.  As a result, card issuers are becoming more vocal indemands for a further tightening of bankruptcy laws.The Good NewsOne of the several positive changes made in 1994 was the raising of theChapter 13 debt ceiling to $250,000 of unsecured debt and $750,000 of secureddebt.  This allows more consumers to seek relief through reorganization ofpersonal debts under Chapter 13, as opposed to filings under Chapter 7, inwhich the debtor's assets are liquidated, or Chapter 11, in which business andpersonal debts are reorganized.  In the later two cases, recoveries to cardissuers have always been lower.  In some of the areas of the country, Chapter11 filings have declined, while Chapter 13 filings have increased, althoughonly marginally.Another positive change which holds promise for the long term was thestreamlining of the reaffirmation process by eliminating the need for courtapproval.  By signing a reaffirmation agreement before a bankruptcy dischargeis entered, a debtor agrees to continued liability after bankruptcy.  Thosedebtors who sign such agreements usually do so to avoid a creditor's complaintcontesting the discharge where the account was loaded up with charges beforethe bankruptcy filing, or where an issuer has offered to let the debtorcontinue to use the card account after bankruptcy.  The latter group includesa growing number of issuers who see reaffirmation as a good way to cutbankruptcy losses.A third positive change was extending the so-called pre-bankruptcy presumptionperiod, during which the charges are presumed to be nondischargeable, to 60days.  The presumption applies to both cash advances and luxury goods andservices where either exceeds $1,000.  This change is reported to haveeffectively enhanced issuers' ability to quickly settle potentialdischargeability claims for relatively large sums.  Because so few accounts,relative to total bankruptcy filings, have activity which rises to the levelof fraud required under the present bankruptcy code standard, actual increasedrecoveries from this change, while significant, have not been dramatic.Finally, the 1994 amendments created the National Bankruptcy ReviewCommission, comprised of nine appointed members who have begun their two-yearmission to review the bankruptcy laws, take testimony from affected parties,and make recommendations to Congress regarding future amendments.  While it isa positive development to have a focal point for change, the obvious downsidewould be congressional reluctance to consider changes before the commissionhas weighed in with its report almost two years from now.  Issuers should,therefore, consider a dual approach to reform:  long-term advocacy through thecommission and, hopefully, faster-track changes by seeking direct legislativeinput into needed amendments.ExemptionsA negative change in the 1994 law was the increase in the dollar value ofproperty debtors are allowed to protect from sale by a bankruptcy trustee.The so-called federal-exemption amounts were doubled across the board.Examples include the homestead exemption which was increased from $7,500 to$15,000 ($30,000 for a married couple), and the household-goods exemptionwhich was doubled to $8,000 ($16,000 for a married couple).  Although thefederal exemptions only apply in 15 states, at least two of the 35 otherstates have recently increased their exemption amounts.  One was California,which doubled the exemptions available to its residents, citing the federalincrease as a basis.Because so-called asset Chapter 7 cases can take two years or longer toliquidate, it is still too early to tell the effect of the exemption change.But because every exemption dollar comes directly out of funds which wouldhave otherwise gone to unsecured creditors, the negative effect will certainlybe significant.Much of the past and present volume of bankruptcy filings is attributable tothe marketing of bankruptcy, both direct and indirect.  Indirect marketingincludes word of mouth (with almost 1 million filings per year, there are alot of voices out there), newspaper coverage (it is virtually impossible tofind an issue of any major-market newspaper that does not include an articleabout a well-known company's or celebrity's bankruptcy filing), and how-tobooks about bankruptcy.All of these indirect marketing aspects have resulted in the almost completeerosion of the stigma once attached to filing bankruptcy.  Yes, bankruptcystill is an extreme emotional hardship for most people, but the reluctance tofile is much easier to overcome in an environment where famous individuals andcompanies are often perceived (usually incorrectly) to be using bankruptcyrelief as a mere financial-planning device.By far the most effective bankruptcy marketing, however, has been what is ineffect direct marketing by debtors' attorneys.  They have done an excellentjob of making consumers aware of the bankruptcy option through advertisementsin the Yellow Pages, newspapers and on television, and through targeted mailsent directly to persons facing lawsuits for defaults.  It is no coincidencethat the bankruptcy explosion of the 1980s came on the heels of the SupremeCourt's relaxation of advertising restrictions upon attorneys.Countering the MessagesIn the face of this successful marketing of bankruptcy, major issuers havebeen attempting for some time to communicate the negative aspects of abankruptcy filing to customers, most importantly a bankruptcy's negativeaffect upon obtaining future credit.  Many issuers have also been activelyreferring delinquent customers to local branches of the Consumer CreditCounseling Service as an alternative to bankruptcy.  Some issuers haveadvocated placing national newspaper ads explaining non-bankruptcy options.Just as important as combating bankruptcy marketing is the need to focus uponimproving recoveries from the increasing number of bankruptcies.  In thisregard, it is useful to look at the big picture which shows that, nationally,almost 70% of consumer cases are filed under Chapter 7.  Of these, only about5% result in any recovery to card issuers.  Issuers' main bankruptcyrecoveries have always come from Chapter 13 repayment plan cases which,unfortunately, are less than a third of all filings.The main avenue to a dramatic increase in bankruptcy recoveries, then, is toshift as many Chapter 7 cases as possible into Chapter 13.  This has beentried repeatedly by suggesting amendments to Congress which would eliminateChapter 7 or greatly restrict its usage.  The only such change ever actuallyto survive the political process and become enacted was the largelyineffective substantial-abuse provision, added in 1984.  That provision allowsthe court to dismiss a Chapter 7 filing if the judge determines the caseconstitutes an abuse of the law.  It was intended to directly force thosedebtors with sufficient income to fund a repayment plan into Chapter 13.  Butbecause of procedural and substantive problems inherent in the wording of thestatute, the provision has never had the desired effect, and is ripe forfurther amendment.Rather than focusing solely upon tightening the availability of Chapter 7relief, however, issuers should consider ways in which Chapter 13 can beenhanced and thereby made more attractive to consumers.  A common complaintamong debtors' attorneys and Chapter 13 trustees is that debtors have noincentive to repay unsecured creditors under Chapter 13.  This is because,they argue, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is just as likely to result in the denialof future credit as is a Chapter 7 filing, and both types of filings arereportable for up to 10 years.The Reporting IssueOne way to enhance Chapter 13 would be to roll back the credit-reportingperiod for a Chapter 13 filing while leaving Chapter 7 at 10 years.  If, forexample, Chapter 13 filings could only be reported up to six months afterdischarge, it might be anticipated that many debtors would opt for Chapter 13as the best way of rebuilding their credit.The Chapter 13 option would be further enhanced if issuers were to adjusttheir records upon receiving a Chapter 13 discharge to reflect a favorablesettlement.  They could also alter lending policies to provided that customerswho complete meaningful Chapter 13 plans would be considered for future creditaccording to their individual circumstances, and not be denied creditautomatically because of a past Chapter 13 filing which affected the issuer.With regard to post-bankruptcy credit, Chapter 13 trustees in Texas and Ohiohave had debtor-rehabilitation programs in effect for several years.  Underthese programs, debtors who successfully complete larger-percentage repaymentplans are considered on their merits for new credit by participating lenders.The lenders do not promise new credit, but do agree to disregard the Chapter13 filing, or to consider it as a favorable indicator of a debtor'srehabilitation in evaluating a credit application.  The trustees report thatthe program has successfully encouraged debtors to choose Chapter 13 overChapter 7.A strong advantage of focusing upon enhancing Chapter 13 relief is thatlegislative opposition presumably would be minimal because the proposals arenot restrictive, but rather offer debtors incentives to rehabilitate throughChapter 13 on a voluntary basis.  This approach reflects compassion for thosewho got in over their heads with credit, sometimes for reasons beyond theircontrol, but often due to an unsuccessful adjustment to the relatively new ageof convenient credit.  Surviving in this era requires self-discipline andcredit education, the lack of which is a problem that is societal in scope.A Favorable ArgumentIn addition, as a foundation upon which to argue for legislative action, afavorable argument can be made that the historically high ratio of Chapter 13to Chapter 7 cases in most of the Southeast should be possible in the rest ofthe country.  The Southeast, with the exception of Florida, traditionally hashad a larger ratio of Chapter 13 filings because, according to some areabankruptcy professionals, conservative attitudes prevail in the largely ruralareas, and Chapter 7 exemptions in those states have been generally morerestrictive.This does not mean that a tightening of Chapter 7 should be ignored.  On thecontrary, removing the subjective standard in many dischargeability contests(the so-called intent to repay) with a more objective (reasonable ability torepay) standard, would ease the difficult burden of proof now facing issuersin many jurisdictions.Going further, although strong opposition could be expected from the consumerlobby, it could be proposed that all principal from debts incurred 90 daysbefore bankruptcy be automatically nondischargeable without the need to file adischargeability complaint.  Such an approach would have a foundation in otherWestern countries' bankruptcy laws, which are generally far more conservative.In sum, issuers' goals of decreased bankruptcy filings and enhanced recoveriescould be met, in part, through making Chapter 13 more attractive, which wouldlikely encounter little opposition, while also proposing tighter Chapter 7dischargeability standards.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996A Plan to Improve The Bankruptcy Law* Make Chapter 13 more attractive to consumers by shortening the time negativebankruptcy information will stay on their credit reports.  * Issuers shouldconsider more favorable treatment for debtors who choose Chapter 13 comparedwith those who use Chapter 7.  * Change the subjective "intent to repay"dischargeability standard in Chapter 7 cases to an objective "reasonableability to repay" standard.  * Make principal debts incurred within 90 days ofa Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing nondischargeable-in other words, the consumercannot escape responsibility for repayment.Source:  Becket & WatkinsBack to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Sorting Out the MailThe mountain of mail coming from credit card issuers keeps rising to newheights.  Card mailings are projected to have totaled 2.8 billion pieces in1995, an 18.5% increase from a year earlier, according Tarrytown, N.Y.-basedBehavioral Analysis Inc.In order to get a better read on which issuers are mailing the most and thetypes of cards most frequently mailed, Faulkner & Gray Inc., publisher ofCredit Card Management, began tracking in April 1994 mailings to staffers inits Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.  offices.  Details from thesolicitations were published monthly in CCM's sister publication, Credit CardNews.  Mailings collected through November 1995 totaled 1,077.While the results of such a survey are not a statistically representativesample of the entire industry, they do provide a road map of which issuers aredominating mailings and the types of pricing strategies in play.Top MailersThough issuers are mailing more than ever, the bulk of those mailings arecoming from a handful of issuers.  The top 10 issuers tracked in the surveyaccounted for 56% of all offers received.  To no one's surprise, Citibank wasthe top mailer with an 11.5% share, followed by Capital One Financial Corp.with a 6.8% share, and First USA, at 6.5%.  Unexpectedly checking in fourth isSan Francisco-based Providian Bankcorp (formerly First Deposit), which ranks22nd in receivables, with a 6.1% share.  MBNA rounds out the top five, with4.9% share.On the pricing side, annual fees remain alive, though they continue to loseground.  Overall, 27% of solicitations received had an annual fee.  Abreakdown of solicitations received for 1995 reveals that issuers are mailingfewer solicitations with annual fees.  Just 26% of solicitations received in1995 had annual fees, down from 29% in 1994.  And nearly all gold card offersare promoted as non-fee cards, according to BAI.Fixed interest rates are also disappearing from the landscape.  Variable ratesare now king.  Of the general purpose card offers received, 78% promoted apermanent variable rate, and 29% offered a variable teaser rate pegged to theprime rate, LIBOR, or some other floating measure.Teaser rates virtually have become a prerequisite for card mailings, as 82% ofsolicitations offered either a fixed-rate or variable rate teaser.  The spliton the duration of the teasers was fairly even:  48% pitched teasers for sixmonths or less, while 52% offered teasers for more than six months.As for the types of cards being mailed, gold cards were the dominant subset,netting 52% of bank card mailings received.  BAI reports that gold cardsrepresented 48% of bank card mailings during the second quarter of 1995.Cobranded cards accounted for 15% of all CCN's bank card mailings.  Cobrandedcards totaled 20% of bank card mailings during the second quarter, accordingto BAI.MasterCard International still leads the cobranding derby.  CobrandedMasterCards represented 65% of cobranded card mailings that did not offerconsumers a choice of brand, compared with 35% for Visa.Among cobranded partners, AT&T's Universal Card lead the way, accounting for22% of cobranded card mailings.  American Airlines' AAdvantage card was secondwith a 17% share of mailings, and the Shell MasterCard placed third with a 12%share.Given the volume of mail, Faulkner & Gray intends to monitor card offers evenmore closely in the future.  Which issuers will be the biggest mailers in 1996and what types of offers will consumers see?  Stay tuned.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996An End Run By FraudstersWhen it comes to the war on fraud, the credit card industry has been sofocused on developing new technologies, such as smart cards, to foil conartists that they may have forgotten to scrutinize the legal loopholes andtheir own business practices for potential weaknesses that swindlers canexploit.Indeed, the indictment last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles of 20Vietnamese immigrants for bank fraud has exposed a serious flaw in theExpedited Funds Availability Act of 1988, in addition to possible flaws in howcard issuers govern their own organizations.The type of fraud perpetrated is a so-called booster-check scheme in which thesuspects allegedly wrote checks from accounts with insufficient funds to boosttheir credit limits, then made cash advances and expensive purchases with thecards before the checks were rejected by the banks.  After the credit burdenbecame too great, the defendants allegedly declared bankruptcy.The scheme defrauded issuers nationwide of more than $40 million, and morearrests are expected.  Similar ploys could cost issuers as much as $100million, says Assistant U.S.  Attorney Marc R.  Greenberg.  That's about 14%of the $734 million in bank card fraud in 1994.  Investigators have subpoenaedthe records from 150 credit card issuers, including Chase Manhattan Corp.,AT&T Universal Card Services, Banc One, and Bank of America.The case raises concerns that changes need to be made to the Expedited FundsAvailability Act of 1988, which requires banks and issuers to post a check andcredit the funds as soon as the check is received, rather than waiting for itto clear.Prosecutors claim loopholes in the law enabled the suspects to withdraw largecash advances or buy big-ticket items with the cards after mailing to theircard issuing banks bogus checks to boost their credit limits.  Some defendantsallegedly sent five checks of $5,000 each to one issuer in a week, then spentthe entire amount before the first check was cleared or rejected by the bank,Greenberg says.After the defendants depleted all available credit on their cards, they wouldfile bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy court records reveal each cardholder has from$100,000 to $685,000 in unsecured credit card debt.  "The law requires issuersto open the line of credit as soon as the check is received," says Joel S.Lisker, MasterCard International Senior Vice President of Security and RiskManagement.  "This is a foolish thing to do."Sharing the BlameResponding to fraud concerns, the Federal Reserve Board plans to survey bankson the extent of check fraud losses caused by the Expedited Funds AvailabilityAct.  The six-page survey should begin arriving at financial institutionsaround mid-February.But the case is also drawing attention to card issuers own short- comings inthe fraud battle.  Fraud experts argue that competition and complacency haveprompted issuers to write off booster check fraud as a collection issueinstead of fraud, overlook red flags that suggest fraud, and make cards tooeasy to obtain.  One suspect had five MasterCards from one bank, each one witha maxed out credit limit, says Greenberg.Adds Everett Whatley, president of Raleigh, N.C.-based Card Risk ManagementGlobal:  "Competition makes issuers less sensitive to fraud andcreditworthiness.  They should not allow checks to boost a credit line.  If alarge check is received, they should ensure the funds are in the bank accountthe check is written from before posting it."That's a logical solution, but will issuers heed the advice?Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996I'll Trade You My Portfolio...Card executives who were savvy traders of baseball cards during their youthmay want to brush up those skills.  The concept of acquiring credit cardaccounts via a straight-up trade for accounts of equal value is beingconsidered as a low-cost alternative to buying portfolios.Indeed, with fewer portfolios on the block and escalating premiums, portfoliotrading makes good sense.  After all, issuers can rid themselves of accountsthat don't fit the makeup of their portfolio, such as affinity cards that wereacquired via a merger, by trading for accounts more in line with theirbusiness, such as those in their home market.Confused?  Don't be.  "The idea is to trade away accounts that are morevaluable to another issuer in exchange for accounts that are more valuable toyou," explains Michael J.  Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group,Westbury, N.Y., which is broaching the idea to clients.Let's Make a DealThat's certainly an attractive proposition in an era when banks are underincreasing pressure to grow assets.  But completing an equitable trade is notan easy task, warns to Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Co., aNewbury Park, Calif.-based consulting firm specializing in portfolio sales."I was involved in two attempted trades back in the 1980s, and both times thedeal fell through because one side always felt their portfolio was worth morethan the other portfolio," Hammer recalls.Just how feasible is portfolio trading?  Auriemma argues that with banks beingpushed by investors to grow assets, issuers will start to give seriousconsideration to the concept because the money saved by not paying a premiumto buy a coveted block of accounts can be put toward card marketing.But before issuers rush off to make the trade of a lifetime, they had bestcheck with their accounting departments about the cost of adding thoseaccounts to the portfolio.  Issuers thinking of trading portfolios ought toask themselves the following questions before pulling the trigger on a trade,cautions one Wall Street analyst:  Can the acquisition costs associated withthose accounts still be be amortized?  Will the accounts acquired in a tradebe more expensive to service than those traded away?  And will the acquiredaccounts be more profitable than those traded away?  "There are a lotaccounting issues that must be addressed," the analyst adds.Card experts agree that portfolio trading can be pulled off if the partiesinvolved price their portfolios equitably.  "Portfolio trading is such anattractive option, any prudent issuer will look at it," says Hammer.  Whoknows, maybe one day credit card executives may trade card portfolios aseasily as they traded, when they were kids, a baseball card of Mickey Mantlefor one of Willie Mays.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Cutting Up Commercial CardsFor years, card marketers have successfully sliced and diced the consumer cardmarket into thinner segments by creating products that cater to specificcardholder needs.  But when it comes to commercial cards, there has beenlittle segmentation.Sure, issuers have created purchasing cards and cards targeted at smallbusinesses that offer a revolving line of credit, but those are basicsegmentation techniques, much like standard and gold cards.  Consequently, fewof the high-powered segmentation techniques learned in the consumer markethave been applied to commercial cards.That's because corporations and businesses have historically looked to cardprograms to lower their operating expenses first.  Cardholder perks areconsidered a frivolous expense that raise the cost of the card program.But that attitude is changing.  American Express Co.'s launch of a platinumcorporate card last October signals that small-business executives, at whichthe card is targeted, are demanding more consumer card perks from commercialcard issuers.Catering to NeedsThe reason:  small-business executives tend to be less sensitive to the costof a commercial card program than large corporations, says Fred O.  Gumbel,president of the electronic commerce division for Electronic Data Systems."Small businesses are more willing to accept perks on commercial cards thanlarge corporations even though those benefits may be built in to the price ofthe card," says Gumbel, who headed First Bank Systems' corporate cardportfolio before moving to EDS in 1994.AmEx, which says its small-business customers asked for more perks, answeredthe call with its platinum corporate card.  The card charges a $300 annual feeand $150 for additional cards.  Cardholders receive free companion ticketswhen they buy a full-fare, first-class or business-class airline ticket; freeenrollment in AmEx's Membership Rewards program; free room upgrades,continental breakfast for two, and late checkout at participating hotels; andconfirmed restaurant reservations.Now that AmEx is applying segmentation techniques learned in the consumermarket to commercial cards, will bank card issuers follow?  The answer is yes."There are bank card issuers interested in marketing a cobranded commercialcard," declares Peter L.  Williamson, managing director of Stamford,Conn.-based Salestrac USA Inc.So coveted are some consumer card perks that small-business owners are payingfor business expenses with consumer cards.  "The right rewards are a big plusfor small businesses," says Williamson.  Perks small-business commercial cardholders may see are frequent-flier miles, car-rental and gasoline discounts."Segmentation is becoming more important in corporate card marketing," saysDorsey R.  Grant, AmEx's vice president of customer loyalty, small-businessservices.  "Whether it's data reporting or cardholder perks, commercialcardholders have specialized needs."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Risk-Based Repricing Draws FlakOn cyberspace chat lines and consumer-rights phone lines, Capital OneFinancial Corp.  is drawing heat for the policy it calls risk-based repricingand consumer advocates say is just unfair.Since last spring, a couple of dozen consumers have contacted Bankcard Holdersof America to complain about Capital One's strategy of altering interest rateson existing customers' credit lines when periodic credit-report reviews revealcustomers have been issued other credit cards, have assumed new debt, or haveotherwise altered their credit profile."That's not a huge number, but the ones we hear from are irate," reports RuthSusswein, BHA's executive director.  "They're being bumped from 12.9% to24.9%.  If they're a poor credit risk, I don't see how a rate hike is solvingthe problem."Syndicated columnist Jane Bryant Quinn also took Capital One to task forsharply higher rate hikes and the "gobbledygook" explanations given toconsumers for the adverse action.  Quinn cited the case of a fireman whoseinterest rate went from 13.9% to 24.96% despite timely payments.  Shesuggested bank regulators should scrutinize the practice.BHA also has been critical of other issuers for what it terms penalty rates,citing Citibank and AT&T Universal for higher late fees and rates forcardholders who fail to uphold their credit agreement.  But Susswein notes theconcept of increasing rates for existing customers on the basis of creditreviews of other trade lines is different, and she suspects Capital One isn'tthe only issuer doing it.Capital One President Nigel W.  Morris defends the strategy and predicts mostissuers will eventually follow suit.  He says the practice of both raising andlowering rates "on a selective basis" has been done by the former Signet cardcenter since 1989."Down the road, the credit card business will look more like the insurancebusiness, with pricing based on likely outcomes instead of one price foreverybody," Morris says.  "Knowing who to do it to and when to do it iscritical."Whether a trend will develop toward risk-based instead of performance-basedrepricing is open to debate.  One issuer who requested anonymity says higherrates based on poor credit behavior "makes good business sense," but changingrates or fees for existing customers because they are assuming debt withanother lender amounts to "preying on the laziness of the American public,"cardholders who stick with higher-rate cards simply because they don't botherto find better deals.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Tapping the Ethnic MarketCard issuers looking to tap the expanding Hispanic market ought to keep an eyeon Key Federal Savings Bank's new secured Hispanic affinity card.Key Federal, which is partnering with Texas-based SER, a renowned andrespected national nonprofit organization dedicated to creating education,literacy, employment, and job-skills programs for Hispanics, is betting thecard will be a hit in a market in which affinity cards tend to flop.

On Jan.  4, AmericanExpress Co.'s Centurion Bank and Delta Air Lines released details of theirmuch-anticipated Delta SkyMiles Optima frequent-flyer program.  Then, on Jan.9, American Airlines and the Air Travel Card, the airline industry's60-year-old travel payment system, announced the launch of the AmericanAirlines AAsset Card.  It is a cobranded MasterCard that can be used both as acorporate air travel card and multi-purpose travel-and-entertainment card.  Itis being issued under a partnership between Air Travel Card and GE CapitalFinancial Inc.Just what impact these new cards will have on the businesstravel-and-entertainment market is unknown.  But they bring major new playersinto an already fiercely competitive game."Folks realize there's a lot of money being spent on business travel," saysMichele Turkel, president of Spectrum International Consulting Corp.,Scarsdale, N.Y.  "There's going to be a lot of new travel products."Both new cobranded airline cards face an uphill battle.  The Delta SkyMilesOptima card is a late entrant in the frequent-flyer arena, and must offer aunique rewards package to make it stand out from other products alreadywell-established in the marketplace, observers say.  Indeed, American Expressmakes no secret it is trying to lure away cardholders from Visa and MasterCardcobranded frequent-flyer card programs by offering incentives forDelta-related purchases, points that never expire and bonus points forcarrying balances.  "This is the credit card product our customers have beenasking us for," says Brian Kleinberg, AmEx's senior vice president of newproduct development.  It is the first ever cobranded card for Delta, althoughthe airline has long participated in AmEx's Membership Rewards loyalty program(CCN, Sept.  1, 1995).Delta and AmEx expect the card to bring in more than 500,000 new members tothe SkyMiles program over the next five years, says Paul Matsen, Delta's vicepresident of advertising and consumer marketing.  SkyMiles currently has 18million members.The SkyMiles card offers 1.5 SkyMiles for every dollar spent on Delta AirLines and Delta Connection tickets as well as Delta Dream vacations, and onemile per dollar on all other purchases.  The card also differs from otherfrequent-flyer cards in that there is no expiration date on using the pointsas long as the cardholder travels on a Delta or Delta Connection Flight everythree years.  American Express will issue a gold version of the SkyMilesOptima later this year.The Delta SkyMiles card also rewards cardholders for carrying a balance-0.2SkyMiles for each dollar spent on new purchases.  This could give an AmEx aprofitability edge in a market whose customers are notorious for theirreluctance to revolve balances.The SkyMiles card carries an introductory interest rate of 8.9% for the firstsix months and then converts to the prime rate (currently 8.5%) plus 9.4%.The card carries a $55 annual fee which is waived for all primary AmEx green,gold and platinum card holders.  The annual cap on SkyMiles accumulation is$60,000 in charges.  Bonuses for Delta purchases are exempt from the limit."This card was really developed for people who fly Delta, want to earnfrequent-flyer miles and like the financial flexibility of being able to carrya balance from time to time," says Mary Miller, AmEx's senior vice presidentof partnership sales and relationships.  She says extra SkyMiles are awardedto revolvers not to encourage cardholders to carry a balance but to compensaterevolvers because "they are carrying a heavier financial load" because ofinterest payments.  "We thought we'd give back something," she says.  "Wedon't think it encourages anybody to revolve if they weren't revolvingotherwise."But some observers say most non-revolvers wouldn't be interested in the DeltaSkyMiles card because they can earn points on AmEx's other charge cardsthrough its Membership Rewards program.  "If I already have MembershipRewards, what's the added benefit for convenience users?"  asks Anne MorganMoore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based consultingfirm.However, American Express views the Delta SkyMiles card as a complementaryproduct to its charge cards, Miller adds.  "Our research tells us people liketo segregate their spending, particularly business travelers, our core targetgroup," she says.And though charge card holders who participate in Membership Rewards also canaccumulate frequent-flyer miles on Delta, Miller says the SkyMiles Optimaisn't expected to harm that program.  "They're different value propositions,"she says, noting that Membership Rewards is aimed at cardholders who don'trevolve balances.There are mixed reviews on the SkyMiles Optima, with some observers sayingAmEx missed the opportunity to develop a truly unique frequent-flyer product."I think it's terribly disappointing," Turkel says.  "They waited 10 years tocome out with this product and they come out with something that won't breakthrough the clutter."But others disagree.  "American Express definitely pulled off a coup," saysJames L.  Accomando, president of Fairfield, Conn.-based Accomando ConsultingInc.  He notes that the Delta SkyMiles Optima is "very rich" in benefitscompared to other frequent-flyer cards.  For example, most other programsoffer only one point for every dollar spent and put a three-year-limit forredeeming frequent-flyer miles.In addition, the $55 annual fee is comparable to those on other AmEx productswhile it falls in the middle range of what other issuers charge for theirfrequent-flyer cards, Accomando says.  But the richness of the benefits couldprove to be an Achilles' Heel in the long run, he adds, saying, "a programlike this is very expensive to manage.  The users are transactors-they're notnecessarily people who roll over balances."The Delta SkyMiles card is one more step in American Express' goal of reaching$30 billion in outstandings by the year 2000.The SkyMiles Optima is one of two cobranded offerings from American Express.Last October, AmEx introduced the no-fee Hilton Optima card (CCN, Sept.  15,1995).  Miller says there may be some overlap between the two cards' basessince both target frequent travelers.The SkyMiles Optima card was officially launched Jan.  5 with a television,print and outdoor advertising as well as a direct-mail campaign.  Delta andDelta Connection carriers operate more than 4,800 flights daily to 297 citiesin 48 states and 29 countries around the world.  American Express in lateAugust announced it would launch a cobranded card with Delta, but didn'trelease details of the program until a Jan.  4 press conference.But frequent-flyer card programs are only one area seeing increasedcompetition.  Corporate air card programs-in which a corporation is billedcentrally for all it airline expenses-also are facing some new competition.Through an agreement with GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiaryof GE Capital Services, Air Travel Card will be able provides its seven majorU.S.  airlines that issue the card with the banking, billing and reportingservices needed to offer a comprehensive cobranded card fortravel-and-entertainment expenses, says Charles B.  Fischer, Air Travel Cardmanaging director.  American Airlines-which also offers the AAdvantagefrequent-flyer card issued by Citibank-is the first air carrier to offer thecard.More than 100,000 corporations, including half of the Fortune 500, use the AirTravel Card.  More than 200 airlines accept it.Air Travel Card sought a partnership with GE Capital because of airlines'requests for a multi-purpose card that could serve as a corporate air, T&E andcalling card, Fischer says.Under the program, the participating airline will do central billing for theair charges while GE Capital will handle billing for all non-air expenditures,says Mark Meythaler, American Airlines manager of credit card marketing.Billing services can be customized if corporations prefer to have all chargeson one bill.  The cobranded T&E market is likely to get more crowded beforethe year is out.  A recent Synergistics' report notes that more and moreissuers are looking to frequent-flyer programs as a means of enhancing cardsto compete with the proliferation of value-added cards on the market."I think we're going to see many more cobranded cards," says Randy Petersen,editor and publisher of InsideFlyer.  "The Delta program is only the second ofat least two to three more cobranded card to be launched by the end of 1996."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996Worsening Credit Quality Casts a Pall Over the New YearAnalysts predicted a decline in consumer credit quality most of last year.Now for a not-so-happy New Year's gift:  Those predictions are coming true.Example:  Moody's Investors Service's most recent index of securities backedby card receivables shows U.S.  consumer credit quality in the third quarterof 1995 slipping, the first quarterly dip in three years.According to Moody's, chargeoffs in the pool of securities it rates rose to4.14% of outstandings in the third quarter from 3.99% in the third quarter of1994.  For September, the chargeoff rate increased to 4.27% of outstandingsfrom 3.83% in September 1994, the sharpest year-over-year increase sinceJanuary 1992.  Moody's tracks $109 billion in securitized outstandings from 74issuers.Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst Edward O.  Bankole blames the booston the recent upturn in consumer bankruptcy filings.  Nonbusiness bankruptcyfilings in the third quarter rose for the second consecutive quarter, to220,945, from 195,308 in the third quarter of 1994, a 13.1% increase,according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts.  Some observerssay personal bankruptcy filings could hit or pass 900,000 when figures for1995 are tallied.  That would be the most since 1992, when there were 900,874filings.Delinquencies in Moody's pool of securitized receivables averaged 4.08% in thethird quarter of 1995, compared with 4.37% a year earlier, Moody's says.  ButBankole says the rate is distorted by the continuing rapid growth in creditcard loans, which reached $299 billion in June 1995, up 28% from June 1994,according to the data from Visa, MasterCard and Discover.The trend is being noticed by other observers.  According to the AmericanBankers Association, total delinquent dollars outstanding rose to 4.21% ofoutstandings in the third quarter, from 3.58% in the second quarter and from2.90% in the third quarter of 1994.Some industry observers blame the increase in delinquencies on the surge inbankruptcies as well as the continued aggressive marketing of credit cardoffers.The number of personal bankruptcy filings for 1995 will near historic levels,Stuart Feldstein, president of Budd Lake, N.J.-based SMR Research Inc..  Thisis troubling to issuers because bankruptcies account for roughly 40% ofchargeoffs.  According to the latest figures from the Administrative Office ofthe U.S.  Courts, there were 832,415 filings between Oct.  1, 1994 and Sept.30, 1995.Some point to increasing consumer debt loads at a time of slow wage growth asanother factor in rising delinquencies.  The amount of revolving credit alonerose 19.1% in the third quarter over the year-earlier period, according toFederal Reserve figures.  Meanwhile, wage growth, and thus the ability to payoff some of that debt, rose only 5.1% during the same period.Intense competition among issuers also has been driving down credit quality asthey scrape to get their cards in the hands of as many consumers as possible.In the push to keep portfolios humming, some issuers are relaxing theirstandards and issuing cards to riskier customers, observers say..Other observers say the continuing decline in credit quality is a correctionfor the rapid growth of card portfolios in the early 1990s.  Chargeoff rates"are seeking their proper levels," says Michael E.  Staten, director of PurdueUniversity's Credit Research Center.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996The Strange Phenomenon Of Overpaying Credit Card BillsThe practice of overpayment of credit card bills came under scrutiny recentlywhen fraudsters allegedly used the tactic to defraud 120 issuers out of about$40 million(CCN, Dec.  15, 1995).  Issuers say the practice is longstandingbut rare, and they say there are legitimate reasons cardholders would makepayments in excess of their credit limits.Overpayment can expose an issuer to fraud.  Because of banking laws, issuersare required to post the checks and credit the funds as soon as they arereceived.  This allows the crooks to take large cash advances and go onspending sprees before the checks are returned as insufficient.But there is a small percentage of cardholders who occasionally will make apayment over their credit limits, issuers say.  This is usually to preventgetting behind on payments or to anticipate purchases that might exceed creditlimits while traveling over extended periods.Industry sources have no figures on how many legitimate customers pay theiraccounts above the credit limit.  "It's very rare," says a spokesperson forJacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T Universal Card Services.But is there really a need for customers to increase their credit limits byoverpaying?  No, says Chris N.  Theoharides, principal of TheoharidesConsulting, Massapequa, N.Y.  Banks have made it easy to get credit lineincreases thanks to toll-free numbers.  And risk scores allow banks to quicklyjudge if the cardholder is worthy of an increase.  Adds Bill Dobbins, vicepresident of fraud operations at Chase Manhattan Bank:  "Why give an issuermoney that's not collecting interest?  You can pay while you're away throughfund transfers or have someone handle your affairs."Issuers interviewed say they will accept an overpayment-but with caution.Cincinnati-based Star Banc Corp.  allows cardholders to overpay and have abalance, says Senior Vice President Collin G.  McKenny."But we watch that because that's one of the tricks of the bad guys," McKennysays.AT&T says it handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis.  "If a cardholderwon't be where their mail is and will be doing some spending, we ask them tolet us know ahead of time," the spokesperson says.One indication that a prepayment is legitimate is that a bill couponaccompanies it, says the AT&T spokesperson.  But depending on how far over thecredit limit the check is, Chase, AT&T and Advanta say they may call thecardholder's bank ahead of time before posting the funds.If a check is received above a credit limit, Key Federal Savings Bank willpost the check but hold some of the money from availability until the bank is"reasonably certain" the check will clear the bank from which it is written,says Robert M.  Bouza, president of operations.  The move is done only incertain cases where the customer is believed to be high-risk and is notagainst banking laws.  "If a check bounces, you've given away the availablebalance-plus," he says.  "You're out of a heck of a lot of money."Chase's Dobbins says the bank will credit the account, but also will call thebank the check is issued from to check the validity of the payment, he says.Overpayment is not always a prelude to fraud, but it should set off warningbells, depending on how far over a customer's credit limit a check is, Dobbinssays.  Fraud experts say a sure warning sign is a check that is mailed with nocoupon in an overnight mail envelope."Someone with a $5,000 credit limit that owes us $1,000 and pays us $1,000isn't unusual," Dobbins says.  "But someone who owes us $1,000, but pays us$10,000 causes a lot of bells to go off," Dobbins says.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996Behind the Growth of Penalties For Rental Car No-ShowsVisa U.S.A., American Express Travel Related Services Co.  and Dean Witter,Discover & Co.  all are now offering guaranteed car-rental reservation andno-show penalties for rental companies during peak periods.  Problem:  Theseappear to be services no one needs.Visa and AmEx rolled out their services in December.  A Discover spokespersonsays the issuer has offered similar services since last May.  But no majorrental companies have signed on to any of the three companies' plans, thoughspokespersons from Alamo, Value and Thrifty car-rental agencies say they areconsidering them.Ironically, Visa and AmEx say the services are in response to requests fromthe car-rental industry trying to combat a chronic no-show problem.  Someindustry estimates peg no-shows at as much as 70% of reservations in somecities during peak periods, such as three-day holiday weekends.AnticipationHowever, executives from Visa and AmEx say they are confident that companieswill climb on board soon.Participation in the programs is voluntary.  Under the services, car-rentalcompanies first must agree to offer guaranteed reservations to customers alongwith penalty fees.  Customers then would be offered the choice of making astandard reservation as they currently do, or guaranteeing a reservation underthe new guidelines.  If a customer accepts the guaranteed reservation, he thenagrees to authorize Visa, AmEx or Discover to charge penalty fees if he failsto show up or call to cancel within a specified time period.  It is the rentalcompany's responsibility to charge the fee.Under Visa's program, cardholders who guarantee their car rentals during peakperiods with a Visa card, are guaranteed a car will be waiting at theirdestination for up to eight hours from their expected arrival time.  In theevent of an overbooking, the rental agency is required to rent a comparablevehicle from another agency and deliver it to the cardholder.  Customers mustcancel eight hours prior to pick-up to avoid a charge for up to a one-dayrental.  In case of a flight cancellation, cardholders have up to one hourprior to the scheduled pick-up time to cancel.American Express offers its customers similar guarantees..  Cardholders willbe assured a car will be held for them for at least 12 hours from theirscheduled arrival time.  If the agency overbooks, the rental agency mustprovide a comparable vehicle from another firm.AmEx cardholders must cancel within 48 hours prior to their scheduled pickuptime to avoid as much as a two-day rental charge.  If the customer's flight iscanceled, the penalty is waived.Discover officials would not discuss their services, except to say a car wouldbe guaranteed for 24 hours and that a customer would be charged up to a24-hour rental fee if he didn't show up without a cancellation.Bad FeelingsBut a major obstacle to car-rental agencies implementing the new services isthat penalties may create ill will with customers.  "If a business travelergets a flight canceled, they have to make a lot more calls than to just therental agencies," says Hertz Corp.  Vice President of Governmental AffairsJoseph N.  Russo.  Rental agencies currently do not impose penalty fees forno-shows who reserve conventional cars.  Hertz is not opposed to penalty feesbut objects to the idea of having such fees mandated by credit card companies,Russo says.  Hertz and Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis impose no-show penaltiesfor so-called special equipment, such as convertibles or four-wheel-drivevehicles that are high in demand.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996A Post-Holiday Lull in Direct-Mail CampaignsMost issuers stayed on the sidelines in the waning days of 1995 and theopening days of 1996.

And in public.  Last month,Diners took a swipe at T&E giant American Express Co.'s revamped MembershipRewards program in ads that ran in major newspapers.The ad headline boasts, "If your rewards program is missing two majorairlines, it's probably still green," and bears a facsimile of an AmEx greencharge card.  Though not naming the carriers, the ad refers to American andUnited airlines, which participate in Diners Club's loyalty mileage program,but not in AmEx's."The renamed American Express rewards program promises the frequent businesstraveler 'a world of choices," the ad reads.  "The truth is, it doesn't evencover the continent."Standing UpDiners executives say the ad is part of a more aggressive marketing campaignthe issuer is launching.  Additionally, they say the new name AmEx chose forits loyalty program last year-Membership Rewards-is a little too close in nameto their Club Rewards program.  And they want everyone to know it.  "When AmExcomes out and copies our name, we have to stand up and be counted," a Dinersspokesperson says.  "We wanted to remind readers that AmEx has an inferiorprogram."Diners Club finished the year with about seven million cardholders and chargevolume around $25 billion.  That pales in comparison to the 37 million AmExcardholders and charge volume of roughly $150 billion.The Best?AmEx executives defend their loyalty program, saying it offers cardholdersmuch more variety and utility.  The program has been honored as the bestinternational program for flexibility and variety by InsideFlyer, a ColoradoSprings, Colo.-based travel magazine.  "We're confident our program is thebest," an AmEx spokesperson says.  "The fact that it is recognized by premiertravel publications speaks for itself."The Diners Club ad and its aggressive stance is unusual, but laudable for theissuer, says Randy Petersen, InsideFlyer's editor and publisher.  "There havebeen some changes in attitude and they are for the better," he says of Diners'new ad campaign.  "I'm a big fan of AmEx, but Diners' comparison is true."While Diners' ad makes a legitimate product distinction, it could backfire,says Richard N.  Kimmel, principal of Kimmel & Co., a Chicago-basedadvertising firm.  The ad makes Diners appear petty , "and being petty doesnot look good," he says."If I had an American Express Card, I might be interested in the airlines thataren't participating, but the ad doesn't tell me," Kimmel says.  "I don'tthink this ad does them a lot of good.  It sounds desperate because it isstrident, untrustworthy and irritating."Won't Back DownThe Diners spokesperson denies the ad is an act of desperation.  "Not at all,"the spokesperson says.  But Diners will not back down from American Expresseven though it has a fraction of AmEx's advertising budget.  "Our pockets arenot as deep as theirs so we have to muster up," the spokesperson says.The chances of AmEx bringing American and United into its fold may be slim.American has a long-standing contractual relationship for the purchase of theairline miles offered through Diners Club cards and the Citi-American Airlinescobranded card.  United has a similar cobranding arrangement with FirstChicago, but could join AmEx when the current contract expires, Petersen says.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996Carlson, Household Become Traveling CompanionsSince 1991, Salinas, Calif.-based Household Credit Services, the card-issuingarm of Household International, has steadily cultivated its corporate bankcard portfolio.  The program has grown to more than 126,000 cards at thebeginning of 1995, making it the second largest corporate bank card file, froma paltry 4,200 at the end of 1991.  Now Household has taken another step someobservers say will give its program a major boost and make a splash on thetravel-and-entertainment scene:  the issuing of a cobranded corporate cardwith Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the Minneapolis-based travel agency giant.The card, appropriately dubbed The Business Card, is the first corporate cardoffered by a travel agency, and one of the first cobranded corporate travelcards, Household executives say.  Initially, it will be marketed to companieswith commercial travel accounts of $1 million or more.  A version for smallercorporate accounts will be rolled out in mid- to late-1996.Tracking ExpensesThe Business Card will be a general-purpose bank card, available as aMasterCard or Visa.  It will offer a variety of spending limits and travelinsurance packages.  Companies can either use computer modules to compileexpense reports from the card in-house or outsource it to Carlson.  The feefor each card and interest rate will be announced later.As part of the venture, Household and Carlson Wagonlit will produce a jointproprietary management information system (MIS) data base that they claim willoffer companies more detailed information than other corporate cards aboutairlines, hotels and car rentals employees use.  Like traditional expensereports, it will allow companies to track costs as well as identify the mostfrequently used travel vendors, says Ron Muratore, director of planning andcommunications for Household's credit card group.  "It is a management toolthat captures more data and presents businesses with a bigger and betterpicture on how their money is spent," he says.Carlson Wagonlit executives say the new card will offer more information andbetter integration with a cli-ent's expense reporting system than competitors,but would not discuss specifics.  "Our whole plan is smooth integration withother corporate travel systems as well as providing the information that'sneeded to manage the travel expense activity," says Terry L.  Thelemann,Carlson Wagonlit director of marketing product services.  "We don't want ourcustomers to jump through a lot of hoops to get the advantage of the card."But executives from Citicorp Diners Club and American Express Co.  say thereis nothing new about the Household-Carlson venture.  Spokespersons from bothcompanies say they provide detailed, yet easy-to-interpret MIS reports andsoftware allowing companies to receive the reports on-line.Major PlayerSome observers say the new card could swiftly be a major player in the T&Earena.  "Anytime two giants like Household and Carlson join, it will drawattention," says Donald J.  Auriemma, chairman of the Westbury, N.Y.-basedAuriemma Consulting Group.

Expect scoring models to be used as customer and totalrelationship management tools rather than just as risk assessmentmethods, experts say.       Scoring also will gain acceptance in previously uncharteredwaters, such as the mortgage lending market.       But industry experts tell us you need to be prepared forlegislative and implementational obstacles related to scoring.     Concern over consumer privacy also may prompt more patrolling ofthis technology by regulators.  Creditors and scoring vendors shouldpursue consumer education programs to ease fears over scoring toolsand to ensure that new legislation will not restrict their businesspractices. Evolving Scoring Methods     Creditors can expect a change in business focus in 1996 fromcredit risk management to customer relationship management, accordingto John Coffman of Credit Strategy Management (CSM) of Atlanta.  Forexample, many creditors now  are starting to use data and predictivemodels to manage the entire customer relationship, includingretention, relationship optimization, product design and targeting.     Creditors need to understand that risk management by itself isnot sufficient to ensure optimal profitability, and that themanagement of risk must be integrated with the management of otheraspects of customer behavior, according to Coffman.       Scoring's use is being encouraged by the Washington, D.C.-basedFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac).  Freddie Mac issued afour-page letter last summer supporting scoring practices by lendersfor residential mortgages.      A few months later, Fannie Mae, formerly known as the FederalNational Mortgage Association, put out an eight-page letter thatencouraged lenders to use credit scores in the application process.       The moves by both organizations have prompted new entrants intothe scoring arena -- the technology no longer will be used by onlycredit card companies, but also by mortgage lenders and various otherplayers in that market, said Marty Abrams, director of privacy andconsumer policy at TRW of Orange, Calif.     "It really has changed the way mortgage [lending] has beenconducted, because now we have an endorsement of scoring by a quasi-governmental agency," said Chet Wiermanski, vice president ofacquisition and risk management services for Chicago-based Trans Union.More Work Needed To Educate Consumers, Regulators     Abrams believes increased use of automated processing throughoutthe marketplace -- not just credit models, but response andprofitability models as well -- will create greater interest on howthose models work.  "I think that this is the first in what will be afairly broad discussion into the whole sense of how models work, andhow they affect consumers," he said.     Wiermanski also sees a need for stepped-up consumer education tooffset critics' fears that scores will be used to reject low scorers.     Score developers and users will need to do more than educateconsumers on how they determine scores -- they'll need to educatebusinesses also.  "There is going to be an incredible use ofstatistical modeling of data to determine who it makes sense to dobusiness with, and who it doesn't.  And that is going to create a lotof controversy," Abrams said.     If the industry isn't proactive in educating consumers,regulators may force it to be with new rules or legislation.       The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, wasconsidering last year whether to require creditors and bureaus todisclose risk scores as part of a consumer's credit report file. After much industry feedback, the FTC decidedagainst mandating a score disclosure.  "That, to me, was a keydecision, considering the complexity of risk scores and proprietaryscore cards on the part of credit marketers and credit grantors,"Abrams said.Consumer Education Issues    The decision may create some key consumer education dilemmas inthe coming year.  "We still have to find a way to help consumersunderstand how they can better prepare themselves to be good creditconsumers," Abrams said. In addition, creditors and scoring vendorslikely will struggle with regulators' concern over "disparatetreatment" and its relation to scoring, said Fran Lyons, principal orScoring Solutions Inc. in Atlanta.      Regulators fear that consumers in protected categories will beturned down for mortgage loans because they are scored based on theircredit history, causing the disparate treatment of a protected group.Total Relationship Management    The industry will have to educate regulators that scores do notresult in disparate treatment.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggeststhat automated decision-making is much fairer to consumers thanjudgmental decision-making, Abrams said.      Coffman thinks the industry as a whole will continue to move inthe direction of total relationship management:  "It has caught onquite quickly."      He cited recent articles on AT&T Universal Card as an example ofthis trend.  "You're seeing more and more companies recognizing thatthey need to integrate the management of these two functions:  riskmanagement and customer management [see related story, p. 8]," Coffmansaid.Success Strategies    One key to success in the credit management arena will be thecreation of a comprehensive and easily accessed customer database. Many creditors already have begun creating customer databases for thispurpose, and the trend will continue, Coffman said.      Using a comprehensive customer database, along with modelingtools, will allow the creditor to manage all customer relationships.      The database might include current and historical financial dataas well as transaction data.  It also should include external dataabout customers, such as credit history and other demographic orlifestyle data.  (Marty Abrams, TRW, 214/390-3659; John Coffman, CSM,404/266-1242; Fran Lyons, Scoring Solutions, 770/988-264; ChetWiermanski, Trans Union, 312/466-7794.) Scoring 101     More and more creditors and scoring vendors will be forced toeducate consumers as to the ABC's of scoring, experts tell us.       But what should you focus on when developing a consumer educationprogram?  TRW instructs its representatives to focus on five "fairinformation values" when interacting with consumers:   *  partnership between TRW and its customers;   *  fairness;   *  balance;    *  education; and   *  dialogue. Advances in Scoring     Consider these latest scoring and credit management tools fromindustry vendors:*  TRW and Fair, Isaac are working together to offer small businesslenders a way to download and score TRW business credit reports withFair, Isaac's Small Business Scoring Service (SBSS).  SBSS, acombination of software and pooled-data scorecards for evaluatingsmall business credit applications, provides an automated interface toTRW Business Information Services' database of business creditreports.     (Fair, Isaac, 800/999-2955; TRW, 800/854-7201.) *  Equifax offers RE-APPEAR, an automated notification deliveryservice for the collections industry.  Users of the service selectcriteria so that credit files of consumers who have collectionspending with the user and have disappeared or "skipped" are flagged. When new or different address or inquiry activity is posted to thefile, RE-APPEAR automatically notifies the customer of the name,address and phone number of the credit grantor who queried the fileand who can then provide updated information on the consumer. (Equifax, 800/879-1025.) *  Trans Union's Revenue Projection Model (RPM), a two-year modeltypically used to predict likely revenue to be generated fromprescreened solicitation prospects, now can be used to make inactiveaccounts, low-balance revolving accounts and seasonal accounts moreprofitable, according to Trans Union officials.  Research conducted byFair, Isaac, the developer of the model, shows that RPM also can beused to rank order existing customers based on likely revenue generation in the 12 months following scoring.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996TIPS FOR MANAGING YOUR NEXT BANKRUPTCY COLLECTION AUDIT    A careful audit of your outside bankruptcy collection agent canhelp improve bankruptcy accounts management and increase profits.  Toaide in this endeavor, CRMR elicited advice from one independentconsultant, Raymond Bell Jr. of Abington, Pa.     Bell spent many years managing a bankruptcy department for amajor credit card company and has audited both collection andbankruptcy accounts.  He directed the handling of consumer bankruptcycases at a national law firm and now is a full-time, independentconsultant.     If you do nothing else when auditing your outside bankruptcycollection agency, your time will be well-spent reviewing the finaltrustee accounting reports to ensure that your claims have been paid,Bell said.     "The final trustee accounting report is the most important audittool in ensuring that you have received correct disbursements from thebankruptcy estate," he explained.     This report will indicate whether accounts have been transferredto a different bankruptcy type, if payments were recorded improperly,or if the trustee made a mistake, he added.     Require your agent to provide a complete account listings forChapter 7, 11 and 13 cases that are active, with data fields for thefollowing:*  Account assignment date;*  Date account information was placed in the agent's system;*  Date the request for notice was sent;*  Date the proof of claim was sent;*  Date the proof of claim was received by the court of the trustee;*  Date of court adversary proceeding;  *  Chapter 13 planned percent payback;*  Claim balance filed with the court;*  Last payment date, payment amount and accumulative amount of       total payment received.     You should review the rationale used to generate the reports, andask that the agent retain the account listing in an extract computeruntil your audit is completed.  This will allow you to subsortinformation as needed quickly and your requests will not slow down theagent's system during business hours, Bell said.     Bell had other suggestions to follow during an audit:*   Establish a pattern of follow-up frequency and criteria for cases.For xample, how many missed payments should trigger a follow-up callor isit for Chapter 13 cases of a certain amount of credit?*   Internally select segments of cases from each type of bankruptcyfor random spot checking.*   Using at least three remittance reports within a 12-month period,test for payments on at least 50 percent of the accounts.*   Review your contract provisions and take a copy with you forreference during your audit.*   Review your prior audit commentary and the agents response.  Takecopies to the audit with you for reference purposes.On-site Review    Bell said the first place he visits during an on-site review isthe lunch- and meeting-room bulletin boards.  These tell a lot abouthow the agency communicates and whether it is up-to-date on issues, headded.    While at the agency, perform audit functions without interruptionand do not leave notes unattended.  If you need to ask questions,which can intimidate agency staff, make a concise list and be sure amanager is present at this stage in the review, Bell advised.     While on-site Bell suggests reviewing the following:*   Licenses.  Are they current and do they apply to state provisionsgoverning an agency?  In cases of an attorney, has this person passedthe bar in the state in which he/she is working?  Additionally, theattorney must have renewed the license in each state of practice andmust meet the state's continuing legal education requirements.*   Written procedures.  The policy guidelines that pertain to youraccount should be up to date.*   Staffing.  Additions, deletions or administrative promotions asthey relate to relate to your account should be explained thoroughly.*   Training.  In-house training, organizational structure andfrequency of internal case reviews by management should be adequate.Post Review    After the on-site review, be sure to provide the client with anoverview highlighting the negative and positive aspects of your reportbefore you leave.  This discussion should be private, Bell said.      Provide the agency with your audit summary.  This ensures thereis agreement to proceed with any corrective action and theimplementation and completion time of desired action.  "The agencyshould be required to respond, in writing, by a pre-agreed time," Bellsaid.      Common problems that may affect agency turnaround includeunorganized agency files, unreceived documents and payments, Belladded.    To keep bankruptcy proceedings running smoothly, Bell suggestedseveral in-house tweaks.  For example, establish tracking abilitiesfor electronic and paper referrals to the agency and require the agentacknowledge referrals.  Additionally, time and date stamp allbankruptcy correspondence before sending it to the agency.  This willaid in auditing the agency's procedures, he said.    Also, establish computer models to predict cash flow andprojected return on Chapter 13 cases that can be compared to actualin-coming, Bell said.    Internally track agent support requests listing the nature antype of request every quarter.  This will help you be more proactivewith this information in the future, Bell said.    Lastly, implement a training program for your bankruptcy andaudit staffs to ensure future audits run smoothly, Bell said. (Raymond P. Bell, private consultant, 800/735-0481.)

Prospective condominium buyers in a 700-unit development in ParkPlace, N.J., now can access NatWest loan officers viavideoconferencing directly from the model home.  However, consumersmust finish the paperwork at the branch.    "Typically 25 percent [of people inquiring about mortgages] willfill out the application.  We are running over 50 percent when they gofill out the application at the model home," said Andrew Demeo,director of interactive marketing for NatWest.    Videoconferencing allows consumers to see NatWest loanrepresentatives and view information on the television screen whiletalking on the phone.    "It is a remote delivery and they are not pressured by being inthe room with an individual," said Demeo.  "They feel in total controland that seems to be important to the consumers.  It gets to ourculture as Americans.  When a salesperson comes and talks to us inperson, we let them finish their sales pitch.  However, thesocialization of how we deal with telemarketers is different.  Mostpeople tend not to stay on the line.  If you can offer that type ofcontrol to the customer, yet offer as much personal contact as a faceto face [conversation] and make it fun, it works."How it Works    Once consumers have toured the model home, they can enter theliving room, turn on a television set there and place a callsimultaneously to a NatWest representative.  The consumer can see astill graphic of the representative in the top one-fifth of the screenon a proprietary pay-per-view channel.    The remaining four-fifths of the tv screen is reserved for movinggraphics.  For example, customers may want to see in graphic form howpayments for a 15-year adjustable mortgage compare to a 15-year fixedmortgage.  The NatWest representative can input the necessaryinformation on the screen and a graphical presentation will appear atthe model home.    NatWest is testing full-motion video for the service and planssoon to offer standard personal computer (PC)-to-PC modemcommunication.  The bank also is preparing a videoconferencing serviceover the Internet.    Demeo would not reveal the cost of the product, but said it "is alot less than you think."  He explained that is a matter of deployinga pc and television set in a cabinet.      Demeo advises lenders to think of videoconferencing as anopportunity help consumers find products which are appropriate fortheir specific needs.  "The key element is presenting conciseinformation as well as [having the consumers] feel like they aremeeting somebody," Demeo said.    After the homebuyers decide which loans are right for them, theNatWest representatives will transmit a closing bill and title righton the tv screen.  In addition, NatWest can estimate the closing andtax costs for the consumers.  The application cannot be completed on-line.  However, consumers are taken line-by-line down the applicationso that they will have all the necessary information when they visit aNatWest branch to complete the application.    NatWest launched the service in the first quarter of 1995 afterDemeo's marketing staff worked closely with officials at the QVC homeshopping channel to learn how to concisely present complicatedinformation via video.    For example, QVC warned Demeo that customers need to beentertained more in a videoconferencing presentation as they are lessapt to just sit and listen when they can simply press an off button.

Creditors should establish written policies on handlingdelinquent payments from certain consumer segments, credit consultantstell CRMR.  This is especially true for creditors that servicegovernment employees, in light of the recent lengthy federalgovernment shutdown which left many employees without paychecks forweeks. Consider these strategies, offered by some industryconsultants, when developing a government employee policy:  *  Review on a case-by-case basis. Examine each case for unusualcircumstances before penalizing an account or initiating collectionefforts.    *  Instruct customers to contact you. Consumers may assume you areaware of their situation.  Statements and bills should adviseconsumers to contact a credit department and explain any paymentdifficulties.   *  Consider special programs. Lenders can establish specialunsecured loan programs with no- or low interest rates for federalworkers affected by a government shutdown.  These programs may not be very lucrative, however, they will inspire long-term customerloyalty, experts say.

That's the lesson evident in the business' latest majordownsizing, AT&T Corp.'s plan to lay off 40,000 employees as part ofits efforts to reorganize by 1997.    More than 200 of the people already accepting AT&T's voluntaryseverance    packages work in the Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&TUniversal Card division, a spokesperson confirmed.

Several of them already have been approached by other issuers, says one credit executive who asked not to be named.  High Demand    These executives are in such high demand because of their abilityto implement leading-edge technologies, such as statistical analysis,behavior scoring and neural networks, the source said.     A recent survey by Allard Associates of San Francisco, anexecutive recruiter in the credit card and banking industries,indicated that 75 percent of issuers surveyed would be adding staff in1996.  Respondents said many of these people would be in the riskmanagement area.

Tim Pryor, director of NAFCU's regulatory compliance office, toldCredit Union Accountant the IRS' rule is significant for credit unionsbecause it eases the paperwork burden in two areas: when bankruptcies arefiled and when a debt is discharged by state law.        The amount of debt written off isn't the most important aspect, thedebt loss will be the same despite this rule, Pryor said. The rule is mostsignificant because it reduces the amount the paperwork, he said.        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, requirefinancial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C informationreturns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders becausethey say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven inexcess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.        Lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating theneed to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS forseveral years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need toforgive debt.        Pryor said the final rule is "a very big issue for credit unionsbecause the previous rule would have required a credit union to file a 1099when a debtor went bankrupt." And since bankruptcies are on the rise andexpected to increase, credit unions would have been inundated withpaperwork. (See related story page 4).        According to Wayne Winegarden, a NAFCU staff economist, "a rise inbankruptcies since December 1994 is evident in the call report data, andother preliminary data supports the idea that the December 1995bankruptcies will increase even further."        The previous rule, Pryor said, would also have required a creditunion to file a 1099 whenever a debt was discharge by state law--somethinghe said is next to impossible for a credit union to assess. He said it'sdifficult for a credit union to figure out the statute of limitations oneach debt and the actual date the debt was discharged. "Operation of statelaw only applies when it is raised as a defense," he said.        The final regulation says that disclosure to the IRS of debtforgiveness will be required only when one of the following "identifiableevents" occur:         The failure of the borrower to make any payments on a debt forthree years with no significant collection activity by the financialinstitution.         A contractual modification or discharge between the financialinstitution and the borrower.         Discharges in bankruptcy of business loans, but not for consumerloans.         The successful assertion in court by the borrower of the statuteof limitations as a bar to collection.         The cancellation of a debt by receivership, foreclosure, orprobate proceedings.         The expiration of the statutory period for commencing a proceedingon a judgment.        Credit unions must comply with these requirements for dischargesoccurring on or after Dec. 22, 1996.        It's important for credit unions to note, however, that the IRS hasprovided several exceptions to the list of "identifiable events," saidCornelia Schneider, the National Association of Federal Credit Union'sassociate director of taxation and accounting.        "Specifically, discharges in bankruptcy are not reportable unlessthe credit union knows that the member incurred the indebtedness forbusiness or investment purposes," Schneider said. "A credit union will nothave to report a discharge of indebtedness upon the expiration of thestatute of limitations if a member's affirmative defense is upheld in afinancial judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding and the period forappealing has expired. In addition, the final regulations do not requireinterest to be included in the reporting of amounts discharged."Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996SAR, CTR EXEMPTION LIST MIGHT EMERGE MARCH 1The new Suspicious Activity Report form, reported by sources lastweek to be due out by Feb. 1, will most likely come out March 1 at theearliest, and might contain a threshold for money laundering, a Treasuryofficial told Credit Union Accountant.        Banks will begin using the forms when the final regulation becomeseffective.        The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also hopes torelease a preliminary Currency Transaction Reporting exemption process inconjunction with the SAR.        As proposed, the SAR had no threshold for suspicious activitiesinvolving money laundering. As a final rule, a FinCEN source said on Jan.17 that, in response to comments received from the industry, Treasury mayinclude an as-yet unspecified threshold for money laundering. This is theonly threshold the regulators say will possibly change from what has beenpreviously proposed.        The SAR, to be administered by FinCEN and federal regulators, isproposed to be used to report suspicious transactions of bank fraud,insider abuse, etc. involving a specific customer if $5,000 or more isinvolved. If no particular individual can be identified, the threshold willincrease to $25,000.        The form replaces the old Criminal Referral Form and a box on theCurrency Transaction Report. The form will be required to be filed withFinCEN only rather than with a number of agencies.        "It is unlikely that the new SAR will be out by Feb. 1," said aFinCEN official. "Each of the agencies has to finalize its own regulation,the database which accepts the suspicious transactions has to be up andrunning, and the form has to be ready. FinCEN's reg is in the clearanceprocess, as well as are the other agencies' regs, I believe. The formitself is close to being final and the database is operational.        "The instructions on the form, telling you when and what to fileare subject to change, since the instructions are driven by the reg itself,which has still to be issued as final."        A preliminary exemption list for Currency Transaction Reporting isalso expected to be released in conjunction with the SAR release, said anagency official.        "There is a two phase approach," said the source. "The easy stuffwill be a (not-specified-yet) existing list--something like the stockexchange list that people can refer to by opening up a newspaper and listsbusinesses that are already exemptible under current regulation. Phase two,the rest of the exemptions of local places, we are still working out. Myguess is that the second list will come as a proposed rulemaking, up forcomment."        "Law enforcement, regulators and the industry all agree that thereare too many CTRs, but we need to finalize the process, which will reduceburden, without impeding law enforcement." --Lisa TroshinskyBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996EXAMINERS GET LIBERTY IN CUSO LIMITSNCUA has said that for purposes of CUSO loan and investmentlimitations, an examiner can decide on a case-by-case basis to value a CUSOeither at original cash investment or by an equity method of accounting.        The regulator said even though these limitations are statutorilyderived, it gives its examiners leeway because statutory and regulatoryhistory provide no clear answers.        Michael L. Miller, assistant vice president for compliance atIndiana FCU, Indianapolis, wrote to NCUA Sept. 11 and asked severalquestions concerning the loan and investment limitations for CUSOs inRegion IV.        Miller first asked if the 1% investment limit in a CUSO is based onthe original cash investment or the equity method. He explained that inJanuary 1994, Indiana FCU invested $100,000 in Indiana Members FinancialServices Inc., a wholly owned CUSO that is the sole owner of three otherCUSOs--a mortgage company, a vehicle leasing company and a collectioncompany. During the first year, Miller said, IMFS lost $36,000. He asked ifIFCU's CUSO should use the original investment of $100,000 or the equitymethod balance of $64,000 to calculate the investment for the 1% limit.        In legal opinion letter No. 95-0930, dated Dec. 13, RichardSchulman, NCUA's associate general counsel, told Miller that IFCU shoulduse the aggregate cash outlay figure of the original investment of $100,000to calculate the CUSO investment limitation. Schulman noted, however, thatfor measuring a credit union's investment to a CUSO in financialstatements, GAAP should be followed. GAAP uses a cost method, equity methodor consolidated financial statements as measurements.        Miller also asked if IFCU's original cash investment in the IMFSsubsidiary companies be included in the calculation or should it use theequity method's balance.        Schulman replied that IFCU's original cash investment, being theaggregate cash outlay, in the other CUSO's should also be included in thecalculation. He said this is what is meant by "aggregate" limitation.        Miller then inquired whether IFCU's lines of credit to the mortgageCUSO and leasing CUSO were considered a loan to a CUSO for the 1% limitsince these organizations are not directly owned by the credit union. Heexplained that when IFCU owned the second tier CUSO directly, lines ofcredit to the mortgage CUSO and leasing CUSO were established. The lines ofcredit are to fund loans and leases until the underlying loan or leaseinstrument is sold back to IFCU or another investor. --Melanie WaddellBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996BRIEFSFed To Issue StudyOn Check Fraud        The Federal Reserve Board has asked financial institutions tocomment on a proposed one-time check fraud survey that will help it fulfillthe congressional mandate to report on the advisability of modifying theExpedited Funds Availability Act.        The changes to the EFAA, which is implemented through RegulationCC, would extend the maximum permissible hold period for local checks as away to decrease losses related to check fraud.        Comments are due to the Fed by Feb. 20. Data collected from thesurvey will cover the period Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 1995.        Congress has also directed the Fed to study:         Whether a pattern of significant increases in losses related tocheck fraud at depository institutions attributable to the provisions ofthe EFAA exists.         Whether an extension by one day of the period between the depositof a local check and the availability of funds for withdrawal would beeffective in reducing the volume of losses related to check fraud.         Whether to make recommendations for legislative actions.        The survey will gather information about the relationship of allfunds availability schedules mandated in the EFAA to check-fraud losses aswell as specific information about the types of check fraud and the causesof check fraud losses at depository institutions.

Kwock & Co. CPA Inc., in the Aloha State, was taken over by KPMGPeat Marwick LLP Jan.1. The move allows KPMG to provide services for thefirst time in Hawaii.        "They absorbed me," said Steven Kwock, said head of the CPA firmthat bears his name.        Kwock added the merger allows for more resources in the future.        "I'm looking to the year 2000. I'm also looking ahead technologywise as well including the Internet. Credit unions are moving from on-lineservices to in-house (operations)," Kwock told Credit Union Accountant.        Kwock said he works exclusively as a credit union auditor, andsince the merger, his position becomes the director of credit unionaccounts in Hawaii and the Pacific Southwest region for KPMG Peat Marwick.        Kwock said he audits 65% of the credit union audit market inHawaii, which totals $3.1 billion. Until now, KPMG had no share of thatmarket. Before the merger, the Big Six firm served 69 credit unionstotaling $17 million in assets.NAFCU's Tech '96 ShowSet for San Jose, Calif.        At a time when many institutions are trying to beat the ever-ticking technology clock, NAFCU has chimed in with a conference and tradeshow in Silicon Valley to showcase the latest in high-tech creaturefeatures for credit unions.

A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurancecompany--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into theinsurance business.        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British WestIndies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International StandardsGroup Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory auditsfor more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into theinsurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in arecent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit unionservices.        A source within the industry told Credit Union Accountant that ISGis attempting to expand into insurance because it's not making any moneyfrom supervisory committee audits.        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996COURT: MEMBERS CAN'T SHIRK STUDENT LOAN DEBTSAn important legal ruling handed down in Massachusetts could calmfears of credit union CFOs and strengthen the long arm of debt collection.        In the case, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said CU memberscan't use bankruptcy as a method to avoid paying off student loans. TheDecember ruling also is significant because, for the first time, a courtsaid that federal credit unions are "government units" for purposes ofhaving educational loans nondischargeable.        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcyproceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofitorganization.        The ruling stemmed from a suit brought by T.I. Federal Credit Unionin Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case wentbefore the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definitionof both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for theseloans.        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylawsprovided that shareholders get a dividend," Koban said. He won this pointin bankruptcy court.        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its caseto U.S. district court, which ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the"government unit" status, so the case was appealed. The 1st Circuit saidfederal credit unions are, in fact, government units, so it didn't see theneed to address whether it was also a nonprofit.        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning ofthis section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpaymentsare nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifyingas a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor'sloans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters ofeither provision," the 1st Circuit said.        Koban, reached by Credit Union Accountant, asked rhetoricallywhether this ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bankis a "government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested thelaw should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period.This ruling is counter intuitive."        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn'taddress the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress isthe only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, notthe courts.        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.        According to the brief of the case, T.I. federal credit unionadvanced loans as part of its special educational loan program. Thisprogram differs from standard loan programs in that it allows for lowerinterest rates, gives borrowers longer repayment periods and allows loansto be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted underpersonal loan programs. The program also enables borrowers tosimultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balanceson previous loans.        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times forassistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into asingle promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes$32,618.        His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but hislawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely. --Ken ReedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996CREDIT UNIONS AND STUDENT LOANS, A YEAR-END BREAKDOWNOne-third of all credit unions that give student loans offer onlyGuaranteed Student Loans (FFELs), one-third offer only other types ofstudent loans and a third offer both, year-end 1994 CUNA data show.        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage ofcredit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a credit union that lendsFFELs, and 37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lendsother types of student loans, CUNA said.        FFELs are generally preferred because a larger portion of the riskis shared with the government.        A study by the National Association of Federal Credit Unions foundthat, of the 336 member CUs responding to its survey, the average creditunion offering student loans has $240 million in assets while the averagecredit union not offering such loans has $103 million in assets.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996FOCUS ON FASBAcSEC To ExploreBalance Sheet        The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a newproject to determine when various types of securities transactions shouldbe recorded on the balance sheet.        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, inaccordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where thecounterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingenttransactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred toas "to-be-announced" trades.        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types oftransactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date oron the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice asto when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions amongusers of the instruments.FASB Extracts LeasesFrom Hedging Project        The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly thescope of the hedging and derivatives project Dec. 21 when it decided thatleases would not be included.        The project, in its current form, provides the option of markingderivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While otherfinancial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to accountfor leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that itwould expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, aFASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with theissues that most concern hedging and derivatives."        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of theproject, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not toinclude leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to thedifficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the leasefrom the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedgingproject, he said.        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack ofvaluation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicatedissues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in thederivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on thecapitalization or valuation of all leases.        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change inthe value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and thatthe interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earningson a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain ona purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent thatexpense has been recognized for the option premium paid.Comprehensive IncomeTakes Tiny Step Forward        The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how toreport accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments andcumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should bereported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.        The decision represents at least another minor step forward inFASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late falland seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in theincome statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when ittentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive incomeshould be reported in one or more statements of income for financialperformance.        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are byexamining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, ofwhich only the latter is currently included in net income. The matterbecomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported ascumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-periodadjustments in others.        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to developexamples illustrating the three different approaches for reportingaccounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first oneis the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensiveincome strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive incomebroadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excludingaccounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report bothcomprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustmentsbeing displayed as the difference between the two.        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that anyof these three approaches would be workable if they were appliedconsistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quoapproach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistentwith either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-inclusive concept.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996PRIORITY PROJECTSThese are the top current and potential issues that should be considered bythe Financial Accounting Standards Board based on the 1995 annual agendasurvey.

Looking to further spur transaction volume, which hasincreased by more than 77% over the last two years, networks are expandingtheir direct debit marketing budgets while incorporating non-traditionalvehicles to expand their geographic reach.More regional networks are offering incentives and developing educationprograms to generate activity, while minimizing use of the more expensivetelevision, radio and newspaper advertising.  "The cost for televisionadvertising is way over our budget for effectively communicating in aseven-state region," says Cindy Ballard, senior vice president ofHouston-based Pulse, the sixth-largest network.  "Instead, we're working withbanks to help them market to their merchant customers in all areas."Pulse is focusing on the acquirer side by holding retailer workshops andmaking joint sales calls with independent sales organizations to sign newmerchants to accept on-line cards.  The network switched strategies followinga 1994 TV campaign in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which increased networkawareness but did not change consumer usage habits.Also moving away from media advertising is Chicago-based Cash Station, the10th-largest POS network, which aired television commercials after launchingdirect debit in 1992, but now is working more closely with merchants andmembers to spur activity.Cash Station expects to expand an incentive program it tested at an IllinoisKmart Superstore last year, in which coupons were distributed to consumers fordiscounts when the Cash Station card was used for purchases.  Clerks also weregiven prizes if they prompted customers to pay with the Cash Station card."Television is very effective when a new product is introduced, but awarenessof POS debit in our area already is high," says Cathy Alexander, Cash Stationsenior vice president.  "But there still is an absence of knowledge on thepart of members and merchants."Indeed, even with network POS transaction volumes soaring, hundreds ofthousands of retailers still do not accept debit cards for payment.  Manymerchants that acquire debit transactions, meanwhile, do not adequately marketthe products to customers.  Thus, networks are devising methods to spurretailers to promote debit.Louisiana-based GulfNet, the 14th-largest network, has devoted more than halfof its 1996 marketing budget to POS, up 10% from last year, with most of thefunds being used to expand merchant debit acceptance.  The network wants toexpand distribution of incentive coupons at the point of sale to consumers whopaid for purchases with a check or credit card.  The coupons give cardholders$2 off their next purchase with a GulfNet card.  Schwegmann Giant Supermarketsran the promotion for a month last year and $15,000 worth of coupons werecashed in, says Del Tonguette, GulfNet president."Offering incentives is key because studies show that if you can get people touse the card twice you, might create habitual users," says Ronald Rawson,president of San Francisco-based R.  C.  Rawson Co., a consulting firmspecializing in EFT awareness, education and usage.  GulfNet also will focuson expanding network signage at the point of sale and assisting independentsales organizations in signing retailers.  All but four of GulfNet's 2,000retailers were recruited by ISOs.But while many networks have devised strategies for marketing POS at the locallevel, some still expect to use the media to reach specific markets.Virginia-based Most, the fifth-largest network, which attributes much of its60% increase in POS volume last year to radio and billboard advertisements,will again use the vehicles to emphasize the different applications tied tothe Most card.  "Television is too costly," says Mary Kilby, Most senior vicepresident.  "We believe in supporting a brand across a broad region, but wecan only support TV in one or two markets."Multiple MethodsMost also expects to work with a product manufacturer in distributing savingscoupons to consumers if they buy a specific product with the Most card.  Lastyear more than 5 million coupons were distributed between September andDecember for savings on Haagan Daz ice cream.  The network, which advertisedin a minor league baseball park last year, also is considering expanding itssports marketing activities.  "We have 94% total awareness and 80% POSawareness, but we still have to look at increasing POS usage, which is only40%," Kilby says.Yet, while many networks have diminished their media advertising, some stillhave not abandoned the airways as a prime marketing source.  Florida-basedHonor, the fourth-largest network, will advertise from August to December onsuch cable stations as Cable News Network, ESPN, A&E, TNT, USA and The WeatherChannel.  Honor is concentrating on cable because it is less costly thannetwork television and many viewers have the same demographics as active EFTusers, such as being upwardly mobile and early adopters of new technology.The network will use 85% of its marketing budget for POS this year, up from50% in 1995.  Honor's activities are being financed by the network's 6-centacquirer-paid POS interchange fee.  While 3 cents of the fee is passed on tocard issuers, the network maintains 3 cents for POS promotions.  "POS has thegreatest potential for growth so we promote it more than ATMs," says ElizabethStorm, Honor director of marketing.Also using television in its POS marketing mix is Michigan-based Magic Line,the 7th-largest network.  Magic Line will run POS TV commercials this springand fall in Michigan and Indiana.  The network also will hold seminars toeducate merchants on direct debit, and is considering reinstating an incentiveprogram that ran for eight weeks last year in which merchant acquirersreceived cash awards for each new POS device they deployed.  Of Magic Line's$1.1 million marketing budget, $400,000 will be spent on POS in 1996.Some networks, meanwhile, are distributing their marketing dollars inaccordance with the volume generated by the different applications.  SanDiego-based Star System, the largest regional network, will use 30% of itsadvertising budget for POS.  Star switched more than 25 million ATMtransactions in December and over 12 million POS transactions.Star will promote POS on cable television and radio this year, and expand itsmarketing in Oregon and Washington.  The majority of Star's marketing willfocus on the network itself and not a specific application.Another major player incorporating radio advertising is New Jersey-based NYCE,the second-largest network, which plans to run two 60-second spots for aneight week period across its entire Northeast region.  NYCE also is devising aco-op program with merchants which could include electronic coupons or aloyalty program.NYCE expanded its market when it merged with Connecticut-based Yankee 24 in1994 "Radio reaches our target audience, which is typically younger people onthe move," says Scott Strug, NYCE director of marketing.Other major networks, such as Washington-based The Exchange, Delaware-basedMAC and Massachusetts-based X-Press 24 still are finalizing their marketingplans.  LBack to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996AT&T Disconnects Itself From The Busy Smart Card LinesWhile foreign and domestic vendors are flooding the U.S.  smart card market toposition for an expected chip card boom, a major player is departing.  DebitCard News has learned that AT&T Corp.  is selling its smart card businessunit, which develops and markets contactless card systems.AT&T is reportedly looking for a buyer because the unit did not fit into thecompany's recent reorganization and was not profitable, sources say.  AT&Treportedly will finish its existing smart card contracts, but will not take onnew customers.  An AT&T spokesperson would not confirm the planned sale.The move to sell the smart card unit follows AT&T's 1995 announcement that theglobal telecommunications and technology company is streamlining its operationfor greater efficiencies.  AT&T is creating three distinct companies for longdistance services, technology and systems, and computer hardwaremanufacturing.  The AT&T Smart Cards business unit was created in 1982.Companies using AT&T contactless smart cards include Delta Airlines, which hasa ticketless boarding program for its Northeast shuttle, and New York-basedChemical Bank, which is running an in-house contactless card pilot with 300employees.  Both projects are expected to continue.  Drew University inMadison, N.J., suspended an AT&T contactless card pilot last year, but isconsidering reinstating it.While most payments industry players are gravitating to a contact card systemin which a smart card is swiped through a card reader, AT&T is marketingcontactless smart cards that must be passed in front of, or near, a cardreader.  While contactless cards are best suited for applications wheretransaction speed is crucial, such as persons going through turnstiles in atrain station, the systems are more expensive to implement.  Contactless cardsand terminals are estimated to cost more than twice that of contact cards.Cards range from $10 to $20, and terminals from $200 to $1,000.Change Of PlansAT&T's reported plan to sell its smart card unit follows its announcement lastspring that it would license its contactless technology in hopes of making itthe world's standard for cashless wallets and electronic commerce.  At thattime, AT&T said it was negotiating with three companies in the U.S.  andabroad.  However, Italy-based Olivetti Co.  reportedly was the only company tolicense AT&T's technology, which it used to pilot contactless cards on theAutostrada, Italy's main freeway."When AT&T decided to license its technology to other companies, that was asignal that they were looking for the way out," says an industry observerfamiliar with AT&T.Indeed, a lack of payments industry interest in contactless technology couldhave led to AT&T's decision to sell its operation.  Most observers say AT&T'ssystem was too expensive for widespread use in supporting stored-value cardprograms, which are typically positioned to replace low-value cashtransactions.In addition, more efficient contactless systems already are being marketed.For instance, while AT&T's design requires cards to be brought within inchesof a reader, radio frequency-based contactless systems only require cards tocome within a few feet of a reader.  Analysts believe AT&T's design is toosimilar to swipe technology.  "Contactless smart card technology is great, butAT&T never got any real applicable products off the ground," says JeromeSvigals, a Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.A Brighter FutureBut while AT&T had problems expanding its smart card business, analysts saythere still is a future for contactless cards.  Indeed, some players that haveencountered difficulties with contactless cards still are planning to utilizethe technology.  Drew University discontinued an AT&T contactless campus cardprogram that was being used by about 2,500 students and faculty after a yearbecause the cards were too weak to support high usage.  However, Drew isconsidering reinstating the technology with more resilient cards.Drew's cards were used for identification, stored value and to pay for meals,but problems stemmed from cardholders' mistreatment of the plastic.  "Thetechnology worked fine, but students shove their cards in their book bags andjeans pockets and if it doesn't work, then a student doesn't get a meal," saysHarry Scarpa, Drew University director of purchasing.  Drew is currently usinga mag-stripe campus card.Still, Drew was impressed with the potential for supporting multiple functionson the AT&T contactless card.  Drew's chip cards 3 kilobytes of memory,compared to the one kilobyte of memory in most contact cards.In addition to cost and reliability issues, contactless card acceptance alsois hindered by a smart card industry that still is evolving.  New applicationsthat generate additional fee revenue are needed to support a more expensivecard product,such as contactless cards, says Timothy McNaughton, manager ofpilots and implementation at Royal Bank of Canada.  Royal Bank will issuecontact smart cards for the Mondex electronic purse program that will belaunched in Canada later this year.But while the payments industry is not ready to embrace contactless cards, thetechnology is still expected to find a niche in the transportation sector.The San Diego-based Cubic Automatic Revenue Collection Group, which designsand implements contactless systems, reports that contactless cards permit morethan 72 persons to move through turnstiles in two minutes, compared to about60 with contact cards.Indeed, a number of metropolitan transit authorities, including those in NewYork and San Francisco, are reportedly considering implementing contactlesssystems.  Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority already istesting contactless smart cards for rail, bus and parking services.  More than1,000 employees are involved in the one-year pilot.  The Washington's transitauthority also is negotiating with North Carolina-based First Union for thecards to be used in an open contact environment (Debit Card News, 11/30/95).Easier AccessMeanwhile, enhancements to contact smart card systems are expected to make iteasier for card issuers to upgrade their products for contactless smart cardapplications.  One method under study would be to place card jackets withcontactless capability over contact cards."One reason why the industry decided on contact cards was because it is mucheasier to make a contact card contactless than vice versa," says David Lott,senior associate at Dove Associates, an Atlanta-based payments consultingfirm.And Visa and MasterCard, which are supporting contact smart card programs, saymarket demand could result in hybrid products.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Visa Leads The Canadian Prepaid PushWhen the SmartCash stored-value venture was announced last summer, a majorpayments participant was conspicuously absent from its proposed ownershiplist:  Visa International.  But while SmartCash and its participants, such asMasterCard International, Electronic Payment Services and Chemical Bank, stillare cementing the business plans for their nationwide stored-value business,Visa has taken a lead role in expanding smart card activity in North America.The California-based bank card association recently signed four Canadianinstitutions to pilot its Visa Cash stored-value product.  And with itssponsorship of a smart card program that will be launched in conjunction withthe 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Visa has become the instrumental playerin generating prepaid card activity in the region.But the North American programs are just one piece of Visa's worldwide smartcard initiative.  Visa already is piloting Visa Cash in Australia, and plansto have the product issued in markets around the globe.  Indeed, Visa expectsits chip card activities to expand in six regions this year.  "Visa Cash notonly will grow in various parts of Canada, but it will expand over time ineach of our operating regions," says Gaylon Howe, Visa senior vice presidentof stored value products.However, the most recent Visa activity is occurring in Canada, where TorontoDominion Bank, Scotiabank, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union and Lescasisses Desjardins, will be piloting Visa Cash.  Toronto Dominion andVancouver City Savings went live in December.Toronto Dominion is issuing 10,000 disposable Visa Cash cards to 5,000employees in Toronto, who can purchase cards through a card dispensing machineat bank headquarters for use in a cafeteria.  Up to 15 card readers areexpected to be installed at retail locations over the next several months,including Michel's Baguette, MMMarvelous MMMuffins, and The UCS Groupconvenience stores.Adding IncomeIn addition, Toronto Dominion expects to eventually add other retailers, pilota rechargeable Visa Cash card, add smart card features to existing debit andcredit cards and support a loyalty program.  "We see the stored-value productcreating a new revenue stream for the bank," says Steve Phillips, TorontoDominion manager of access cards and smart card development.  "Visa researchshows consumers are willing to pay a fee to obtain cards, so we wanted to getour feet wet and generate technical and business expertise with a pilot."  Thetest is expected to last six to 10 months.  The bank expects to eventuallyroll out the card to other provinces, Phillips says.Stored-value card activity also is under way at Vancouver City Savings, whichis issuing 1,200 Visa Cash cards in $20 denominations to its employees in theVancouver area.  The cards can be used for purchases at a local McDonald's, aSubway shop, a bank cafeteria, a gift shop at the Science World children'smuseum, and a Starbucks coffee shop.Vancouver City Savings is one of Canada's largest credit unions with 250,000members.  "We compete with larger banks and feel we can get ahead in themarket with stored value," a spokesperson says.  Vancouver City's pilot willrun through the spring.  The credit union plans to eventually roll out VisaCash throughout British Columbia.Still developing its chip card program is Toronto-based Scotiabank, whichplans to launch a six-month in-house pilot in early February at two bank sitesin Toronto with 5,000 employees.  Employees can use the cards at the bankcafeteria, MMMarvelous MMMuffins and Starbucks Coffee shops.  "We want to beready when the market moves," says Bob Lounsbury, Scotiabank vice president ofcard products and marketing.  "But we don't yet see stored-value cards asproviding an opportunity to steal customers away from other banks."Quebec's largest credit union, Les caisses Desjardins, will launch a Visa Cashpilot by March in a yet to be determined location.  The credit union isscouting for an area with a high concentration of stores that deal insmall-value transactions, such as in an office complex.  Program details areexpected to be finalized by the end of the month.Acquirer-paid interchange pricing for Visa Cash in Canada has not yet beendetermined, though each bank will set its own fees, participants say.Consumer pricing has not been set, but employees will not pay extra card feesduring the test.The Canadian financial institutions are positioning to garner a piece of thelarge market for low-value transactions.  Visa estimates that transactions ofunder $10 account for $75 billion annually in Canada.Bank executives believe Canadians will embrace stored-value cards because manyconsumers already are active debit users.  For instance, Toronto-basedInterac, the national on-line point-of-sale network that was launched in 1990,has doubled its POS transaction volume in the last year.More than 7 million Interac cards have been issued up, from 5 million in 1994.Interac had 50 million POS transactions in December, up from 25 million a yearearlier.  Yet, Interac executives do not expect stored-value activity to cutinto on-line volume because stored value is designed to replace cash orlow-ticket transactions.  The average Interac purchase is about $47.Competitive PressuresBut while Visa Cash is expected to operate alongside Interac, the stored-valueproduct could still face strong competition from the London-based Mondexelectronic purse program.  Mondex has signed Royal Bank of Canada and CanadianImperial Bank of Commerce-two of the largest institutions in the country-andHongkong Bank, to issue cards.  Mondex plans to test its product in Guelph,Ontario, during the second half of 1996.  Guelph has 100,000 residents and1,200 merchants (Debit Card News, 11/15).Mondex is positioned as a cash replacement and cards can be loaded with valueat ATMs, bank counters and telephones.  Consumers also can transfer valueamong cards, and send value electronically from the point of sale to the bank."We are looking to get practical experience from an actual market test, whichshows we are moving faster to bring smart cards to the marketplace," saysTimothy N.  McNaughton, Royal Bank of Canada's manager of pilots andimplementation.Though some observers believe Visa Cash has an advantage with name awareness,analysts say both companies face the challenge of getting consumers to try anew stored-value product.  "Visa's brand recognition gives it an edge, butboth products are starting from scratch," says David Lott, senior of DoveAssociates, a payments consulting firm.  "There is ample room in Canada forboth products."Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Another President Departs From Debit Processor Deluxe DataFor the second time in less than three years, one of the debit industry's mostrenown processors, Deluxe Data Systems, is working to keep its course in themidst of a leadership upheaval.  Milwaukee-based Deluxe has named John B.Benton as interim president, replacing James E.  McGowan.  Benton is chairmanand chief executive officer of Benton International Corp., a Torrance,Calif.-based consulting firm which develops processing systems.McGowan exits his position just 28 months after being named president.McGowan replaced Alan G.  Brown, who reportedly was forced out in 1993.  In astatement released by Deluxe, Gus Blanchard, president and chief executiveofficer of parent company Deluxe Corp., said that a number major changes andadditions to product offerings are planned, and "I felt this major expansionrequired new leadership to move us to a higher plane."Deluxe's new growth strategy, which was developed after a six-month analysis,features four major initiatives including enhancing the company's paymentsprotection capabilities and creating larger information data bases.  The aimis for Deluxe to function as a technology partner and act as a link betweenfinancial institutions and their customers.  Client institutions would be ableto electronically hook their customers to a variety of banking application,such as being able to check balances from a home computer.Other initiatives involve restructuring the company's catalog and directmarketing units, and a major cost reduction and asset redeployment program tohelp finance Deluxe's expansion plans.This development of new initiatives and the replacement of McGowan follows arough period for Deluxe.  The company has faced difficult times in recentyears as EFT networks, Deluxe's Data's major clients, have taken theirprocessing in-house.  For instance, New Jersey-based NYCE, the second-largestshared network and a former Deluxe client, began processing its owntransactions in 1992Deluxe also lost a major processing customers in 1990 when Brown Deer,Wis.-based Tyme, the 22nd--largest network, switched from Deluxe to M&I DataServices.  Tyme, however, still is a software customer of Deluxe.Some analysts also say that Deluxe has made some questionable businessdecisions in recent years.  In 1994, the company purchased Louisville-basedFinancial Alliance Processing Services, one of the industry's fastest growingcredit card processors that offers credit and debit services to about 150financial institutions.  Some observers believe Deluxe overpaid for FinancialAlliance.Other observers attribute Deluxe's situation to McGowan's inexperience in EFT.Though McGowan spent 18 years with IBM and was an executive with threesoftware and technology firms, he was new to the electronic payments industrywhen hired by Deluxe.  McGowan has has been placed on special assignment,reporting to Blanchard."I'm not surprised by this because McGowan was in over his head," says DonaldAtkinson, president of Atkinson & Associates, an Irving, Texas-based dataprocessing consultant.  Some observers also were surprised by the suddennessof McGowan's departure and the naming of Benton as interim president.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996NACHA Adds More Pieces To The Nationwide EBT PuzzleSeven months after stating plans to develop national electronic benefitstransfer operating rules, the National Automated Clearinghouse Associ-ation'selectronic benefits transfer council is moving forward.  The council hasdeveloped a set of preliminary rules to clarify the roles of such EBT playersas banks, processors and state governments.  NACHA also has startednegotiations to acquire a logo for a national EBT network.The EBT council, which is working to create a nationwide EBT system, expectsto release the final version of the rules in March.  State EBT consortiums,such as the seven-state Northeast Coalition and the eight-state SouthernAlliance of States, plan to incorporate the NACHA rules in their operatingprocedures."We are trying to create an interoperable environment for EBT so it makessense to incorporate these standards," says Daniel Berry, EBT coordinator forNew York State, which is part of the Northeast Coalition.NACHA's EBT Council consists of representatives from state governments, banks,processing companies and shared regional EFT networks.  The council is workingwith the U.S.  Treasury and the Federal EBT task force to createspecifications for a national EBT program.The NACHA rules are designed to clarify a wide range of EBT issues.  Theystate, for instance, that scrip machines in retail locations can be used todispense benefits as long as the device is treated as point-of-sale terminalsand not ATMs.  Scrip machines dispense vouchers that are redeemed for cash bya store clerk.  Networks have different fee schedules for ATM and POStransactions.While some observers say the EBT Council's operating rules will duplicateexisting EFT operating rules, participants say the NACHA group is helping tosimplify procedures.In addition to developing rules, the EBT council is negotiating with directorsof the defunct Quest shared regional EFT network to use the Quest logo for anational EBT mark.  The deal is expected to be completed within several weeks.Kentucky-based Quest was merged into Delaware-based MAC, the third largestshared regional EFT network last July, but the Quest name is still owned byTransaction Services Co., which represents seven Kentucky-area financialinstitutions.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Blockbuster Has A Casting Call For Its Corporate Prepaid CardOne of The Blockbuster Entertainment Group's newest releases, a prepaid debitcard for consumers, has been re-edited.  Blockbuster has shelved plans toissue cards to consumers and is concentrating on signing corporate customersto distribute the stored-value products.Blockbuster is aggressively working to sign product manufacturers, restaurantsand other merchants to purchase and disperse the prepaid cards to theircustomers as a marketing incentive.  Already, Planet Hollywood and publisherSimon and Schuster have formed alliances with Blockbuster.  Simon and Schusteris including the disposable magnetic-stripe cards in books sold at collegebookstores.  The co-branded cards can be used for purchases at 3,300Blockbuster Video, 520 Blockbuster Music and 330 Discovery Zone children'splay-area locations in the U.S.By targeting the corporate customer, Florida-based Blockbuster has turned itsattention from the consumer market.  Blockbuster began testing its disposableValue Card in Salt Lake City last summer at 25 Blockbuster Video, BlockbusterMusic and Discovery Zone locations (Debit Card News, 9/7).  The companyreportedly invested more than $1 million in hardware and software for theprogram.  Consumers paid $15 for cards that held $20 of value.Yet, despite strong consumer interest in the cards, Blockbuster did not expandthe program outside of Utah.  More than 100,000 Blockbuster Value Cards weresold in three weeks and Blockbuster said last fall that the company wasencouraged by the test.  The card was expected to cut transaction times at thecheckout, increase the average ticket size and generate interest income onunspent funds that are held by Blockbuster.A Blockbuster spokesperson now says the Salt Lake City program was primarilydesigned to test the stored-value operating system and that the company now isputting all its efforts "into the corporate direction."In addition to signing product manufacturers and service companies,Blockbuster is marketing its stored-value GiftCard as a vehicle through whichcompanies can distribute bonuses to their employees.  Blockbuster also ispositioning the cards as a collectible, which can feature designs depicting awide range of themes, such as pictures of hit movies when the films arereleased on video.Most recently, Blockbuster sold GiftCards to consumers during the holidayseason to use as gift certificates.  The Blockbuster spokesperson says using amag-stripe card as an electronic gift certificate cut the company's processingcosts and the vehicle is expected to be used again this year.  The GiftCard isexpected to be marketed internationally.Blockbuster stored-value transactions are processed by Omaha-based First DataCorp.'s Card Establishment Services/NaBANCO unit, the company's credit cardprocessor.  During a transaction, the cards are swiped through the stores'credit card devices and sent to CES/NaBanco for authorization and processing.Cardholders can check remaining account balances at the point of sale.The move to market a stored-value product is just Blockbuster's latestactivity in the card market.

The state has backed away from a plan to collect sales tax onconsumer fees that are attached to on-line point-of-sale and automated tellermachine transactions.The measure, which was proposed last summer by the California Board ofEqualization after an audit of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Prestige StationsInc.  subsidiary, could have cost companies that surcharge millions of dollarsin back taxes.  The regulation also could have resulted in a decrease inmerchant surchargers, and hefty consumer fee increases to compensate for thetaxes, analysts believe.California determined last year that it was owed taxes from consumersurcharges on transactions generated at 280 Arco service stations inCalifornia.  Prestige Stations Inc.  operates Arco's 400 company-ownedstations in California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Arizona.  Arco chargesconsumers 25 cents to initiate on-line debit POS transactions.  While Arco andCalifornia officials would not state the amount of taxes that were inquestion, which date back several years, observer believes it was in themillions of dollars.The Board of Equalization last month ruled that Arco and other surchargesshould not be subjected to a sales tax because the consumer fee is more of afinancing charge than the sales price of an item, says Dennis Fox, supervisorof audit planning for the California Board of Equalization.The board recently published regulations for EFT fees which state that vendorscould be taxed on surcharges if, for instance, the extra fee is not statedseparately; if the consumer could not purchase the property at a price whichdoes not include the amount of the fee; or if the fee is calculated as apercentage of the sales price.  The provision is expected to become law inabout four months, following public hearings and a comment period.By excluding surcharges from the tax code, California has kept a strongmerchant revenue pipeline in place.  Anaheim-based Carl's Jr., for instance,one of the U.S.'s largest on-line POS merchants with close to 2,000 terminalsin more than 500 outlets, surcharges consumers 50 cents a transaction onpurchases.  Indeed, Fox said the fast-food industry lobbied the state to dropits plan to tax surchargers.While Carl's Jr.  reportedly implemented the fee to discourage consumers frominitiating small purchases just to get $40 or more in cash back, analystsbelieve the fast-food outlet, as well as Arco, is generating strong incomefrom the fee."This removed a significant barrier to the imposition of surcharges inCalifornia," says Eric Bell, vice president of Los Angeles-based FirstInterstate, a leading merchant acquiring institution.  "Most of the surchargerevenue was pure gravy."But while California point-of-sale surchargers might have dodged a major taxbullet, the merchants could be facing another obstacle later this year whenCalifornia-based Visa's Interlink national POS network is expected to ban allmerchants from surcharging transactions.Though the network outlawed surcharging as of November 1993, retailers thatwere surcharging prior to that date are allowed to continue the practice untilthis November.  The Visa board could address the issue this year, analystsbelieve.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Debit-Conscious Australia Says G'Day To Prepaid CardsWhile Australia may be best known for its kangaroos and koala bears, someNorth American payment players might also be equating the country with guineapigs.  For Australia has become a major test site for new and advanced debitproducts that eventually will be employed in the U.S., including smart cards.A stored-value card test is under way on the Gold Coast, a tourist area on theeast coast of Australia, by Visa International.  MasterCard International willlaunch a pilot in Canberra, Australia's capital, in March.  The smart cardpilots will help determine how stored-value programs will be designed andpromoted in the U.S.  and other regions."The Australia pilot will help us leverage what we learn from consumers,merchants and member banks about product positioning and marketing," saysWalter Greenberg, MasterCard senior vice president and stored-value projectmanager.Debit SavvyThe bank card associations are using Australia as a test site because researchfound that the majority of Australian consumers are willing to usestored-value smart cards in lieu of cash.  Australians already have embracedon-line debit cards, with 17 million debit cards issued to the population of17 million.  Last year, Australian taxis began accepting MasterCard's Maestroglobal POS network cards for payment in Sydney.But while both associations are expanding into Australia, they are followingdifferent routes.  Visa's Visa Cash product currently is just distributed as adisposable stored-value card, but a reloadable application is expected to berolled out in February.Meanwhile, MasterCard will offer a rechargeable MasterCard Cash card when itrolls out a stored-value program in March.  "We started with the disposablecard to gain critical mass," says Bruce Mansfield, Visa's head of chip cardsin Australia.  "Because reloadable cards feature bank logos, we didn't wantour banks to compete against each other at the beginning of the pilot."MasterCard, which is marketing its MasterCard Cash product to consumers thismonth via direct mail, will link its stored-value smart card to existingcredit and debit accounts.  MasterCard is not issuing disposable cards for theAustralian pilot.  "Our research shows that consumers want enhancements toexisting cards, rather than have more cards in their wallet," Greenberg says.Targeting TouristsAustralian stored-value activity was kicked off by Visa in mid-November on theGold Coast, an area that attracts nearly 3 million visitors per year.  Thesmart cards are being issued by five major financial institutions:  AustraliaNew Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit UnionServices Corp.  Australia Ltd., National Australia Bank and Westpac BankingCorp.The banks have issued more than 10,000 cards and installed 250 card-readingterminals at an estimated 100 retail locations.  Visa is implementing amarketing campaign which includes print advertisements and billboards.Approximately 150,000 cards will be issued during the year-long pilot.The Visa Cash cards are being sold at about 50 locations, including movietheaters, theme parks, hotels and financial institution branches.  Reloadablecards will be added in February and cardholders will be able to add valuethrough automated teller machines and at the point of sale.Visa also expects to have 1,000 smart card terminals installed by February.Most merchants, which include Kmart, Target, McDonald's, 7-Eleven, Shell Oiland Bond University's book and coffee shop, are situated near two majorshopping centers.  Three theme parks, including Sea World, will accept cardsat about 150 terminals and are expected to go live this month.About a half-dozen card dispensing kiosks also will be tested and the pilotmight incorporate home-based telephones to add value.  An upgrade to allowcardholders to store multiple currencies at sites around the world is plannedfor 1997.  Pricing for reloadable cards could range from 50 cents pertransaction to $10 annually.While Mansfield will not disclose current Visa Cash volume, he projects thatactivity will reach 25,000 transactions per week in March.  Acquirer-paidinterchange pricing will be determined by each bank.Meanwhile, MasterCard is just as aggressive in expanding its Australianprogram.  MasterCard has been signing merchants since October and expects morethan 200 retailers and 300 smart card terminals to be involved in its pilot inBelcommen, a suburb of Canberra.  Retailers are paying for terminalinstallations.Gauging InterestMasterCard Cash issuers-Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, CommonwealthBank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp.  and Standard Charter Bank-will runmonth-long, in-house tests with up to 500 employees to strengthen employeeunderstanding of the product and to test the stored-value operating system.The employee pilots also will test different consumer pricing.  The banksexpect to issue up to 10,000 cards for the nine-month consumer pilot.MasterCard banks began a direct mail campaign this month for MasterCard Cash.Final pricing schedules will be completed by March.  While Australianregulations restrict banks from publicly disclosing consumer and merchantpricing, research shows that customers prefer monthly or annual fees, ratherthan per-transaction fees.MasterCard Cash cards will be distributed through bank branches andcardholders can reload value onto the card's computer chip by transferringfunds from bank accounts at ATMs and at the point of sale.  Futureenhancements could include loading value through home-based telephones.Full-function kiosks also will be installed, where customers can checkbalances and transaction information.In addition to their Australian effort, Visa and MasterCard also expect tosign issuers in New Zealand.

Tampa-based Payment Systems Inc.  reports thatin 1995, 52% of all retail transactions were initiated at financialinstitution branches, down just 2% from 1994.  The total volume oftransactions conducted at a traditional branch increased by 6% between 1994and 1995.Meanwhile, the share of all transactions conducted at automated tellermachines increased from 22% to 26%, with ATM volumes increasing by 32%, PSIreports.  Phone banking's share of total transactions increased from 12% to15%, with a 39% volume increase from 1994 to 1995.Payment Systems Inc.  determined that active ATM users also use phone bankingsystems to transfer funds between accounts or inquire about cleared checks,and use bank branches to initiate deposits.  ATMs account for 47% oftransactions made by consumers to obtain cash, up from 39% in 1994.Traditional financial institution branches account for 49% of cashtransactions, down from 54% in 1994, PSI reports.Paypoint Network Gets A New PresidentSteve Minihan has been named president of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'sPayPoint subsidiary.

The service is called CS-Direct Invest andfollows the May 1995 launch of CS-Direct Invest in Switzerland.German clients will be able to carry out investment business via an"account/safekeeping account" in Switzerland. With a minimum investmentof DM10,000 ($7,000), German clients can use CS-Direct Invest to buildup a portfolio from Credit Suisse's Credis Investment Funds.A Credit Suisse spokeswoman confirmed that because the accounts arebased in Switzerland, German customers are covered by Swiss bankingsecrecy laws. Recent years have seen a number of clamp-downs by theGerman authorities on banks for allegedly facilitating customers inavoiding tax through Luxembourg-based funds.Credit Suisse priced its Swiss product high - mainly to avoid losingtoo much business from other areas of its banking service. But theapproach in Germany has been different: "CS-Direct Invest has acompetitive price structure in Germany, but there is a cleardifferentiation from discount banks such as Direkt Anlage, Comdirectand Bank 24," said a bank spokeswoman."Our selling point is not so muchprice as service."The product comes with investment advice and a personal adviser, unlikeGerman competitors Direkt Anlage, which pared costs to the bone by notincluding advice, though it provides information.The German funds market has grown 25 percent a year since 1990, andCredit Suisse expects it to grow at least 15 percent a year until 2000.A spokesman for rival Swiss Bank Corporation said that while it had noplans to launch a similar product in Germany it was closely observingthe market.The project will not involve any co-operation with the Winterthurinsurance company, which CS has linked up with in Switzerland.There are no plans at the moment for PC banking with CS-Direct Invest,but the bank is watching developments, especially in relation toimproving security.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But Signet says the high loan losses arepart of its statistically-driven "cell testing" method and are no causefor alarm.Signet's "loan by cheque" programme is one of the most daringexperiments yet in "branchless" banking. The programme uses databasedmarketing and advanced computer models to generate pre-approvedconsumer loans of up to $10,000. For each pre-approved loan, the banksimply mails out a cheque to the targeted consumer, who can then cashit at his local bank.The new programme relies on the statistical science of "informationdiscovery", an approach first developed by the US credit card industryand used to great effect by Signet's highly successful credit cardoperation, which the bank spun off into Capital One in early 1995.Capital One, which uses information discovery to generate customisednew card offers, increased its accounts by 22 percent and itsreceivables by 42 percent in 1995.Information discovery studies each customer's behaviour and calculatesthe "net present value" of each customer relationship. It thencontinuously analyses customer data to isolate behavioural clustersthat permit the bank to generate customised card or consumer loanoffers. Once these offers are tested and retested among the bank'sexisting customers, the resulting models, or "hypotheses", are used togenerate new offers to non-customers taken from external lists.Signet's cheque-by-mail programme is part of an ambitious bid totransform the mid-sized regional bank, which has $10 billion in assetsand some 250 branches, into a national consumer bank. Since 1993, thebank has used statistical modelling and bought lists to mail out offersfor consumer credits, student loans, home equity products and mutualfunds to tens of thousands of prospective customers, who have only tophone a toll-free telephone number to accept the terms offered.The bank's declared strategy is to take the statistical methodspioneered by the credit card industry and extend them into consumerlending and direct banking. A number of large US banks, including FirstBank and Wells Fargo are using similar methods for national marketingdrives in small business lending and home equity loans, for example,but Signet's effort is the most aggressive and broadly-based."Signet is turning into a cross between a consumer finance company anda regional bank. It could turn into a huge national company," said TomMcCandless, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York. "Many banks aretrying to emulate what they're doing."But the experimental nature of Signet's marketing methods have latelybecome a cause for concern among analysts. Signet's programme ran intotrouble in the third quarter of 1995, when its gross charge-offs roseto $9.3 million, up 63 percent from the previous quarter. As a result,Signet was forced to double its loan loss provisions to $8.7 million,and redoubled them again in the fourth quarter to $18.6 million. Thebank's total net charge-offs jumped 20 percent from the third quarterto $15.6 million.Signet explained that the higher loan losses were the result of twomailings the company made in late 1994 to test how lower acceptancecriteria would affect response and profitability. The two mailingsgenerated $175 million in new loans, but three quarters later they hadcreated an annualised loss rate of 11.23 percent.Signet has responded that the third-quarter losses were the result ofmailings the bank deliberately made to higher-risk segments. "In orderto build more effective models, we had to have some losses, and inorder to get some losses, we had to mail to higher risk segments,"Signet chief operating officer Malcolm McDonald told American Banker.While the bank was expecting a higher loss rate for these mailings, itdid not expect the high response level - and resulting loss levels -that the mailings produced. Earlier mailings, he said, did not produceenough losses to build statistically robust models. McDonald explainedthat each mailing has expected losses built into it, and that Signet'scheque-by-mail programme could sustain higher loan losses and stillgenerate a"positive net present value".But fourth-quarter losses have further highlighted the problems of theloan-by-cheque programme. The loan loss ratio of the programme's twohigh-risk mailings reached a miserable 19.5 percent in the fourthquarter, against 2 percent for the rest of the programme. But Signetstands by the programme, whose loans its hopes to double in 1996. Itexpects high losses to continue in the coming quarters, as high-riskloans decline as a percentage of the total loan-by-cheque portfolio.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The company says the opportunityexists because of the deregulation of the mandatory motor insurancemarket.Balz Hoesly, chief operations officer of Swissline, expects volume togrow to between 10 percent and 15 percent of the non-life insurancemarket by 2000, and expects to make a profit in four to six years.Swissline will initially offer motor insurance and linked products likelegal help and breakdown recovery, but it is hoped that it will expandinto other forms of insurance "fairly soon".Swissline is a stand-alone company, and is legally the underwritingagent for Wintherthur Insurance and Wintherthur Life. It employs 70people."We are aiming to gain lasting competitive advantage in the entirevalue-added process," said Hoesly. He cited motivated staff,first-class service, cost advantages for customers, rigorous costmanagement and a high-tech infrastructure as the basics needed for thesuccess of the direct operation.Swissline says it deliberately waited for the deregulation moves tostart operations.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Banc One's poor results highlight the screenphone'sfailure to achieve any success in the US market in 1995. Several largeinstitutions, including Citibank, withdrew from screenphone pilots lastyear, and many other banks chose to focus on PC banking instead.Banc One launched the pilot in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in September,in partnership with hardware vendor GTE and processor Visa Interactive.GTE's screenphone was priced at $150, perhaps the lowest price on offerin the US, where some high-end models have sold for $700. GTE hoped tosell 2,000 units by the end of 1995, but it sold only several hundred.Most of the buyers were blue-collar men who were older and lessaffluent than expected.Banc One mailed 150,000 screenphone offers to its customers in Texas,but the promotion generated far more inquiries about the bank's PCbanking programme than its screenphone service. (Banc One currentlyoffers PC banking in Ohio through on-line service Prodigy, a programmeit plans to extend to other markets this year.)In its 1996 Home Banking Report, Jupiter Communications in New Yorkestimated that PC home banking accounts in the US at 750,000 in 1995and predicted they would grow to 13 million by the year 2000. But forscreenphones, Jupiter Communications offered a less sanguine view - the19,000 US households using screenphones for remote banking in 1995would grow to 600,000 by the year 2000. Since screenphones, unlike PCs,bear the enormous marketing and hardware risks involved in launching anew consumer device, Jupiter's screenphone projection should be enoughto dissuade most large banks from trying.While the screenphone was widely discussed at the 1994 Retail DeliverySystems conference, it received no attention at all at the 1995 RDSshow, where speeches on PC and Internet banking drew huge crowds. Askedat one 1995 RDS session to name his greatest marketing failure, Keycorpmarketing chief Steven Cone replied,"At Citibank, my biggest mistakewas backing the screenphone, a wonderful device that no one uses."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Time Warner's FSN, the first interactive cable pilot inthe US, has signed up 3,500 customers in Orlando, Florida and nowoffers customers local phone service as well as broadband datatransfer.Barnett's programme, the first US home banking pilot that usesfull-motion interactive television (ITV), will allow FSN subscribers tocombine remote banking with such interactive services as video ondemand, home shopping and video games.Barnett's home banking package, which is free for all FSN customers whoalso bank at Barnett, allows users to check their balances, viewstatements and transfer funds by manipulating displays on their TVswith the help of cable set box. All customer information resides withBarnett, which encrypts and secures transaction information on its ownproprietary operating system.Once the holy grail of remote delivery, interactive cable in the US wascompletely eclipsed last year by the phenomenal growth and popularityof the Internet. Only two operators have introduced interactive cablepilots - Time Warner and regional telco Bell Atlantic, which launchedits service in New Jersey last month.The expense of upgrading infrastructure has delayed the progress ofboth projects and cast doubt on their commercial viability.

The service - Giro Direkt - was launchedin October.The number of accounts in American Express Bank in Germany rose 30percent between April and October 1995. Of new customers, 50 percentwere not holders of American Express cards."Amex Bank has been successfully selling a similar product to its cardmembers since 1991. We saw that there was growing interest outside thecard member base to offer a similar product."We are waiting to see the results of that test, and will then reviewthe situation," said a spokesman.Giro Direkt will be evaluated on, among other criteria, the number ofcustomers and their profiles and usage patterns.It is possible that the company will open a similar operation in the UKor elsewhere, if the German operation is a success. American Expresshas direct banking operations for card holders only in Paris,Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.But a spokesman warned: "There are no plans to do anything in the UK atthis stage. We will look at the banking environment, what consumerinterest there is and then move from there."The project started in Berlin and Hamburg, where the bank says there isa clear reflection of its current customer profile.Giro Direkt customers can bank by phone, fax or letter from anywhere inthe world.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightDIRECT DELIVERY INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DUTCH COURAGEThe Netherlands was one of the first countries to embrace directdelivery. Yet the country's major institutions show marked differencesin their approach. Diarmuid MacConville reportsDUTCH FINANCIAL institutions were among the pioneers of directdelivery, and the Dutch are among the world's keenest users of directservices. At present, about 8.5 percent of retail bank customers usethe telephone, and UK market research company Datamonitor believes thatby the year 2000 almost a quarter of the Dutch population will bebanking by phone.Direct banking in Holland started in 1978, 15 years before bankselsewhere realised that customers wanted more flexibility in banking.Postbank, before its privatisation and absorption into NMB Bank, andultimately ING Group, coined the phrase "Thuisbankieren", which is nowused generically for all home banking.Only cash withdrawals and lodgements required a visit to the postoffice; all other transactions could be carried out at home, usuallyover the phone. Postbank prospered with direct banking: market share ofsavings rose to 17 percent in 1989 from 13 percent in 1978.Three players - Rabobank, Postbank, and ABN AMRO - dominate the Dutchmarket, and account for 80 percent to 90 percent of most types ofbanking business. But smaller players, including insurance companieslike Achmea and Aegon, are starting to nibble at the edges of thedirect banking market. Postbank has been by far the quickest into thedirect market; the other big banks are only slowly starting to adddirect banking services to the main offering.A spokesman for a rival bank said: "That is because for us, directbanking is only one channel of distribution, not the main one, like itis for Postbank."Postbank, part of the ING group, is basically a stand-alone directbank, though it does have dedicated counters in post office branchesaround the country. It started experimenting with alternativedistribution channels in the 1960s, while it was still state-owned.Today, the telephone is its main distribution channel. It claims abanking relationship with one-third of Dutch households, about 6million people.Postbank has 500 staff at four processing centres, all dealing withcustomer queries. The bank generates most of its customer creditinquiries from the post offices (60 percent) compared to 27 percentfrom mailed material, which is also used extensively.Some 800 customer service agents at 11 Postbank call centres deal with8.5 million inquiries. This has been supplemented by Girofoon, anAutomatic Voice Response (AVR) unit launched in 1993. But Postbankmanagers are sceptical about customer acceptance. "We are convincedthat many of our best customers do not yet appreciate it," said HermanHuizinga, Postbank's head of telephone banking. "Because we are not yetconvinced of the full acceptance of the medium, we are not forcingcustomers to use voice response."The bank also has AVR units to reply to questions about share pricesand its mortgage products.ABN AMRO, which also has an AVR unit, started its pilot human operatorphone banking service early in 1996. Clients of 33 branches can use it,allowing them to buy and sell stocks and shares and obtain marketinformation. From February 19, a service line will be available,allowing account transfers and other banking services.An ABN AMRO spokeswoman said that the continuation of manned phonebanking depends on the results of the pilot. The bank wants to focusthe direct banking as an add-on service for branch-based customersrather than as a stand-alone operation. Now employing about 50 people,the call centre is expected to expand to several hundred if the mannedtelephone banking operation goes ahead.Achmea Group came from the merger of Avero Central Beheer Group (AVCB)and Zilveren Kruis Group and started operating at the start of 1995. ASalomon Brothers study put the market penetration of its Dutch directcar insurance service (Centraal Beheer, set up in 1975) on a par withDirect Line, the UK's largest motor insurer.Direct banking, run by AVCB Bank, was started as part of the CentralBeheer direct insurance operation in 1988. It offered consumer creditand started operating as a stand-alone bank in 1992 when it got abanking licence allowing it to offer savings accounts. It now alsooffers credit cards.The bank makes use of the insurance operation's call centre, mostly fornon-clients who call to get information about the bank, often after amail-shot. Existing clients phone the front offices direct to transactbusiness, and staff at the front offices spend most of their timedealing with client calls. Product manager Cobi Weddepohl said very fewclients feel the need to call in person to the bank offices.All banking activities are being reorganised within Achmea; there arecurrently three banks with AVCB Bank selling products under fourdifferent labels. The aim is to have one bank holding company with oneback office and several front offices.Co-operative Rabobank Nederland, which has about 4.9 million retailcustomers, has an AVR unit. This was only set up in late 1994 andallows balance inquiry, funds transfer and information on personalloans.A Rabobank spokesman said its priority is "advisory banking", and thatany telephone services are additional. "Meeting customers face-to-faceis a very important part of the relationship." But the spokesman added:"That could change if the there's a need in the market. For example,our order line for share buying came in due to competition fromothers."Generale Bank Nederland (formerly Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland),while much smaller than its rivals, has dipped into the direct bankingmarket with Direktbank. It offers a limited range of banking services,and its main distribution channel is through a network of independentintermediaries. Sources in Generale have indicated it could turn moreto direct banking to increase market share without the expense ofcreating more branches.VSB Telebank, part of the financial conglomerate Fortis, was started in1990 as a result of an efficiency drive in the VSB Bank. It startedwith five staff and now has 30. Some 18 telemarketing staff man thelines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year- the first Dutch bank to offer this service.Calls doubled after the first year and have grown linearly since then.At the same time, branches are being closed or are reducing theiropening hours.An AVR unit deals with simple queries and standard calculations. Whenmore detail is required on a particular item, telesales staff willarrange a meeting with staff in the nearest branch.The bank strongly believes in tying most customers to their branches,thus overcoming the resentment often felt by established branches fromthe development of a direct banking operation. Branches are creditedwith sales made by telemarketing staff who take commission on it.The bank is careful to point out that it also has stand-alone customersin niche markets; this relates generally to the "upscale marketsegment" where it operates with financial advisers Finles, a companyspecialising in advising professional associations.VSB said that the conversion rate - the number of contacts that lead toa direct sale - is substantially higher for VSB Telebank than forbranch contacts, and said that 70 percent of VSB Telebank sales aresettled on the phone rather than through the post or branch visits.Spaarbeleg, the banking subsidiary of insurer Aegon, believes its lowoverheads allow it to offer some of the most competitive interest rateson the market. Customer numbers have doubled since 1993 to 700,000.Revenues increased by two-thirds to DFL488.5 million ($268.4 million)over the same period. It positions itself as a simple, high-interestalternative in the savings market.One of its two products is a savings account for employees ofcorporations which allow employers to offer their employees a fixed sumof money in a tax-efficient manner at an attractive rate of interest.Aegon thinks that the savings market will continue to grow in responseto the government's policy of encouraging citizens to provide forthemselves.Heinie Hakker, banking analyst at BZW, said that of the insurancecompanies nibbling the edges of the market, Aegon's Spaarbeleg has beenthe most successful, because it offers better interest rates than thebanks and also uses direct marketing techniques.A Postbank spokesman, commenting on the high interest rates offered bySpaarbeleg, admitted it would not be able to compete with this rate onall its accounts, but said Postbank has the huge advantage of a verystrong position in the payments system.The next development in direct banking in the Netherlands is theOctober 1996 launch of a multifunctional chip card. PTT Telecom, theDutch telecom company, has joined forces with ING to create a cardwhich can be used in shops, phone booths and banks. They can be loadedwith money at post offices, telephone booths, and eventually at homewith a special attachment to existing phones. The money added to thecard will be debited from a customer's account.Between them, the phone company and the bank have "access topractically every household in the Netherlands", according to BenVerwaayen, president of PTT Telecom.The system is especially designed to be an open one, and the designershope other retail groups will take part in it. The Dutch partners say aproject on this scale has never been tried before in Europe andpossibly beyond.They did not wait for the consensus that is usual among Dutch banksbefore launching a project. "The speed to market was all-important,"Verwaayen said.A similar electronic purse is being piloted by the other Dutch banks,though it is a less ambitious project than the "multifunctional" cardventure.ABN AMRO and most other banks say they are undecided about joining thenew venture, pointing out that they are already committed to anall-bank chip card project, currently under test in Arnhem.BZW analyst Hakker said: "Both ING and PTT are putting themselvesbehind it, and they are in dominant positions in their markets. It canbecome a big success. The Arnhem card has been badly received by tradeand industry because it is too inflexible and too expensive."Rabobank said it will "certainly not" be involved in the Postbank card.A spokesman said that the combined banks' card would probably beavailable in a few months, before the Postbank card, and that researchfrom the pilot project in Arnhem was very positive."On a scale of one to ten, customers gave it 7.2 and retailers gave it6.9. Retailers don't think it's too expensive. And 58 percent ofretailers would recommend it to others, said a Rabobank spokesman.PC-based home banking is well advanced. For example, Postbank has117,000 customers, including 91,000 retail who subscribe to Girotel,the PC-based home banking service launched in 1988. Subscriptions havetaken off since September 1994 - a three-fold growth was seen after theintroduction of a friendlier home banking system.The service is off-line, so users can complete all the necessary dataand send when they are ready. This has led to cost savings for the bankas well as for customers who do not have to wait for processing to bedone on-line, saving them on the phone bill.Rabobank has 80,000 private customers and 70,000 companies banking viaPCs, and expects this to grow to 200,000 within "a couple of years".The bank's PC banking started in 1992. A typical day would have about150,000 corporate transactions and 35,000 personal transactions.The use of smart phones has met with little success, however. On aPostbank test, while technically successful, customers felt that theadded convenience of banking with screenphones did not outweigh theirhigh costs."At the moment, we draw the conclusion that the coming years will bedominated by the use of the straightforward phone. Rapid penetration ofmobile telecommunication can support this. And in all circumstances wehave to rely on our staff to communicate with the customer," saidPostbank's Huizinga.AVCB Bank is trying out PC banking in 1996, and may go ahead dependingon the results of the pilot.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightDIRECT DELIVERY INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HONG KONG SET TO LEAP-FROG DIRECTA variety of factors particular to the territory mean that thedevelopment of direct delivery is taking an unusual course in HongKong. Andrew Moody reportsHONG KONG, like many centres in Asia, is a major focus for technology.The people, too, are gadget-obsessed. It is therefore somewhatsurprising that this culture of technology has not spread to directdelivery.The lack of development in this area is not because Hong Kong isunsophisticated in banking terms - it is one of the leading financialcentres of the world, and its 400 banks are a key element of thatstrength.But while the corporate banking community is fairly advanced intechnology terms, retail banking appears pretty slow off the mark. Akey reason for this is that Hong Kong is by geographical andsociological accident clumsily suited to the primary forms of directdelivery in banking.Telephone banking often requires huge space but Hong Kong, where landcomes at a higher premium than anywhere in the world, does not havemuch to spare. And in a country where unemployment has until recentlybeen insignificant, no-one, particularly anyone calling themselves abanker, wants to be a telephone operative.Sergio Rial, general manager of ABN AMRO in Hong Kong, agrees that thesteps towards telephone banking in the territory are only tentative."The real challenge and the barrier to phone banking in Hong Kong isthe people. In a place of full employment, no professional wants to bebehind a phone. I don't think they would be able to hold their heads upas a real banking professional," he says.And he adds: "Going through password procedure and paying people'sutility bills would not be anybody's idea of fun. Everybody here wantsto be part of a go-ahead marketing team, not this."So what have Hong Kong banks been doing in terms of direct deliverysystems? The first steps towards telephone banking came in the late1980s and early 1990s, pioneered by the territory's major players,Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered."We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another. Wecan do telephone, we can do fax and we have been looking at the mostcost-effective and customer-receptive forms of direct banking toimplement," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing andplanning for the Hongkong Bank and a leading figure within theterritory's banking community."Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is stilloffered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separateentity such as First Direct."But the services offered in Hong Kong are more primitive compared tomany of those in the west. The standard product is automated so that acustomer speaks to a voice-activated machine which is able to carry outsimple routine transactions. Generally, only AB and high-ratedcustomers get the chance to speak to a person, but that individual maybe someone from their branch who they would normally deal with duringthe course of their conventional banking transactions.High employment and land prices are not the only barriers to telephonebanking. The greater role played by the ATM compared to the west may beanother.In Hong Kong, the ATM is not just something in which you insert yourcard to check your balance and withdraw cash but something much morehighly prized. People can pay their utility bills, swap money betweendifferent accounts and carry out a variety of other functions.In fact, in most streets in Hong Kong the ATM machine seems to be acommunity focal point, like some open air post office, where people canstop and gossip, judging by the crowds they tend to gather around them.Staggeringly, there are 7 million ATM cards in use in the territoryserving a population of 6 million.In part, the ATM has taken over many of the functions served bytelephone banking in the west, and the average ATM transaction coststhe bank one-eighth of what it would cost over the counter.ATMs, however, are still more costly than more modern methods of directdelivery. They don't operate independently of branches. In fact, manyoperate within them, so this halfway house towards full direct deliveryis far from ideal.But the real catalyst for a wholesale change to more sophisticatedforms of banking could be the economy itself. So far, economicpressures on the banks to adopt new methods of technology havecertainly been nowhere near as great as in the west.Retail banking in Hong Kong is as profitable as virtually anywhere inthe world. Much of this has to do with the fact that Hong Kong hasaveraged economic growth rates of between 5 percent and 8 percent forthe last decade. It has also operated an infamous interest rate cartel.Bank customers have, therefore, been getting richer and moremiddle-class. There have therefore been fewer bad debtors, savingsrates have been higher and the bottom line of the banks ever bigger. In1993, for example, the Hang Seng Bank, 62 percent-owned by the HongkongBank, was the most profitable retail bank in the world, according tocredit rating agency IBCA. Consequently, banks have not been forced tocut costs by closing branches, get rid of staff and move more quicklytowards automated methods of banking.This factor, however, is beginning to change. GDP growth forecasts forHong Kong, particularly over the difficult period of 1997 when thecolony transfers from British to Chinese control, look very uncertain.A survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, published in January,points to growth slumping to 1.7 percent in 1997, compared to around 5percent now. If this is the case, retail banking in Hong Kong can nolonger rely on the ever-increasing wealth of their customers to digthem out of a hole.The new harsher economic environment has undoubtedly begun to changethe thinking among senior bank executives within the major banks.Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of the Hang Seng Bank, is inno doubt the banks will have to adapt to the new environment."What is coming will be dramatic and will totally reshape the business.By the end of the millennium retail banking will have undergone majorplastic surgery," he says. "It has become increasingly apparent thatthe future of banking lies in automation and technology applications.With the higher cost of operations, finding a more efficient way todeliver banking services to customers is one of the critical factorsfor financial institutions."ABN AMRO's Rial believes that Hong Kong banks in their evolutionarydevelopment will actually by-pass conventional telephone banking andtake a quantum step from branch banking to PC home banking. "Because ofthe constraints within the market, I can see this happening. There arealso many local factors making it difficult to operate telephonebanking in any meaningful sense, so I would not be surprised if HongKong banks took this peculiar step forward," he says.Some, however, do not quite hold with this theory. Peter Wong,vice-president of global consumer banking for Citibank in Hong Kong,believes there is mileage in telephone banking. From his office next tothe futuristic Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay, hemainly deals with higher net worth customers."We have had considerable take-up of our telephone banking services,and they have gone down well with our customers. We have a satisfactionrating for this service of 90 percent, compared with 82 percent for ourconventional banking," he said.Assuming, however, that the era of telephone banking in Hong Kong issome form of interregnum - a brief stop on the way to moresophisticated systems of direct delivery - what methods do the bankshave in mind?The leading banks are already investing heavily behind closed doorsinto technologies that will make home PC or TV banking a reality.Electronic banking is already available to the corporate market and itwill inevitably spread into the retail market. Consumers in Hong Kongare very computer literate; it is estimated that 200,000 people in theterritory are already Internet subscribers. And it is expected thatwithin just a few years, once banks have developed secure transactiontechnology, there will be a flood of customers wanting to do theirbanking over the Internet.The direct delivery of banking services into people's homes throughinteractive multi-media services may happen even more quickly. A numberof banks are planning to broadcast product information through thistechnology in 1996 paving the way to them conducting transactionbanking through this medium.Electronic cash could soon become a reality in Hong Kong with theimminent introduction of smart cards. The Mondex card is expected to beon trial later this year with a major launch in 1997. How it will takeoff is difficult to judge. It is seen in the west as an anti-crimemeasure but in Hong Kong there is virtually no cash crime.A bank likely to lead the market is the Hongkong Bank, which has beeninvesting heavily in this new technology. "We are not doing homebanking yet but we are coming along with it. We are currently workingwith Hongkong Telecom jointly to do TV banking. All the differentinterfaces which are possible technologically are being looked at,"says Hongkong's Tai.Its sister bank, the Hang Seng, is also a driving force. "In terms oftechnology products in use Hong Kong is still in the early stages oftechnology banking when compared to the western countries," says AlexAu."But although investment in new technology involves huge sums, bankscannot afford not to make the investment. For in the end, technologybanking means - for both external and internal operations - improvedefficiency, higher productivity, better risk control and lower costs."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Thisseems to contradict the general view that these products are toocomplex to sell direct, and require advice and advisers.A major attraction of buying direct seems to be"the positive experienceof the price and service benefits delivered by companies such as DirectLine and First Direct". Six out of ten customers cited value for moneyas their key motivation for wanting to buy this way.Banks were most popular among the mass market while affluent customerstended to see pensions and insurance as more complex matters requiringadvice.Customers cited companies like Marks and Spencer (17 percent), the PostOffice (34 percent), and even the utility companies (16 percent) asplaces where they would buy life assurance, pensions and investments.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Rather thanselling them off as it has done with four of the nine banks to date, itnow plans to merge the banks into two of the leading specialised banks - Polska Kasa Opieki (Pekao) and Bank Handlowy w Warsawie.Under the plan, Bank Handlowy w Warsawie will absorb Pomorski BankKredytowy (PBKS) and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH), while Pekao willmerge with Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy andPolski Bank Rozwoju (PBR).According to Standard & Poor's, "the consolidation would notsignificantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range forzloty-denominated obligations".It added that certain risks would increase in the near term, as themergers would bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio, andthe integration process could be difficult. S&P said that objectionsfrom shareholders of the already semi- privatised banks BPH and PBR, aswell as from regional bank managements "could still scuttle the deal".Recent reports from Poland said the president of BPH claimed she wouldfight the merger with Bank Handlowy w Warsawie if it meant BPH wouldlose its separate identity. And the president of Pomorski BankKredytowy is reported to have said that a takeover of PBKS and BPHwould cause chaos and delay the privatisation process.S&P said that"a more jaundiced view" held by some market players isthat the consolidation strategy is merely a ploy by the government forreasserting control over the banking system, a theory which will beborne out, it said, if Bank Handlowy w Warsawie and Pekao are notprivatised.On the plus side, S&P said the consolidation plan could give the twobanks greater diversity and market share, which could be positivefactors. Bank Handlowy w Warsawie would gain more retail deposits andcommercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution networkand possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertiseof Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokeragestrength.Thomson BankWatch ratings on Hungarian banks                                          Intra-Country  Short-TermFinancial institution                     Issuer Rating  Debt RatingBudapest Bank                             IC-C           LC-2Central-European International Bank       IC-B           LC-1General Banking and Trust Company(Altalanos Ertekforgalmi Bank)            IC-C           LC-2Inter-Europa Bank                         IC-B/C         LC-2Kereskedelmi Bank(Commercial and Credit Bank)              IC-C/D         LC-2Magyar Hitel Bank (Hungarian Credit Bank) IC-C/D         LC-2Magyar Kulkereskelmi Bank(Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank)            IC-B           LC-1Orszagos Takarekpenzar (National Savings and Commercial Bank)   IC-B/C         LC-1Unicbank                                  IC-B           LC-1Source: Thomson BankWatchCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The programme affectsabout 8 percent of the banking sector and will require small banks torecapitalise and reduce their bad debt exposures by the end of 1996.Ekoagrobanka, a small agricultural bank based in Usti nad Labem, northBohemia, was forced into administration by the CNB's BankingSupervision Committee in mid-January and remained closed for more thana week after rumours flared that it was having difficulties, creatingqueues outside its 79 branches.The CNB advanced the bank CK1 billion ($37.4 million) to help cover therush on its demand deposits, and the CNB issued a statement in supportof Ekoagrobanka and its likely recovery. Shareholders agreedreluctantly to a capital reduction by nearly CK600 million to onlyCK1.2 million plus the injection of CK500 million of fresh capital fromKonsolidacni Banka, which becomes the largest shareholder.The CNB stated that Ekoagrobanka depositors should face no limits ontheir withdrawals once the bank opens again for business. Althoughdepositors are insured for 80 percent of deposits up to CK130,000 undera new national scheme, many are nervous following the collapse of threeother Czech banks in the past two years - Kreditni a Prumyslova Banka,AB Banka and Ceska Banka.The CNB had Ekoagrobanka under close scrutiny due to its large level ofoverdue loans, but CNB spokesman Martin Svehla said unlike the threebanks which collapsed, Ekoagrobanka had a realistic plan forstrengthening its capital adequacy and was implementing that planwithin the agreed time.The 1994 annual accounts of Ekoagrobanka received a heavily qualifiedaudit from local firm BDO. The auditors noted that reserves fordoubtful debts of CK266 million should, in fact, be CK1,291 million andprovisions against losses on securities should be raised from CK25million to CK494 million. Total assets in the qualified accountsamounted to CK12,005 million.Short-term deposits amounted to 66 percent. The stated profit was CK63million on CK1,286 million of revenue. The bank had planned to doubleits share capital by issuing CK600 million of shares on the PragueStock Exchange, but there were few interested buyers.The National Bank of Slovakia followed the example of their Czechcounterparts and placed the ten Slovak branches of Ekoagrobanka inforced administration in mid-January.The CNB has not revealed the names of the banks which it has forcedinto its new consolidation scheme, partly for fear of creating furtherpressures at a sensitive time. But it is known that many small Czechbanks are struggling from high levels of bad and doubtful debts and lowmargins compared to the larger banks.Banking analysts consider the Czech Republic to be over-banked,especially with many smaller banks failing to offer a differentiatedservice and thus suffering from a lack of access to low-interest loansand poor quality borrowers.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Many banks were unable to meetobligations on the interbank market (see EEB56). The crisis left fewbanks untouched with many smaller banks in particular being badly hit.The crisis led to a shift in the balance of forces that has affectedeven top banks. It led to a serious shake-up in the banking system withmany of the top banks forging close alliances with each other.Many of the top ten banks reacted to the crippling demise of theinterbank market by forming their own alliance, offering to resumelending to each other in return for mutual access to financial records.In response to the crisis, the Central Bank is planning to introduce inMarch new laws which will determine how banks will be run and funded.It has also set up a programme to identify troubled banks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But the projects were dogged by delays,constantly changing requirements and ongoing disputes.Sporitelna claims Unisys was using the Czech Republic as a retirementhome for low-quality staff. Unisys claims Sporitelna lacked consistentpolicies and made unreasonable demands outside the terms of itscontracts. Either way, in 1995 the bank cancelled the deals and tookover training and project management, leaving Unisys with a hardwareservice contract. Both claim they are owed millions of crowns by theother.Whatever the truth of the matter, the issue has given Unisys rivals amajor competitive weapon and left the firm scrambling to convincelocals of its capabilities.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

GE Capital willhave operational control of the bank, and will provide the Bank withnew financial products, technology and training.The deal cost $87 million with GE Capital taking a 27.5 percent stakeand the EBRD acquiring 32.5 percent. In October GE Capital signed amemorandum of agreement with the Hungarian government to carry out duediligence of Budapest Bank as a prelude to purchasing a stake in thebank (see EEB57).Budapest Bank, Hungary's second bank by capital, with a comparativelylarge retail network of over 74 branches, was under pressure to securea buyer by the end of 1995 in order to hold on to a controversial statecapital injection made prior to a failed buy-out deal earlier in theyear.Swiss Bank Credit Suisse pulled out of a purchase deal following itsown due diligence. It is believed to have been mainly dissuaded by keydiscrepancies in strategy between the two banks.Budapest Bank declared a net profit in 1994 of HUF1.6 billion ($12.2million), mostly due to a capital injection of HUF12 billion secretlymade by the government to shore up losses after the compulsory creationof a HUF21 billion fund to cover bad loans. It has assets of HUF210billion and has an image as one of the most innovative banks withwestern-style management and product launches.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Bank of Lithuania suspended the operationsof the banks and froze their assets, accusing them of insolvency.The two banks which had been set to merge - Litimpeks and theLithuanian Incorporated Innovation Bank (LAIB) - are now at the centreof an insolvency and fraud investigation.The reasons for the insolvency of the Lithuanian Joint-Stock InnovationBank and Litimpeks banks are being investigated. International auditcompany Ernst & Young is performing an audit in these two banks," saida Bank of Lithuania statement.The suspensions and investigation have had a serious knock-on effect onthe rest of the banking sector with fears of a run on bank deposits.On January 9, the government and the Central Bank issued a statementsaying most of the commercial banks were operating normally andadvising people to ignore rumours about the instability of certainbanks. It also urged them not to withdraw deposits from commercialbanks and said that banks were not experiencing difficulties withpayments to customers.Reports in early January suggested that many Lithuanian commercialbanks had started to run out of hard currency as depositors rushed towithdraw funds following the suspension of the two banks. Depositors,fearing a devaluation of the national currency, the litas, queued atmajor banks to withdraw hard currency from their accounts.One report said the demand for US dollars increased tenfold since thecrisis broke, while another said hard currency deposits had dropped by22 percent and individual deposits by 16 percent. But the governmentand the central bank ruled out a devaluation.However, both the Prime Minister and the President promised state aidfor personal and corporate account holders of the two suspended banksand said the government will assume liability for their deposits.The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, passed a law on December 21bringing in a mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investorsagainst lost bank deposits.Lithuanian politics were also thrown into chaos by the crisis when theforeign minister and defence minister resigned in protest against PrimeMinister Adolfas Slezevicius's move to withdraw deposits from hisaccounts in the LAIB just days before its operations were suspended.President Algirdas Brazaukas, however, refused to accept the ministers'resignations. Slezevicius maintained he did nothing wrong and said hewould stay in office despite some calls for his resignation.There were also calls for the resignation of Central Bank GovernorKazys Ratkevicius. His resignation on January 9 was not accepted by thegovernment which felt it could cause more instability in the bankingsector. Ratkevicius rejected charges that the Central Bank had notexercised sufficient control over the activities of commercial banks.On January 12, a joint mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and the World Bank met with the Prime Minister, the finance ministerand the chairman of the Bank of Lithuania.Originally, the aim of the mission had been to evaluate the economicstate of the country. But following the crisis, it is now investigatingthe reasons behind the problems of the two banks. Together withofficials from the Bank of Lithuania, it will prepare a programme toovercome the difficulties in the banking system.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The amendment enablesthe creation of "managerial funds", which may hold majority stakes incompanies. The law, and related investment activity, is spelling a boomfor local investment banks.Voucher privatisation funds can now be converted into more aggressiveand predatory managerial funds, but only if they buy out dissentingprivatisation fund shareholders at a price equal to or above net assetvalue. That may help to reduce the massive discounts of up to 50percent at which most privatisation funds are trading.The amendment, approved by the Czech government in early January, ispartly in response to a sudden rise in mergers and acquisitions in themarket, which CS First Boston head of equity sales Peter Mayer called"a feeding frenzy".Recent corporate raids have included a $200 million shopping spree byBahamas-based US businessman Michael Dingman, with help from leadingCzech fund manager Viktor Kozeny, targeting a handful of blue chipcompanies in late 1995 (see EEB 58). The pair were closely followed bya flurry of stockmarket deals involving Motoinvest, a private firmoperating through Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, both of whichMotoinvest now controls.Motoinvest snapped up millions of discounted shares in theprivatisation funds run by the leading Czech banks, and later sold themback at a substantial profit. Komercni Banka's fund has now swallowed apoison pill to help prevent a similar raid in future. Motoinvest roseto fame by buying up heavily discounted small privatisation funds andselling their assets at a large profit.In December, Motoinvest bought the Czech privatisation fund managementoperations of Creditanstalt, one of the most popular fund managers inthe first wave of voucher privatisation. Other merger and acquisitionactivity in December included a deal by leading privatisation fundmanager Ceska Sporitelna to sell 40 percent of its two voucher funds toBankers Trust for CK6.7 billion ($252 million) - a discount of morethan 40 percent on their net asset value.Tomas Fiala, investment funds analyst at Czech stockbroker Wood & Co,said the level and scope of such financial activity may eventually becurbed by securities legislation which was proposed alongside the newinvestment funds law. The government rejected details of some of theproposals, including provisions to protect small shareholders bysetting ownership limits beyond which corporate raiders would be forcedto make a takeover bid for an entire company. Fiala said the proposalshave gone back to the drawing board but are likely to be approved byparliament after the general election in October.Fiala said the approved changes to the law on investment funds mayimprove the impact of the post-communist privatisation process uponCzech industry, since portfolio investors may now officially takeeffective control of their investments for the first time.Privatisation funds are prohibited from owning 20 percent of any singlecompany and therefore are forced to work together to achieve managerialcontrol of companies and effect operational changes. The concept ofactive management is not universally accepted and stirred controversywhen some fund managers endeavoured to"tamper" with their investments.Even so, privatisation investment funds own the bulk of shares in Czechindustry, and the result has been a slow start to economic reform inthe private sector. Some analysts claim the privatisation funds run bybanks, which are among the largest in the country, are especially toblame for the lack of commercial reform, since many own shares incompanies which are major clients of the banks, and the banks exertpressure to prevent major changes in their clients' activities.The new draft law allows the investment fund managers to manage pensionfunds for the first time. Its most likely impact is to help fundmanagers reduce costs by merging their separate management teams. Afterone year of pensions legislation, the major banks and insurancecompanies and the leading employers have already established 35 pensionfunds. Government authorities expect the total to reach a maximum of 45before shrinking as market forces dictate rationalisation and mergers.All funds will also face more stringent reporting requirements.Penalties for non-compliance are also much stiffer, at a maximum ofCK10 million plus the possibility of suspension, forced administrationand the replacement of management by finance ministry regulators.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Apoll in June by the Factum agency found 20 percent of Czechs wereparticipating in pension funds and a further 21 percent were thinkingabout it. A Social Affairs Ministry spokesman said the number ofparticipants was at the higher end of estimates. The Ministry expectsthe total number of funds to reach at least 45 this year, but due tocompetition and the lack of immediate profitability, the number isexpected to consolidate.Some pension schemes have fewer than 5,000 participants, and the figureof 100,000 participants is exceeded in only three cases: Penzijni FondKomercni Banky, Podnikatelsky PF and Vojensky Otvreny Fond.

Worstperformers are the Commercial and Credit Bank (Kereskedelmi Bank andthe Hungarian Credit Bank (Magyar Hitel Bank).Last July Thomson BankWatch acquired Bank Research Eastern Europe(BREE), a bank rating agency specialising in providing research on eastand central European financial institutions. The Hungarian ratings arethe first BREE ratings to be converted to the BankWatch scale. Intra-country (IC) issuer ratings reflect a combination of pure credit riskand performance risk, and offer a relative indication of the likelihoodof receiving timely repayment of principal and interest as well as anopinion regarding the company's vulnerability to negative events thatmay alter the market's perception of the bank.The ratings use a nine-point scale ranging from IC-A for banks withexceptionally strong fundamentals, representing low-risk, to IC-E forbanks whose viability is in doubt. The nine-point scale is IC-A, IC-A/B, IC-B, IC-B/C, IC-C, IC-C/C, IC-D, IC-D/E, EC-E.Short-term debt ratings apply specifically to local currencyobligations. The ratings range from LC-1, indicating a very highlikelihood that interest and principal will be paid on a timely basis,to LC-4, which is considered speculative. The four-point scale is LC-1,LC-2, LC-3 and LC-4.BankWatch uses a rating methodology which involves a thorough analysisof both financial as well as qualitative factors. Emphasis is placed onmanagement, market position, ownership, the local environment andstrategic initiatives. Extensive on-site due diligence is conducted onan annual basis."For Hungarian banks, the environment has been extremely challengingover the last several years. Delayed bad debt work- outs, under-investment in modern systems and few sophisticated services in anineffective regulatory environment have all hampered the restructuringprocess in the banking sector," explained Ramin Habibi, president ofThomson BankWatch-BREE.As in other eastern European countries, Hungarian state-owned banksinherited a huge volume of bad loans from the old economic system.Major reforms were initiated in 1987 with the introduction of a two-tier system. However, Hungary's massive foreign debt burden held backthe state from cleaning its banks' portfolios as quickly as inneighbouring countries. Since then, state-owned banks have beenrecapitalised along BIS norms, and bad loans have been swapped for long-term state bonds under the Loan and Consolidation schemes initiated in1992 and completed at the end of 1994."While much improved, asset quality remains an issue," said Habibi."The fragmentation of supervisory responsibilities has impededeffective regulations. Hungary's unique situation has given foreign andjoint-venture bonds an unprecedented opportunity to penetrate thedomestic market. Such intensified competition has fostered a newrapidly evolving environment, with local management becoming much moreclient- oriented and responsive to market needs."Overall, much progress has been made to establish a well- functioningfinancial system - one that can operate without the support of thegovernment, but there still is a difficult road ahead."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE PROSPECTS ARE GOODEastern Europe, though still a drop in the ocean in terms of worldinsurance premiums, is a rapidly growing market. In the first part of amajor survey, EEB reports on the state of the industry in countries ofeastern central Europe.AFTER YEARS of reforms the turnaround in the insurance industry ineastern Europe appears to have begun. Despite the fact that the worldmarket share of the region amounts to less than 1 percent and theinsurance industry is still extremely under- developed, the prospectsare good.Clearly-defined rights of ownership and privatisation of the economyare of the utmost importance for the insurance industry, according to a1995 report by Economic Studies Unit of Swiss Reinsurance Company(Swiss Re). An important indicator for progress in this area, it said,is the private sector's share in total production which, in mostcountries, rose to over 50 percent by the middle of 1994.But, it added, insurance penetration - the proportion of income spenton insurance policies - is still quite low throughout the region,ranging from 3.4 percent in Slovenia to just 0.3 percent in Romania.In Slovenia, incomes and insurance penetration stand at around half theEU average, and in the other eastern central European countries atabout one-third. The low penetration could be attributed to the factthat in the first few years of the changeover to a market economy,premium income fell in most countries.The year 1993 appears to have been a watershed for insurers in easternEurope. The falling rates of inflation, the economic upturn and theturnaround to sustained real growth in premium have been having apositive effect on the insurance industry since 1993. The volume ofpremiums in the region increased by an average of 8 percent comparedwith the previous year. Worldwide, growth stood at 6 percent. Premiumvolume continues to grow at a faster rate than on the world market as awhole.The countries of eastern central Europe accounted for 62 percent oftotal premium volume in 1993, with Poland the most important singlemarket. However, in 1994, Russia replaced Poland as eastern and centralEurope's biggest single market. But Swiss Re noted that, apart from inPoland and Slovenia, it has not yet been possible for eastern Europeancountries to make up for the sharp downturn in insurance activity whichoccurred in the first few years of the transition to a market economy.Life insurance has shown the highest growth in most countries. However,it is also exceptionally underdeveloped, accounting for just 25 percentof premium volume in 1993 against the European Union average of 50percent. The decline in economic activity resulting from the changeoverto a market economy affected life insurance more than it did non-lifeinsurance, according to Swiss Re. Only in Poland and Slovenia was thereany increase in the initially very low level of life insurance, itsaid.In 1993, the life insurance sector in eastern central Europe began toexperience strong growth. Provided inflation rates continue to fall andthere are improved investment opportunities on the developing capitalmarkets and tax incentives for private provision for old age, the lifeinsurance sector should also see above-average growth in the yearsahead as levels of prosperity rise, according to Swiss Re.In the non-life sector, motor insurance is expected to dominate. Marineinsurance has also helped to push up growth in non-life business. Butmotor insurance is expected to continue to account for 40 percent-50percent of this sector, in line with traditional developing marketgrowth patterns, until rising prosperity levels make for more diversedemand.General third-party liability insurance is also projected to growsignificantly. Indeed, in contrast to western Europe, it couldinitially outstrip personal accident and health cover, a segmenttraditionally more than twice as large as liability. Agriculturalinsurances, which were very prevalent when reforms began have fallenoff considerably and their importance looks set to decline evenfurther, especially in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.But reinsurance rather than insurance is likely to grab much of thelimelight until eastern European countries are in a position to raiseminimum capital requirements. These are still being kept precariouslylow due to the structural weakness of the insurance sector and the lackof capital.Under these conditions, reinsurance is of the utmost importance forsafeguarding solvency, said Swiss Re, both by providing support to newprivate companies during the process of growth and by helping with therestructuring of the former monopoly companies, which often do not havean adequate capital base.That leaves reinsurers, especially foreign ones, in a strong positionto tap a regional market which hands over 5 percent more than theEuropean Union's average of 17 percent of non-life insurance toreinsurance. Most countries are eager for foreign reinsurers to take onthe secondary insurance market that no local players are willing orprepared to supply adequately.The progress of the past five years has also been helped by the reformsin the regulatory framework of the various countries and the enactmentand enforcement of supervisory laws. Different approaches have beentaken by different countries - Poland's market is highly deregulatedwith emphasis on financial control and Hungary has substantive controlfor all products.It should be noted that regulations in various countries are still in astate of flux with regulations to be passed or laws completed. Thelegislators in the countries of eastern central Europe have beenstrongly influenced by European Union Directives when draftingregulatory legislation.POLANDAlthough replaced by Russia as the region's biggest single insurancemarket in 1994, Poland's insurance sector continues to grow quickly.Economic development, a decreasing level of inflation and theprogressive adjustment of legal regulations to EU directives creategood opportunities for the insurance sector, according to corporatefinance and advisory services firm Ernst & Young in Warsaw.Among the 41 insurance companies licensed to run insurance businessesin Poland, 13 are conducting life business with the remainder runningnon-life business.In 1993, the Polish market represented 27 percent of the total premiumcollected in eastern Europe. In 1994 all insurance companies jointlycollected a gross premium equal to ZL4.15 billion ($1.75 billion) - 33percent more than in 1993.In the first half of 1995 the gross premium collected in the lifebusiness increased by 40 percent more in comparison with the first halfof 1994, while the gross premium of the non-life business was 21percent more.In 1994, almost 70 percent of premiums were accounted for by generalbusiness with the remainder accounted for by life business.At the beginning of the 1990s, the development of the life productsmarket was rather slow due to high inflation, low average real wagesand the marginal size of the middle classes.The majority of the Polish population had one cheap group lifeinsurance with a very limited level of protection. However, Poland'slife insurance industry enjoyed dramatic growth in 1993 and 1994. Lifeinsurance premiums collected in 1994 were approximately 45 percenthigher than in 1993 and amounted to around $0.6 billion.Taking into account that inflation was at 32 percent in 1994, thisrepresents a real increase of about 13 percent. In 1994 the main areasof growth were in group life policies. PZU, the state- owned insurancecompany which still dominates the Polish market, collected premiumsamounting to $500 million, although its market share decreased to 95percent.In the first half of 1995, PZU's market share reduced further to 90.3percent, losing out to foreign insurers Commercial Union (5.2 percent),Amplico (3.9 percent), AGF (0.4 percent) and Nationale-Nederlanden (0.1percent).The continuing development of the life insurance market will depend onthe level of economic growth, inflation trends and changes in thesocial security system and income tax policy, according to Ernst &Young. The following factors will determine the development of the lifeinsurance market in the coming years.1. Unfavourable personal tax treatment of life products. However, theregulation introduced this year allowed the companies to consider lifeinsurance premiums for the first time (paid on behalf of employees) ascompany costs. Life insurance premiums will not be tax deductible inthe short and medium term unless an aggressive lobbying campaign isconducted.2. Further postponement of the social security reform since 1990. InApril 1995, the Council of Ministries presented the draft of the SocialSecurity Act with a new pension system (consisting of a state pension,a social insurance pension and a voluntary pension plan).Realistically, a programme for social security reform could be preparedand approved in 1996. This programme will definitely not be "a shocktherapy", but rather a step-by- step approach, explained Ernst & Young.Regulation concerning close-end funds and pension funds have also beendrafted and will be passed and implemented in 1996. This may startbenefiting the life insurance market by 1997 or 1998.3. VAT on insurance agents' services was implemented in 1995 and had abig impact on agents' incomes. Under pressure from the insurance lobby,tax decreased to 7 percent until the end of 1995. The tax rate for 1996is still unknown.4. The monopoly of PZU and state protectionism. In June 1994, theMinistry of Finance accepted a plan presented by the management of PZUfor its privatisation without turning to the EBRD for a $200 millionloan designated to boost the company's reserves. Under the plan, theMinistry opted to split the PZU into two separate companies. Butfollowing the change in government at the end of 1995, it was decidednot to split the PZU, but to leave the company intact and privatise itin 1996 through the sale of shares to employees, individual investorsand carefully selected institutional investors.5. Low confidence in the financial institutions among the Polishpopulation. Such an attitude was the result of Polish private banks andprivate insurance companies going bankrupt.Ernst & Young said that the economic growth of 1994 points to theresilience of the recovery which was initiated in mid-1992. Theeconomic mechanisms launched a guarantee that the rate of economicgrowth will be kept at 4.5 percent in the 1990s and long-term inflationis showing a gradual downward trend.The annual inflation rate which was 32 percent in 1994 is expected tofall to 10 percent in 1999. Therefore, it can be expected that thedevelopment of the life insurance market will accelerate in the comingyears, said Ernst & Young.Foreign insurers may not open branches in Poland until 1999. However,they may set up separate companies, in full accordance with Polish law,and/or enter into joint ventures with Polish partners. Despite localcompanies facing technical problems, a lack of qualified personnel andlimited solvency, a number of foreign companies are approaching themarket.The most popular distribution channel is the own distribution network,a regional level structure, with branches and sub- branches orrepresentative offices. The number of independent brokers and agents isgrowing, with around 600 brokers now licensed in the country.According to Ernst & Young, co-operation between different insurancecompanies and Polish banks is expected to grow with the increasingacceptance of the idea of bancassurance and the fact that most of theforeign companies created joint-ventures with Polish banks when theyentered the Polish market.A law on insurance activities was passed in July 1990. However, due tothe rapid development of the market, much-needed changes wereimplemented with the Insurance Act in October 1995. Ernst & Young saidthat these changes had the following objectives:* Increase the compatibility to EU directives;* Better protection of the insured by increasing the financialrequirements of companies applying for an insurance licence as wellexisting insurers. In particular, the share capital for insurersentering the market, should equal the minimum guarantee capital(Ecu800,000 for life business or Ecu200,000-Ecu400,000)* Increasing and clearly defining the power of insurance supervisionwhich will control insurers, brokers and agents. An independent Officeof Insurance Supervision (OIS) will be established. At present,insurance supervision is part of the Ministry of Finance.* Re-drafting all the provisions unclear in the former insurance law -in particular, the licensing rules for new insurers and requirementswith respect to actuaries will be described in more detail.* Clearly defining the rights and obligations of insurance brokers.These provisions are based on recent EU directives.The Ministry of Finance must issue a licence for a company to set up aninsurance business. A company may not issue both life and non-lifepolicies. Neither can they engage in other non-insurance business. Theycan only operate as joint-stock or mutual companies.There are strict guidelines regulating reserve capital, contingencyfunds compensation in the case of a lack of compulsory insurance (likemotor vehicle third party liability, fire insurance for farmers' realestate, farmers' civil liability). The assets may be invested only inapproved instruments, with some limitation to the portfolio'scomposition.According to Ernst & Young, the Polish Finance Ministry which, for themoment, supervises the insurance sector, is to press for astrengthening of the capital base of Polish insurance companies. Inorder to prepare domestic companies for direct foreign competition inthe domestic market after 1999, foreign companies who want to enter thePolish market are strongly encouraged to merge with small Polishinsurance companies.HUNGARYThe Hungarian parliament passed a new insurance law in 1995 which cameinto effect on January 1 this year. All newcomers to the insurancemarket must set up separate life and non-life companies. The 14existing insurance companies will not be forced to establish newcompanies but will be obliged to clearly separate accounting andmanagement structures for each sector.Insurance companies will also face new minimum capital requirementswith the introduction of the distinction between organisational andsecurity capital, distinguishing between operational and businesscommitments.The new legislation also modifies the supervisory environment,eliminating the need for permits for non-life products. The existingState Insurance Supervision (ABIF) agency's remit will cover ensuringcompliance with legislation, rights protection for insurance companyclients, monitoring of applications by insurers and supervision ofcompanies' financial status and investment procedures.Life insurance start-ups must continue to obtain permits for theirproducts and have initial security capital of at least HUF250 million($1.8 million). New non-life operations will be required to havesecurity capital of at least HUF150 million and up to HUF70 millionmore for certain categories of product.Although foreign insurers are admitted only by the establishment ofsubsidiary companies or through participation, the market is dominatedby outsiders.Allianz is reportedly in negotiations with state privatisation agencyAPV to sell the German group the remaining 9.2 percent public stake inlocal non-life leader Hungaria. Allianz has already built up a 90percent holding in Hungaria, which own 0.8 percent of its own stock.CZECH REPUBLICThe implementation of a new insurance law has been in the pipeline forsome time as the current law dates back to May 1991. In any new law,solvency regulations are intended to be in accordance with EuropeanUnion directives.Insurance penetration in the Czech Republic is around 2.5 percent andlike other eastern central European countries is growing. Motorliability and occupational accident insurance is compulsory.There are no limits on the establishment of foreign insurers but cross-border services are not permitted. Germany's Allianz and Italy'sGenerali both denied speculation recently that they were interested inbecoming strategic investors in the Czech insurance giant CeskaPojistovna in which private fund manager PPF (Privni Privatizacni Fond)recently bought a 12 percent stake.Both already have domestic Czech insurance operations which althoughmuch smaller are more flexible and able to target the most profitablesectors of the market.PPF bought its 12 percent stake from Ceska Sporitelna, the formermonopoly state savings bank at the end of 1995 and is negotiating withInterbanka, the Hungarian-owned Czech merchant bank, over its 7 percentstake in the insurer.PPF claimed it was a long-term investor and denied it was acting for athird party. But analysts of the insurance industry say PPF is unlikelyto hold its stake for long, but may want to build a sizeable positionand find a strategic investor.Although Ceska Pojistovna is losing market share as the number ofcompetitors swells, it still claims more than 70 percent of the mainsectors such as life and motor insurance, and its revenues are growing.It has raised motor premiums substantially and is lobbying hard for anoverhaul of the compulsory third party sector, in which it is the sole,reluctant provider.Analysts also point to substantial reserves of more than CK64 billion($2.4 billion) and numerous other activities such as fund management aslikely magnets for an investor or strategic partner, either local orforeign.Elsewhere, Czech health insurers were forced to reassess their budgetsin December after most had their business plans for 1996 rejected bythe government.Only five of 27 insurers got a clean bill of health under a tough newgovernment fitness regime. In an effort to spruce up the industry, thegovernment has demanded that health insurers make more realistic incomeforecasts and keep administration costs under 7 percent of revenues.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus estimated that seven of the rejectedinsurers should have no trouble getting in shape by their secondattempt in January, but that still leaves 15 insurers on the criticallist.As a result, a rash of mergers is likely to break out among the smallerfunds. But such mergers will not be easy, due to a list of problemsincluding long-standing debts to hospitals and doctors and difficultieswinning projected volumes of clientele."The system has many childhood diseases," said Frantisek Beranek,general director of insurer Vojenska Pojistovna, referring to the factthat the first health fund was established only in 1993. Vojenska hadits own plans rejected, but Beranek was confident of winning on appealafter its accountants gave it a more thorough check-up.The insurers' woes reflect the dismal state of the Czech healthindustry, beset by increasingly volatile labour relations and blatantover-billing by under-paid doctors. Insurers owe more than CK5 billionto health providers. But even if they can pay their bills, they areoften too busy investigating claims of unnecessary treatment by doctorswho are paid per consultation.Challenging claims is the insurers' responsibility and their onlychance to improve profitability in an industry where both premiums andthe cost of services are set by the government.Czech health sector costs have risen from 5 percent of GDP in 1992 tothe current level of 8 percent and the government is struggling to finda solution. It is considering a range of plans including mandating asingle agency to collect all revenues and limiting the scope of allother insurers to offering only supplementary medical services.If the government does choose radical surgery, the quickest recoverymay be made by the General Health Insurance Company. It was the firstto start business and it now insures 6.7 million people - well overthan half of the country.SLOVAKIAInsurance operations in Slovakia are governed by the insurance law ofDecember 1990 which was implemented in March 1991. Changes to the laware expected to bring solvency regulations in line with EU directives.Branch separation is planned for life and non-life businesses.The minimum capital required to set up a non-life insurer is SK20million-SK30 million ($672,429 - $1,008,640) and SK50 million for lifeinsurers. There have been no limitations on the participation orestablishment of foreign insurers since the beginning of 1992. However,higher deposits are required for foreign establishments. Cross-borderservices are not permitted. Supervision is the responsibility of theMinistry of Finance.SLOVENIAA new insurance law, based on earlier German and Austrian legislation,was passed in October 1995. This succeeded a law which had been inoperation since mid November 1994. However, further changes will beneeded to bring Slovenian law in line with European Union regulations."This law should last for about two or three years, but it must changeto open the market and align it with the EU. But Slovenian insurers arestill not prepared for competition," explained Dr Miro Koncina of ITEOmanagement consultants in Ljubljana.Under the law, a guarantee fund has been established for insurancecompanies consisting of DM1.5 million ($1.04 million) for life insurersand the same for property casualty insurers. Supervision is carried outby the Ministry of Finance. There is no branch separation between lifeand non-life business, although separate accounting is required.Majority participation by foreign insurers is possible, although thisis not the case in reinsurance companies. Foreign insurers must beregistered in Slovenia to operate there and cannot sell products fromabroad into the country.Insurance penetration, while quite low by European Union standards, isthe highest in eastern central Europe at around 3 percent-4 percent orDM800 million-DM900 million in premium volume. The market is continuingto grow strongly, according to Koncina, but needs to reach a premiumvolume of DM1.5 billion.He concedes that the process of changing people's attitudes isdifficult. "The difficulty is that people are still waiting for statesocial insurance," he said."We are in transition. We have a middleclass with money. We must spread this capital and this involveschanging tradition and culture. It is a process and it is changing."The proximity of Slovenia to EU countries like Italy, Germany andAustria is making this process of education easier, he said.Former state monopolies still hold around 60 percent of the totalinsurance market with the rest held by small independent companies andjoint ventures between Western and local firms.In the second part of the insurance survey EEB will report on themarkets of Bulgaria and Romania, and Russia, Ukraine and Estonia.Eastern Central Europe - Premium Volumes (1994)                Premium       Population                volume in     in          Insurance   InsuranceCountry         millions US$  millions    density(1)  penetration(2)Poland          1,806         38.60       46.78       1.91%Slovakia          287          5.35       53.57       2.30%Czech Republic    981         10.33       94.94       2.82%Hungary           885         10.29       86.01       2.09%(1) Premium per capita in US$(2) Premiums as % of Gross Domestic ProductSource: National associations and insurace supervisory authorities;WIIW; Swiss Re.Insurance in eastern EuropePOLANDMarket Structure:       36 companies (26 Non-Life, 10 Life)                        Market share of the 3 biggest companies                        1993 (1994)                        Non-Life:                 86.4%     82.8%                        - PZU                     65.7%     61.0%                        - Warta                   18.1%     19.0%                        - Polisa                   2.7%      3.0%                        Life:                    100%      100%                        - PZU Life                99.2%     95.1%                        - Commercial Union         0.4%      2.9%                        - Amplico                  0.4%      2.0%                        Market share of foreign insurers(2):                        Non-Life:                 <1%       <2%                        Life:                     <1%        4.9%Insurance law and       Law on insurance activities as of 28 Julysupervision:            1990 with various amendments and                        supplementary regulations.

Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keepingcontrol of that growth and turning it into profits is a differentmatter.Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, withfiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking evencurrently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according tomanaging partner Duleep Aluwihare."We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some ofour more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage tocontinue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run outof investment opportunities."Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one ofthe few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although itplans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice orCracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In orderto set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going tomaintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve inthis marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticketitems," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basicwork, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clientsinclude Poland's finance ministry.Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrandand Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived inPoland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess whenthe firm should start making a profit.Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking last July before returningto the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're not justhere for a financial return on investment, we're here to make sure thatCoopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking atopening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of themarket, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firmhas acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bankand of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successesinclude the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, whichraised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing groupOkocim.PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgetedto start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After fiveyears in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-nationalcompany investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growthis running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where thefirm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clientsinclude Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatisedBank Gdanski.Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some timeare KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche."We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner BillDrysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where weare largely self-sufficient."Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at BarentsGroup, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of newclients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firmrecently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run itsGerman practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have afully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said."Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics groupSiemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polishclients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurancecompanies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices inCracow and Poznan during the last year.At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits getsshort shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm hasalways been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financialsupport from outside, other than very small amounts. All the otherfirms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they haveX amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of itsrivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw andSzczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is aheadache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line."Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It'sdifficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated intoa corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standardsright way."E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as muchbusiness as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when ithired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T."These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speakonly with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Oftenyou'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,all the rest will follow."The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in thePolish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is thesmallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strongposition in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firmtook action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz ashead of the Polish business. Leslaw Paga was head of the PolishSecurities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is surethat Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitelyenhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said."There have been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its positionin Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industriesand service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong positionin financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say wewere latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"he explained.Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bankand of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's 64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in thebanking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk andCracow during 1995.Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four othermid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co- ordinatingpartner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "thesort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging withanother firm.He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name theprospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to anothernetwork. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we arelooking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with aheavy UK or English language capability," he said.Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switchedinternational affiliations from CKL International to Alliott PeirsonInternational during 1995. Baltic Accountants continues to alsorepresent RSM International and GMN International.The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issuefor many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firmslike to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to localclients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing inPolish equity partners than others.Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firmholding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and USaffiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has beengiven the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, whileKPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managedfirm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly-owned by Deloitte ToucheTohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent fromthe start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the localpractices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agreethat fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gapbetween what western firms are charging and what local clients arewilling to pay is narrowing.One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment mustpay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet themarket half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper localfirms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it firstarrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in"strategic situations".Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of awestern-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came intoeffect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accountingprocedures more into line with International Accounting Standards andto move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on taxcompliance.Another area where western accountants are making more encouragingnoises is in relations between the international firms and the localChamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when thechamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted tothe chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners thatPoland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shuttingnew blood out of the profession.Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences beingmended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciaksaid. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of coursethere will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bitfrightening to them."While the situation regarding audit training and exams remainsunacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamberwill rethink its approach.Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous inadmitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems tohave gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably bereviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said."And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all partof the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make surethe chamber is a strong and active body."Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and thatthe growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feelsthat this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We allexperience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."Poland: Key economic indicators                                      1994      1995*     1996*GDP real (% change)                    5.1       6.0       5.0Industrial output (% change)          11.9      12.0      11.0Inflation (% change)                    32        29        22Unemployment rate (%)                 16.0      14.6      14.0Average monthly wages (ZL/month)       460       620       780Trade balance ($/M)                   -836    -1,000    -1,500Current account ($/M)                 -944    -1,400    -1,900Exchange rate (ZL/$)                  2.27      2.50      2.85* Forecast Source: CreditanstaltLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND- FEE SPLIT (%)                                               CorporateFirm                    Audit Accounting Tax   fincance  MAS  OtherArthur Andersen(1)      40     -         20    15        15    10(2)KPMG                    50     -         20(2) 15        15     -Ernst & Young           33    17         33     -        17     -Price Waterhouse        43(3)  -         33(2)  -        24(4)  -BDO Binder              86     2          5     2         4     1Interexpert Poland      25    45         20     -         -   105Arnold Hill             40    20          5     -        35     -Staniszewski & Richter  60     -         30     -        10     -PNA Audit-Union         25    25         22     -         8    20(1) Figures do not include Andersen Consulting(2) Includes legal(3) Includes accountancy(4) Includes corporate finance(5) Includes consultingSource: International Accounting BulletinLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND RANKED BY TOTALSTAFF                                       Number of Number of                   Number    Number    charge-   admini-                   of        of        able      strative  Total                   offices   partners  staff     staff     staff                   1994 1995 1994 1995 1994 1995 1994 1995 1994 1995Ernst & Young(1)     5    6    7    8  139  314   50   58  196  380Coopers & Lybrand    2    2    9   11  127  174   64   66  200  251Arthur Andersen(2)   1    1    7    7  n/a  200  n/a   40  n/a  247Price Waterhouse     1    1    5    6  120  161   54   44  179  211KPMG                 1    3    7    8   97  162   21   30  125  200Deloitte & Touche    3    4    6    6  124  144   20   27  150  177Misters Audytor    n/a    3  n/a    6  n/a   44  n/a   11  n/a   61Sadren             n/a    1  n/a    3  n/a   37  n/a    4  n/a   44TG Consultants     n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a   34  n/a    4  n/a   40Rodl & Partner     n/a    3  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a   22   36BDO Binder           1    2    3    4   15   20    6    7   24   31Moore Stephens - RIR Revision        1    3    1    2    4   26    1    2    6   30Potworowski Kinast   1    1    2    2   16   24    3    3   21   29Interexpert Poland   1    1    5  n/a   18  n/a    3  n/a   26  n/aBRA Salustro Reydel            n/a    1  n/a    1  n/a   17  n/a    2  n/a   20Arnold Hill          1    1    1    1   12   12    2    3   15   16Tax-Audytor        n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a    9  n/a    3  n/a   14Baltic Accountants and Consultants     1    1    1    1    9    9    2    2   12   12Staniszewski & Richter           n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a    4  n/a    1  n/a    7PNA Audit-Union    n/a    1  n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a    1  n/a    4(1) Figures refer to Sep 94 and Sep 95(2) Figures do not include Andersen Consultingn/a = not availableSource: International Accounting BulletinLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND- WHO'S WHOArnold Hill (HLB)ul.

Sources predict non-discriminatory ATM surcharges will be thebanking issue of 1996 as financial services providers try aggressivelyto reap profits from alternative delivery methods.     No national EFT network allowed its members to surcharge prior to1996.  However, 14 state legislatures passed laws prohibiting suchrestrictions.     Visa's PLUS ATM network will allow its members to surcharge onApril 1, 1996, and many regional EFT networks have lifted theirsurcharge bans.      MasterCard's Cirrus network has not lifted its surcharge ban anda company spokesperson said it does not plan to change its position.     The Wilmington, Del.-based MAC EFT network, the second-largestregional network in the  country, said last month that it will allowsurcharging in 1996.Competitive Pressure     Many financial institutions and other third-party ATM owners suchas Plano, Texas-based EDS and Dallas-based Affiliated ComputerServices, claim they cannot support the cost of placing ATMs in low-volume transaction areas without a surcharge.  However, consumergroups say surcharging is just another means for banks to add to theirrecord profits.     The networks receive no money from the surcharge.  Surchargerevenue goes directly to the ATM owner.  Banks claim they needsurcharges to compete with third-party ATM owners such as EDS andAffiliated Computer Services (ACS), which negotiate contracts withcasinos and malls.       Some bank executives said EDS and ACS can outbid financialinstitutions for these contracts because they offer the retailers acut of the surcharge.     "A lot of pressure is on banks to surcharge even if they arephilosophically opposed to it," said Joseph Pendleton III, senior vicepresident of electronic banking for Wyomissing, Pa.-based MeridianBank.  "If they don't [surcharge], they will not be able to manage anoff-premise program with significant value."Who Wants the Surcharges?     The non-financial ATM owners are not so sure financialinstitutions are really opposed to surcharges.      One ATM owner suggested banks may be hiding behind the third-party ATM owners to avoid public outrage.     "We are in favor of surcharging and believe it will give us theability to deploy more ATMs," said T.A. "Kip" Hyde Jr., a director ofEFT development for ACS.  "As far as people like us and EDS pushingit, that is not entirely true.  Banks are learning that in off-premiseATM sites, there is only a certain [limit] to the expenses you canbury in marketing costs."    ACS surcharges range from $.50 at convenience stores to $2 atcasinos in its 4,100-ATM MoneyMaker Network.  EDS charges from $.25 to$1 at approximately 10 percent of its 5,800 ATMs, according to companyspokesperson Carol Winters.    Consumer interest groups don't believe the claim that remote ATMscost too much to run.  "Banks are already able to save billions inteller and branch costs with ATMs and they are already generatingbillions in fees," said Janice Shields, a banking researcher for theWashington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of Responsive Law (CSRL). "Now, we are just adding more profit to the top."    According to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) -- anaffiliate of CSRL -- ATM transactions generated more than $2.55billion in fees, while saving banks $2.34 billion in teller costs in1993, the last year for which such figures have been compiled.  TheCFA claims more than $.78 in profits was generated for every dollarcollected from consumers for ATM services.    With consumers being charged for using an ATM not owned by theirbank and then having a surcharge added on top of that, shouldn't theindustry be concerned that transaction volumes will decrease?    The majority of the machines with surcharges exceeding $1 will beplaced in areas where the consumer desperately needs the money andwill pay for convenience, ATM owners said.  For example, highway restareas and casinos present prime surcharging opportunities.A Transaction Drop?    New Orleans-based GulfNet EFT Network has allowed its members tolevy surcharges because the Louisiana and Mississippi legislaturesoverruled the mandate of the national networks.  However, DelTonguette, president of GulfNet, said transaction volume has not beenaffected by the surcharges.     Nearly 87 percent of GulfNet's 4,000 ATMs carry member surchargesand Tonguette said pricing has not been an issue.  He claims setting afair and equitable surcharge is easily determined by the consumer. ATM owners who charge too much will quickly lose transaction volume.    "I am gratified to see at least Visa has seen the light.  Oneprediction that I can make is that MasterCard and all of itssubsidiaries will follow suit," said Tonguette, who has been a staunchproponent of surcharging.    The MAC Network, which is owned by Wilmington, Del.-basedElectronic Payment Services (EPS), admits it is not exactly sure whateffect surcharging will have on transaction volume, but it does notbelieve it will inhibit growth.    "A lot of discussion and consideration [went into our decision],"said Barbara Link, an EPS spokesperson.  "It is difficult to sayexactly what surcharging will mean.  Certainly, the banks would liketo have a lot of say [in determining whether surcharging is prudent]."    Reston, Va.-based Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA)has not taken a position on surcharging because it claims members aredivided on the topic.  Consequently, the EFTA has not lobbied any ofthe national or regional networks to lift the surcharge bans.   However, Kurt Helwig, executive director of the EFTA, said EDS hasvocally supported surcharging, while other financial institutions haveopposed it.  Helwig understands both sides of the argument:  "This isyet another issue we cannot take a position on.  [However,] to date,studies have shown consumers are willing to pay for convenience ...[But] ATM owners have to be smart about pricing because the consumer isgoing to decide this marketplace."Government Intervention    As banks begin to learn how much consumers will pay for theconvenience of remote ATM services, it appears ATM owners will nothave to worry about scrutiny from Capitol Hill.  According to Shieldsof the CSRL, "consumers don't exactly have a good Congress for[surcharge reform] now.  It is not a good legislative climate to tapATM fees."    The CSRL is working with representatives in Washington to draftlegislation that would require disclosure of fees before a transactionis completed.    Despite the push for surcharges, fees are not the only answer toincreasing ATM installation and maintenance costs.  EDS's Winters saidATM owners can lower their costs by offering more services, such asstamps, event tickets, calling card vouchers and travelers checks. These services can require the bulk of the surcharges, while ATMactivity is left relatively untouched.  (Kurt Helwig, EFTA, 703/435-9800; T.A.

Back to Headline List CopyrightEFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996PROPRIETARY SMART CARD PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE STEADY GROWTH IN 1996Smart cards will continue to gain market share this year, but theirgrowth still will fall short of the explosion enthusiasts seek. Millions of smart cards will be issued this year; however, themajority of them will be used in closed systems such as collegecampuses or large business headquarters, according to Basil Bromberg,president of Dallas-based smart-card consultancy Smart Cards USA.    "The big open systems are all waiting for a bank to issue [smart]cards," said Bromberg.  "Niche systems will develop more quickly. After that, the shared smart card will [arrive].  For instance, atransportation industry may link with a school [identification card]where the [bus company] can buy some of the memory on the I.D. and thekids can use the card to pay for the bus."Sports Stored Value    The eyes of the financial services industry will be on theVisa/First Union smart card pilot at the Atlanta Summer Olympics thissummer.  Visa and First Union plan to launch more than 1 million smartcards in an open system pilot.    Bromberg called the pilot a glorified closed project.  "It isonly a large- scale show, really," said Bromberg.  "It is an accesscard.  It is nice.  It is no great brainstormer.  The trouble is thatonce the Olympics are over, all you have is a souvenir."    It is easier for the banks to see the profitability of a closedsystem at this point in the smart card's development.  The bank wouldmake money in a proprietary system by sponsoring the transactionhandling and money transfer.    The specialized sport stored-value card, as employed by theNational Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars, will continue to gainmomentum.  The Jaguars have issued stored value cards that can only beused inside the stadium to purchase refreshments or souvenirs.    "That is going to take off like a rocket," said Joseph PendletonIII, senior vice president of electronic banking at Wyomissing, Pa.-based Meridian Bank.  (Basil Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502;Joseph Pendleton, Meridian Bank, 610/655-2726.)      Back to Headline List CopyrightEFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996NYCE ATM NETWORK BUILDS HOME BANKING PLATFORMThe NYCE EFT network said it is ready to expand into home banking andtake advantage of the largest single opportunity for EFT transaction-building.  As a result, it could pose a challenge to industrymainstays MasterCard, Online Resources, Servantis and Visa.    NYCE, the largest EFT provider in the Northeast and a subsidiaryof Hackensack, N.J.-based Infinet Payment Services, invested at least$2 million in creating a bank-branded home banking and electroniccommerce services platform, according to NYCE President and CEORichard Yanek.    The main goal of the platform is to create a single interface forNYCE members to access customer financial institution information fromany personal financial management (PFM) software product and anyaccess device.    Without NYCE or another commercial interface, if a bank wants toallow its customers to use PFM software from Intuit's Quicken, Meca'sManaging Your Money or Microsoft Money, the institution must build aseparate interface to each vendor.  NYCE will manage the interfacesand act as a translator so the bank's customer information will lookthe same regardless of the customer's means of access.    Three to four institutions of various sizes will begin pilotingthe NYCE product in the second quarter of 1996, Yanek said.  Theproduct should be commercially available to NYCE's 1,200 memberinstitutions by the end of 1996.      "We tend to think of this [product] as a transporter translator,"said Yanek.  "What comes through to the bank [is the same no matterwhat the PFM software].  We already have the pipeline [to the banks]. And, very importantly, think of the cost of implementing such asystem.  We are spending a substantial amount of money.  But it isminuscule compared to what an institution would have to spendindividually."    NYCE is negotiating with "all of the providers on the markettoday," Yanek said.    New York-based MasterCard, Reston, Va.-based Online Resources,Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis and San Francisco-based Visa startedsimilar home banking "translation" software in the last 12 months. However, Yanek claims NYCE's system will be the only one to be bothon-line and interactive.A Change in Branding Philosophy    All NYCE EFT products carried the NYCE brand prior to homebanking.  Yanek said NYCE has decided to allow the institutions tobrand their home banking offerings.    "With services of this kind, the consumer is operating within thebank.  They are working directly with the bank," said Yanek.  "Hence,there is no need for the NYCE logo.  That contrasts with what existson the marketplace today.  When you sign on with Quicken, you see aroster of all of the Quicken banks.  It is counterproductive.  Whencustomers sign on, they want to see or hear the name of their bank."    What NYCE loses in name recognition, it could gain in transactionvolume and licensing fees.      Yanek predicts that home banking transactions will buildgradually, and by the end of the century, each home banking householdwill complete approximately 24 transactions per month.  Currently,each ATM cardholder performs an average of one transaction per month.    In addition, NYCE plans to license and offer equity in theproduct to other large EFT networks.  Yanek said preliminarydiscussions have begun, but don't expect small networks to join thehome banking mix just yet.    "Small networks will not venture unless it is free-ride," saidNew Orleans- based GulfNet EFT Network President Del Tonguette. "Offering home banking is fine with me as long as [someone else] paysfor the expensive startup."    Omaha, Neb.-based bill-payment provider SmartPay paid all of thecommunications and hookup costs to link GulfNet member banks HancockBank and Jefferson Guarantee.  The increased transaction volume atthese two banks has been negligible, according to Tonguette.     Tonguette, however, believes home banking will be a very smallpiece of the action through the rest of this century for his company's277 financial institution members.    The future of home banking could be here for large networks likeNYCE.  Before creating the home banking platform, NYCE surveyed itstop 25 banks in addition to 125 other members of various sizes, askingthem to set their priorities from a list of 27 possible productofferings.    Home banking and bill payment services were highest on therequest list from the top 25 banks and second on the list for theremaining banks surveyed.  At the top of their list was enhanced ATMservices.    Financial institutions also want their customers not only tocomplete conventional home banking transactions but also to haveaccess to financial periodicals and the Internet.    "The reality is that [consumers and banks] are desiring somethingmore than home banking," said Yanek.  "A better term is 'electronicfinancial commerce.'  We see a need for something more than a simpleset of transactions."  (Del Tonguette, GulfNet, 504/643-5070; DickYanek, NYCE Network, 201/488-6111.)  Back to Headline List CopyrightEFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996DIEBOLD EXPANDING INTO ATM MAINTENANCE     Diebold no longer sells only automated teller machines (ATMs). The Canton, Ohio-based company is producing and selling ATM managementsoftware to avoid any loss of revenue if the ATM market becomessaturated and profits flatten.     Many EFT sources predict new ATM sales could decrease sharplyover the next 5 to 10 years.     Interbold, Diebold's ATM joint venture with IBM, holds 55 percentof the U.S. ATM market.     Diebold took its first step into the ATM software managementarena at last month's Bank Administration Institute (BAI) RetailDelivery Conference (RDC) in Atlanta.  Diebold and its partner,Optical Data Systems of Richardson, Texas, have created a newnetworking solution for client-server systems.     The local area network (LAN) hub and ATM-driving software allowsbanks to download programs and change ATM screens in seconds, saidHarry Bosch, Diebold business development manager.     The system can help banks increase uptime because ATMs will nothave to be down as long for changes.  It also can save bank personnelcosts because it eliminates the need to change programs and screens by"sneakernet" -- employees visiting each machine to load software, hesaid.    Additionally, banks can improve marketing efforts because thesystem allows targeted screen changes, Bosch said.  For example, if abank wanted to run a promotion involving a certain chain of grocerystores, the 50-or-so ATMs at that chain can be loaded with aspecialized screen, he added.    In the security arena, Diebold also released an event managementsystem.  The software will identify ATM device failures, analyze thesituation, open a trouble ticket and determine the proper course ofaction without human intervention.  It sends faxes to the owner-bankor beeps a service representative, Bosch said.    InterBold displayed many of its updated machines at the RDC.  Themachines can read and cash checks, print courtesy amounts and givechange.  Updated ATMs also can dispense checkbooks, stamps andtickets.  Interbold's most advanced technology was demonstrated in itsMicroBranch, a sit-down kiosk with touch-screen monitors, dualtelephone handsets and videoconferencing.  The outside walls of thekiosk change from clear to cloudy when occupied for privacy.    Diebold has the right idea in enhancing and expanding its ATMproduct line, said Megan Robertson, a Smith Barney analyst:  "ATMs arecommodity products, so this is a value-added product.  That's theright stuff."    Competitor Fujitsu ICL offers similar enhancements and AT&T'snewest machines offer coupon-printing capabilities. DIEBOLD AT A GLANCEDiebold 5995 Mayfair RoadP.O.

CONTINENTTSB BANK, the UK's eight largest retail bank, has concluded contractualarrangements with Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and Banque Francaisedu Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), which will give the German and Frenchbanks access to the UK clearing system, for low-value cross-borderpayments. Developments are already under way to make the link two-way.Manus Fullerton, head of TSB International, said the deal will allowWestLB and BFCE to make payments to British beneficiaries, whilecomplying with the proposed EC directive on cross-border payments."We are able to fulfil this contract using our existing technology,which is seen by our European partners as offering significant benefitsin building a pan-European payments network," he said. "The otherfactors which came into play were service levels and price . . . Thecombination of TSB's proprietary systems and SWIFT's solution for bulkdata transfer (IFT) has allowed us to develop an innovative andattractive product."WestLB, in turn, has been nominated by the German savings banks astheir agent for sending payments to the UK. At the moment, TSB has seta limit of #10,000 ($15,600) for transfers to the UK, while WestLB hasa limit of DM5,000 ($3,200) for payments to Germany.Alan Gibson, international services manager of TSB's Edinburgh- basedinternational division, said: "There are some technologicaldevelopments taking place to establish our links, so I would not liketo say how much it will cost. We are happy with the investment made dueto the service benefits for our customers and the steps we are takingtowards meeting EU legislation.""We see an expansion of cross-border payments, both within the EU andfurther afield. The proposed EU directive on cross-border payments,which will insist on small payments being made more cheaply and faster,is a challenge which we have anticipated for some time," Fullertonsaid.TSB is discussing similar arrangements with a number of other banks inEurope and further afield. "The cross-border payments system iscontinuing to evolve. This process will develop and gain momentum.Customers will see benefits in terms of improved levels of service,greater product choice and reduced cost", Fullerton added."We are happy with the transfer arrangements", Wolfgang Grauer, managerof international payments at WestLB, told EPI. "We chose TSB becausethey are a well-known bank and we have already worked with them ininternational payments. Since mid-December we have been sending masspayments and it works. Volume is slowly growing."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED STATES:  FEDWIRE TO UPGRADE IN 1997THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors has expanded the format forFedwire funds transfers to be more compatible with the comprehensiveformats used outside the US. It has also pushed back implementationdeadlines to the end of 1997, a year later than previously discussed.In addition to a longer timetable, the Fed last month opted forstaggered-date phase-in, with separate deadlines for send and receivecapabilities. The Fed rejected having all banks switch on the same day,fearing that with 11,000 banks the risk of disruption to the system wastoo great. "We did not believe it was practical to do a one-daycut-over due to our large size," said Louise Roseman, associatedirector of the reserve bank operations and payment systems division.The Board ruled that all banks must be ready to receive the new formatby May 1997 and to send by the end of December. A small number of bankswill be authorised for same-day change over.Expanding the format was first recommended by a task force of theAmerican Bankers' Association, though bankers acknowledged that thecosts of conversion will be very high. The greatest disagreement hasbeen over how and when to implement the changes. The expanded formatwill permit banks to include the names and addresses of transferoriginators and beneficiaries, which are also required under newTreasury regulations.As a result, the format of Fedwire transfers will be more consistentwith those used by the Society for Worldwide Interbank FinancialTelecommunication (SWIFT) and the Clearing House for Interbank PaymentsSystem (CHIPS), operated by the New York Clearing House. From anoperations standpoint, US banks will able to increase automation andfacilitate more end-to-end processing of international transfers."The new format will allow banks to facilitate mapping of transmissionsfrom other transfer systems. It will make Fedwire more consistent withSWIFT and CHIPS, and will allow for more automated mapping without theelimination of any critical payment information," said Roseman.Roseman said some of the highest-volume banks will be authorised tocomplete a same-day change over in June 1997. Smaller banks will havean easy transition since the Fed-provided software will be upgraded forthem. The expanded format was supported by the country's largest banks,particularly those which transact business outside the US through othersystems. "This format will effectively make the Fedwire system morecompatible with other payment systems - SWIFT as well as CHIPS," saidSy Rosen, vice president of payment systems at Citibank."More importantly, it defines fields now that would allow one toeffectively, more directly, translate format messages from othersystems. From the viewpoint of efficiency and automation, it really isa plus," he said."When you have this smaller format, sometimes, when you map from onesystem to another, you can't necessarily map one for one," Rosen said.But with the new, expanded format operations staff will be better ableto translate messages field by field, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED STATES:  PAYMENT BY FAX MADE SECURETWO COMPANIES have developed systems that use computer fax technologyfor secure funds transfer over public telephone networks. The systemtransforms a fax machine into a front-end device for access toautomated clearing houses and financial wire services.MoneyFax, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, holds US and internationalpatents. Parties initiating a transfer are registered with the MoneyFaxsystem and draw a unique item number for each pay order, much like apaper cheque. Transmissions are encrypted and paperless, so theelectronic documents can be stored efficiently.The MoneyFax system, which can be set up at banks or processor datacentres, offers such amenities as image scanning and interactive voiceresponse. It also notifies the sender and receiver by fax whentransmissions go through. MoneyFax is ready for delivery, according topresident William Benton. It is being piloted in a Canadian bank, whichhe would not identify.As well as talking to banks and third-party processors, MoneyFax isseeking approval from US and Canadian governments that would allow thesystem to be used for electronic tax payments.CONNOTECH, based in Montreal, has a patent pending for a payment-by-faxsystem. Its president Thierry Moreau said that over the last two yearshe has developed a cheque-replacement technology that allows computerfax-users to send data and images securely over fax lines.This system ensures protection against misdirected calls, as well asconfidentiality so that only the intended party sees the document,Moreau said.CONNOTECH is currently negotiating with partners in the US and Canadato install the system, which will be ready for field trials in ninemonths.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995SINGAPORE:  NETS HIT BY BREAKDOWNSSINGAPORE'S NATIONAL eftpos system, run by the Network for ElectronicTransfers (NETS), is showing signs of strain. Recently, the systembroke down four times in two weeks.The breakdown in service affected the whole of the island and occurredduring the pre-Christmas shopping "rush hour". The breakdowns do notusually last more than half an hour, but the latest incident lastedthree hours, just three days before Christmas. Shoppers who depended onNETS for payments were furious at the system's failure.The breakdown was blamed for longer queues at the check-out counters ofmany retail outlets, because customers did not realise that the NETSsystem had broken down, and check-out staff did not know when theservice would be restored.NETS attributed the recent spate of breakdowns or "system down-time"to the surge of users trying to transact at the same time. A NETSspokesman said the system, which is usually configured to handle fivetransactions a second, was reconfigured to handle twice the volume inanticipation of the demand of the festive season and peak-hour shoppingactivities. Apparently, the system failed when actual transactionsexceeded 10 per second during peak hours, causing the breakdowns.This has raised concerns about the system's ability to cope withincreasing volume during peak hours. Interestingly, while trying toincrease the capacity of its system to handle more transactions, NETScaused similar breakdowns in service on several occasions during thesame period in 1993.NETS has since assured the public that it has "rectified the hardwareproblem" and is "fine-tuning the system to handle the sudden surge intransactions". It has also decided as part of a longer-term measure toupgrade the eftpos system to meet a higher transaction demand.In the mean time, to address public concern about the system and toenhance its response time to another breakdown, it has set up acustomer hotline service.On a separate issue, NETS has announced that the pilot phase of itsnational electronic purse project, CashCard, has been delayed for thethird time. This follows similar postponements in July and in the finalquarter of 1994.NETS said the pilot implementation of the CashCard, which is to takeplace at two locations, was delayed by the final technical test, whichis still on-going. It stressed that the pilot can only proceed afterthe final technical test is completed, because security issues andfeatures which"cannot be compromised" have to be resolved first.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED STATES:  PROCESSOR ENABLES BANKS TO PRODUCE CARDS INSTANTLYFIFTH THIRD Bancorp's transaction processing subsidiary, MidwestPayment Systems (MPS), together with Atalla Corporation, are selling acard activation system that would allow banks to issue debit cardsinstantly in the branch.Atalla's Card Activation and PIN Selection (CAPS) 2000 System allowsbanks to issue debit cards, replace lost or stolen cards, and rewritethe magnetic stripe of damaged cards.It also has the customer service benefit of letting depositors choosetheir own PIN code. Financial institutions can perform most of thesefunctions in the branch that previously required outside providers,reducing costs and waiting times.According to the agreement, MPS installs CAPS. It also markets thebranch terminals which are the size of POS card-swipe devices, to itsclient banks. The system is capable of driving up to 240 terminalsdistributed through branches.MPS, a Cincinnati-based transaction processor, claims it is the onlyone to offer the service. Smaller banks can now offer the serviceavailable at larger banks without the expense of buying the centralcomputer, Atalla explained. Client banks would pay MPS a fee for everytransaction. The amount of the fee was not disclosed.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UK SHARES TRADE TO GO LIVEA UK BANK is to launch an electronic share dealing scheme available toany personal computer owner before the end of September.Jack Lang, technical director of Electronic Share Information (ESI),the Cambridge-based company behind the new share-trading market, toldEPI it was "well down the line in discussions with two leading banks toprovide an interest-bearing account for customers to use on-line".Although its main use will be to facilitate rapid payments for shares,Lang said the account would also offer other banking services. He wouldnot disclose which banks were involved, but said the project would golive either in June or September, following the summer holiday season.He expected developments of the service in due course, with furtherbanking services and home shopping.The company is the brainchild of a group of electronics and computerspecialists, chaired by Hermann Hauser, founder of Acorn Computers.They believe ESI will revolutionise share dealing, in much the same waythat general insurance was transformed by Direct Line. "It will reducecosts by an order of magnitude," said Lang. "Flotations will be about atenth of the cost of floating a company on the London Stock Exchange,and share dealing will be considerably cheaper."ESI will specialise in flotations and dealing in the shares of smallcompanies, challenging the London Stock Exchange and its AlternativeInvestment Market (AIM), which will be launched to replace the unlistedsecurities market.By using a personal computer to buy and sell shares via a modem, thecompany expects to dramatically reduce the cost to small investorsgetting involved in the market. "If you take some of the mystique awayand reduce costs to say a #10 ($15) dealing fee, you can offer arealistic return on a #200-#300 investment", says Lang.Speed will be a key attraction. The software, developed by TCAMSystems, a UK-based software supplier, will allow customers to log on,pass through security procedures and buy packets of shares from ESI'spublic order board. The bank would then transfer the fundsautomatically from the account of the buyer to the seller. Langestimates an average transaction will take seven seconds."We needed tofind banks which have immediate money transfer systems, rather thandoing it overnight".There are 9 million shareholders in the UK, almost half of them holdingshares in government-privatised firms. By providing affordable, directaccess to share dealing many of these may be tempted to play the marketregularly.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED KINGDOM:  FIVE BID FOR PO CONTRACTA CONTRACT for an electronic stop-list to clamp down on benefit fraud,which costs the UK government #220 million ($340 million) a year willbe awarded shortly.This will offer short-term protection against fraud before acomprehensive overhaul of the benefits payment system takes place.Benefit order books will possibly be replaced by smart cards. At themoment pensions and other payments are made using a personalisedbenefit order book issued to each claimant. Although they are alreadybar-coded, copying and theft of books is commonplace.A Senior Post Office Counters spokesman said: "given the need to combatorder book fraud, we hope to finalise things as soon as possible".Five technology companies, including ICL Enterprises and Gemplus, aretendering for the initial contract, which will develop a combinedbar-code reader and electronic stop-list. It will be tested"in about1,500 post offices in a large metropolitan area," said Wilson. Withexperience of the fraudsters' ability to adapt to and beat anti-fraudsystems, the Post Office is concerned that as little information aboutthe reader and the test location (which is likely to be London) isreleased. If successful, the system will be rolled out to all postoffices.Two contracts which apply to the automation of the UK Post Offices willbe awarded. The larger contract for revamping the entire paymentssystem is expected to be announced before the end of the year (see EPI92).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995PORTUGAL:  NEW BARCLAYS SYSTEM AIMED AT COMPANIESBARCLAYS BANK has launched a "global cash system" to replace itstraditional electronic banking system in Portugal. According to thebank's marketing director, Gloria Brito, the new system is "aimedprimarily at businesses hoping to cut accounting costs, although it isopen to anyone who wants it".The system involves a computer link-up between a customer and the bankand is broken down into three components - cash management, cashpooling and cash express.Cash management allows for cash movements within the country, and forup-to-date information on money and exchange markets. Cash expressallows international cash transfers to be carried out on the same day."In effect, it is as if the customer were linked to the internationalSWIFT network," explains Brito.Cash pooling is aimed at centralising customer's accounts. "A customerwith several accounts can consolidate his various accounts on a dailybasis, thus increasing his positive accounts or reducing hisoverdrafts." The system, says Brito, also means that a customer canmake predictions on their accounts in conjunction with the cashmanagement programme.Brito says it is difficult to evaluate the investment made by the bankin the new system. "Most of the necessary software already exists inEngland, although we have had to modify it slightly for the localmarket. This includes making a translation of the software intoPortuguese, something we are working on at the moment. It should all bein place by the early part of next year."The system is already available to some 50 customers in Portugal, mostof them large companies who have swapped it for the old electronicbanking system.Barclays says it is not worried about whether or not the system can payfor itself."Its real aim is not to directly make money, but rather toincrease our customer portfolio and to increase the movements of ourexisting customers,", Brito told EPI.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995IBOS SIGNS UNIBANKTHE INTERBANK On-line System (IBOS), set up by Royal Bank of Scotlandand Banco Santander in Spain, has signed Unibank, Denmark's secondlargest bank, to the network.Unibank becomes the seventh financial institution to join thereal-time, cross-border payments network. It is also the first bank inScandinavia to become involved, and brings an extra 440 domesticbranches to the IBOS network, increasing the number in Europe to 3,800.According to Jorgen Christian Andersen, first vice president ofUnibank, discussions with IBOS had been on-going for about six months.He said Unibank decided to join in order to compete with larger bankswhich have a global presence."It is a good way of getting a branch network all over Europe withoutthe costs," Andersen told EPI. Andersen said it should be ready to golive in the second half of this year.Unibank plans to offer the service only to corporates with regularcross-border payment needs. It will not be offered for one-offpayments; they will be sent through the normal SWIFT channels, he said.The other members in IBOS include: Banco de Comercio e Industria inPortugal; Credit Commercial de France; Kredietbank in Belgium; andFirst Fidelity Bancorp in the US.Economies of scale have proved elusive for IBOS, which is essentiallycompeting with the giant message carrier SWIFT, despite protestationsto the contrary. IBOS's future was secured last year following thedecision by US-based technology company EDS to buy a stake in thecompany.The cost of joining IBOS, said to have been a deterrent to joining, issaid to have dropped following the purchase by EDS of a stake in IBOS.According to Andersen, the most expensive element is adapting Unibank'sback office systems to be compatible with the IBOS software.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995GZS SETS UP SUBSIDIARYGESELLSCHAFT FUR Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the bank-owned German paymentssystem, has set up a subsidiary for payments transfers which, it says,will allow cross-border bulk payments in Europe to be made in three tofive business days, compared with seven to fourteen days at present.The new operation, known as Bank fur Zahlungsservice or BZS, willhandle smaller-denomination payments of up to  Ecu 2,000 or DM5,000($1,600-$3,200).Payments may be routed from any of the German banks that are members ofGZS. They include all major institutions.According to GZS, the rationale for the new bank is to realise quickand low-cost transfers of funds within the European Union in line withthe European Commission's Green Book recommendations of 1990.BZS will be the German link in the chain of automated clearing houses(ACHs) which should eventually extend to all European countries. Memberbanks will be charged a fixed price per transaction and are expected topass on any cost benefit to customers.A GZS spokesman said that each member bank would have to calculate itssavings individually, but acknowledged that Germany's major bankinggroups might still find it cheaper to operate their own systems.The co-operative banks' TipaNet system, for instance, offers flexiblearrangements for cost-sharing between the sending and the receivingbank and should eventually deal with substantial volumes.BZS will make transfers to ACHs in other European countries and to itsmember banks on a bulk basis. At present, the system can handleeurocheques only. While GZS hopes to extend the service to bank chequestoo, no final decision has been made on whether to offer that facility.BZS is not yet in a position to operate a pan-European system. Thepilot system set up with Belgium has gone into operation immediately,and the link should be extended to the UK, Austria and Italy in thecourse of this year.Frankfurt-based BZS will be headed by Detlev Buchal, the chiefexecutive of GZS, and Gerhard August Stern, who was previously head ofpayments systems at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995CANADA'S INTERAC DOWN, BUT UPINTERAC DIRECT Payment, Canada's national on-line debit network,weathered its first Christmas season as a fully-deployed system,handling volumes that were almost three times higher than December1993.Several bankers gave the debit card system glowing marks for itsperformance. However, the system suffered a set back during the heightof the Christmas shopping season when local and wire news mediareported that HMV Canada, a major chain of record stores based inToronto, complained that the system caused "frustrating delays."Interac general manager Fred Harris told EPI the system experienced nosignificant downtime in December, while other defenders dismissed thecomplaint as an isolated case. In addition to problems within themerchant's system, longer transaction times could be attributed tosystem-clogging volume: a peak 1.2 million transactions passed throughthe system on Christmas Eve, he said. He did not expect that Interacwould be modified as a result of the complaint."If that is the case, then I would suggest that there was a systemfailure," said Mel Fruitman, president of Retail Council, anassociation of Canadian retailers, adding that a debit system shouldwork quickly and accurately no matter what day it is. "Even ten secondsis an infinite amount of time when people are waiting. If a system ishaving these delays, it is not meeting customer needs," Fruitman said.Interac features a distributed system, Harris explained. When onebank's card is used at a "foreign" POS terminal, the transaction ispassed to the issuing bank for authorisation and clearing. Interacmaintains no central switch, except for a central diagnostic facility."We did not see any degradation or problems with the core network,"Harris said. With the distributed architecture of the system, heexplained, transaction delays could be traced to any number of steps inthe cycle. Of 26 million transactions made with Interac cards, 18million to 19 million went through the core interchange backbone.According to Harris, 5.5 million cardholders used the system 26 milliontimes in December, generating C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) in sales - amore than 50 percent increase over August's C$892.5 million in sales.And compared to December 1993, when 2.5 million customers generatedC$500 million in sales, system volume last month almost trebled."We think it will double again this year," Harris predicted. Thegreatest system growth took place after April, when Ontario was linkedto the system. Ontario is also the province where most national chainsare centred.In other news, Harris said the Bureau of Competition is stillscrutinising the network. Earlier in 1994, it was revealed thatregulators were investigating Canada's only EFT network after itreceived complaints of excessive fees and charges.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995US FED HITS `SHOULDER SURFING'THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors took aim at "shoulder surfing,"a technique used by criminals at ATMs, by eliminating the requirementthat banks print a consumer's account number on every ATM receipt.According to an interim rule approved last month, banks are no longerrequired to "uniquely" identify the consumer's account or card numberon ATM receipts.Previously, Regulation E, which governs electronic fund transfers inthe US, specified that banks print a consumer's number so that atransaction could be clearly identified. It is presumed that banks willtruncate the account number to three or six figures out of a 12 numberaccount, enough so that a transaction can still be identified.Criminals can often videotape or photograph people entering their PINs,which they then combine with receipts that are often disposed at theATM. Criminals are then able to counterfeit cards and access accountswith the PIN codes.Losses due to counterfeiting are conservatively estimated at $25million to $40 million, according to Tami Ishida, a senior researcherat Dove Associates, a Boston-based consultancy. She agreed the interimchange would help to slow fraud losses.While issuers will win out in the long term by denying counterfeiterscritical data, converting terminals to accommodate the new rules willcause some expense, she observed. Acquirers will have to re-programmesome 400,000 POS terminals and 109,000 ATMs.Industry reaction was positive. A spokeswoman for the Star System, oneof the largest EFT networks in the US, said her network was pleasedwith the change. "This will significantly help curtail the size of theproblem caused by shoulder surfing," she said.However, she added that the interim rule is vague and the industrywould be better served with uniform standards."It allows too much roomfor interpretation. We're urging them to be more specific so theindustry has better guidelines," the spokeswoman said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995INFINET BOSS SAYS REGIONALS WILL PROSPERREGIONAL NETWORKS may face pressure from neighbouring regionals,national brands and non-bank processors. But there are substantialopportunities, even as customers demand increasingly sophisticatedservices, according to InfiNet Payment Services chief executive RichardYanak.In a December 21 speech before the Electronic Banking EconomicsSociety, a professional association in New York, Yanak described hisvision for the future of the newly-created InfiNet and for other bankEFT networks."People value their time even more than they value money," he said,listing the first among absolutes that rule today's payments industry."We need to deliver those services whenever and wherever they arewanted."Until now, Yanak said, shared networks were limited to transactionswitching, terminal driving and other aspects of maintaining ATMsystems, such as card authentication and embossing. In the next yearand beyond, networks will introduce remote banking, electronic billpayment, off-line debit, and electronic purses, he said. And as banksface pressures to reduce costs, InfiNet could serve as a bank-owned,third-party service provider to the virtual bank, Yanak said. Bankershave to examine if they need a data centre or back office. Yanak warnedthat past in-house efforts have not shown success. Chemical Bank andHuntington Bank both have launched bill payment systems to no avail, hesaid.Providing new and expanded services will help to generate new revenuefor member banks. Yanak told the EBES attendees that InfiNet willexplore developing in-house services, buying other enterprises andforging business alliances. "Every service can generate a fee incomefor our members. If priced properly, consumers will pay," he said.Yanak said InfiNet is looking at creating a terminal leasing business.The network would strike deals with manufacturers, buying large numbersof units at lower prices and leasing machines to banks. By partnering,he said, "InfiNet would guarantee manufacturers substantial orders at aprice lower than is available to any individual bank. Participatingbankers, who would pay a monthly rate, would be sure to always receiveupdated ATMs."Yanak questioned Visa and MasterCard's apparent direction of late, andsuggested the traditional division of territory could be jeopardised."Are the regional networks superfluous? Under the right circumstances,they wouldn't be needed," he said. But banks have turned to regionalnetworks to remain competitive. "A substantial fraction of the paymentsbusiness has moved to non-banks, in part due to the policies set out bythe associations."This year, Yanak observed, the creation of Visa Interactive remotebanking and MasterCard's purchase of the BankMate network in St Louisposed tangible threats to regionals. While advising a wait-and-seeapproach, Yanak said the nationals should be watched. "If competitionbetween the national and regional networks increases, regionals willhave no choice but to implement universal interchange," he said."Both associations say they support the bank brand in its relationshipwith the customer. The difference between them and us is that webelieve it," he said. For the good of the banks, in the battle for thehearts and minds of consumers, Yanak called for a national brand to beplaced on the back of cards.Member banks face continuing erosion of their relationship with thecommunity due to the growing dominance of the national marque, Yanaksaid."When national brands are put on the card, it usurps the localbrand and it sounds the death knell of the depository account business.We have to come to grips with that reality," he said. Depicting a worsescenario, Yanak said a powerful corporation, such as General Motors,might create a GM National Bank and offer deposit access services viathe national systems.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995FIRST NATIONAL SWITCH/AUTHORISATION CENTREAPPLIED COMMUNICATIONS (ACI) the US-based EFT solutions company, hasannounced it has signed an agreement with CSG Card Services, the US'slargest card processor for credit unions, to form the first nationalswitch/authorisation centre that is owned and operated by the CreditUnion System."This agreement allows us to offer credit unions a complete EFTpackage," said Elizabeth Taylor Quilliam, CSG vice president ofsales/EFT services."We can now provide a single point for authorisationservices, whether to Visa, MasterCard, a national or regional ATMnetwork or a shared branch network.

The new giro facilitatesovernight electronic domestic money transfers among the country's500-plus bank branches.Before the launch of the system, bank-to-bank transfers routinely tookdays and even weeks, representing a major obstacle to the country'stransition to the free market.After extensive training of thousands of employees in every bank branchin the country, the system's architects managed to convert from anantiquated network to the new X-25 packet switching system betweenFriday November 18 and Monday November 21, 1994. Under the old system,magnetic tapes and disks were delivered round the country by train."The effort was no small peanuts," said Peter Braun, president ofGiro's board of directors. "We didn't get much sleep before thelaunch."Braun is also the deputy chief executive of Orszagos Takarekpentzar(OTP), the national savings bank, and the country's largestdeposit-taking bank with 365 branches. Giro, the system's legal owner,is held proportionally by all of the commercial banks who are obligedby the National Bank of Hungary to belong to the system. OTP holds thelargest stake at 22 percent.The overnight X-25 system is itself intended to be a back-up system toa realtime giro due out later this year. The network runs on a seriesof Intel Pentium-based PCs, linked via satellite and microwavetransmitters, with further back-ups made on floppy disks.Transfer orders are sent in the late afternoon from branches to theGiro headquarters in Budapest, where they are sorted overnight fordispatch early the next morning. The pending real time system, madepossible by a World Bank grant, will be administered on a Bull DPS7000mainframe.One reason for launching the overnight back-up system before a realtime system was to determine whether the back-up system was functioningproperly, according to Pal Kerekfy, software director for IDOM, adomestic information technology company which administered thetransition to the X-25 exchange.In addition, the Bull network has been delayed for more than two yearspending the central bank's newly-defined system of liquidity controlamong commercial banks. Now, the National Bank sets a liquidity limitfor each bank daily. The X-25 network's software was developed from thebeginning to accommodate the liquidity limits, while the Bull systemstill has to be modified accordingly, Kerekfy said. IDOM, which wastaken over by Deloitte & Touche last year, also won the tender toadminister the installation of the Bull system.Before the projects are completed, all commercial banks will have toadopt a new system of client account numbers. At the moment, the banksuse as many as 40 systems of keeping track of client accounts, saidKerekfy.The National Bank has devised a new system, also to be implementeduniversally this year, but it has decided to delay the new accountnumber system until after the launch of the Giro as"it was consideredtoo much of a shock to modify both systems at the same time", Kerekfysaid.In more than a month of operation, the new giro system has functionedwithout a problem, apart from the occasional human error among clients.The margin of error is within the 1 percent to 2 percent internationalnorm, said Braun.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995FRANCE:  SELF-SERVICE EXTENDS TO STOCK TRADINGIF A new series of tests succeed, self-service banking may be extendedto include stock exchange transactions. The tests are being undertakenin two branches of CIC-Paris (Credit Industriel et Commercial), and maybe extended to other banks and branches where sufficient demand exists.The CIC-Paris experiment is being undertaken in partnership with theSociete des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which manages the French stockexchange. It is scheduled to run through June 1995. During this period,CIC-Paris and SBF will analyse results based on quantitative andqualitative considerations. These include: the number of users; what itis used for; and clients' suggestions. A decision on whether or not toextend the service will then be made.The test terminal, known as the "Borne-Bourse", consists of aspecially-equipped Minitel (part of the French national videotexsystem) with a colour screen, a keyboard and a smart card reader called"LECAM". Initially, there will be one terminal in each of the two testsites.Users of the service simply put their bank card into the card readerand enter their PIN code. This gives them access to the CIC-Paris stockmarket videotex service. Menu-driven software guides them through thesession.At the moment, the service includes three offerings: personal portfolioinformation (by value, rubric, settlements, and taxes); generalinformation on various stocks and the market, on privatisations and onCIC-Paris mutual funds; and order placement for buying, selling,cancellation or amendment. For reasons of security, clients mustconfirm any orders they pass by entering their PIN a second time. Underthe present experiment, clients must use terminals only at brancheswhere they have an account and a portfolio.SBF made the decision to run this trial last year, following thesuccess of its"Points-Bourse" information terminals. The Points-Bourseprogramme, which was launched in 1992 in partnership with variousbanking networks, provides clients with up-to-date SBF stock exchangedata using a system called Chronoval.The programme has grown dramatically since October 1992, when thenumber of these terminals located within branch offices totalled 45 insix banking networks. By the end of 1994, there were 263 terminals usedby 28 partner banks. SBF officials hope for similar success with thenew venture.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995PAYMENTS COME OF AGEPreviously the poor relation of the banking industry, payments areincreasingly seen as the most interesting and profitable area of thebusiness. Electronic Payments International looks back at some of thedevelopments of the past year which have shaped this thinkingIF 1993 was the year when eftpos took off, then 1994 was the year ofthe smart card. The issue of rising telecommunications costs, coupledwith the problem of fraud, forced banks to move away from traditionalmagnetic stripe technology and look at the alternatives. Without doubt,1995 will see a continuing migration to chip card technology.Smart CardsEncouraging results from France's Cartes Bancaires smart card system,prompted banks in other countries to begin investing in the technology.Cartes Bancaires' decision to replace magnetic stripe cards with chipcards was criticised by local banks and dismissed by the internationalbanking community as an expensive folly.However, events in 1994 vindicated Cartes Bancaires' decision. Cardfraud in France dropped by 50 percent between 1992 and 1993, fallingfrom 0.08 percent to 0.04 percent of all transactions. This translatesinto losses of Fr207 million ($40 million) at the end of 1993, asopposed to Fr472 million in 1991. Interestingly, though, CartesBancaires abandoned its electronic purse project being developed withLa Poste, the French postal service.In January, National Westminster Bank in the UK announced the imminentlaunch of Mondex, arguably the most ambitious smart card scheme. Thecard, which includes an optional wallet, is being developed inconjunction with British Telecom (BT), the UK's main telecom supplier.Midland Bank, a subsidiary of the giant HSBC corporation, alsoannounced its involvement in the scheme.Due to go live this year in a pilot in Swindon, Mondex allows users totransfer funds between their bank accounts and their cards through BTtelephones and adapted NatWest and Midland ATMs.Tim Jones, senior executive of IT, strategy and policy at NatWest, andthe man behind Mondex, said the scheme differs from other electronicpurse schemes in that Mondex aspires to replace cash, with no audittrail. Cardholders can transfer money between wallets and can lock itwith a PIN-code. If the person loses the wallet, the cardholder haslost the money.Despite, or perhaps because of, its technical sophistication, Mondexhas been severely criticised by industry sources. At the InternationalSmart Card Conference held in Frankfurt in February, Tim Jones cameunder fire from speakers from Banksys, Belgium's national paymentsorganisation which has developed its own electronic purse scheme, andfrom others who questioned Mondex's security and economic viability.Armand Linkens, director of marketing and sales at Banksys, said theteam developing the Belgian pilot looked at Mondex and concluded that,because it leaves no audit trail and because it is an "open", ratherthan a "closed" system, the potential for fraud was considerable.However, Mondex does have its proponents. Jerome Svigals, a US-basedsmart card consultant, said NatWest has taken a bold step in the rightdirection. Firstly, it increases productivity at the bank and theretailer because it eliminates cash handling. Secondly, the banksbenefit from the float created by a prepaid card.In fact, the industry became increasingly divided into two camps: thepro-Mondex banks and the closed system banks.A further division within the smart card industry was created by thecard associations, Visa and MasterCard/Europay. In December 1993, Visaand MasterCard/Europay agreed to co-operate on chip cardspecifications. The decision was greeted with enthusiasm by theindustry, but failed to hide the fundamental differences between thecard associations approach to smart card applications.Under the leadership of Charles "Chuck" Russell and with Roger Peircein charge of delivery systems, Visa was less enthusiastic about smartcards than MasterCard. Although this philosophy changed with theirdeparture - Russell left as president and chief executive officer atthe end of 1993, while Peirce left in March 1994 - Visa is stillunconvinced that smart cards should be implemented as a replacement formagnetic stripe cards. MasterCard, and particularly Europay, havecommitted themselves to migrate to smart cards within an ambitious timeframe.At Europay's annual members' meeting in Bergen, Norway, theassociation's board agreed to invest Ecu1 billion ($1.2 billion) toimplement smart cards. It expects its members to begin introducingsmart cards by 1996. Understandably, the decision was dismissedas"headline-seeking" by Visa.Europay claimed that members would see a return of $2 billion within aseven-year period as a result of a reduction in fraud. Visa, meanwhile,replied by saying these figures were only relevant to Europay, sinceits fraud was higher than Visa's. This is because Visa had reducedfraud as a result of its Card Verification Value (CVV) technique.It was not long after the Europay board's decision that MasterCardannounced it too was fully endorsing smart card technology. Thedecision was made in tandem with Europay's decision, but MasterCardwould not say how much money it was committing to the project. It didsay, however, that it would be converting terminals to accept chipcards by 1996.Visa, aware it was becoming branded as the anti-smart cardorganisation, sought to counter this with some high-profileannouncements. In March, it said it was planning an electronic purseproject which would rival the Mondex scheme.In order to develop such a scheme, Visa linked with two groups ofindustry specialists to develop specifications for a purse. The firstincludes banking groups working on electronic purse projects: Banksysin Belgium; Cartes Bancaires in France; Taiwan's Financial InformationSystem Centre; Sociedade Espanol de Medios de Pago in Spain; SociedadeInterbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) in Portugal; Denmark's Danmant;Electronic Payment Services (EPS), NationsBank and Wachovia - all fromthe US.The second group included technology companies, such as Gemplus andVeriFone. These were contacted to help develop the specifications foran electronic purse scheme, while the first group were responsible forensuring technical compatibility across the various schemes.One notable exclusion from the first group was Mondex. The significanceof this was played down by both groups. Mondex said it was followingstandards set by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and theEuropean Commission's working group (CEN), but would not say if it hadbeen contacted by Visa.Europay was sceptical about the Visa initiatives, sticking to itsfigures on fraud. Neither organisation said Visa's working groupsjeopardised the joint specifications committees, although Europayprofessed disappointment that it had not been made aware of theconsortia.However, despite their differences, Visa and MasterCard/Europay didannounce the completion of their joint specifications. On November 8,the third and final part of the standards, which determine how smartcards and POS terminals would process financial transactions, cardapplications, and provide for contingencies were announced.As the associations battled it out for the upper hand, individual smartcard initiatives continued during the year. In February, Banksysannounced the towns to be involved in its electronic purse trial. Thecard, later called Proton, was developed to replace cash at the pointof sale. The trial, due to go live in December in Leuven and Wavre, wasone of the most ambitious purse schemes. Given the centralised natureof the country's payments system, the electronic purse was expected tomigrate to general bank cards in the future.In July, NETS, the national payments organisation in Singapore,expanded its CashCard electronic purse project by linking with a localuniversity and Singapore Telecom. The CashCard scheme announced anaffinity programme with the National University of Singapore. It wasadapted to the needs of students and university staff for payments onthe campus. The Telecom deal opened up 25 adapted telephones toCashCard holders.Meanwhile in August in Portugal, the SIBS-backed purse announced it wasto go live in the third quarter of the year, several months early.Unlike other pilots, it was controlled in the branch of one of themember banks, Caixa Geral de Depositos.Danmont, the first major electronic purse scheme, celebrated its secondanniversary in September. Transaction volume grew 108 percent in thefirst quarter of 1994, compared with the last quarter of 1993.In the US, one of the few backers of smart cards, EPS, announceddetails of its electronic purse pilot in September. It is due to golive in the fourth quarter of this year. Due to involve 10,000customers, the trial will take place in a five-mile corridor inDelaware.South Africa also backed smart cards that month. Six of the country'smain banks are involved in the project, called the South AfricanElectronic Purse. The pilot, which went live in September, involved 100merchants and 12,000 customers in Alberton, a suburb of Johannesburg.Finland became the next to announce the launch of an electronic purseproject. Called Avant, the scheme was backed by the Finnish centralbank and came in two forms, a prepaid phone card, and a reloadableelectronic purse. About 40,000 cards were expected to be in issue bythe end of last year.Mondex received a considerable boost near the end of the year whenHongkong Bank signed to the scheme. It agreed to become a franchiseefor the scheme in the Asia region. The agreement was a natural resultof Hongkong Bank's association with Midland Bank, one of the banksbehind Mondex.Finally, the Dutch banks announced the details of its electronic pursescheme, to be launched in October 1995. The scheme, called Chipknip,will be piggy-backed on to the banks' eurocheque cards. Interpay, amerger of Eurocard Nederlands and BeaNet, will manage the scheme. Itexpects up to 20 million smart cards to be in issue in three to fouryears.Cross-border paymentsLow value, cross-border payments continued to dominate discussionsduring the year, with various payment clubs emerging. One of the firstpayments networks, Interbank On-line System (IBOS), launched by RoyalBank of Scotland and Banco Santander in 1990, continued to sign newbanks during the year. The system transfers money, on-line, real timeto and from any branch of its members, which include, Credit Commercialde France, Banco do Comercio e Industria in Portugal, Kredietbank inBelgium and First Fidelity Bank in the US.Although IBOS is keen to play down the potential conflict with SWIFT,the international financial message sender, many see it as operating incompetition rather than as complement to SWIFT. Critical mass remainsan elusive goal for IBOS. The company says that 20 members would makethe system viable.In February, the first signs that the European Commission (EC) waspreparing to take stern action against banks emerged. At theInternational Electronic Payments Conference in Frankfurt, PeterTroberg, head of DGXV, the directorate in charge of financial services,warned banks that, unless improvements were made to the quality of lowvalue, cross-border payments, a directive would be proposed.The financial community rallied together against the Commission,accusing it of unrealistic expectations, saying that low value,cross-border payments represent less than 5 percent of all payments.Improvements, they said, could not be made since it could not bejustified by the volumes involved.Despite the protests, various payment clubs went live during the year,partly in response to the EC's threats. In April, B.epsys, a consortiumof seven of the largest Belgian banks, went live with its low valuesystem. It began processing payments between Belgium and Germanythrough an arrangement with Geselleschaft fur Zahlungssysteme (GZS),the bank-owned payments organisation. The system operates similarly toan automated clearing house, with domestic transactions routed forinternational clearing.In that month, NatWest announced that the group in its payments club:Commerzbank; Societe Generale; Banco Central Hispano, was to beexpanded. Unlike IBOS, which uses SWIFT message standards but does notuse the SWIFT system, the NatWest group used the international network.In December, the bank rumoured to be joining was Banco ComercialPortugues.It was in December that the system went live with its first transactionusing SWIFT's Interbank File Transfer (IFT) service. It claims to cutthe transfer time down from eight to three working days.Meanwhile, in July, Banque Nationale de Paris and its strategic partnerin Germany, Dresdner Bank, launched a cross-border payments service.The service is designed for payments of up to Ecu2,500 ($2,800),charging a fee of Fr140 ($7).In September, TipaNet, the cross-border payments initiative set up bythe co-operative banks in France and Germany was adopted by Bankers'Trust in the US, Swiss Bank Corporation and Austria'sRaiffeisen-Zentralbank. Like the NatWest system, TipaNet uses SWIFT'sIFT system for transfer of payment messages.Despite these initiatives, the European Commission dealt a blow to theindustry in October when it proposed a directive to improvecross-border payments. The decision was met with dismay from thebanking industry, but the Commissioner for DGXV, Raniero Vannid'Archirafi, was adamant the banks were given adequate time to improvethe situation.The proposal came after a second study was undertaken for theCommission which showed that double charging occurred in 36 percent ofpayments, while at 46 percent of branches, no written information wasavailable.Banks criticised the quality of the research in the report and the EC'sinterpretation of its findings. They said that in most instances thebanks were within the Commission's parameters. The average cost of atransaction had fallen from Ecu22.39 to Ecu19.80 since the last survey,while the time for the transfer of payments, 4.8 working days, was wellwithin the EC's recommendations.Other developmentsATMs continued to be adapted to deliver extra services. In Brazil,Tecnologia Bancaria (TecBan), the Brazilian company which runs theBanco24Horas ATM network, revamped its machines to allow for billpayments. An initial 30 Pagamento Eletronico terminals went live inMarch in Sao Paulo for paying electricity and telephone bills. TecBanexpects 500 to be installed by the end of this year, with otherutilities, such as gas and water companies coming on-line.In Thailand in May, Bangkok Bank began selling mutual funds through its400 ATMs. The system was launched in conjunction with BBL AssetManagement, a subsidiary of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.La Caixa in Spain also offered extra services through its ATMs. CalledServicaixa, the system dispenses concert, local transport and airlinetickets, provides for the payment of taxes, and pay for universityfees.The service was expanded in February 1994 by installing a further 400machines, bringing the total to 800 and could be accessed by all thebank's Sistema 6000, Visa and Eurocard cardholders.The USThe US electronic payments marketplace showed signs of maturity in1994, as government regulators alerted the banking industry that itpromised to pay closer heed to competition issues.The pace of regional EFT network consolidation slowed slightly, thoughthere was no shortage of merger discussions. In November, theMissouri-based BankMate network was purchased by MasterCard, a movethat confirmed the worst fears of regional executives, who suspectedthat the national associations want to be more than just gatewayswitches.The only major merger to succeed was between Yankee 24 and NYCE. Theymerged as equals in October, creating the third-largest network in theUS. The MAC network continued westward when its members, which acquiredowners of the Quest network in Kentucky, absorbed the network into MAC.Local jealousies in Colorado, however, sparked a spin-off as small,independent banks formerly affiliated to the Rocky Mountain BankcardSystem created their own network. There was reportedly great strifebetween the independent bank and First Bank Systems, which recentlypurchased the owners of the Rocky Mountain network.Talks, were broken off between Cash Station of Chicago and Magic Lineof Michigan in May, both parties citing philosophical and culturaldifferences. The perennial discussion of a merger between the Honor andMost networks, in the southeast US, also bore no results.State and federal watchdogs caused the greatest stir in April when theUS Justice Department brought anti-trust charges against ElectronicPayment Services, parent to the owners of MAC, the largest ATM networkin the US. The Justice investigation resulted in EPS signing a consentdecree that said EPS must open the network to third-party processors,reversing a long-standing network policy.EPS management said the consent decree, which is not an admission ofguilt, made no difference because EPS earlier changed its bylaws. Theconsent decree accelerated the timetable for opening up the network.Justice complained that MAC policies left banks, particularly smallinstitutions, vulnerable to higher fees and charges. Competing EFTnetworks said this action was inevitable, with the rising importance ofATMs in the consumer banking industry, but also added that MAC'srestrictive policies were unique in the US.US Congress also entered the fray, with several consumer groupslobbying the House Banking Committee. A subcommittee headed by JosephKennedy took bankers to task, questioning the wide variety and therising cost of service fees in the last few years. No further actionwas taken after the public hearing.The US Government, in an effort championed by Vice President Al Gore,supported the development of systems that would deliver federal andstate benefits via the electronic payments system. With limited runs inTexas, Maryland, California and Ohio, EBT programmes performed well.However, the Federal Reserve Board created a storm with its decision toextend Regulation E to stored-value cards, including EBT cards. EBTproponents criticised the Fed action, claiming Regulation E will stymieprojects because of the heavy liabilities that would be transferred tostate governments and onerous reporting requirements.MasterCard, at the end of 1994, sparked a new round of competitionconcerns when it unilaterally declared that its national on-line debitprogramme, Maestro, would not prohibit duality. A few years earlier,MasterCard and Visa were rebuffed by the National Association ofStates' Attorneys General for trying to launch Entree, a joint debitcard programme.MasterCard submitted its proposed rule change to the group for comment.When the group responded that it was not filing suit, MasterCardexecutives proceeded with the change. Visa and other industry observersnoted that the Attorneys' opinion, while not against the proposal, washardly an endorsement they emphasised that the group had reserved theright to bring suit in the future.Americans showed that they have warmed to electronic payments. Visa's72 million cards in circulation generated 35 million in sales volume asof second quarter 1994. Officials from regional networks, Visa, andMasterCard report that debit volumes are starting to rise, claiming alarger share of total spending. MasterCard reported that ATM usage hadbegun to carry over to debit.Perhaps most unsettling was the sudden realisation that computersoftware and telecommunication companies are poised to play a verysignificant role in payment systems. Assuming the role of bankers'worst nightmare, Microsoft and its outspoken president, Bill Gates, waswidely credited with awakening bankers to the urgent need to adapt tochanging times. Bankers also learned about software and technologycompanies, such as Intuit and Netscape Communication.Several companies shook up the industry by plying alternative deliverychannels, such as banking by telephone, screen-phone and by personalcomputer. Visa in July established Visa Interactive when it bought mostof Virginia-based US Order. Interactive billed itself as a bank-ownedsolution for banks that wanted to offer home banking and bill paymentservices.Non-banks were very active. US West, Electronic Data Services (EDS) andFrance Telecom Intelmatique formed Interactive Transaction partners(ITP) and quickly signed such sizeable clients as Comerica Bank Texas.Visa trumped MasterCard when it signed a deal with Microsoft inNovember. It agreed to develop software that would allow consumers tomake payments securely and transact business over computer networks.This and other software will open up the worldwide web to commerce. InDecember, First Data Corporation, the largest transaction processor inthe US, signed a deal with Netscape Communications that could routecredit card transactions over the Internet. MasterCard finally followedin January when it launched its own programme with Netscape.In ACH news, bankers turned long-standing grievances against Fedwireinto action this year with the formation of the Private Sector ACHExchange, or PAX. Visa USA, the New York Clearing House, and ArizonaClearing House agreed to link up, allowing banks to route ACH paymentsoutside the Fed. At the moment, the federal reserve, which plays therole of both regulator and competitor, controls 80 percent of thebusiness. In its first year, Citibank NA and Chemical Bank joined thenew system, while PNC Bank moved more of its business through Visa ACH.The private sector scored another victory when lobbying, led by theNational Clearing House Association (NACHA), spurred the FederalReserve to drop its bid to process corporate tax payments to the USTreasury, a programme expected to add $1 trillion in payments to thenational ACH volume. ACH executives also had feared that the governmentcould have exceeded its authority by controlling such a significantpiece of business.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List WT02-B38-32IA074-000493-B040-83http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi42.html 205.156.212.5 19970122010025 text/html 48453HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 00:58:29 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:16 GMTContent-length: 48266Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi42.html Sample Issue Copyright EMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNet January 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES PAYBACK TIME FOR MEXICO?

The sovereign easilyraised DM 1 billion Monday with its first ever 7-year DM issue, equal to$690 million. The state bank Nafinsa raised $100 million Wednesday and theimport-export bank Bancomext issued $300 million in commercial paper.        But top Mexican financial officials denied that the country isusing the sovereign cash expressly to make any of the $1.3 billion inpayments due Jan. 29 on short-term swaps drawn from the U.S. Treasury andthe Fed.        "People might think it is for the IMF or the U.S. Treasury, but themoney does not have a specific purpose," insists Daniel Martinez, advisorto Martin Werner, Mexico's director general of public credit."The money isjust being used to refinance short-term debt and improve the debt profile."        Market sources, however, disagreed and seemed amused with Mexico'scurious response.        "They have some money to pay back to the U.S. Who are theykidding," wonders a syndicator.        Chemical Bank analysts suggest that Mexico will almost surely repaythe half due to the Fed, for legal reasons, but that payment on theTreasury's half is less certain. There's been "some hint" that the Mexicangovernment has been seeking to roll over the debt, says the research groupin a Jan. 8 analysis. But, "given the politically charged environment inthe U.S., we believe this will be a hard sell," Chemical says.        Martinez  refused say when Mexico would issue next. Perhaps thecountry will follow Argentina to Japan--Mexico has certainly mimickedArgentina before. The Argentine government is said to be leaning towards ayen deal, maybe as soon as this week (see page 8).        Deutchemark deal fever shows no sign of abating--the likely drop inGerman interest rates should stoke even more issuance. Mexico was thesecond Latin American country to lengthen a DM tenor to seven years. Co-ledby CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the issue carried a 10.38%coupon, 1/8% higher than the 10.25% coupon that Argentina's seven-year dealcarried two weeks ago.        A syndicate source says the Mexican issue's higher coupon makes itslightly more attractive than the Argentine seven-year bond, and has soldbriskly with German and Swiss retail investors. Mexico last tapped the DMmarket in October with a five-year DM 1 billion deal for 9.38%.--Dan B.LevineBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996DEBT RESTRUCTURING TICKING ALONGWith the holidays over, the commercial debt restructuring deals ofPeru, Panama and Slovenia are seeing renewed progress toward completion.There have been no reports of significant snags or delays in any of thedeals; the original timetables seem to be substantially on track.        As it promised, Panama has refrained from asking for a rebalancingof options choices in its $3.5 billion Brady, even though the choices werefar from the balanced breakdown the country the country had sought. Withnearly all the debt spoken for--and no indication of any major renegadesamong creditors--the overwhelming majority of orders came in for interestreduction bonds, covering 81.9% of the debt by Panama's count. Pars bondswere chosen for only 13.6% of the debt, and discounts only 4.5%. Nary acreditor chose new money.        "There is nothing at this point that would hold the deal back,"said a banking source. Panama is still reviewing the final documentation.No signing debt has been set, but the two sides are still hoping forsigning in this quarter, and a closing in the next.        The aggressive timetable for Peru's $9 billion Brady has slipped alittle. Bank creditors handed their version of the term sheet to Peru inearly December, right on time, but it hasn't yet come back. The Peruvianssay they want a first quarter closing, but it looks now like both sideswould have to work like lightning to accomplish that. There has been nofurther movement on specifying more closely the debt's participation indebt for equity swaps; apparently the term sheet will say only that theBrady debt can't be excluded from any such scheme the country puts forth.        Slovenia's bank advisory committee was last week awaiting waiversfrom creditors that would free Slovenia's share of the ex-Yugoslavia's debtand allow Slovenia to begin paying off about $800 million in obligations atLibor + 13/16. Creditors holding at least two-thirds of the debt mustapprove the country's exit from the joint and several liability for ex-Yugodebt. Bankers have not expected a problem, but the New York blizzard andthe fact that some French banks reportedly didn't get the documents untillast Tuesday could create some slight delays. Slovenia hopes to close thedeal within 70 days from waiver approval. -- MDBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996THINK TANK CHIEF FORESEES CUBAN BLOODSHEDDespite some Cuban economic modernization and a tentative openingtoward non-U.S. foreign investment, Cuba and the United States are unlikelyto move toward eliminating the long-standing U.S. economic embargo againstCuba in the near future, predicts Leslie Gelb, president of the Council onForeign Relations.        In fact, Gelb foresees something much darker: the possibility of abloody civil war "as awful as Bosnia" in the coming years, with thetransition away from a Castro regime.        Cuba "could be on the edge, in three years, or 10 years, of realcivil war," Gelb suggested last week during a talk at the Americas Societyin New York, shortly after returning from a week of talks in Cuba that theCouncil on Foreign Relations arranged with the Cuban government.        Gelb, a former Pulitzer-prizewinning New York Times journalist andU.S. diplomat, participated in a series of meetings with top Cubanpolitical and economic officials during his November visit, which includedfive hours of talks with Castro.        His conclusions are bad news for investors who hope forregularization of Cuba's defaulted $4 billion debt to Western banks. Whileoffshore and other non U.S.-registered funds have taken small positions indefaulted Cuban loans (the Emerging Markets Traders Association recordednearly $1.2 billion face value in trades of Cuban instruments last year,$652 million of that in loan trades that averaged less than $2 millioneach), and there are several funds collecting money in wait for betterportfolio investment opportunities on the island, the main impetus forappreciation of such investments would be the lifting or softening of the35-year-old embargo.        Liquidity would improve dramatically, as U.S. investors now bannedfrom holding the debt would be allowed to participate. War, of course,could wipe out such positions altogether. Cuban debt now trades in the lowto mid 20s.        Cuba has a team of well-trained economic managers, which Gelbequates with the teams Mexico has sported in the last dozen years. However,their initiatives would presumably be overshadowed by the thrust U.S. -Cuban diplomatic relations.Both Sides Take Hard Line        Pressured by anti-Castro Cubans in the United States, PresidentClinton is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. stance toward Cuba in therunup to the Nov. 1996 U.S. presidential elections, Gelb points out. But,for reasons of its own, the Castro administration isn't particularly eagerto see sanctions lifted now, either.        Despite a 40% plunge of the Cuban economy after the collapse of theSoviet Union, and a desperate need for U.S. investment, Castro seems tofear that the end of the embargo also might mean an end to his regime.Cubans could become further disillusioned with their president if theyconclude that domestic problems typically blamed on the embargo persistafter it is lifted.        "My sense is that Fidel Castro is not interested in the next yearor two in making any significant concession to the United States," Gelbsays.        Gelb advocates gradually lifting the embargo, to avoid shocking theCuban economy, and calls for increased diplomacy via U.S.-Cuban militarycontacts and a strengthening of the trend to encourage U.S. NGOs to operatein Cuba.        But he doesn't think the present situation can last too long,partly because of the great pressure of an alluring American society 90miles away.        "I don't think the situation is long-term stable," Gelb says. Cubahas begun to grow again, but the 2.5% growth expected this year--perhaps 4%later on if the sugar harvest is good--is far too slow to be meaningfulafter a tumble that was far worse than the United States suffered duringthe Great Depression.        "I just don't think the Cuban situation will continue to evolvepeacefully," he says. He reports that Cuban officials are "very concerned"about how to create a transition from the rule of Castro, who doesn't wantto leave. Under one scenario, the Cuban military could end up disbanding,Miami Cubans could return en masse, and the island could find itself thrustinto a civil war.--Mary D'AmbrosioBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NY FED'S E-MARKETS CHIEF: IT'S NOT A CRACKDOWNThe New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be stronglyfocused on information gathering and policy recommendation--and wasn'tcreated to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,the chief of the effort stresses.        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smackpeople in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named tothe new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.        Checki, 50, becomes the New York Fed's eighth executive vp. The jobis intended to consolidate various pieces of emerging markets research andsupervision that had been scattered across different departments, he says.His top priority, he adds, is to be sure Fed policymakers know what's goingon.        While it seems logical to take such a step after the solution toMexico's Dec. 1994 peso crisis landed squarely and expensively on the U.S.government's doorstep, and the Daiwa Bank trading loss debacle appeared tocatch the New York Fed failing to act on information it had for years, Fedofficials said creation of the group was neither expressly the result ofthese issues, nor a signal of stepped-up or changing regulatory practices."We're not doing anything now that we haven't done before," Checki said.        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge ofinternational banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDCexpert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDCdebt crisis in the 1980s, functioning as ex-NY Fed chief Gerald Corrigan'stop international troubleshooter and then taking on the same role forcurrent NY Fed chief William McDonough.         But Checki doesn't see his role as limited to U.S. commercial orforeign bank supervision. Instead, he expects to maintain information tieswith all of the players and influences driving emerging markets--keepinginformed about the initiatives of investment banks and funds, trackingpolitical, economic and financial trends, and consulting with other centralbanks.         His priority is to get emerging markets information to McDonough,preferably "before it emerges," and make policy recommendations, he says.        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure bettereconomic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing themajority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in thewake of the Mexican crisis.         "I think we need to see that the information is as available aspossible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that theIMF "should not be in the business of assembling information for theprivate sector," he does think the Fund has an important role to play inmaking sure good financial information is procured from borrowingcountries.        His advice to those thinking of participating in emerging marketsfor the first time: "Tell them to be sure of their ability to swim," hesays, "and to understand how deep the water is."--Mary D'AmbrosioBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996TELEBRAS RATED TO SOVEREIGN CEILINGMoody's has assigned an initial B1 rating to Brazil'sTelecomunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras).

In Ecuador, asluggish economy and a divided congress mean May 1996 elections areunlikely to usher in economic improvements.        Those are some of the conclusions that the Syracuse, New Yorkanalytical firm Political Risk Services presents in its January forecast.        Romanian President Ion Iliescu's supporters are unlikely to win amajority in September's Parliament elections. But both Egyptian PresidentHosni Mubarak and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori are seen as secure intheir positions.        Venezuela's considerable problems remain due to an overdependenceon oil exports and a lack of fiscal discipline, in the opinion of theseanalysts, in a climate of high inflation and no growth. Inflation isprojected to climb to 75% in 1996, from 46.9% last year. Caldera's populiststance is not making the country's situation easier either, and leftistCausa R may benefit in the 1998 elections. Causa R's presidential candidateAndres Velasquez finished second to Caldera in 1993.        In China, despite some forms of private enterprise, there is muchconcern over the business climate. Some government groups are discussingthe removal of foreign tax breaks. Another potential problem is the growingaggressiveness of the Chinese military in the South China Sea. Pressurefrom the U.S. over the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, trade policy andhuman rights could also threaten foreign businesses, analysts say.        In Ecuador, prospects are slim that President Sixto  Ballen'sadministration can implement necessary economic reforms to stimulate theeconomy. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1.8% in 1996 after reaching 3.6%this year.        The economy is also at risk because of increased violence and thethreat of a military coup. But the May 1996 elections are unlikely toresult in a regime any more capable of improving the economy.        Romania's Iliescu is favored to win September's presidentialelections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a parliamentary majority.Despite opposition, Iliescu remains popular as he moves the economy towardsintegration with the EU.        Budget cuts and market reforms are being implemented to qualify forassistance from the IMF and the EU, but not enough to greatly improve thebusiness climate. But, inflation is projected to fall dramatically to 28%in 1996 from 161.5% last year and GDP growth is expected to rise to 4% thisyear from 3.6% shrinkage in 1995.        In Egypt, Mubarek's willingness to use force, mixed with politicalliberalization, has kept the opposition off balance and solidified hiscontrol in Egypt. Some progress has been made in reducing foreign debt,controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth,but essentialprivatizations have yet to occur.        Peru's Fujimori also shows no signs of losing control, standinghigh in public opinion polls. Peru's economy is healthy by South Americanstandards, and Fujimori presided over the country's debt-restructuringdeal. A question for the long term is finding a presidential successor.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LEGAL NOTESLegal Notes is prepared by James Leavy and M. Cecilia Gaviria of SerraMichaud & Associes, Paris based on information produced by law firms fromLatin America. This is part one of their monthly report. Part two willappear next week.BrazilMeasures to strengthen the financial systemThe government and the Central Bank have adopted a series of measures tosupport the financial system, parts of which have come under strain asBrazil moves to a low-inflation monetary system.a) PROERA package of measures concerns a special program created by the CentralBank and known as PROER (Program for Encouraging the Restructuring andStrengthening of the National Financial System).Created by Resolution 2208 of the Central Bank, PROER consists of thefollowing major elements:i) a special line of financial assistance linked to securities or otheroperations of the National Treasury or Federal Government entities, tolosses arising in the process of reorganization of financial institutions,to the costs of restructuring and modernizing operational systems and tomobilization of assets of the participating institutions. (Circular 2636 ofthe Central Bank sets out the principal conditions applicable to operationsusing this financial line);ii) availability of resources arising from compulsory deposits orcontributions, linked to acquisition of bank CDs issued by entitiesparticipating in PROER;iii) greater flexibility in reaching operational limits required offinancial institutions;iv) deferment of costs related to restructuring and modernizing offinancial institutions.In connection with this program the Government adopted a provisionalmeasure providing for several tax concessions to entities taking part inPROER, including the following:a) where an entity is incorporated to take over a failing institution, itmay treat the institution's difficult loans as losses ("difficult loans"are defined in Resolution  2210 of the Central Bank);b) the incorporating entities may treat as a financial cost, the differencebetween the purchase price of their investment and the book value of theirinterest in the acquired entity;c) for tax purposes, the losses described in a) and amortized costsdescribed in b) (up to a limit each year together with tax losses carriedforward from previous years, of 30% of gross profits) can be offset againstgross profits.Central Bank Circular 2633 specifies that access to the PROER program willbe decided on by the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis and is limited torecognized financial institutions which acquire the control of another suchinstitution or whose control passes to such institution or which assume therights and/or obligations of such an institution. The Circular specifiesthat admission to PROER does not diminish any criminal or other liabilitywhich the directors of an entity taken over might otherwise have.b) Other MeasuresProvisional Measure 1.182 applies the rules of existing legislation onquarantine of property ("indisponibilidade de bens") to that of the personscontrolling a financial institution which is the subject of intervention,liquidation or temporary special administration. It authorizes the CentralBank to take special measures such as injecting additional capital,transferring control or corporate restructuring for the purpose ofsafeguarding the public interest (including the interests of depositors)where a financial institution is in serious difficulty. It sets out thetypes of measures which can be taken with the prior authorization of theCentral Bank when a financial institution is subject to intervention,liquidation, as well as the measures which can be taken in respect of thedirectors of the affected institution.Resolution 2.212 of the Central Bank strengthens the capital adequacy andprudential requirements of financial institutions, particularly in thecontext of a change in the control of such institutions.Resolution 2.211 of the Central Bank approves the by-laws and regulationsof the Credit Guarantee Fund, which is designed to guarantee deposits andother credits against financial institutions in case of bankruptcy,insolvency or similar situations. Financial institutions contribute monthlyto the Fund an amount equal to 0.025% of the balance of accounts guaranteedby the Fund.(Source: Walter Douglas Stuber, Amaro, Stuber & Street, Sao Paulo)ColombiaPrivatization legislationFollowing a decision of the Constitutional Court, Congress has adoptedlegislation to regulate article 60 of the national constitution and thusprovide a general legal framework for privatizations. The new legislationprovides that privatizations must be carried out in accordance with aprogram approved the Finance Ministry and the relevant Ministry to whichthe respective entity is attached, which program must be notified toCongress.Each privatization must be carried out in a context which permits widedispersion of share ownership, protection of public resources and (whereapplicable) continuity of the public service which is provided by theprivatized entity.Current and former employees of the entity would be given preferred statusin the allocation of shares, as would, labor unions, employee pensionfunds, investment funds and similar entities.Shares in the relevant entity must be offered at a price which reflects thevaluation carried out under the authority of the relevant ministry. Offerscan only be made when arrangements have been put in place to enable thosehaving preferred allocation rights to exercise those rights, includingspecial lines of credit (minimum term 5 years: security interest on sharesbeing purchased). Those receiving preferred share allocations may berequired to retain their shares for up to 2 years and limits may be placedon the amount of shares allocated to senior management of the entityimmediately prior to privatization.The new legislation specifies that privatizations of financial institutionsare subject to the special legislation governing the financial sector andthat no privatizations of certain entities in which the State telecomcompany has an interest may be carried out before Jan. 1, 1998.(Source: Vincent Trevisani, Cavelier Abogados, Santafe de Bogot )MexicoAdjustments to financial institutions legislationA recent congressional decree has made some adjustments to the legislationgoverning banks, securities markets, insurance and guarantee companies andspecialized financial institutions. Among the changes are the following:i) provision is made so that the shares held by foreign financialinstitutions or insurers in their Mexican subsidiaries are clearlyidentified. At least 51% of the shares in the subsidiary must be held in aspecial category reserved to the foreign controlling entity (or its holdingsubsidiary). Those shares can only be disposed of with the priorauthorization of the Finance Ministry;ii) the limits on individual holdings of shares in insurance or guaranteecompanies can be exceeded where such a company is being converted into alocal subsidiary of a foreign entity;iii) financial institutions must establish systems for dealing with clientsinquiries and complaints and a system of arbitration is provided for beforethe National Banking and Securities Commission where a dispute persistsbetween a financial institution and its client;iv) special provision is made for recovery of claims owed to the nationalgovernment and generally for carrying out treasury activities in respect ofassets held by or belonging to the national government, including funds andsecurities.(Source: Antonio Prida, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, Mexico D.F.)Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SOVEREIGN FUND SEES VALUE IN VENEZUELA AND BULGARIADiego Aramburu, manager of Atlantic Security Bank's Atlantic SovereignFund, thinks Venezuelan and Bulgarian bonds will help him build on the23.06% gain the $26 million fund achieved last year.        The Cayman Island-registered fund, held by the offshore securitiesarm of Banco Credito de Peru, performed slightly behind the J.P. MorganEmerging Markets Bond Index Plus, which returned 26.78% in 1995. ButMicropal ranked the fund third out of 23 Latin American regional debt fundsthrough last November.         The fund is 100% emerging markets debt, and Aramburu, who investsmostly in Bradys and some sovereign Eurobonds for yield and liquidity,touts bonds of Venezuela and Bulgaria as values this year.        "We understand the risks in Venezuela. We think there arefundamental changes in the policy that will make Venezuela attractive,"says Aramburu, who works out of Lima and Miami. Though he is critical ofPresident Rafael Caldera's populist stance, he supports the government'srecent devaluation and thinks an IMF deal is coming soon.  He is alsocounting on banking, social and tax reforms to cut the fiscal deficit.Gasoline price hikes are also likely as part of an IMF deal, but the fundmanager differs from many analysts in believing that social unrest will notresult. "The population is understanding better that some measures need tobe taken. They are going in the right direction," says Aramburu.  But hepredicts that Caldera won't be reelected in 1998.        Aramburu recently bought options on Venezuelan DCBs, bringing theportfolio's Venezuelan holdings to 5%. "The fact is the market gave usrelative value with those," he says.        Aramburu also argues that Bulgarian Bradys, which make up 10% ofthe fund, are undervalued compared with Poland's. "There is not a bigdifference between those countries," he insists. "Bulgaria's financialnumbers are not the best, but they are improving." Aramburu thinksBulgarian IABs, yielding around 14%, are one of the most undervaluedinstruments available today.        The remainder of the fund's portfolio includes a heavy 10% positionin Peru, a standard 25% stake in Brazil, 15% holdings in each Argentina andMexico, 7% holdings in Nigeria and small positions in other Latincountries, such as Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.        The fund started in Oct. 1994 when the company merged the bank'sLatin and Growth funds. Aramburu had established the Latin Fund in 1990,shortly after joining the bank, and set up the Growth Fund two years later.But, "both funds had similar objectives so it didn't make sense to have thetwo separate," he says.         Fund products cannot be sold in the U.S. The Sovereign Fund paysdividends twice a year equal to six-month Libor + 1% of the value of thepurchase price of the fund's shares. Latin American private investors arethe typical clients,  and they purchase shares with a minimum investment of$50,000.        Aramburu, 34, is a total return investor who uses bottom-upfundamental analysis when making investment decisions. He also followspolitical situations closely, but acknowledges his worst mistakes have beenthose made primarily based on news from various newspapers around theglobe.        "The political part of analysis is very difficult to quantify, andwe are very much interested in quantification," says Aramburu, who holds aPh.D. in international economics from the University of Miami. Aramburufollows a model that establishes a relationship between the values ofassets against a country's fundamentals.        Aramburu generally holds assets for at least three months, buttrades part of the portfolio heavily once a month to find high yields. Thefund is now fully invested, compared to the 40% cash it held at thebeginning of 1995.         Aramburu maintains a 25% stake in Brazilian holdings because hefinds excellent values among DCBs, Exits and EI's.        Argentine FRBs and discounts make up the bulk of the 15% Argentinaposition. Aramburu says Argentina is being unfairly correlated with pre-peso devaluation Mexico; he thinks the country's stronger export sector andreserve position leave it in superior shape. Aramburu expects Mexico tostruggle mightily during the first half as fourth quarter 1995 numbers arereleased, but foresees improvements later in 1996.              One countryhe won't invest in is Russia, despite the $32 billion debt reschedulingagreement. "The problem with Russia is the lack of financial numbers," hesays. "It's like investing in a company that you don't have the financialsfor. I still don't have a grasp on what Russia's numbers are. --Dan B.LevineBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BRAZIL BUYBACK TALK STOKES LDCSThe LDC debt market gained for the second straight week, despiteconcerns over the U.S. budget negotiations, rising about one point on theweek to Thursday. Brazil led a spirited rally last Thursday on strongrumors that it will soon conduct a two-step buyback worth $300 million ofdebt owed to it by Paraguay.

ELM's three-year deal, joint led by ING and J.P. Morgan, wasoversubscribed two to one and enlarged from $100 million. ELM was to launchthe deal last November but backed out due to a difficult marketenvironment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia andEurope.        "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds,"says Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It wasrelatively attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and iswell priced and valued."        Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELMissue last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was lured back by thechanging sentiment towards Mexico.Nafinsa Gets Aggressive        Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro viaSalomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive andaggressive. The three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 bpover U.S. Treasuries. The deal, which carries a 144A option, was popularwith European retail investors, but some in the U.S. were not impressed.        "I think it's expensive for the investor. You can get Nafinsa paperwith the same spread for shorter maturities," says one.Argentina Weighs Yen        Argentina, fresh off of a DM 500 million ($347.8 million) deal twoweeks ago, is receiving bids for another issue, and may launch asubstantial yen deal this week, according to a yen source. "They'vereceived a number of different structures, but a yen deal looks good," thesource says. Argentina may launch either a five-year, 50 billion ($476.8million) deal with a 6% coupon or a three-year, 30 billion yen ($286million) issue with a 4.5% coupon, the source says. Nomura, Daiwa and Nikkoare in the running.        But Argentina may instead issue in Italian lira again to get abigger deal, according to the source. Argentina issued a 150 billion lira($93.1 million) Euro last September and may want to continue diversifyingagain.Colombia Dusts Off Yankee        Colombia's 20-year Yankee issue lead-managed by Merrill Lynch andGoldman Sachs is expected to launch in the next three weeks, according tomarket sources. Yield-hungry investors are said to have made the deal,shelved last November, possible again. The issue may contain two tranches--seven- and 20-years. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Goldman Sachs officialswould comment.Chilgener Takes $150M Deal To Road        Roadshows for Chilgener's $150 million Yankee begin today in NewYork (weather permitting) and end in California later in the week.

Price talk is not available, but a source says it will besimilar to the 7% that Celulosa Arauco's $300 million Yankee carried lastDecember. "Chilgener is a better credit than Celulosa Arauco. It is betterrated and is a utility while Celulosa is in the forestry industry," thesyndicate source says.Brazilian Samurai Mandate Expected        Brazil is expected to award a mandate for a Samurai bond worth 30billion yen ($286 million). Nomura has been rumored to be named lead, butyen sources say it may not be a done deal. "Nomura has been backing off,"says one. "I think they believe their relationship with Brazil will beenough to get them the deal." The issue is expected to be for five yearswith a coupon of between 6% and 6.25% and may launch at the end ofFebruary.BBA Leads Brazilian Banks        Banco BBA Creditanstalt is expected to launch a DM 100 million($69.5 million) issue for three years this week via Banque Paribas. Thedeal is expected to carry an 8.63% coupon for a yield of 470 bp over thebund.

However, in a report by the Institute for InternationalFinance reviewingthe IFC changes, the banks cautioned that there are areas where the IFCneeds to be more clear about its efforts to avoid displacing private banks.        The banks expressed concern about the IFC continuing to participatein financing in countries that would have no trouble attracting privatesources, and should have been graduated from the IFC program by now, amongthem Chile, Colombia, Turkey and Thailand.        The IFC has left this "graduation" up to private banks, and has notset a clear criteria for staff to judge whether a company or country shouldbe treated as off limits. Often companies that have a long-standingrelationship with the IFC are inclined to return there in the future, evenwhen they could find private capital sources.        In these cases, the IFC should only become involved in exceptionalcircumstances, and limit participation to countries that could nototherwise find financing, the report stated, although it added the provisothat a country's graduation should be reversible, so that the IFC could re-enter if needed.        "In Latin America and Asia the private sector is capable of doingthe job, if not single-handedly, than at least predominantly," while thereis much more need for the IFC in Africa, said Donald McCouch, groupexecutive of Chemical Bank, who participated in preparing the report.However, McCouch said the IFC should be given credit for trying to adapt toa changing world.        The IIF report, which focuses on nine areas of the new IFCguidelines, in general was in favor of the changes. "We believe the IFC istaking important steps towards increasing its effectiveness and increasingits ability to catalyze private finance for developing countries," saidCharles Dallara, managing director of the IIF.        "It will help focus the efforts on places where it is most needed,and greatly reduces if not eliminates the displacement of private sector,"Dallara told reporters, adding that scarce IFC resources should not be usedon a project that could be financed wholly with private funds.        The report also recommended the IFC limit its activities insecurities underwriting and equity participation to exceptional cases whereit is clear the transaction would not be completed without IFCparticipation.        The value of IFC participation in underwriting international issueshas been limited, since it has worked with well-known companies indeveloping countries that could have been underwritten by privateinvestment banks. However, IFC has scaled back its operations in this area.        There also were concerns about a conflict of interest when the IFCacts as a lender, particularly in a B-loan syndication, in a company inwhich it has equity interest.        The report praised the IFC for deciding to refrain from competingin bidding for privatization advisory mandates, but said the IFC shouldcontinue to scale back its advisory operations, and stay out of any biddingfor such programs. It should concentrate on establishing regulatoryenvironments necessary for privatization, model privatization transactionsin countries like Russia and the Ukraine, and focus on those where there isnegligible private sector interest, such as Haiti.        Bankers stressed that in no instance should the IFC link financialsupport to obtaining the advisory mandates, which Dallara said he has seenhappen many times in the past.        The report also recommended the IFC increase its use of guaranteesto leverage private financing, continue its efforts to diversity sources ofco-financing for B-loan syndications, use private sources more forappraising, arranging and managing project financing, and put in place anappeals procedure for institutions concerned about displacement.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996PEOPLEThe next two weeks will be nervewracking for Chemical Bank andChase Manhattan emerging markets division employees,  as Chemical/Chase co-emerging markets heads Daniel Canel and Jorge V. Jasson are expected toeliminate some duplicate jobs. "The additional cuts are probably going tocome at the end of the month," says a Chase insider.        Canel and Jasson named 13 top managers last month for the newcapital markets division: seven from Chase and six from Chemical. Chasehead Brady trader George P. Grunebaum and Chemical managing director RaulPonte become head traders in the U.S., while Barry J. Hoffner and Brian C.Lazell, each of Chemical, hold the same positions in London. Chase researchhead Lawrence J. Brainard maintains the same position in the consolidatedgroup, with Chemical research chief Thomas J. Trebat as deputy. Chase headof syndication Cynthia Powell also keeps her spot, Chase's Federico L.Amadeo is responsible for Latin America origination and Chemical's GabrielG. Politzer will cover Latin America local markets and external debt.        Also, Chase's John P. Colligan has been tapped to handle U.S.sales, while Chase's Gustavo M. Dominguez is responsible for derivatives,structured products and arbitrage. Rounding out the appointments areChemical's Anette L. Kolenda, named business manager, and Chase's RachelleC. Keller, who was selected as Kolenda's deputy.        Noticeably absent from the list is Chemical syndication head JuanLacroze, who helped engineer Mexico's $1.5 billion Eurobond last December.Lacroze is remaining with the new Chase--just not in the syndicationdepartment. But his new role has not been announced.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CALENDARJan. 23-26: Accessing Global Equity Markets, London, Paris, Frankfurt(simultaneous).

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMMISSION INVITES COMMENT SECOND BANKING DIRECTIVETHE DECEMBER issue of European Banker, in the article Freedom orfallacy?, discussed some aspects of the Commission communication oninterpretation of the Second Banking Directive, highlighting differentMember State interpretations of the Directive and quoting some initialreactions to the communication by national banking associations. EUFinancial Industry Monitor readers may be interested in more details onthis text of major importance.The Commission published its text, strictly speaking a DraftCommunication entitled "Freedom to provide services and the interest ofthe general good in the Second Banking Directive", in the OfficialJournal No C 291 of 4.11.95.An introductory passage states that the Draft is "the Commission'scontribution to the discussions under way on the problems associatedwith freedom to provide services and the interest of the general good"under the Second Directive. It points out that the discussions have sofar been restricted to the Member States in the Banking Advisory Groupand the Working Party on the Interpretation of the Banking Directives.The Commission, however, "takes the view that the broadest possibleconsultation should be held on its interpretative work" and so invitesinterested parties to submit comments on the Draft by 4.3.96. Afterconsideration of any such comments, the Draft will, if appropriate,become a Commission interpretative communication which will give banksan idea of how the Commission will view particular problems brought toits attention.This is a most unusual step. First of all, it is very rare for theCommission to issue interpretative communications on directives. It hasdone so in the case of several of its own regulations, for example inthe competition policy field, but very seldom in the case of Councildirectives since they have to be implemented through national law.Secondly, although the Commission has certainly consulted interestedparties in the past on the interpretation of EU legislation, it hasnever published a draft interpretative document with an invitation tothe world to comment on its intended interpretation.The reason for taking this unusual step is very honestly stated in theintroduction to the Draft Communication:"In the course of its contacts with numerous economic operators, theCommission has come to realise that continuing uncertainty with regardto the interpretation of basic concepts, such as freedom to provideservices and the interest of the general good, has seriously underminedthe workings of the machinery set up by the Second Directive and issuch as to deter certain credit institutions from exercising the veryfreedoms which the Second Directive sets out to promote."It is also worth emphasising that this Draft Communication may be onlythe first in a series. The Commission has tipped off the specialised EUpress that it considers it premature to issue such Drafts for the"third generation" insurance directives and the Investment ServicesDirective but that it is already reflecting on the problems ofinterpretation of these measures and is committed to the coherence ofthe positions adopted for all financial services.This is hardly surprising, given the great reluctance of certain MemberStates to open up their insurance and securities markets to servicesprovided cross-frontier and their alleged use of the general goodprovisions of directives to make life difficult for institutions fromother Member States.The Commission's approachOnly the European Court of Justice can give a final, definitiveinterpretation of EU law. The Commission, therefore, makes it clear inits Draft Communication that the contents are without prejudice to anyEuropean Court of Justice interpretation of the Second BankingDirective.What the Commission has done is to restate the principles laid down bythe Court of Justice in giving judgment in cases involving the freedomto provide services and the interest of the general good in other areasof EU law and to examine the application of these principles to theSecond Banking Directive.In a key passage which is implicitly revelatory of the restrictiveposition of some Member States, the Commission states that itsinterpretations of the Directive "do not necessarily represent theviews of the Member States" but then makes a threat:"However, in accordance with its duties as guardian of the Treatyreserves the right to exercise the powers vested in it by the Treaty(Article 169)."In other words, the Commission is warning the Member States that,although they may not agree with how it interprets the Directive, ifthey go against that interpretation the Commission will not hesitate tostart Treaty infringement proceedings against them. The DraftCommunication takes up thirteen-and-a-half Official Journal pages andis both discursive and legalistic.Freedom to provide servicesUnder the single licence system, a bank authorised in a Member State isentitled to provide services without an establishment in any otherMember States after going through the sole formality of notifying itshome Member State regulatory authorities of its intention to do this.The Commission's Draft Communication addresses:1) the services covered by the Directive, 2) commencement of theprovision of services.The first of these is sub-divided into: a) nature of services; b) formsof provision of services; c) provision of services; and d) nature ofthe notification.Nature of servicesArticle 20(1) of the Second Banking Directive states that:"Any credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provideservices by carrying on its activities within the territory of anotherMember State for the first time shall notify the competent authoritiesof the home Member State of the activities on the list in the Annexwhich it intends to carry on."This makes it clear that only the "core banking activities" listed inthe Annex to the Second Banking Directive are covered by the freedom toprovide services. It is equally clear that the notification procedureonly applies where services are to be provided for the first time.Article 23(2) of the Directive explicitly states that rights acquiredby credit institutions which provided services before the Directivecame into force are not affected.The Draft Notice then examines the questions of: 1) whether the factthat an activity has only been carried on once or a few times beconsidered enough to confer acquired rights; and 2) how far back intime should one go to find evidence of past activity.For the Commission it would be "absurd to set a quantitative limit . .institution has acquired rights if it provided a service at least oncein another Member State, regardless of when. However, the Commissionadds that:1) this activity must have been carried on lawfully, that is, inconformity with the law in force in the host Member State at the time;and2) the institution must be able to provide, if necessary, evidence ofits past activity.It also adds that institutions with acquired rights cannot be subjectedby their home Member State authorities to more onerous procedures thanwere applied before the Second Directive came into effect. For example,they will not have to notify the authorities of their intention tocontinue providing the services under Second Directive terms. Thenotification procedure only applies to services to be supplied for thefirst time.Forms of provision of servicesArticle 20(1) of the Directives requires notification for services tobe provided "within the territory of another Member State". On thebasis of European Court of Justice interpretation of the Treatyprovisions on freedom to provide services, the Commission DraftCommunication addresses the provision of services when there is"movement" and also addresses rules on advertising.The bank providing a service may move, in the sense that staff may goto the other Member State for the purposes of providing the service.The Commission considers that this situation is "undoubtedly" coveredby freedom to provide services.Conversely, the receiver of the service may be the person to move, thatis, he/she comes to the Member State where a credit institution isestablished without this being the result of canvassing by theinstitution. No notification to the home Member State authorities isrequired in that situation.Nevertheless, an institution which before the Second Banking Directivecame into effect and only provided services to clients from otherMember States in that way, would have to notify if it intends to startseeking new clients through canvassing in other Member States or bytravelling to them.The third situation is where the service itself moves, that is, wherethe service is provided by post or by modern communication method suchas telephone, fax, telex, electronic mail. In this case, the Commissionmakes a distinction between whether the service is provided at thecustomer's initiative or whether it follows canvassing by the creditinstitution. In the first case, the institution is exempt fromnotification but, in the second, the canvassing is proof of anintention to provide a service in another Member State and notificationis, therefore, necessary.It follows that the notification procedure should be completed beforethe credit institution and its customers establish "commercialrelations". The Draft Communication points out that, where a creditinstitution subsequently wishes to offer services not covered by itsinitial notification, an additional notification would have to be madefirst.Advertising in another Member StateWhen does advertising amount to an intention to provide services inanother Member State and so create the obligation to notify? TheCommission's starting point is that:"It is only where, by its very nature, the advertisement constitutescommercial canvassing, ranking as an actual invitation, issued at adistance, to enter into a contract, or where it precedes a physicaljourney by the supplier, that it constitutes an intention to provide aservice within the territory of another Member State, within themeaning of Article 20."Two scenarios then arise. The first is where the bank which places anadvertisement does not intend to go subsequently to the consumer'sMember State of residence. In this case, the Commission considers thatnotification of the intention to advertise is required when twoconditions are both met:1) the advertisement contains sufficient information for the consumerto make up his mind (for example, interest rate, duration, cost); and2) the contract can be concluded at a distance, that is, by reply slip,letter, telephone etc, without the bank and the customer having tomeet. If, however, the contract cannot be concluded without theconsumer going to the Member State where the bank is established,notification is not required.The second scenario is where the bank intends to go to the consumer'sMember State of residence to conclude a contract for a service whichhas been advertised. Notification is required in this case. There maybe difficulties of classification. The Draft Communication takes theexample of advertisements in Europe-wide publications or TV channels.The Commission considers that notification would only be necessary ifsuch an advertisement were directed at a specific Member State, forexample, if it appeared in a national edition of an internationalnewspaper.Provision of services compared to establishmentThe case law of the European Court of Justice makes a cleardistinction. When a service is provided in a host Member State, thepresence there is temporary. Establishment, in contrast, implies theexistence of permanent premises in the host Member State.The Court has also ruled that, in the case of an activity carried outtemporarily but frequently, the Member States may apply their rules forinstitutions which are established there if an institution invokes thefreedom to provide services abusively, so as to avoid the local rulesfor established institutions.The Draft Notice then considers some cases where it is difficult todraw the line between provision of services and establishment -electronic machines, recourse to independent intermediaries and thepermanent presence of the institution's own staff in another MemberState.Electronic machinesElectronic machines capable of performing Second Directive core bankingactivities may be covered by the concept of establishment.A machine is unlikely to be a credit institution's only place ofbusiness in another Member State. In the normal course of events, amachine would be attached to a branch, agency or some other form ofestablishment and so would not be "an entity in its own right". As aresult, it would be subject to the rules applicable to theestablishment to which it is attached.In the unlikely event of an electronic machine being a creditinstitution's sole presence in another Member States, then, in theCommission's view, the machine would be deemed to be a provider ofservices. As such, it would have to be notified, subject to the "firsttime" rules already described.As a provider of services, a machine would be subject to the generalgood rules of the host country. In that respect, the DraftCommunication gives as an example the need for a machine to show atelephone number in the host country.Independent intermediariesIn its discussion of whether an intermediary used by a creditinstitution to do business in another Member State is or is not to beregarded as a permanent establishment, the Commission's DraftCommunication quotes extensively from the case law of the EuropeanCourt of Justice. It concludes that the links between a creditinstitution and an independent intermediary in another Member Stateamount to the institution having a branch in the second Member Statewhen the intermediary meets three cumulative criteria:- he has received an exclusive brief from that credit institution andfrom no other;- he is empowered to negotiate on the credit institution's behalf andto bind it;- he operates on a permanent basis.This raises the question of the intermediary who acts on behalf of morethan one credit institution and here the Commission distinguishes twoscenarios.Where the intermediary acts exclusively for a group of creditinstitutions which have jointly called on his services, all of them aredeemed to be established in the form of a branch, assuming that theother criteria are met.The other situation is where the intermediary acts for a number ofcredit institutions which have not jointly called on his services. Inthat case, the first of the branch criteria - receiving an exclusivebrief - is not met. Therefore, the instructing credit institutions arenot established in the second Member State and are providing a servicethrough an intermediary. Notification is required.The Draft Communication then examines the situation in those MemberStates which require intermediaries to be given mandates by the creditinstitutions for which they act.Without giving explicit answers, the Commission states that it wouldhave to examine the extent of the mandate, the credit institution'sability to control the intermediary, the possibility for theintermediary to commit the mandating credit institution.Finally, the Draft Communication considers the situation where theintermediary is itself a credit institution. If the intermediary offersits customers the products of another credit institution, the latterwould have to notify its intention of exercising the freedom to provideservices in its intermediary's Member State unless, of course, it iscovered by the acquired rights provision.If, on the other hand, the intermediary provides accommodation to abranch of the other credit institution, there would have to benotification of the intention to exercise the freedom of establishment.Permanent presence of staffUnder this heading, there are two situations - either a creditinstitution's staff in another Member State carry on a banking activityor they do not.If they do carry on a banking activity, they constitute a branch. Since1.1.93, a branch start-up has required prior notification under theSecond Directive. If it was operational before that date with anyauthorisation required by the host Member State's legislation, itenjoys acquired rights under the Directive and so notification is notrequired. If it was operational before that date but without thenecessary local authorisation, it requires notification as it had notstarted operations "in accordance with the provisions in force in (its)host Member State".The presence in another Member State of a credit institution's staffwho do not carry on a banking activity - in other words arepresentative office - does not, in the Commission view, constitute abranch and so does not require notification. That does not, however,prevent the host member State requiring the institution to inform it ofthe opening of the office and to go through "a registration procedurethat would have to be a mere formality". The host member State wouldalso be at liberty to carry out "a simple, unsystematic check toascertain whether the office is not, in fact, engaged in bankingactivities".Nature of the notificationThis is dealt with very simply in the Draft Communication. For theCommission, the Second Directive's notification procedure:"pursues a simple objective of exchange of information betweensupervisory authorities and is not a consumer protection measure."The Draft Communication continues by stating that notification cannotbe considered "a procedural condition underlying the validity ofbanking contract". In other words, a bank which has not fulfilled anotification requirement can be penalised for this failure but thecontracts it has entered into the second Member State cannot beannulled on the grounds of non- notification.In the Commission's view, that would be contrary to the Community lawprinciple of proportionality and would negatively affect the legalcertainty of contracts entered into in good faith.Commencement of the provision of servicesArticle 20(2) of the Second Banking Directive states:"The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, within onemonth of receipt of the notification mentioned in paragraph 1, sendthat notification to the competent authorities of the host MemberState."The Draft Communication contrasts this provision on the freedom toprovide services with the corresponding provision on freedom ofestablishment. The latter (Article 19(5) of the Directive) requires thecredit institution to wait for receipt by the branch of a"communication" by the host Member State authorities.In the absence of any such communication after a period of two months,it can start operating. The Draft Communication points out that whenthe proposed Directive was being examined in Council the idea ofapplying that rule to both freedom of establishment and freedom toprovide services was rejected.The Draft Communication continues: "In the Commission's opinion, the re-introduction, by way of interpretation, of formalities which the MemberStates did not wish to see in the definitive version of the textadopted by the Council is neither desirable nor in keeping with thespirit and letter of the Second Directive."In other words, a credit institution can start exercising the freedomto provide services in another Member State once it has notified itsintentions to its home Member State authorities, which have one monthin which to notify the host country authorities. The credit institutionmay well ask the host country authorities to confirm receipt from thehome country authorities of the institution's notification but thatconfirmation cannot be a prior condition for starting to provideservices. Making confirmation a pre-requisite "is unacceptable andconstitutes an infringement of the Second Directive".The general good in the second banking directiveThe general good part of the Draft Communication discusses firstly thenotification of conditions to be met in the interest of the generalgood and, secondly, the applicability of rules adopted in the interestof the general good.Notification of conditions to be met in the interest of the generalgoodThis section of the Draft Commission discusses the interpretation ofArticle 19(4) of the Second Directive which provides that:"Before the branch of a credit institution commences its activities thecompetent authorities of the host Member State shall, within two monthsof receiving the information mentioned in paragraph 3, prepare for thesupervision of the credit institution in accordance with Article 21and, if necessary, indicate the conditions under which, in the interestof the general good, those activities must be carried on in the hostMember State."It appears that uncertainty has arisen regarding the words "ifnecessary". Some Member States have considered that this imposes anobligation to indicate the general good conditions to a branch. Othershave read the words as merely giving an option or a "moral obligation".The Commission considers that it is an option. Its principal reason forstating this is that the text says nothing about the form and contentof notification of general good conditions. That being so, it would beimpossible to verify whether the "obligation" had been complied with.In addition, there is no detailed, harmonised definition of "thegeneral good". It may vary from one Member State to another and may notapply in the same areas in host and home Member States. Also, "there isno way of knowing in advance what the credit institution wants toobtain".In conclusion, it is up to a credit institution which wishes to operatein another Member State to establish the situation, either by its ownefforts or by asking the host Member State authorities.Even if these authorities were to refuse to give the information, therewould be no breach of Community law, although any harm suffered mightbe subject to a remedy under the national law.Applicability of rules adopted in the interest of the general goodServicesThe case law of the European Court of Justice has already laid down anumber of requirements on the national provisions which may be appliedto undertakings exercising the freedom to supply services. These mustnot only be in the general good but also be:- non-discriminatory;- objectively necessary; and- proportionate to the objective pursued.In addition, the interest of the general good must not be safeguardedby rules to which the service provider is already subject in the MemberState of establishment (non-duplication).Finally, any restrictions on the grounds of the general good must be infields which are not the subject of EU-level harmonisation.Harmonisation by Directive has already established what the Commissioncalls the "Community general good". Thus, for example, nationalmeasures on own funds, the solvency ratio, deposit guarantees or largeexposures cannot be justified on general good grounds because of theDirectives on these issues.The Draft Communication then states that the Second Banking Directiveadds nothing new to this case law as far as freedom to provide servicesis concerned.EstablishmentThe European Court of Justice case law is essentially the same in thefield of establishment, with the additional rule that a nationalprovision which is discriminatory against branches of institutions ofother Member States may be justified on the grounds of public policy,public security and public health.The case law has recognised a number of areas as being covered by theconcept of the general good. Those relevant to the financial servicessector are:- protection of recipients of services;- protection of workers;- protection of consumers;- preservation of the good reputation of the national financial  sector;- the prevention of fraud;- social order;- protection of intellectual property;- the cohesion of the tax system.This list could be added to by the Court of Justice.Measures in these areas would have to be justified on the grounds ofthe interest of the general good and also respect the principles ofCommunity law already cited under services, that is, non-discrimination, non-duplication, necessity and proportionality.There then follows a rather theoretical and legalistic discussionleading to the conclusion that:"depending on the circumstances, the same restriction applied in theinterest of the general good could be adjudged proportionate in respectof a branch, but disproportionate in respect of a service provider."That is followed by a long and equally legalistic passage on the linkbetween rules governing the interest of the general good and lawapplicable to banking contracts.By determining the law applicable to a banking contract, it is possibleto establish the law applicable to the service proposed by the bank.This raises the relationship between the mutual recognition provisionsof the Second Banking Directive and the rules laid down in the 1980Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.There is, of course, an important issue here. If the Rome Conventionhas the result that the law applicable to a banking contract is that ofthe home Member State, can the host Member State then apply its generalgood rules to the bank's operations on its territory, as it should beable to do under the Second Directive?The Commission's answer to this is that the Directive's mutualrecognition principle should be given effect through a three- stageprocess:- the law applicable to a banking contract should be established on thebasis of the Rome Convention;- it should then be established whether the result of that first stepconstitutes an obstacle to mutual recognition;- if there is no obstacle, then the host Member State law would applyto the banking contract without further ado. If there is an obstacle,the host Member State law would only apply if that can be justified bythe general good and if the European Court's criteria for applicationof general good measures are met.ConclusionsThe Draft Communication ends with three conclusions.Firstly, the Commission does not believe that a banking activity can becarried on under the same conditions in home and host Member States,whatever the circumstances. Host country civil, criminal, tax or labourlaws will apply to the branch or foreign service provider as these arenot affected by the Second Directive.Secondly, non-discriminatory restrictions applying to the serviceitself must, however, satisfy the general good test (and theaccompanying principles of proportionality etc) regardless of whetherthe banking service is provided through a branch or from another MemberState under the freedom to supply services.Here, the Commission makes specific reference to restrictions applyingto:1) the intrinsic features of the service such as cost, interest rates,duration, contractual terms and conditions;2) the underlying financial techniques; and3) the way the service is marketed, such as advertising, canvassingetc.Finally, application of the proportionality principle to measuresjustified in the interest of the common good will produce varyingresults for credit institutions operating in another Member State underthe freedom to supply services or through a branch.Draft Commission Communication: Freedom to provide services and theinterest of the general good in the Second Banking Directive: OfficialJournal C 291 of 4.11.95.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightE.U. FINANCIAL INDUSTRY MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MORE DETAILS ON NEW APPROACHES TO THE HARMONISATION OF ACCOUNTINGTHE NOVEMBER 1995 issue of EU Financial Industry Monitor reportedcomments by Commissioner Mario Monti on the possibility of adopting anew approach to accounting standards. Since then, he has obtained fromhis Commission colleagues approval for a Communication entitledAccounting harmonisation: a new strategy vis-a-vis internationalharmonisation. This is essentially a discussion document, although itsets out fairly clearly what the Commission intends doing.The Communication starts by setting out the reasons for a new strategy:- the known shortcomings of the existing EU legislation. Thederogations and Member State options which have detracted fromharmonisation under the basic Fourth and Seventh Directives - oncompany accounts and consolidated accounts respectively - have beencarried forward into the Bank Accounts Directive and the InsuranceAccounts Directive;- the absence of progress on harmonisation since these measures wereadopted and the unlikelihood of new legislation. The Communicationreports that a conference in 1990 brought out a clear preference fornot adopting new legislation in the near future;- the problems faced by large European companies seeking capital on theinternational markets. In particular, companies seeking capital on theNew York Stock Exchange have to draw up separate accounts according toUS Generally Accepted Accounting Practices since accounts drawn upaccording to European standards are not accepted in the US, althoughthe reverse is the case;- the importance of the international harmonisation process and thedanger that in the present situation Europe can contribute little tothis process and then face problems of compatibility between itsstandards and international ones.After setting out these problems, the Commission Communication brieflycites several solutions which have been aired with the Member States:amending the Directives so as to exempt large listed companies and letthem follow other rules, negotiating a mutual recognition agreementwith the US, setting up a European Accounting Standard Setting Body.All of these are rejected for one reason or another.The Communication then sets out the Commission's proposed approach,which will have to gain the explicit support and agreement of theMember States. It emphasises that this new approach does not involvethe EU abandoning the field of accounting harmonisation but, on thecontrary, strengthens "its commitment and contribution to theinternational standard-setting process, which offers the most efficientand rapid solution for the problems of companies operating on a world-wide scale".The Commission's proposed approach consists of four steps.Checking the conformity of existing international accounting standardswith the accounting directivesThis is a priority, given the urgent issue of European companiesseeking listings on international capital markets.The Contact Committee on the Accounting Directives, set up by theFourth Directive, would examine the compatibility of the IAS with theDirectives. Conformity is an essential first step if the Member Statesare to allow their large companies to prepare accounts on an IAS basis.The Communication points out that the Member States would have to gothrough the same exercise for their national laws because of theoptions in the EU Directives. An IAS could be compatible with theDirectives but not with national law.Inconsistencies between the Directives and IAS would have to beexamined case-by-case so as to resolve conflicts. The InternationalAccounting Standards Committee could be asked to change the standard inquestion (the IASC executive has expressed its willingness to considerchanges) but, if necessary, the Commission would propose changes to theDirectives. To that end, the Commission believes that seriousconsideration should be given to an accelerated procedure for amendingthe Directives by a committee.European contributions to the work of the IASCTo ensure EU input to the IASC, the Contact Committee should examineIASC Exposure Drafts and try to reach agreed positions on them. Theagreed positions would be sent to the IASC. In this way, the Commissionbelieves that the EU can build up a position of influence, possiblyeven extending to IASC agenda fixing.This would involve enlarging the role of the Contact Committee and theCommission favours the setting-up of technical sub- committees.Priority would be given to consolidated accounts for two reasons.Firstly, it is those companies which prepare consolidated accountswhich are most exposed to the problems described in the Communication.Secondly, a general approach covering individual company accounts wouldbe more likely to raise problems with the Member States because of thelink between company accounts and taxation.Improving the comparability of accountsThe Contact Committee should increase its efforts in this area bydealing with practical problems in the application of the Directives.For its part, the Commission will co-operate with the Contact Committeewith a view to improving coordination among the Member State bodiesinvolved in standard-setting.The Commission might, for example, incorporate the advice of theContact Committee in interpretative communications or recommendations.Where appropriate, it would publicise the work of the ContactCommittee.The Directives under the new approachThe new approach can only operate within the limits laid down by theDirectives. Therefore, if it proves necessary, the Commission willpropose amending directives, although it would clearly prefer to avoidthat course and hopes that legislation can be avoided in most instancesby "effective technical co- operation" in the Contact Committee.To that end, it is essential that all institutions involved inaccounting standard-setting are involved in Committee's work.Similarly, the Commission considers that there should be co- ordinationbetween the Committee and the Accounting Advisory Forum, whichrepresents users and preparers of accounts and which at present ispurely consultative.Contact Committee members could attend Forum meetings and the Forum'sexpertise could be "associated" with the Committee's technical work.The Communication ends with a conclusion that"The Union needs to movepromptly to offer the users and preparers of accounts a clear prospectthat companies seeking listings on the US and other world markets willbe able to remain within the EU accounting framework and that the USGAAP, over which they and their governments can exercise no influence,is not the only option".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMMISSION CONSUMER DG PLANS DATABASE OF BANKING PRICE STRUCTURESTHE COMMISSION'S Directorate-General for Consumer Policy (DG XXIV)plans to set up a database to compare the national price structures ofbanking services and follow their evolution. It published an invitationto tender for a study to this end in the Official Journal C 233 of 7September.The invitation to tender, in its description of the proposed study,states:"Some banking services which were in the past apparently free of chargefor consumers are now explicitly charged and some are becoming ratherexpensive. On the basis of information from several Member States, theprice of these services is increasing faster than the rate ofinflation. The introduction of a single currency will also imply a newcost structure for some of these services (for example, cross-bordertransactions)."DG XXIV, therefore, aims to create an instrument to compare MemberState price structures and to follow their evolution. The instrumentwill be set up before the end of this year and updated annually. Itwill cover the management of consumer bank accounts and relatedoperations in all 15 Member States.The first stage of the study will be to determine for each of theMember States the typical use of a bank account by the consumer orgroup of consumers and to establish the average cost to these consumersof the typical use.Since national habits vary - the relative use of cheques, banktransfers, debit cards, credit cards, etc - the study will have toensure comparability of study results.All costs borne by consumers will be covered by the study, includingannual administration charges, transaction fees, interest lost throughdeferred value dates, consumer credit linked to credit cards andoverdrafts.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

With between 120 and 150 partnersbelieved to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000per partner.The action related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADTfor Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million forBritannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had beenaudited by Binder.Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profitswere #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assetswere less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT waseventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit againstBinder in 1992.The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its auditof Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADTbecause of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off onthe accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop wasasked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accountsgave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishopreplied that he did.Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted aduty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for anyadvice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which heldthat auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties regardless ofwhether they are negligent.Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it willsucceed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparoprinciples apply," a spokesman said. The appeal, which will not beginuntil next year, could take a year or more to run its course.BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of thefirm, which still uses the Binder Hamlyn name, joined the ArthurAndersen Worldwide Organisation (EA 49). Bishop is still with BinderHamlyn in London.Most of Binder's regional offices merged with Stoy Hayward (EA 46),which subsequently became BDO's UK member firm, while some partnersjoined other accounting firms or went into industry.

Since then, a further 70 consulting staffhave jumped ship.The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, are a blow tothe firm's consulting business, which reported revenues of Pta2.67billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times that of E&Y.According to a C&L spokesperson, the consulting practice had justreturned to profit after several difficult years during Spain'srecession.Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director ofE&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managingdirector. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have beenmade partners at E&Y."This was part of a plan we started a couple of years ago when I camefrom the US, and that was to increase the size of E&Y in Spain," McKaysaid. "It became clear to us that to achieve the growth, we needed tobecome a competitive force. We couldn't do it through internal growth,we needed external resources at a senior level. That included bringingin as managing director a Spaniard who would run the practice."E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but didnot specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the former C&Lpartners were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & YoungConsultores is a separate firm with its own profit pool.The raid is not E&Y's first attempt to build a strong consulting arm inSpain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a consulting divisionwhen Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in 1989 and the 1993establishment of E&Y Consultores with financial backing from E&Y in theUS - were not as successful as the firm would have liked.Although head-hunting is not rare, the scale of E&Y's raid isunprecedented and has been perceived by C&L as a direct attempt tosteal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the firm. C&Lis reported to be taking legal action against E&Y and the formerpartners.It accuses E&Y of breaching Spain's fair trade laws and of inducing C&Lstaff to break their legal commitments to the firm by offering themfinancial compensation to leave without giving the required 15 days'notice.McKay denied this. "We believe we have acted in accordance with thelaws and contractual obligations of all the people," he said. "Thepeople who have joined us have joined of their own free will andexercised their professional rights in the marketplace."E&Y also denies trying to steal C&L's business and has offered to`lend' C&L its former consultants to finish work already in hand, anoffer which C&L described as cynical and not worthy of consideration.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

MRI has alsosigned up a correspondent firm in Finland.The new firm, to be known as Revision Noraudit & Co AS, will haverevenues of roughly NKr160 million ($27 million), a figure which willgive it sixth place in the local rankings ahead of Price Waterhouse andbehind the other Big Six affiliates. The staff figure totals around250, including 48 partners, and the new firm will operate out of 17offices.The merger was "purely" driven by national considerations, according toKjetil Rivelsrud, chairman of the new firm and formerly executivechairman of Noraudit. "We'd made a decision that we had to make amerger in Norway to strengthen our coverage," he said. "We talked withRevisorGruppen about a merger and the result was that we had to chooseone of the [international] groups. RevisorGruppen had more referredwork for Norway than Nexia, so we decided that MRI was the betterchoice."Rivelsrud said the merger is a good strategic fit. His firm is strongin Oslo and the northern part of the country, while the MRI affiliateis well represented in Bergen and Stavangar in the west of the country.RevisorGruppen, the smaller of the two firms, comprised a network of 11offices, two of which - Molde and Horten - have opted out of themerger. Those practices accounted for revenues of between NKr10 millionand NKr15 million, Rivelsrud said.Revision Noraudit's fiscal 1994 revenues totalled NKr119 million. Oneassociated firm, with revenues of NKr5 million, has opted out of themerger, while Nexia Consulting AS, which is partly owned by theauditing firm, is also remaining independent of the new firm.Noraudit previously represented Deloitte Haskins & Sells, but opted outof the global merger with Touche Ross in 1990. It joined forces withNexia in 1992, and last year changed its name from Deloitte Norauditfollowing a legal dispute with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Internationalover the use of the Deloitte name. Rivelsrud said the two sidesresolved the dispute through an out- of-court settlement.Noraudit's defection naturally leaves Nexia with a gap in its Europeancoverage."They felt they had to do a merger locally," said NigelHodges, Nexia's executive director. Hodges admitted that Nexia does notrefer much work into Norway and said the group will use the services ofOla Petter Hopp, a former senior manager at Noraudit now operating as aconsultant, until a new member can be found.Meanwhile, in Finland, MRI has linked up with Tilimerkono, a two-partner Helsinki-based firm with revenues of $500,000. The firm, whichhas nine staff, was recommended by MRI's Danish member, City RevisionA/S, and will help MRI expand into the Baltic countries, according toJohn Cox, the network's executive director. The Helsinki practice waspreviously unaffiliated.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996JERSEY TO OFFER PARTNERS LIMITED LIABILITYTHE UK member firms of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young look set tobe the first to take advantage of a proposed law in Jersey that willlet professionals form limited liability partnerships (LLP) on theisland.Details of the draft law were announced on December 11 by the Financeand Economics Committee of the States of Jersey, the island'sParliament. It will be debated by Jersey legislators in the firstquarter of 1996 and, if approved, will then go to the UK Privy Councilfor sanctioning. The measure is expected to become law before the endof the year.Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the Jerseyproposal. Solicitors, architects and surveyors will also be able toestablish partnerships on the island, as could practices from othercountries.Under the proposed law, which was devised in consultation with PW andE&Y, the LLP would remain totally liable for all the firm's debts, butindividual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligentact would have their personal assets protected from debts arising fromthat negligence.Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and allLLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP wouldbe required to put up a #5 million ($8 million) bond for judgmentsagainst the partnership."We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liabilitypartnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Ysenior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number ofclients and all of our partners have produced a very positivereaction." Privately, E&Y sources said the firm plans to move to LLPstatus as soon as possible."At the moment, if you're found to be liable for negligence, thenyou're liable for everything, no matter what your contribution to thatnegligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of CharteredAccountants in England and Wales in trying to get the government tochange the UK legal principle of joint and several liability. "Thiscan't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things take time and timeis not necessarily on our side." In the meantime, the firms need a wayto protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law forpartnerships, which was created in 1907, as "not relevant to moderntimes". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primarylegislation would be needed to change it, he said.The proposal allows E&Y and PW to maintain their partnership culturewithin the UK and there will be no change to their UK taxationarrangements. The Jersey option is claimed to be cheaper than theincorporation route chosen recently by KPMG (EA 60). A senior partnerat one of the firms estimates the saving could be as much as 10 percentof pre-tax profits compared with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.However, some KPMG sources raised doubts over how effective the LLPoption will be in preventing potential litigants in the UK frompursuing a partnership registered in Jersey through the British courts.KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman declined to comment on the legaladvice his firm had received. "When we made our decision to incorporatewe were aware of the Jersey option and we discounted it," he said. "Fora number of reasons - one of which was the degree of security we werelooking for - we elected to go the route we have."(See page 8 for more analysis)Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Manchester-based company, which wasowned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin Harrison, was mainlyinvolved in leasing cars, property and computer equipment.Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a duediligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate financeadvice in connection with the transaction.In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations andadvice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceedwith the acquisition."It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition,Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the wayit was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position beenrevealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not haveproceeded with the acquisition."In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions ofSch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing and, in 1992, forced theresignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of itsUK operations.However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted areal due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said thefirm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisitiontook place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuationat the time of the purchase."We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defendthem," Hainsworth said.The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The casecould take two years to be heard.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CODE DEMANDS SCRUTINY OF HIGH-RISK CLIENTSNEW REGULATIONS in Germany have introduced a Big Six-style  approachthat requires all of the country's auditors to adopt a risk-basedapproach to their work.The new requirements have been jointly issued by theWirtschaftspruferkammer (WPK), the state auditing body run by thefederal minister of economics, and the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer(IdW), the private professional body that represents Germany's 6,000accountants.In future, all statutory auditors will have to analyse their clients'operating environments, assess the influence of general risk factors,make a provisional judgement about inherent business risk, and evaluateinternal control procedures.The risk-based approach, long used by the Big Six in Germany andelsewhere, has now become part of the official guidelines which statethat "the high-risk audit areas should be given greater weight in theaudit process".The new guidelines form part of a revised code of conduct on auditquality. The code, which was last amended in 1982, has been updated inan attempt to dissuade the justice ministry in Bonn from introducingtougher legislative controls on auditors. For the first time, theprofession's quality guidelines cover voluntary audits, tax advice,consultancy and expert advisory work, as well as statutory audits.Outgoing IdW president Dietrich Dorner said the profession remainsstrongly in favour of self-regulation. "We don't want to wait until theauthorities and the government take the reins," he said. "We don't wantstate regulation." But he acknowledged that recent controversies aboutaudit quality in Germany have led the justice ministry to considertougher regulation of the profession.WPK president Gerhard Burret acknowledged that there had beenshortcomings in all of the practice areas covered by the new rules. Inparticular, the rules are stricter on auditor independence; auditorsare required to disclose financial, personal and shareholder links withtheir clients.The rules require auditors to ensure that their work is reviewed by asuitably-qualified colleague (the so-called double-signatureprinciple). Dorner said the principle was equally binding on solepractitioners. "These accountants usually have links with otherpractitioners and I expect they will use them to fulfil thisrequirement," he said.Separately, Dorner commented on the growing acceptance of InternationalAccounting Standards (IAS) by German companies. The IdW recentlyproduced a dual-language guide to IAS for members of the profession andtheir clients. Dorner believes IAS will inevitably become generallyaccepted in Germany even though they contradict some of the main tenetsof the country's commercial code. "Our principle of prudence is a soundone, but it is evident which way things will go," he said. "We won't beable to avoid IAS."Yet Dorner does not agree that the German profession would be able toexert more influence on the formulation of IAS by having an Anglo Saxon-style standard-setting body. "I'm not optimistic that [such a body]would be any better than what we have at the moment," he said."It wouldpronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effectwould be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GOVERNMENT WARNS PROFESSION ON SELF-REGULATIONTHE GERMAN government has served notice on the local accountingprofession that it must vastly improve its self-regulation if it is notto have practice rules imposed by law.Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingenin early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting standards atthe Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputychairman of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).Biener was dismissive of the profession's new quality standards,introduced just a few days earlier (see story above). Even under thenew rules, he said, German accountants are still not obliged toactively seek out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts."The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said."Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The lawallows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obligedto argue things out with the company."Biener also criticised the IdW's main practice committee for its latediscovery of shortcomings in the switch to International AccountingStandards by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger Zement for their 1994accounts. Gross countered that it would have been unfeasible for thecommittee to intervene any earlier, but that the changes suggested bythe committee would be incorporated in the companies' 1995 accounts.Biener acknowledged that the leading accounting firms in Germany areworld-class, but expressed concern about the rank-and-file of theprofession. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise toaudits which are just average; rather they should allow accountantswith an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which isup to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died outbecause they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession hasgrasped that message."German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regainpublic confidence, particularly as a result of the bad publicitysurrounding Daimler-Benz's accounts. As the only German company with aNew York listing, Daimler is obliged to publish not only German-styleaccounts, but a reconciliation to US GAAP as well. That has resulted inhuge discrepancies between the two figures, particularly in thecompany's 1993 accounts."Our audits have become suspect," Biener said. "Sooner or later Germanaccounts will no longer be accepted by the international community."Companies' accounting departments, rather than accounting firms, shouldprovide the impetus for the regulation of accounting practice, saidBiener. Accounting firms have their own commercial interests toconsider, and may be reluctant to push for change. He thereforesuggested that German, and in turn European companies, set up aregulatory body modelled on the Financial Accounting Standards Board inthe US.In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea. "Iwon't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] bodyoperates in a sensible fashion," he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Combined auditing revenuesfor 1996 are expected to total L15 billion ($9 million).The alliance was approved by Consob, Italy's bourse watchdog, at theend of September and will formally take effect early in 1996. The firmwill operate as Grant Thornton Italia, although it was the partners ofHodgson Landau Brands, the HLB International affiliate, who made thefirst move.The new firm's partners will own 90 percent of the shares, while theremaining 10 percent will remain in the hands of Centrobanca,Italaudit's owner. Recent legislation obliged Italian banks to reducetheir shareholdings in auditing firms to below 50 percent by the end of1995.Lorenzo Penca, managing partner of Hodgson Landau Brands, will bepresident of the new firm while Claudio Muollo, the head of Italaudit,is moving to lead Grant Thornton's consultancy arm -in Italy, the twodivisions have to be kept legally separate.Penca said the merger will enable the firms to keep pace with thecompetition. "This was an opportunity we could not pass up," he said."Auditing firms in Italy that do not grow will find it increasinglydifficult to survive. With this merger we have established a highly-professional auditing body with a solid base and a recognisedinternational name which will distinguish us from the smaller firms inItaly. Our view is that there will eventually be only ten auditinggroups [authorised to audit listed companies] in the country and thisis our way of ensuring that we are one of them."Previously, Hodgson Laundau Brands was ninth in the rankings, with feeincome of L7.5 billion, while Italaudit was placed 12th with revenues,including consulting, of roughly L6 billion.The firm will have more than 70 staff with 11 partners. Clients includeItalian dairy producer, Parmalat, two leading football clubs, anItalian drugs company, publishers, fashion houses such as GianfrancoFerre, and a clutch of Italian banks."We may not be able to compete with the Big Six on size, but we cancertainly match them for image and professionalism," Penca said. "Thereare only a small number of groups in Italy whose accounts GrantThornton Italia would not be in a position to audit, which leaves a lotof potential business. The trend for smaller companies to seek stockmarket listings is very encouraging and we will be looking to exploitthe situation to the full."The merger is a blow to the HLB International network. The Italian firmwas HLB's 15th-largest member and referred out "a reasonable amount" ofwork, according to Peter Frost, the group's London-based chiefexecutive. "The move was driven by their desire for a merger atnational level," Frost said."We are looking at one or two alternativesat the moment."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Assirevi had come to beregarded as almost exclusively a Big Six organisation since the smallerfirms broke away to form Aire in the late 1980s.Vittorio Salvi, head of Milan-based Sofiresa, which recently quit Aire,cited two reasons for firms returning to the fold. "It has happenedpartly because of the growth of international affiliation among Italianfirms, but also because Assirevi carries more weight with banks andConsob," he said. "The reasons for starting Aire for Italian auditingfirms have been overtaken by events." Sofiresa is a member of SummitInternational.Hodgson Landau Brands, which recently merged with Italaudit to formGrant Thornton Italia (see above story), was one of the few mid-tierfirms not to join Aire. Dino Mangiarotti, senior partner at the newfirm and a director of Assirevi, is convinced of the value of Assirevimembership. "Firms wishing to audit listed companies in Italy benefitgreatly from the international name and the status of being part ofAssirevi," he said. "It distinguishes these companies from the other,smaller firms."Aire president Fausto Vitucci does not dispute the differing roles ofthe two associations but is convinced that Aire still has an essentialrole to play for auditors in Italy."The listed company audit market is limited in Italy and anexceptionally high number of non-listed companies will request audits,"he said. "The problem is how this market is divided. Smaller firms arebetter suited to auditing smaller companies, particularly in terms ofcosts. It seems unreasonable that the largest firms seek to imposetheir brands on this end of the market because it raises fees to anunacceptable level for many small companies."Vitucci said the Italian market is different from others in severalways. The stock market is small relative to the size of the economy andaudit work is more seasonal than in other countries. The big firms, heclaimed, are forced to seek work at the lower end of the market to keeptheir partners busy all year round.Recent legislative changes have required all auditors to officiallyregister with the authorities - more than 65,000 have since done so. Onthe other hand, there is no clear regulatory authority for the non-listed market unless the work is performed by a Consob-authorised firm.Vitucci said Aire can provide support for smaller audit firms andensure that standards are maintained at the lower end of the market.Vitucci's firm, First Professional Audit, is applying for Consobauthorisation, a step which, he said, improves auditors' status even ifthey do not plan to audit listed companies. Sofiresa, for example, isalso Consob-approved although it currently has no quoted audit clients.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Namesthen sued the auditor for negligence, claiming that the syndicates'accounts had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value oftheir investments. The Names said they would not have invested in lateryears had they known of the losses.The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent inauditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed tofuture investors at Lloyd's. The Names are expected to appeal thedecision.The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wideout-of-court settlement of all the litigation that has dogged themarket for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for theestimated #11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988.

Havermann was previouslysenior partner between 1985 and 1991 and chairman of KPMG Internationaluntil September 1995.Separately, KPMG Germany said it expects gross revenues in 1995 to rise5 percent to about DM1.17 billion ($800 million). Profits will alsoimprove, the firm said, without giving details. This growth was largelythe result of "initial successes" in KPMG's efforts to put greateremphasis on consulting work, it added.Meanwhile, provisional figures from C&L Deutsche Revision indicate thatthe Coopers & Lybrand member has drawn almost level with KPMG as thelargest accounting firm in Germany. Partner Horst Goldbach told EA thatgroup fee income expanded by 9.5 percent to about DM1.14 billion in1995. Although fee income was up in all divisions, growth wasparticularly strong in consultancy work, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"The intention always was that the [London firm] would joinus at some stage," he said.Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certainethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have mergedwith Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. "We are actively seekingfurther acquisitions over the next year," McDonnell said. GrantThornton is in preliminary talks with a number of local firms, none ofwhich are linked to a national network, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The prosecution hopes toprove that the former executives carried out fraudulent papertransactions - worth billions of marks - between Balsam and Procedo andthus caused the collapse of both companies. Muscat, who advised bothcompanies, is accused of "deliberate involvement" with the allegedfrauds.Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his caseagainst PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partnersacted intentionally, rather than just negligently. But he is unwillingto delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a prolongedadjournment. The court was scheduled to reconvene on December 19 tomake a final decision on the adjournment, after both sides hadconsulted with their clients.The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of"intentional misconduct"in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approvingthe accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added anew claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval withoutactually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

ICAEWchief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible asa result of the inevitable duplication of services currently beingprovided by the two.Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. Heexpects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEWis currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 ($210) annualsubscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110currently charged by CIMA.However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behindthe merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," hesaid. "We are promoting this because the environment for the professionis becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests ofaccountants better by being bigger."The new body will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at thosetraining in public practice, who will continue to be known as"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,who will bear the title "chartered management accountant".There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of twofoundation levels, an intermediate stage and a final level. Studentswill be time barred if they do not pass their final exams within sevenyears of starting the foundation course. Students will be able toaccumulate exam credits at all levels except the final one.The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be droppedin an attempt to give the new body a global image. "This is notmarketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a high-qualityqualification around the world," Colquhoun said. "They will have tomeet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think there is amarket out there for our qualification."The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each ofwhich will be able to elect six members to the new council: three fromindustry and three from practice. The exception will be London whichwill elect 14 members.There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in othercountries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa. Members of bothinstitutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal in April or May.Meanwhile, CIMA has gained Privy Council approval for its members touse the individual description of "chartered management accountant"with immediate effect. According to a statement from CIMA, the newdesignation"should enable the members of both bodies to consider themerger proposals on their true merits, as there would be no change oftitle for the members of either body".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

He also repeated his demand for the ACCA president and vice-president to be elected by the association's members. "Basically, thepeople who are leading the organisation need to be mandated," he said.The plan to disband the current London-based council and replace itwith a federal structure was put forward by ACCA chief executive AntheaRose at a council meeting in early December. The proposed structuredevolves power to a number of new regional councils, which will in turnreport to an international committee. Sikka has argued that theassociation's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent of the total - areeffectively disenfranchised.A discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCAmembers on December 15.An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structuredmakes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if theylive on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose someform of devolution with a federal structure."The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.These could include direct dealings with regional governments and theissue of guidance and advice on local auditing, accounting and taxationmatters. It is unlikely that the regional councils will have anycontrol over ACCA's examination syllabus.As for Sikka's call for direct presidential elections, the ACCA is notruling this out. But a change to the current practice of having thepresident elected by the council is not part of the latest proposals.Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Associationof Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the PrivyCouncil, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation'sRoyal Charter.In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of theword "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with theuse of the term "chartered".In submissions to the council earlier this year, the Institute ofChartered Accountants in England and Wales argued that the name changewould cause confusion with the certified public accountant designationused in the US. Another vocal critic of the ACCA, Labour Member ofParliament Austin Mitchell, argued that the association did not actsufficiently in the public interest for it to merit the title"public".The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects toput forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996A SOLUTION TO THE LITIGATION PROBLEM?UK accounting firms may have found a partial solution to the problemsof litigation without the expense of incorporation. William Gleesonlooks at the implications of two firms' plans to register as LLPs inJerseyTHE "ACCOUNTANCIES" - the collective noun that some UK newspapers havestarted using for accountancy practices - have announced that, for thetime being at least, they are putting their hopes for salvation fromrogue litigants in the hands of the 600-year- old Jersey Parliament.Or, at least Ernst & Young and Price Waterhouse are.The Finance and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey - as theisland's Parliament is called - is proposing a new limited liabilitypartnership (LLP) law, to be debated in the first quarter of the newyear.If the legislation comes into being, the UK's largest accountancy firmswill be able to re-register in Jersey and, should they be successfullysued, the personal assets of the partners not directly involved in thealleged wrongdoing will be protected.Both E&Y and PW have said the Jersey route is their preferred way tolimit liability. It has the advantage of preserving the partnershipethos of the firms, and is cheaper than incorporation. The change frompaying national insurance contributions under the rules for the self-employed to the rules applying to those employed by a company wouldmean, in effect, partners would face higher tax rates.The basis for assessing taxable profits would change as well, withAccounting Standards Board rules applying to the incorporated entity.This particularly applies to work in progress which would be given ahigher value, making the income of the practice higher.But serious question marks hang over the proposals. It is by no meanscertain that the laws will have a smooth passage through the States ofJersey. This body is not a traditional Parliament, and there are nopolitical parties. Instead, there is an assembly of individuals whocome from a wide cross-section of the community. Current members of the54-strong body range from a retired stockbroker to a green activist.Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the Finance and EconomicsCommittee, said: "This is not in anyway like a party political system,where you know you have a majority before you start . .very meaningful."Horsfall's seven-man committee has to persuade the other 47 members ofthe States of the merits of the case for the new law during one stand-up debating session.In the autumn, a bill proposed by the States education committee toreform the way school pupils are streamed at the age of 14 was thrownout, forcing the committee to resign.But limited liability for partnerships should be less of an emotiveissue for the Jersey Parliament than local education. Also, there is alot in it for the local economy. Passing this legislation will bringcloser ties between the island and prestigious financial sectorbusinesses. Of Jersey's 43,000 workers, 9,000, or just over 20 percent,are employed in the financial services sector.Whatever happens, the answer will be obtained quickly. Once the processhas passed through the States it must then await the approval of the UKPrivy Council, an honorary body whose role it is, by and large, torubberstamp the States' proposals. E&Y has said it hopes to become anLLP sometime in the second half of next year.But even if the proposed bill gets through in its current form, doubtexists as to whether the new law will afford the protection beingsought.KPMG has received legal advice that the UK courts may refuse torecognise that Jersey's laws take precedence to UK laws. In essence,the firm has been advised that if the accountant being sued works andlives in the UK and signs his audit report "KPMG, London" and theplaintiff is based in the UK, it seems perfectly reasonable to arguethat the re-registration in Jersey is nothing more than an artificialruse to escape the UK courts' jurisdiction.Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: "This law doesn't existyet, it is a proposed change. When we were considering it we were awarethat the States of Guernsey was thinking of revising its partnershiplaw and aware that the States of Jersey was considering doing so. Wehave an English law solution to an English law problem which gives usas much protection as we need."Indeed, it transpires that KPMG has taken a long hard look not only atthe Channel Islands but at other European jurisdictions - not just theobvious ones like Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, but France, Germany andSpain as well.But there are plenty who hope the cynics are wrong, not least the otherfirms - Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross - which are currently sittingfirmly on their hands waiting for some progress.It is undoubtedly wrong that all the responsibility for corporatefailure is borne by the auditors, with the failed company's managementgetting away scot-free.The firms feel time is against them. The campaign to reform liabilitylaw in the UK is not likely to bear fruit for several years.The same is true of UK partnership law. The Department of Trade andIndustry is said to be sympathetic to the needs of the accountancyprofession, but it is currently not high on the list of priorities ofeither the government or the main opposition parties, especially with ageneral election to be held sooner rather than later.But in the end, this move is not about economic or legal realities. Itis about the psychology of poker players. Potential litigants will nowhave to ask how much stronger will off-shore re-registration make thehand of the accountancies in negligence claims?As yet, nobody has sued partners in a firm for their homes and theshirts from their kids' backs - and possibly no rational litigant everwould. The fear is of the potentially irrational "rogue" litigant. Infuture, if the Jersey law goes through, should any person ever think ofbeing a rogue, they will have to ask"is this worth it, now that thedeep pockets motive has gone?"Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EARLY SIGNS OF UPTURNDanish accounting firms are predicting sustained growth over the nextfew years thanks mainly to an improvement in general economicconditions. Sally Roden reportsALTHOUGH FEE income growth is still quite modest, Danish accountingfirms believe they have turned a corner after recent years ofrecession.Demand from clients is on the increase, although few partners expectauditing to drive the recovery. "Competition is still quitesubstantial, but the economic recovery is beginning to influence theprofession in a positive direction," said Frank Jakobsen, internationalcontact partner with Grant Thornton Denmark/Grothen & Perregard."For the first time in several years, we are experiencing a lack ofskilled labour, indicating that firms are beginning to feel a rise indemand."That said, the latest batch of fee income figures are unlikely to setpulses racing. Only two of the top ten firms reported revenue increasesof more than 5 percent, and one of those, BDO ScanRevision, said its14.2 percent growth rate was partly the result of a merger."The economy has been improving in general but - at least among thebig, international firms - the audit market is affected byrationalisation and technological changes, and in some areas is stillaffected by keen price competition," said Torben Haaning, managingpartner of Coopers & Lybrand.KPMG C Jespersen is still the top firm in Denmark with 1994 revenues ofDKr668 million ($120 million), a rise of 3.4 percent on the previousyear. For 1995, the firm estimates revenues will rise a further 2.5percent to DKr685 million.The 1995 figures will have been boosted by the merger completed at thestart of the year of KPMG's offices on the island of Funen with localfirm Edvin Munk. The merger gave KPMG a presence in three more towns onthe island and doubled the size of its office in Svendborg.Among KPMG's major audit clients are shipping, manufacturing and retailgroup AP Moller, electrical machinery maker Danfoss and in the bankingsector Den Danske Bank and Unibank.Second-placed Deloitte & Touche, which changed its name from Schobel &Marholt on January 1 of this year, reported revenues of DKr651.2million for fiscal 1994, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier. D&T'smajor audit clients include insurance company Topdanmark, for which italso provides consulting services, and food and beverage producerDanisco.In third place in the rankings is C&L with 1994 revenues of DKr525million, up 1.9 percent from a year earlier, followed by Ernst & Youngwith fee income of DKr358 million, a rise of 3.2 percent.The E&Y figures do not reflect two mergers which the firm completedthis year. On May 1, it teamed up with Borg og Green, an auditing firmbased in the northern Zealand area. The merger boosted the number ofpartners in E&Y's Hillerod office to seven and increased its totalstaff there to 52. Then on July 1, E&Y merged with RIO Partner, a four-partner firm in Odense with annual revenues of DKr50 million.E&Y managing partner Teddy Wivel said the firm has experienced a lot ofgrowth in management consulting and tax services and expects this tocontinue in the current year.Price Waterhouse/Seier-Petersen took fifth place with revenues ofDKr300 million in the year to June 1995. Morten Iversen, a partner atthe firm, said PW was not involved in any mergers during the year andthat its growth rate of 11.1 percent was entirely organic.He said much of the revenue increase came from a rise in informationtechnology consulting and tax consulting business. "We have a verystrong tax practice and there has been a general increase in demand foradded-value tax services."Among PW's major audit clients are pharmaceuticals group Novo Nordisk,Tele Danmark, insurance group Trygg-Baltica Forsikring, and the localsubsidiaries of computer group IBM and oil giant Shell.The highest revenue increase of any of the firms surveyed came fromsixth-placed BDO ScanRevision, with fee income rising 14.2 percent toDKr297 million in the year to September. The firm said the impressiveincrease was partly the result of a merger with auditing firm JRI,which has offices in Aarhus, Skanderborg and Auning. Managing partnerJens Rye said the merger doubled BDO's presence in Aarhus, a port onthe eastern side of Jutland.Rye added that BDO has experienced some growth in the audit sector overthe last year. He said this was because the firm deals mainly with themedium-sized corporate sector where price competition is less severe.BDO has also begun diversifying into consulting. "Clients are morewilling to pay [for consulting services] because they see results,which is not always the case in the audit sector," Rye said.Arthur Andersen remains in seventh place, with fiscal 1995 revenues ofDKr234 million, a rise of 4 percent on the previous year. The firm'saudit business contributed 44 percent of revenues, while AndersenConsulting accounted for 47 percent.Andersen's country managing partner Torgny Pahle said tradingconditions in Denmark in the last year were characterised by a "veryweak audit market with no growth, fierce competition and a soft outlookfor the future". The consulting market, on the other hand, is growingacross the board, he said.Most firms agreed with Pahle that competition in the audit marketremains strong. More and more audits are being put out to tender, andclients are stepping up their demands for value for money, they said.Wivel said E&Y has also noticed price competition spreading from theaudit sector into the consulting business, particularly from other BigSix firms with strong consulting arms.The poor outlook for the audit market is unlikely to be helped if thegovernment goes ahead with plans to drop the rule obliging listedcompanies to appoint joint auditors. The government believes the jointauditor system places too heavy a financial burden on the companiesconcerned.Although the proposal is still being considered, Bjarne Fabienke,senior partner at KPMG, expects an amendment to the law beforeChristmas. If it goes ahead, "the total audit market will be reduced",he said.As a result of the rule, the Big Six currently share many of Denmark'slargest companies as clients: brewing group Carlsberg is audited byKPMG and PW; Bang & Olufsen, the electronics company, is audited by C&Land PW; and the national postal service, Post Danmark, is audited byAndersen and PW.PW's Iversen believes the government is considering changing the jointaudit rule because Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe withsuch a requirement. "In terms of the EU, it's a bit unusual," he said.Last October, a law was passed which said no one audit client should beallowed to contribute more than 20 percent of a firm's fee income.Twelve months later, the general consensus among firms is that thelegislation has had little real effect.Fabienke said the law does not apply to big firms in reality since oneclient would never contribute 20 percent of total revenues. However,problems might arise for smaller firms with lower overall fee income.The aim of this legislation was to boost auditor independence, an issuethat was under the spotlight in recent years but now seems to havemoved off the agenda. "The profession's reputation was tarnished in thelate 1980s and early 1990s when there were a number of collapses and itwas automatically drawn into the debate," Iversen said. "That period isbehind us. The profession has regained its credibility."Alongside the ongoing improvement in the Danish economy, the joblessrate has fallen over the last year from over 12 percent to just above10 percent. With this, some firms have reported problems findingsuitable staff. "When the market is growing it is inevitable that someshortages arise," said Iversen at PW.Wivel said E&Y has had problems recruiting in the Copenhagen area. Ithas been doing presentations in the universities to encourage younggraduates into the firm with some success.A more serious problem for the big international firms is insurancecover. Legislation was introduced earlier this year requiring firmswith more than ten certified public accountants to take out nationalinsurance cover of DKr20 million. All the bigger firms already haveinternational insurance policies but the Danish authorities no longeraccept this. "We foresee extra cost to fulfil the nationalrequirements, even though we have international insurance with a moreextensive cover," said Haaning at C&L.Denmark's traditional links to the Baltic have resulted in a number ofDanish accounting firms establishing a presence in the former easternbloc. KPMG, for example, at the request of the international firm,established a practice in Lithuania. KPMG's Swedish and Finnish membershave set up practices in the other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,respectively.BKR International's RIR Revision owns a firm of the same name inPoland, although earlier this year the Polish firm dropped the BKR linkand signed up with Moore Stephens. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, BDO's memberfirm is owned by BDO ScanRevision.LEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN DENMARK - FEE INCOME                                    Most                                    recent   Previous                                    year's   years'                                    fee      fee       Growth Effec-                      International income   income    rate   tiveFirm                  affiliation   (DKr/m)  (DKr/m)   (%)    dateKPMG C Jespersen      KPMG          668.0    646.0       3.4  Dec 94Deloitte & Touche     Deloitte                      Touche                      Tohmatsu      651.2    642.0       1.4  Sep 94Coopers & Lybrand     C&L           525.0    515.0       1.9  Dec 94Ernst & Young         E&Y           358.0    347.0       3.2  Dec 94Price Waterhouse/ Seier-Petersen       PW            300.0    270.0      11.1  Jun 95BDO ScanRevision      BDO Binder    297.0    260.0      14.2  Sep 95Arthur Andersen & Co, SC(1)            AA & Co, SC   234.0    225.0       4.0  Aug 95Mortensen & Beierholm HLB           126.5    124.0       2.0  Apr 95Grant Thornton/ Grothen & Perregaard Grant Thornton 78.0     78.4      -0.5  Dec 94Askgaard Olesen       Horwath        61.0     60.1       1.5  Dec 94City Revision         Moores Rowland 58.3     57.3       1.7  Apr 95Erik Nielsen & NH Christensen          Jeffreys Henry 53.4     53.0       0.8  Dec 94Christiansen & Engelbrechtsen       RSM            52.0     60.0     -13.3  Dec 94Revisionsfirmaet Knud E Rasmussen          Summit         36.3     34.5       5.2  Jun 95Revisionsfirmaet Preben Larsen        Nexia          24.0     39.0     -38.5  Sep 95Info:Revision         Urbach Hacker                      Young          22.5     21.5       4.7  Jun 95RIR Revision          BKR            21.9     21.1       3.8  Dec 94Krogh & Ronald        Morison        21.0     21.0       0    Apr 95Also & Breinholt      Alliott                      Peirson        17.1     15.8       8.2  Dec 94Dansk Erhvervs Revision             IA              9.1      9.6      -5.2  Jun 95Fyns Erhvervsrevision Urbach Hacker                      Young           8.5      7.1      19.7  Sep 95ASSOCIATIONS OF INDEPENDENT FIRMSINTEG Group           GMN           165.0    165.0       0    Dec 94International Group of Accounting Firms  IGAF          150.8    154.6      -2.5  Dec 94Revisorsamarbejdet Kreston              Kreston       135.0    135.0       0    Dec 94Dalgaard              Moore Stephens 89.0     88.0       1.1  Dec 94Pannell Kerr Forster Denmark              PKF            45.4     44.3       2.5  Jun 95(1) Totals include Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting, separatebusiness units of Arthur Andersen & Co, SCNOTE:  Other firms were contacted but did not respondSource:  European AccountantLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN DENMARK -
