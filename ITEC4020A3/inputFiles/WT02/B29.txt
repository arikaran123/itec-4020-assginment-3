In the 1980s, Americanscreated 16 percent more newhouseholds, yet the population rose just 10 percent. That meansthe average family size isdown 5 percent. The fastest growing household segments from 1990 to 2000 will bemarried couples with nochildren, single father households, and non-traditionalhouseholds. The traditional familyunit still makes up 71 percent of American households, but thenumber is shrinking. Conversely, household income will rise 40 percent in the 1990scompared with the previousdecade. These changes have prompted employers to push their insuranceproviders to move beyond theestablished system of offering just single or family rates. Despite the cost benefit in aparent and child or husband and wife rate versus a family rate,it is not simply a financialissue. Beyond the cost issue, these trends infer changes in the Americansocial structure. Non-traditional households, such as grandparents raisingchildren, common-law or same sexcouples, are seeking social credibility, which may take form independent benefits that werepreviously unavailable to them. While it's still not common, the decision by companies to offerbenefits to same sex coupleshas not proven to be a major problem, despite what some industryobservers originallypredicted. To understand how these demographic shifts are playing out in themarketplace, we askedseveral insurance producers for their perspective. SherriGorelick, of Progressive PlanAdministrators, New York, says employers find parent and child orhusband and wife rateseasier to sell to employees who ask why they should subsidize thecost of insuring anotheremployee's family with four children. Richard Bass, of The Kaye Group, New York, notes that there wasat first wild speculationabout how same sex couples would affect benefits and insurancecosts. Now it's largely moot. Costs of coverage for these couples, when offered, are easilyabsorbed into the pricing of abenefits plan.

By the year 2000, more thanhalf of all adults in the U.S. will have some college education,compared to about 30 percentin 1970; 45 percent of all college students will be over age 25and more than half of allcollege degrees will be awarded to women. This will mean satisfying a more talented and competitive workforce. Surveys indicate thatthis group is concerned with both control and quality towardshome, work, and entertainmentissues. One way employers are offering more control is by increaseduse of the triple optionproduct. Triple option is a single-priced product that givesindividual employees theoption to use indemnity, HMO or PPO coverage when they seekmedical care. With it, companiescan provide flexibility while still paying only one premium. Theindividual pays the costdifference and employees generally accept this in return for thechance to customize thebenefits plan to their own needs.

Today, 58 percent of womenare either working or looking for work, compared with 76 percentof men. Ten years from now,the number of women in the workforce is projected to increase tobetween 61 and 65percent. A number of managed care organizations have responded by offering"expectant mother" and"well baby" programs. These have proven popular with busyworking mothers who find the riskscreening, the ongoing education and the preventive care builtinto these programsattractive. Benefits managers like the positive feedbackwellness programs get fromemployees, as well as the cost-benefits early diagnosis andtreatment provide. There is no question that benefits managers need to play a keyrole in helping theirorganizations compete effectively for talent and keep their bestemployees. But how willthey achieve this objective? One of the real keys is the ability to offer, and effectivelycommunicate, flexible benefitsplans. Benefits managers must also learn their employees' needsfirst-hand. We see more andmore mid-sized and small companies doing satisfaction studies,which is critically importantin making the right plan design choices. Then, once the harddecisions have been made, theyare focusing on clearly communicating the information employeesneed to make informed choicesabout their plan and the costs involved. Larger corporations, regarded as less attractive employers todaydue to waves of downsizing,must pay particular attention to benefits in order to keep andrecruit talent. From 1987 to1992, 5.6 million workers with more than three years ofexperience were laid off. Half ofthem were white collar employees. Today, the Fortune 500companies employ just 10 percent ofAmerica's workforce, down from 20 percent in 1970.

Large companies have the infrastructure tomanage a wide range of productoptions that gives them a competitive advantage over smallerfirms. Bigger firms can presstheir advantage with plans that set an expenditure cap for theyear, but offer flexibilitywithin that limit, so employees may use those dollars formedical, dental, or even dependentcare. Other attractive employee-funded benefits can includevoluntary life insurance andshort-term disability coverage. There are also some profound regional differences that bearwatching. Larry Kachler, ofKachler Corporation, Houston, Texas, points out that largeremployers in Texas are stillquite cautious about giving additional benefits. This is largely due tothe difficult experience oftaking benefits away to reduce costs during the downturn in theoil and gas industry severalyears ago. In businesses like engineering, where the supply ofexperienced people is quitelimited, many firms in Texas offer better benefit packages as atool to attract and keepemployees. But, in general, employers are more apt to offervoluntary, employee-paidprograms to supplement their benefit packages. This can often bedone on a pre-tax basis tothe employee.

Health experts expect last year's measles rate to come close to the all-time low of 312reported nationally in 1993 (The 1995 figures are still being tallied by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, or CDC). "I think we're beginning to see real progress in our efforts to increase vaccination of children in thiscountry," says Russell Steele, M.D., a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee onInfectious Diseases. In 1995, three out of four two-year-olds were properly immunized against polio, measles and whoopingcough, up from two out of three in the mid-1980s, according to the CDC. On the downside, warns Dr. Steele, one in four of the nation's two-year-olds still isn't getting theshots needed to fend off killer diseases. Dr. Steele is a national leader in the federal government's Vaccines for Children campaign to reduce thenon-compliance rate for childhood vaccinations to only 10 percent by the end of 1996. Several factorshave contributed to the recent gains. According to Dr. Steele: day-care centers are making sure that two-year-olds have had all their immunizations. compliance by age 5 is now virtually 100 percent, as school systems continue to do a good job atmonitoring required inoculations for entering students. increased public attention helped to boost vaccinations after First Lady Hillary Rodham Clintonlaunched her campaign to improve America's lagging vaccination rate. Dr. Steele won't be satisfied with 90 percent compliance. "Our goal should be perfection," he says. "Wewant tohave 100 percent of our children out there adequately immunized, even if our actual target for '96 is 90percent". What Shots Does Your Child Need? These days, immunizations are offered for 10 different diseases: Hepatitis B Haemophilius b influenza Tetanus Measles Rubella (German Measles) Polio Diptheria Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Mumps Chicken Pox In most cases today, the diptheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccinations are combined in a shot known asDPT.

Our partner in the projectis acompanycalled Stuart Disease Management Services, based in Wilmington, Delaware. What is Disease Management? The idea behind disease management is simple. There are a number of chronicdiseasesthatdoctors know a lot about, have experience treating and for which effectivemedicines exist.Disease management adds patient education and close monitoring of the disease towhatdoctorsalready know. Patients are told about their condition and receive instruction abouttakingmedication and keeping a close eye on their own health. About Congestive Heart Failure In the case of congestive heart failure, doctors have learned that the disease isbesttreated with lifestyle changes and medication. The lifestyle changes may includecuttingbackon salt, getting more rest and restricting activities that bring on symptoms of thedisease. Congestive heart failure refers to a range of conditions which impair thefunction of theheart. It results in shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles, fatigue, and, atits mostextreme, fluid in the lungs. The condition may develop over a period of weeks,months oryears. Congestive heart failure affects between 2.3 and 3 million people in the U.S., with400,000new cases diagnosed each year. It is one of the most frequent causes forhospitalizingpeople aged 65 and older. Currently, treating patients with congestive heartfailure costs anestimated billion each year in the United States. The congestive heart failurediseasemanagement program includes: strategies for disease prevention and early intervention. physician and patient education programs. ensuring patients adhere to their doctor's treatment program. identifying the drugs that work best. measuring the effectiveness of various treatments. How We Started - Where We're Going The program started with a pilot CHF management program at participating primarycarefacilities in Long Island, New York, where CHF admissions represented 40% of thehospitalizations for NYLCare 65 members. Expansion into the rest of New York State,NewJersey, Texas and Washington, D.C. will follow. By the end of 1996, the diseasemanagementprogram will be available to more than one million members of NYLCare. The relationship with Stuart Disease Management has produced an excellent programforthemanagement of congestive heart failure in a cost-conscious manner. The goal for patients in the Congestive Heart Failure Disease Management Program istoreceive the ultimate benefit for anyone suffering from a chronic disease--animprovedqualityof life.

After implementing the respiratory wellness program,developedby AccuLab Diagnostics, there was an extraordinary improvement for the group. Herearethehighlights of the program: Some Key Results In the six months prior to introducing the respiratory wellness program, there hadbeen 59emergency room visits. In the six months after the program was introduced, therewere only4ER visits--a 93% reduction. In the six months before the program began, school-age members missed 51 daysofschool;in the six months since, only 2 days of school were missed-a 96% reduction. Average medical cost per asthma patient over a six-month period declined from$5,875.86to $27.59. How did they do it? It turns out that the AccuLab staff is comprised of licensedrespiratorytherapists who visit NYLCare members in their homes. "You can tell a whole lot about possible triggers when you go to a person's home,"saysMichele Smith, RN, Manager of Utilization Management and Case Management at NYLCareof theSouthwest. "And the respiratory therapists have a lot of specific, practicaladvice toimpart. For instance, dog owners are advised to rinse their pets with distilledwater aftershampooing to lower the animal's impact on the owner's airways." Smith says that sometimes a primary care physician will "inherit" a patient withasthma,decide the patient has the condition under control, and continue prescribing amedicine thepatient has been taking in the past. In the respiratory wellness program, therespiratorytherapist, working closely with a physician, can go back to square one in assessingthepatient's condition and treatment options. Together, they often find ways to helpthe patientmanage the disease better. "It's very satisfying to achieve these kinds of resultsfor ourmembers," Smith concludes. The chart to the right shows the sharp decline in the number of school days and work daysmissedduetoasthma after the respiratory wellness program was introduced.

How Should You Receive Your Money When You Leave a Company? Whether you are retiring, taking a job with another company, or leaving your company for some other reason, there are extremely important decisions for you to make. One of the most important involves the retirement plan money that is yours to take when you leave your company. This sum of money is called a distribution, and may be the single largest sum you will ever receive at one time. The choices you make now regarding that money will affect not only your current and future income, but your income tax obligations as well. What you do with this money may determine your financial well-being, now, and well into the future. There are two major decisions you have to make regarding this distribution: How should you take your money from your employer? What should you do with it then? Both of these decisions are very important and somewhat complex. This section of the Web site was written to help you work through the first question so that you have information to help you make a decision that is right for you. Of course you should also consult your tax advisor. Answers to the second question are explored in: Basic Investing Concepts.

That's because the way in which you take your distribution can have important tax consequences. You can be subject to income taxes, an early withdrawal penalty, and 20% tax withholding. The value of your distribution can be dramatically reduced by the taxes and penalties that may apply if you fail to plan. Your age may also play a large role in how you are treated by the IRS. Before you make a decision on how you wish to receive your money, read What are the Tax Consequences? (a link is included below), and, of course, consult with your tax advisor. 1 Not all pension plans have a lump sum option, and not all savings plans have an annuity option.

What's a Rollover IRA? An IRA is designed for retirement saving, and provides you with the opportunity tomakecontributions to your retirement plan. These contributions will not be taxed untilthey arewithdrawn. You may be familiar with IRAs already if you've ever invested on yourown in a"contributory IRA." These generally allow contributions of up to $2,000 peryear. The IRS allows you to take eligible money from your employer's retirement planunder certaincircumstances and "roll it over" into an IRA - specifically, a rollover IRA. Thesecircumstances include retirement, change of employer, termination of youremployer'sretirement plan, permanent disability, termination of your Keogh or SEP plan, orbeing thebeneficiary of your spouse's retirement plan at his or her death. There are two main advantages with a rollover IRA: 1) it allows you to avoidwithholding andpossible penalties for premature withdrawals, keeping as much as possible for yourfutureuse, and 2) your balance continues to accumulate tax-deferred, meaning that it is nottaxed untilmonies are withdrawn. Thus, more of your money is available for investment. Only pre-tax contributions are eligible for rollovers. This means that money onwhich you'vealready paid taxes cannot be rolled over although earnings on such money can berolled over.Any stock you receive as part of your eligible distribution may also be permittedto bedirected into your rollover IRA. Your employer will provide you with theinformation you needabout what will qualify as an eligible rollover distribution. You may roll over the entire taxable amount, or a portion of it, as you choose. Butbe awarethat any portion not rolled over may be subject to withholding taxes and possiblepenalties.If you receive a total distribution from your employer and direct the entire amountinto arollover IRA, you can later roll it over, with earnings, into another employer'squalifiedretirement plan. This is known as a "Conduit" IRA. To be able to do this, however,the fundsfrom your distribution cannot have been combined in the same account with anypersonal"contributory" IRAs which you may have had outside your employer's plan. For thisreason, itis generally recommended that you keep your rollover IRA and any "contributory"IRAsseparate.

What Are the Tax Consequences? Ordinary Income Tax Money you receive as cash-in-hand is added to any ordinary income you have, andtaxed attheordinary income rate. Your age may qualify you for special tax treatment, however, as explained below. Early Withdrawal Penalty Most withdrawals or distributions made prior to age 59 1/2 are subjectto a10%penalty. Inaddition to this penalty, the entire amount remains taxable. So, if you take adistributionwhich is subject to the early withdrawal penalty, you end up paying taxes on moneyyouneverreceive. 20% Withholding Any distribution you receive is subject to a mandatory 20% tax withholding,regardless ofyour age. The 20% withholding can be avoided only by making a "Direct Rollover"into atax-qualified investment, such as an IRA, an annuity, or another employer's plan.

If You Don't Take Your Money Now, When Can You Get It? The IRS places restrictions on your ability to withdraw your money from aretirement plan orIRA before the age of 59 1/2 unless you qualify for a specialexemption.Onceyou reach thatage, the possibility of a 10% penalty on your withdrawals is eliminated and youhave moreaccess to your money. Please note, though, that the distribution is taxable for theyear inwhich you receive it. Once you've established a rollover IRA, withdrawals can be made either as you needthe money or through periodic payments. To avoid the 10% penalty if you're under 59 1/2, youmust take at least annual periodic payments, based on your life expectancy, for the greater offive years or until you reach 59 1/2. To a certain extent, the ability of your money to continue to "work hard" for youthroughinvestments depends on what you originally decide to do with your distribution. This investmentdecision is explored in detail in Basic InvestingConcepts. Remember,20%of your pension/retirement plan distribution will be withheld unless you elect tohave yourdistribution transferred directly into another qualified investment, such as arollover IRAor an annuity. It is vital to your financial well-being that you consider yourchoices andinform your employer of your decisions before your employer pays out yourdistribution.

What Are Your Sources of Income? You have reached a milestone in your life. It is very possible that your financialstatus haschanged. It'stime to take a clear look at your current and future financial situation so thatyou can plan foracomfortable retirement. The first step is to determine whether you currently have sufficient income andwhether youwill havesufficient income in the future. The answers to these questions will help you todecide whatto do withyour distribution. Most people have sources of income at retirement in addition totheirretirement plandistribution. Social Security, for example, can provide some ongoing income. Be aware, though,that thepercentageof income replaced by Social Security is lower for someone with a high income thanthat forsomeonewith a low income. Generally, the percentage drops as the income level rises. You may be receiving a pension benefit in addition to your retirement plandistribution.Perhaps you'vealso saved and invested on your own, so that you have personal investments that mayalsoprovidesome income.

Include in this figure your housing expenses,anestimate of food, transportation, clothing, insurance, health-related and other miscellaneousexpenses.If you wish to travel or pursue a hobby during your retirement, you'll need to include anestimate oftheadditional expenses. Compare the sum of these expense items with the sum of your income. If yoursources of income are insufficient for your needs, you might want some of your retirement plandistribution to produce an additional stream of income. But if it were only that simple! Don't forget inflation! Years ago, you could go to a movie for 25 cents. Popcorn would cost you another 15cents, and a soda 10 cents. Fifty cents would get you a whole afternoon's entertainment! Now,evenbargain movies cost you a whole lot more than that! What's the point? Inflation! If you're receiving your distribution now because you're retiringanddon'tintend to work at another income-producing job, it is critical that you consider the effect ofinflation. Tomaintain the lifestyle you want, you'll need to take steps to assure that your income at leastkeepspacewith inflation. How does inflation affect the value of your money? Let's assume that in the first year you have atotal of$40,000 in income. Let's further assume an annual inflation rate of 3%. After five years, your$40,000will buy $35,504 worth of goods at today's prices. In 10 years, it will be worth only $29,764attoday'sprices. Keep in mind that you may have 20, 25 or more years of retirement to look forward to, andinflation higher than the 3% estimated here would have an even more dramatic effect. Of particular concern is the cost of medical care, which you are more likely to need as you growolder.These costs are rising at a far faster rate than other costs. You must therefore consider theeffectinflation will have on your ability to maintain your lifestyle. The problem is not as monumentalasit maysound. There are many investment alternatives that have the objective of helping your nest egg togrowin size - so that your purchasing power can stay constant (or possibly increase), even whileinflationerodes the value of a dollar. In a way, basic economic and investment principles become your"partners" as you work to realize your expectations.

While you may befamiliar with other types of investments, like real estate, these three are most commonly usedwithsavings concepts. Therefore, before anyone makes a major savings investment decision, theyshouldfirst understand what these three types of investments are and how they are used. Stocks Stocks represent equity in a company. That means you actually own a piece of a company, and willhavean opportunity to benefit from the company's success. The price of a stock may go up and down,sometimes quite a bit. Bonds Bonds are loans. In effect, you are lending money to a government entity or to a company orinstitution.Interest is earned on the money you lend. Another term commonly used for bonds is fixed incomeinvestments because they generally pay a set, or "fixed", interest rate. There is an easy way to remember the basic difference between stocks and bonds: with stocks, youown; with bonds, you loan. The prices of bonds don't tend to move up and down as much as stocks. Cash Cash is represented by investments such as money market instruments, CDs, and Treasury bills.Thevalue of cash investments are generally less volatile than stocks and bonds. Stocks vs. Bonds vs. Cash: a historical perspective Although past performance is not a guarantee of future results, thehistorical results of stocks, bonds, and cash over a long period of time may give you an idea ofwhat toexpect when you make your investment decisions. A good period of time to consider is 20 years orlonger for long-term investing. The table below shows the returns of each of these asset classes over the past 20 years. Thedifferences in returns - which, as you can see, are considerable - may help you understand whysomeone may choose an investment that may be more volatile in order to achieve the possibility ofgreaterlong-term rewards. Historical Returns 1976�1995 Stocks Bonds Cash Volatility/Investment Risk High Medium Low Average Return 14.59% 10.58% 7.28% Value of $100 After 20 Years $1,523.82 $672.75 $407.73 Source: New York Life For illustrative purposes only. Figures are not intended to predict or guarantee the results ofanyspecific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investors during this period (1976�1995) got what they bargained for. The Volatility/Risk columnindicates that stock prices (represented by the S&P 5001) bounced around more than bond and cash prices (represented bythe Salomon Brothers Long-Term High Grade Bond Index2 and U.S. 90-day Treasury bills), but that stocks over the long-termdelivered the best return by far. The last column shows that over this twenty-year period, ahypothetical$100 invested in stocks would have grown to almost $1,524. That's a 14.59% annual return. Bond prices bounced around less than stock prices and the average return wasslightlylower at 10.58%. The average return of cash was much lower than that of stocks and bonds, and the up-and-down movement was also much lower. (Keep in mind that past performanceis no guarantee of future results). Why not invest just in cash? Investors commonly ask: If cash (generally, moneymarket funds) can provide a positive return with relatively little risk, why would anybodyinvest inanythingother than cash? Why should anyone subject him or herself to stocks and bonds, which "bouncearound" much more? One answer is that cash generally only keeps up with the current rate of inflation, oroutperforms it byonly a little. This means that at the end of an extended period, an all-cash portfolio may nothave grownthat much more than inflation. To "outrun" inflation and "grow" your portfolio, you may need the higher returns that stocks andbondshave historically delivered. Admittedly, stocks and bonds are more volatile than cash - but ifyou seekhigher returns, you have to be willing to live with greater ups and downs. Accepting more risk may result in more money over time. People who refuse to assume anyinvestmentrisk may be disappointed by the size of their nest egg and find that their retirement income maygradually erode over time if it is outpaced by inflation. 1The S&P 500 StockIndexis a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Corporation. S&P 500 is an unmanaged index thatisgenerally considered representative of the U.S. stock market. 2 The SalomonBrothers Long-Term High Grade Bond Index is a bond indicator comprised of about 800 bonds withmaturities of 12 years or more, rated AAA or AA.

Risk? Diversification? What is Return? Risk? Diversification? An investment's return is measured by how much the total value of that investment increasesordecreases. Often we speak of an investment's return by comparing it to the return of otherinvestments.For example: if most investments showed a hypothetical 6% increase in one year, and yoursshowed a4% increase, you might be disappointed. On the other hand, if your investment returned 8%comparedto the "consensus" 6%, you might have cause to celebrate. Everyone would like to put money into an investment that earns terrific returns and not worryaboutchanges in the value of those investments - especially negative ones! Unfortunately, that'sjust aboutimpossible. Different types of investments have different characteristics in terms ofinvestment risk. Thefact is, the value of almost all investments tends to move up and down, some more thanothers.Investments with values that move around a great deal are said to have greater risk thaninvestmentswith values that don't move around as much. Investors should also consider that an investment that generates low returns may barelykeep up withinflation. Although annuities provide a guaranteed income, there is a risk that, over time,inflation canerode the value of that income and reduce your purchasing power. Investment risk cannot be eliminated, nor is it necessarily bad! You can however, manage itsomewhatby putting your money into a combination of investments. This is known as diversification.Differenttypes of investments may do well at different times. Therefore, it is important to have adiversifiedportfolio that combines the right types of investments that will: Limit exposure to any one investment that may be going through a rough period Include investments that have a long-term potential opportunity to outpace inflation What Are Your Sources of Income? | Estimate Your Income Needs The Basics | Matching YourNeeds and Objectives with the Right Investments DifferentTypes of Investments Meet Different Needs | What is Return?

Therefore, if you reduce yourprincipal - whatever the amount may be - you will be reducing the level of interestincome that couldbe available to you.

An IRA provides you with an option to invest up to $2,000 or 100% of your earned income,whichever is less, in your IRA each year. You can have an IRA whether or not you are anactive participant in any other retirement plan. However, you may not be able to deduct allof your contributions if you or your spouse are covered by an employer retirement plan. What is a Rollover IRA? Participants entitled to a qualified lump sum distribution from their employer's retirementplan can rollover their distribution to an IRA, thereby eliminating the mandatory 20% taxwithholding requirement. This move from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA canbe accomplished through a direct rollover IRA. The various rules regarding rollover IRAs arediscussed in the CustodialAgreement and the Disclosure Statement. You can request a New York Life Rollover IRA Program Kit. Click on the "What's My Next Step?" link below. What is the minimum initial investment required to open a RolloverIRA? The total minimum initial investment is $1,000. Can I receive periodic distributions from my IRA? Yes, you can request monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual payments from your account.These payments will be subject to ordinary income taxes and if you're under 59 1/2, you maybe subject to an IRS-imposed 10% penalty tax. The funds remaining in your IRA continue to betax deferred until withdrawn or distributed. Will I receive written confirmation? Yes. Each time you make an investment or an exchange, a confirmation will be sent to you. Will I receive statements and how frequently? Each month we will send you a consolidated statement that shows the total value ofyour account, the holdings in your account, and the activity in the account during themonth. What tax information is furnished to the IRS with respect to my IRA? Each year during tax reporting season these forms will be filed with the IRS and a copy willbe sent to you. Form 5498 shows regular and rollover contributions and the value of your account at yearend. Form 1099R shows all amounts paid to you during the year from your IRA. What happens if I withdraw funds from my IRA? You may, of course, take a distribution from your IRA at any time. However, if this is donebefore age 59 1/2 (and you are not disabled), you will have taken what is called a "prematuredistribution" and you may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. After age 59 1/2, you can withdrawall or part of your IRA assets without penalty. Of course, these withdrawals will be taxed asordinary income. At what age must I withdraw from my IRA, and how much should Iwithdraw? According to IRS requirements, you have to begin withdrawing money from your IRA by April 1of the year following the year in which you turn age 70 1/2. All subsequent requireddistributions must be taken annually by December 31. The minimum required withdrawal is based on two factors: the previous year-end balance ofyour IRA, and your life expectancy or the life expectancy of you and your designatedbeneficiary. However, if you elect a beneficiary who is not your spouse, for calculationpurposes, your primary beneficiary will not be considered to be more than 10 years youngerthan you. Life expectancies are initially determined using standard IRS tables. All subsequent yearsmay be determined using two different methods; straight-line or recalculation. Once youchoose your method of calculation, your election becomes irrevocable. What withdrawal options do I have? Your distribution can be paid to you either as a lump sum or, using the systematic withdrawaloption, we can send you a check monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually.Required Minimum Distributions may be rolled over into a regular non-IRA brokerage account inyour name. Please note that funds will be taxed under this option and any growth in thisaccount is no longer tax deferred. What happens if I die before receiving the money in my IRA? If you die before withdrawing any or all of your assets from your IRA, the remaining amountwill be distributed to your designated beneficiary(ies). If you have not designated abeneficiary, or a beneficiary dies before you, your beneficiary will be your estate. The above IRA information is for general information purposes only and is not intended toprovide specific tax advice. Tax rules are subject to change and you may want to consult yourtax professional for advice on how these rules may apply to your personal situation.

For some, it may be a cozycondo on the ninthhole of theirfavorite golf course, traveling throughout the world, or helping a lovedone with the cost ofpaying for acollege education. Each day, more and more people are coming to therealization that unlessthey savefor retirement, their dreams of enjoying the good things in life will notbe realized. Whatcan you do? In today's competitive business environment, retirement benefits arecritical to attractand retainquality people, build loyalty and morale, and help your employeesenjoy a securefuture. To justmaintain their current standard of living, your employees will need tosubsidize their SocialSecurityincome with savings, investments, and perhaps most importantly, anemployer pension plan.Buildinga reserve of assets through a pension plan is a way to ensure that themoney set aside todaywill payfor what is needed at retirement. Consider the following trends: Americans are living healthier and longer. The average working American will need between 70-80% ofpre-retirement income tomaintaintheir present standard of living. Adequate retirement planning could meanthe differencebetweenthriving and merely surviving during retirement years. The savings rate in the United States is shrinking. The FederalReserve System indicatesthat thesavings rate of disposable income in 1973 was 9.4%, versus 3% today. Thisindicates that manyAmericans face the possibility of insufficient income in the future. Thisis compounded whenweconsider that the rate of inflation is expected to continue growing. Although debated for many years, we are coming to the realization thatSocialSecuritybenefits may not be available for many. By the year 2011, America'slargest presentgeneration, the 75million baby boomers, will start to retire. With less workers puttingmoney in, and moreretirees gettingpaid, the promise that Social Security benefits will be available is notguaranteed.

The amount of benefitreceived,usuallyupon retirement, is based solely on the amount contributed to the plan, plus orminus theinvestmentperformance of the fund(s) selected. Examples of these plans include: 401(k) Plans Profit Sharing Plans Money Purchase Plans. Other similar programs where the retirement benefit is based on the amountcontributed andtheinvestment performance are: Individual Retirement Accounts Simplified Employee Pension Plans Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plans Tax-Sheltered Annuities. Defined Benefit Plan This is a plan that is designed to provide employees with a defined benefit atretirement(i.e.: a monthly benefit of 20% of compensation upon attaining age 65). Contributions under the planaredetermined bythe amount of benefits to be provided, not on the basis of a percentage ofcompensation. The Social Security Forecast One of the hot political topics today is the overhaul of many health and welfareprograms,including theSocial Security system. Reports throughout the media have indicated that unlesssomething isdone tocorrect the situation, there is a real possibility that Social Security benefitsmay not beavailable in thefuture. As Americans live longer, and there are more individuals receiving benefitsthanthosecontributing, the risk of impending financial problems increases. Even with a thriving Social Security system, Americans still need to subsidizetheirretirement incomethrough personal savings, investments, and participation in an employer sponsoredretirementplan. The Advantages Of Tax Deferral One of the many benefits retirement plans can offer is tax-deferred accumulation ofcontributionsandearnings. Because participants pay no Federal income tax until the funds arewithdrawn and,in mostlocations, no state income tax either, the accounts can accumulate much faster than anafter-taxinvestment.For example: if an employee is in a 25% tax bracket and can contribute $100before-tax vs.$75 after tax,the earnings potential on the before-tax contribution is greater. Please note that withdrawalsprior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to an additional 10% IRS penalty. Dollar Cost Averaging The automatic savings feature of retirement plans, where employees set aside aspecificamount eachpay period, helps participants weather market changes through dollar costaveraging. Dollar cost averaging is the systematic investment of the same amount of money atregularintervals,regardless of market conditions. Over time, the average amount one pays for sharesis likelyto belower than the average share price. The secret of this system is that the samedollar amountbuys moreshares when the price is low, and fewer when the price is high. By investing withMainStay,employeesmay benefit in a declining market as well as in a rising market. Dollar costaveraging may allowemployeesto take advantage of sudden upswings rather than sitting by and waiting for theopportunemoment tobegin investing. The following chart illustrates a dollar cost averaging strategy: Month Investment Amount Share Price Shares Acquired 1 $100 $10.00 10.00 2 $100 $8.75 11.43 3 $100 $9.15 10.93 4 $100 $9.50 10.53 5 $100 $11.15 8.97 6 $100 $10.05 9.95 Totals $600 $58.60 61.81 The above information is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of anyparticular investment. Dollar cost averaging does not assume a profit nor does it protect against loss in decliningmarkets. To be effective, there must be a continuous investment regardless of fluctuating pricelevels, and the investor should consider his/her financial ability to continue to make purchasesthrough periods of low price levels.

Here's a brief overview of the types ofplans andprograms we can offer you. What Is A Profit Sharing Plan? A profit sharing plan is a retirement plan that allows the employer to make anannualdiscretionarycontribution for each eligible employee. The maximum contribution is the lesser of15% oftheparticipant's compensation or $30,000. In 1996, you can only take into accountthefirst$150,000 ofcompensation, so a 15% contribution for a participant earning $150,000 will giveyou amaximumcontribution of $22,500. The plan allows the employer to change the contributionpercentageeachyear or even skip a year at the employer's discretion. Profit Sharing Q&A What Is A 401(k) Plan? A 401(k) plan is a profit sharing plan that allows for three types ofcontributions. Thefirst and mostdistinguishing feature is that a 401(k) allows your employees to save for theirfuture bycontributingpretax dollars from every paycheck. Second, a 401(k) allows the company to maketax-deductiblematching contributions to encourage participation in the plan. Third, a 401(k)allows thecompany tomake tax-deductible profit sharing contributions on a discretionary basis. Thepopularity of401(k) plansis due to the low cost, flexibility and outstanding benefits they offer to bothemployers andemployees. From the variety of retirement plans available, 401(k) plans are currently the mostpopular,with over90% of the Fortune 1000 companies offering 401(k) plans to their employees. 401(k) Q&A What Is A Money Purchase Plan? A money purchase pension plan is a retirement plan that allows the employer to makean annualfixedcontribution for each eligible employee. You elect the contribution percentage(1-25%) inthe plandocument and are required to make this contribution each year. The maximumcontribution isthelesser of 25% of the participant's compensation or $30,000. In 1996, you can onlytake intoaccount thefirst $150,000 of compensation, so a 20% contribution would produce the maximum$30,000contributionfor a participant making $150,000. Money Purchase Plan Q&A Integrate Your Plan Take advantage of retirement contributions your company is already making to SocialSecurity. Integration allows you to recognize the retirement benefits generated by youremployercontribution toSocial Security for each employee. When you integrate your plan, a highercontributionpercentage isallowed for earnings above the Social Security wage base ($62,700 in 1996). Thereare certainrulesunder Permitted Disparity that limit the difference between the contributionpercentage forearningsabove and below the taxable wage base. Integration, however, does allow largerpercentagecontribution for your higher paid workers. Paired Plans - The Best Of Both Worlds Many employers like the contribution flexibility allowed by profit sharing plans,yet stillwant to be able tocontribute more in good years. By pairing or combining a profit sharing plan witha moneypurchasepension plan you can have both. The money purchase pension plan has a fixedcontributionthat mustbe made each year. This contribution can be as high as 25% of compensation. Bypairing a10%money purchase plan with a profit sharing plan's flexible contribution of 0-15%,you get thebest of bothplans. See for yourself: Contribution Minimum Maximum Money Purchase 10% 10% Profit Sharing 0% 15% Tax Savings 10% 25% Under this arrangement you would be required to make the 10% money purchase pensioncontributioneach year. In good years, the additional 15% profit sharing contribution allowsfor acombined 25%contribution to a maximum of $30,000 per participant. Benefits of a Profit Sharing or Money Purchase Plan to YourCompany All contributions and costs of maintaining the plan are tax-deductible as businessexpenses.Company profit sharing contributions are discretionary. With a 401(k) plan, payroll deduction allows your employees to fund the plan,significantly increasingtheir retirement benefits, with minimal cost to your Company. Company money purchase pension contributions may be fixed as a percentage of totalcompensation.The plan may reduce the Company's fiduciary liability risk if it offers at leastthree diversified investmentoptions, allows employees to direct their own investments, and meets certain otherrequirementsunder Department of Labor (DOL) regulations. The plan can be a tremendous recruiting tool and can be positioned as part of theCompany's overallcompensation package. The plan can help you retain a talented work force in today's competitiveemployment environment.All Company contributions and administrative costs are tax-deductible, which cansubstantially reducethe cost of installing, funding and maintaining your plan on an after-tax basis, asthe following chartshows. Reduce Corporate Taxes Company A Company B Corporate Income $250,000 $250,000 Contribution 0 50,000 Taxable Income 250,000 200,000 Taxes at 34% 85,000 68,000 Tax Savings 0 17,000 Assumes $250,000 corporate income, 34% tax rate. Company Amakes no profit sharingcontribution. Company B makes a $50,000 profit sharing contribution. As you can see, with the $17,000 tax savings, a $50,000 Plan contributionactuallycosts only $33,000. Benefits of a Profit Sharing or Money Purchase Plan to YourEmployees Earnings on all contributions accumulate tax-deferred A plan can provide access to professional investment management,investment flexibility and guidance in identifying investment objectives Employees can direct their own investments Employer contributions are not taxed as income to the employee until theyare withdrawn. Distributions at retirement may receive favorable tax treatment. With 401(k) plans: Automatic contributions make saving easy and convenient andprovide a disciplined approach to saving for retirement Pretax contributions lower your employees' current taxableincome. The following example illustrates the difference between saving after-tax and saving pretax throughthe MainStay 401(k). Pretax Contributions Mean Higher Take-Home Wages Employee A Employee B Annual Wages $28,000 $28,000 Pretax Savings 0 2,000 Taxable Income 28,000 26,000 Taxes at 28% 7,840 7,280 After-Tax Wages 20,160 18,720 After-Tax Savings 2,000 0 Take-Home Wages 18,160 18,720 Pretax Advantage 0 560 Assumes $28,000 annual income, 28% tax rate. Employee A saves$2,000after tax. Employee B saves $2,000 in a 401(k) pretax plan.

Sounds excellent, if you have the time and means to sort it allout. Most people don't have the time, and will gladly pay a sales charge to utilize the knowledgeand direction of a professional investment advisor. Almost two-thirds of all mutual fundassets have been sold through investment advisors.1 Unfortunately, media "financial experts" portray smart investors as only those who buy no-load,"no-help" funds. So are the majority of mutual fund investors inept? No, they simply realize thevalue of the advice provided by a professional investment advisor. Here are some reasons you should consider using the services of a financial advisor: Daily monitoring of investment markets In-depth analysis of your investment needs and strategy to obtain them Retirement planning College planning Specialized investment research Familiar voice to express your interests and concerns regarding your investments What source would you rather consult for critical investment decisions which could have an impact on both your present and future financial positions? Large stacks of nice glossy brochures, charts, and graphs. A seasoned investment professional dedicated to servicing your investment needs. 1 DALBAR Financial ServicesInc., 1996.

An annuity is offered through an insurance company and can provide you witha fixed monthly income for a specified period of time, most commonly the remainder of yourlife. An annuity is generally purchased with a single premium, before the annuity takes effect.This premium entitles you to the income that you'll receive in the future. Once your fixedannuity has been purchased, the payments will not change. The monthly payments areguaranteed, and the amount is based on the size of the premium, life expectancy, and thepayout option you choose. This option will protect your money from the 20% withholding and the early withdrawal 10%penalty. It will also allow your money to remain tax-deferred. Your monthly payment orannuity benefit is generally considered ordinary income, which means the money you receive ina given year will be taxed. Generally, when you invest in an annuity you lose access to your money in exchange for thefixed monthly income. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to your totalfinancial situation. Accessible outside savings should be maintained for any unexpected orcatastrophic expenses.Annuities are discussed in more detail in the Annuitiessection of the New York Life Web site.

While most people want low risk and high returns, that combination may bedifficultto find. As you can see from this chart, over time, common stocks have substantiallyoutperformedlong-termgovernment bonds, Treasury bills, and outpaced inflation. The chart also shows thatovershort periods,stocks have had more ups and downs than fixed income securities, subjectinginvestors togreater risk.While bonds and Treasury bills tend to provide relatively stable income, theirreturns alsomay vary withchanges in interest rates. As a general rule, investments with higher returnpotential tend toinvolvemore risk, and low-risk investments tend to provide lower returns. However, pastperformance is noguarantee of future results. This information is shown for illustrative purposes only and should not be viewed as an expectation of what an investor may receive on his/her investments. 1Common stockperformance is measured by the S&P 500, an unmanaged index considered to begenerallyrepresentative of the U.S. stock market. Long-term government bond performance ismeasured by aone-bond portfolio with a 20-year maturity and current coupon. U.S. Treasury billperformance is basedon a one-bill portfolio with the shortest maturity not less than one month.Inflation ismeasured by theConsumer Price Index (CPI), which shows the changes in the cost of selected goods.

MainStay offers the level of service you've come to expect from a leader in mutualfunds. YourRegistered Representative understands your objectives and can help you select themostappropriateFunds for your individual situation. Whenever you have questions about yourMainStayinvestments,your Registered Representative is one of your most valuable resources. At MainStay,we havededicatedservice representatives who can help explain your investments and the progressthey'remaking. If youever need help when your Registered Representative isn't available, we'll bepleased toassist. Why should I consider investing for growth? Over time, the cost of just about everything - food, clothing, housing, and healthcare - tendsto go up. If your investments don't keep pace, you may be falling behind. Over long periods,growthinvestmentshave tended to provide higher returns than fixed-income investments, helpinginvestorskeep pace withrising prices. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, manyinvestorsbelieve thehigher return potential of growth investing is well worth any additional risk. Should I invest in tax-free funds? The answer depends on your income and how much of your investment earnings taxesaretakingaway. For investors in higher tax brackets, tax-exempt funds offer an excellentway to keepmore ofwhat they earn. Although the returns on tax-free Funds may appear to be lower thanonother Funds,looks can be deceiving. For an investor in the 31% Federal income tax bracket, a6%tax-free returnmay be better than earning 8.5% in a taxable Fund. How often should I shift my investments? If you select Funds that suit your long-term objectives, you should be able to stayinvestedfor the longterm. An annual portfolio review with your Registered Representative can help youdetermine whetherthe Funds you've chosen still fit your objectives in the current economicenvironment. If youdecide tomove your money, it's a good idea to do it gradually over time. Investors whochange Fundsevery timethe markets move are as likely to miss opportunities as to capture them. Can I use MainStay Funds for my IRA or other qualified retirementplan? Yes, except for our tax-free Funds.

Whether you live alone or withothers,have youngchildren or aging parents, chances are you want your investments to enhancesomeone'slife. Knowingwho you're investing for, what you hope to achieve, and when you'll need your moneycanhelp youdevelop an effective investment strategy. If you're young and single, you may makedifferentchoicesfrom someone who's married and about to retire. If you want to pay for yourchildren'seducation, areyou thinking about public colleges or aiming for the Ivy League? Set specific goals Most people want more money. But if you're setting an investment goal, it helps tobe morespecific. Do you want to retire with a million dollars in 25 years? Are you hoping to make adownpayment on a$100,000 house in five years? Would you like to earn at least three percent morethan theinflation rateover the next ten years? Specific goals make it easier to see if your investments are on course - andeasier toadjust them ifthey start to fall behind. It's fine to want financial independence. Buttranslating that into aspecificdollar amount and a definite time frame can help you decide what's realistic andwhat's justa dream. Know when you need results Most people have a variety of goals with different time horizons. You may want tobuy a newcar nextyear, start your own business in five years, put your kids through college in tenyears, andtake a worldcruise when you retire. Knowing when you'll need your money can help you choose the right investments. Amoneymarketfund may be an appropriate investment for a car you'll buy next spring. A bond orgrowth and income fund might be a good choice for an intermediate-term goal. Andequity funds may bemoreappropriatefor your longer-term needs. Consider how you feel about risk Investments go up and down, some more than others. While past performance is noguarantee offuture results, over time, stocks have tended to have wider price fluctuations thanbonds. Bonds, inturn, have tended to vary more than short-term investments like Treasury bills ormoneymarketinstruments. Of course, price variations aren't all you'll want to consider. Over time,stocks havetended toprovidehigher returns than bonds, and bonds have typically returned more than money marketinstruments. Smart investors know that risk and return are closely linked. So they may seek thehighestreturnpotential they can get without taking on risks they can't afford. Balancing Risk and Return The kinds of investments that are right for you will depend largely on how you feelabout riskandreward. While most people want low risk and high returns, that combination may bedifficultto find. As you can see from this chart, over time, common stocks have substantiallyoutperformedlong-termgovernment bonds, Treasury bills, and outpaced inflation. The chart also shows thatovershort periods,stocks have had more ups and downs than fixed income securities, subjectinginvestors togreater risk.While bonds and Treasury bills tend to provide relatively stable income, theirreturns alsomay vary withchanges in interest rates. As a general rule, investments with higher returnpotential tend toinvolvemore risk, and low-risk investments tend to provide lower returns. However, pastperformance is noguarantee of future results. Growth of $1 in different investments 1925-1995 1 1Common stockperformance is measured by the S&P 500, an unmanaged index considered to begenerallyrepresentative of the U.S. stock market. Long-term government bond performance ismeasured by aone-bond portfolio with a 20-year maturity and current coupon. U.S. Treasury billperformance is basedon a one-bill portfolio with the shortest maturity not less than one month.Inflation ismeasured by theConsumer Price Index (CPI), which shows the changes in the cost of selected goods.Source: IbbotsonAssociates, Chicago.

While there is noguarantee that themarket willrecover, many professionals recommend buying when the market is down to increasethelikelihood ofbenefiting if there is a recovery. Benefit from regular investing Regular investing is a convenient and cost-effective way to build your portfolio. If $10,000 ismore thanyou can afford to invest right now, $300 a month might be within your reach. Atthat amount,in just threeyears, you'll have invested more than $10,000, not taking into account any incomeorcapitalgains yourinvestment might earn. If you can invest the same amount on a regular basis, the ups and downs of themarket maypotentiallywork to your advantage. In particular, you may avoid the risk of investing all ofyour moneywhen shareprices are high. While regular investing cannot assure a profit or protectagainst loss indecliningmarkets, one thing is certain - the number of shares you own will increase overtime, givingyou alarger stake in each of the funds you select. Since this strategy depends oncontinuousinvestment insecurities regardless of fluctuating price levels, investors should consider theirability to continue to make purchases through periods of varying price levels. How time can add value to your investments Time can be a powerful tool in helping your money grow. To see how important timecan be, look at howmuch just a few years can add to a $10,000 investment earning an 8% annual returnwithmonthlycompounding. It's never too late to invest, but it pays to start early. The sooner you startinvesting, the moreyou can setaside and the longer your money can work for you. Which means the best time toinvest isright now. Staying invested can be a powerful way to help the reduce risk. Since 1926, stockandbondinvestors have seen both up and down markets. While past performance is no guaranteeoffutureresults, history shows that those who have stayed invested for 20 years or longerhave alwaysearned positivereturns.1 As time passes, the rising cost of goods and services can also affect the value ofyourinvestments.This process, known as inflation, may reduce the amount of food, clothing, housing, and healthcare your money can buy. If the cost of livingrises fasterthan thevalue of your savings or investments, you could actually be losing money. Evenmodestinflation can eataway at the dollars you set aside, which is one important reason why many people useinvestments toseek higher return potential.

Some funds invest in securities that provide little income, while othersspecifically seeksecuritieswhich provide the highest income they can find. Capital Gains Distributions When a fund sells securities for more than they originally cost, it results ina capital gain. Sellingsecurities below their original cost results in a capital loss. If a fund'scapital gains exceedits capitallosses for the year, most of the net gain must be distributed to shareholdersas a capitalgainsdistribution. Changes in Net Asset Value The total value of all fund assets, minus liabilities, divided by the totalnumber of sharesoutstanding isthe net asset value (NAV) per share. In calculating the NAV for a specificclass of shares,only assets,liabilities, and outstanding shares that apply to that class are used. A word about sales charges and total returns Total returns may be reported in two different ways: At net asset value, without any adjustment for sales charges Adjusted to include the maximum sales charge for the share class andperiodshown. When total returns are shown at the public offering price (POP), they includethe maximumup-frontsales charge. Total returns which reflect a contingent deferred sales charge(CDSC), showthe effect ofthe maximum applicable back-end sales charge. If no sales charges apply toyourpurchases or sales,you should look for total returns at NAV. If a fund imposes a sales charge, the fund is required by law to include theeffect of such acharge in the total return calculation. This type of total return, oftenreferred to as "SECAverage Annual or Total Return," is calculated using a standardized formula. For more informationon how total return is calculated, consult the prospectus.

To get awell-rounded picture,you'llprobably want to look at total return in a number of ways. Short-term performance You may want to know how the fund has done recently, say, since the start of theyear. Sometimesshort-term returns are "annualized" to show how the current investment climatemight affectyou if itlasted a full twelve months. Cumulative returns Cumulative total returns show how much a fund has earned over a specific stretchoftime. The longerthe period, the more impressive the results may look. But don't be misled. Findout howlong it took thefund to achieve the return, examine its volatility, and look for standardized SECaverage annual total returns required for a one/five/ten year or since inceptionperiod, which must accompany cumulative return data. Average annual total returns Your performance analysis should include average annual total returns fordifferentperiodsof time. Comparing these returns to appropriate benchmarks can show you how the fund hasperformedrelative to an index or other funds of the same general type. Year-by-year results Look at how a fund performs from one year to another. Did the results varywidely? The bigger the variations, the more volatile the fund. SEC returns The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created guidelines for reportingtotalreturns tomake it easier for you to compare the performance of different funds. Averageannual totalreturnsreported in compliance with SEC guidelines are adjusted to include the maximumapplicable salescharges over 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods - or since inception of the fund if it'sless than tenyears old. The more you know about total returns, the better you'll keep score of how yourinvestmentsare doing. Since a fund must earn at least as much as the maximum sales charge before it canreportpositiveSEC returns, it's possible to see negative SEC returns even when returns at NAVarepositive.

What is Total Return? Total return is a way for investors to keep score of their investments For sports enthusiasts, there's nothing quite like the anticipation at the start of a newbaseball season. How will your favorite team do? Will they aim for a high average or hit lots of home runs? Will it be agood season or a frustrating one? What are the chances of winning the pennant? Once the season starts, many people keep track of each game's score and their team'splace in thestandings. And, like your team, your investments can perform well one year and disappointyou thenext. Or, your team could be a model of consistency, contending for the pennant year afteryear, withonly a few exceptions. Keep score of your fund's performance with total returns If you're a mutual fund investor, total return is the full amount your investment earns over aspecificperiod of time. This takes into account all three ways you may earn or lose money with mutualfunds:dividends, income, capital gains distributions, and capital appreciation (an increase or decrease in net assetvalue or NAV). Investors should be as concerned with what goes into total return as with the bottom line. They should know whether their investment has come out ahead and, if so, by how much. There aremany reasons why you should pay close attention to each part of the total return youreceive. They arereasons like these: Your purpose for investing - If you're investing to maximize income,dividendswill be very important to you. If you're looking for long-term growth, you're going to beinterested incapital appreciation. The style that makes you most comfortable - If you love home runsand aren'tafraid of strikeouts, you'll probably look for funds that focus on the potential for capitalappreciation, even ifthey havemore ups and downs than other funds. If you like hitting for a high average and alwaysbeing on base,you may prefer a fund with the potential for regular dividends and less volatility. A Valuable Tool Total returns can be a valuable tool in selecting funds when viewed in light of yourobjectives, timehorizon, and attitudes about risk and reward. Remember, though, that past performance is not aguarantee of future results. Your Registered Representative is one of your best resources for determining how performanceshould affectyour overall investment strategy. When providing performance information, all funds must disclose that past performance isnoguarantee of future results and that share prices will fluctuate, so that, when redeemed,shares may beworth more or less than their original cost.

When you invest in a mutual fund, you join other investors, pooling your money to purchase securities and pursue a specific objective. If you don't have the time to follow the markets, the experience to manage a portfolio, or the resources to diversify on your own, mutual funds may offer you four important advantages. Diversification By pooling the resources of many investors, mutual funds are able to purchase a broader range of securities than most individuals can afford on their own. While the types of securities a fund may purchase will depend on its investment objective, diversification is widely recognized as a way that may help reduce investment risk. Flexibility Mutual fund "families" offer investors the ability to stick with their original investment or move some of their money among various funds when markets shift or their personal circumstances change. Professional management Mutual funds are managed by experienced investment professionals, who continually monitor the economy, the markets, and individual securities to free you from having to make complex day-to-day investment decisions. Convenience Mutual funds are a convenient and affordable way to invest. In many cases, the minimum investment may be less than the cost of a single security in the fund's portfolio. Depending on your needs, you can arrange to have any income or capital gains automatically reinvested or sent directly to you.
