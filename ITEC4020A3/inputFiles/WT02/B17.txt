Appendix B: Example Page from Solar Radiation Data Manual for Flat-Plate and ConcentratingCollectors PDF Version (33K) Appendix C: Federal Life-Cycle Costing Procedures and the BLCC Software Federal agencies are required to evaluate energy-related investments on the basis of minimum life-cycle costs (LCC) (10 CFR Part 436). A life-cycle cost evaluation computes the total long-run costs of a number of potential actions, and selects the action that minimizes the long-run costs. when considering retrofits, sticking with the existing equipment is one potential action. Often called the baseline condition. The LCC of a potential investment is the present value of all of the costs associated with the investment over time. The first step in calculating the LCC is the identification of the costs. Installed Cost includes cost of materials purchased and the labor required to install them (for example, the price of an energy-efficient lighting fixture, plus cost of labor to install it). Energy Cost includes annual expenditures on energy to operate equipment. (For example, a lighting fixture that draws 100 watts and operates 2,000 hours annually requires 200,000 watt-hours (200 kWh) annually. At an electricity price of $0.10 per kWh, this fixture has an annual energy cost of $20.) Nonfuel Operations and Maintenance includes annual expenditures on parts and activities required to operate equipment (for example, replacing burned out light bulbs). Replacement Costs include expenditures to replace equipment upon failure (for example, replacing an oil furnace when it is no longer usable). Because LCC includes the cost of money, periodic and aperiodic maintenance (O&M) and equipment replacement costs, energy escalation rates, and salvage value, it is usually expressed as present value, which is evaluated by LCC = PV(IC) + PV(EC) + PV(OM) + PV(REP) where PV(x) denotes "present value of cost stream x," IC is the installed cost, EC is the annual energy cost, OM is the annual nonenergy O&M cost, and REP is the future replacement cost. Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the LCCs of two investment alternatives, e.g., the LCC of an energy-saving or energy-cost-reducing alternative and the LCC of the existing, or baseline equipment. If the alternative's LCC is less than the baseline's LCC, the alternative is said to have a positive NPV, i.e., it is cost effective. NPV is thus given by NPV = PV(EC0) - PV(EC1)) + PV(REP0) - PV(REP1)) - PV(IC) or NPV = PV(ECS) + PV(OMS) + PV(REPS) - PV(IC) where subscript 0 denotes the existing or baseline condition, subscript 1 denotes the energy cost saving measure, IC is the installation cost of the alternative (note that the IC of the baseline is assumed zero), ECS is the annual energy cost savings, OMS is the annual nonenergy O&M savings, and REPS is the future replacement savings. Levelized energy cost (LED) is the effective or blended energy price at which a conservation, efficiency, renewable, or fuel-switching measure becomes cost-effective (NPV > = 0). Thus, a project's LEC is given by PV(LEC*EUS) = PV(OMS) + PV(REPS) - PV(IC) where EUS is the annual energy use savings (energy units/yr). Savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) is the total (PV) savings of a measure divided by its installation cost: SIR = (PV(ECS) + PV(OMS) + PV(REPS)) / PV(IC). Some of the tedious effort of life-cycle cost calculations can be avoided by using the Building Life-Cycle Cost software, BLCC, developed by NIST.

Mack, Principal Investigator, Energetics, Incorporated In the coming years, one or more high-value projects will befunded by the Hydrogen Program to field-test hydrogentechnologies that are at advanced stages of development.These projects will be selected through a competitiveproposal evaluation process. Because of the significantscope and funding levels of projects at these developmentphases, a formal proposal evaluation process was devised toensure that supported projects are implemented by capableinvestigative teams and that they will advance programmaticobjectives. To meet this need, a proposal evaluationmethod called HScan/AHP was developed. HScan is a two-partsurvey instrument that elicits detailed information fromproposers concerning potential risks and benefits of theirprojects. HScan also provides the reviewer with anevaluation mechanism. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an evaluationtechnique that allows the decision maker to define importantcriteria and then structure the criteria into a decisionframework. The criteria weights and the relative rankingsof candidate alternatives are derived in a special paired-comparison process. In the HScan/AHP exercise, the evaluation criteria are factors that must be considered inselecting projects to fund. These criteria includetechnical, market, financial, and other factors. The HScanand AHP components of the process are linked by buildingthose evaluation criteria into their structures. Acompleted HScan provides a concise information source forevaluating proposals using the decision model generated withthe AHP. This work began during the 1995 planning year. At thattime, a coordinated effort was made to generate an initialHScan/AHP prototype that represented the Program's decisionenvironment in selecting a proposal for advanced technicalvalidation. A baseline HScan survey was developed. Aprototype AHP evaluation model was constructed using ExpertChoice® decision support software. Both the HScan and theAHP components were configured using evaluation criteriadefined in an interview process. Recent Advances: During the past year, an HScan/AHP prototype was fullydeveloped and implemented. The prototype was tested usingtwo unsolicited proposals for projects at the technicalvalidation stage. The proposer section of the HScan wassent to the proposing teams for completion. After thosesections were returned, they were submitted to two reviewersfor evaluation using an HScan/AHP package supplied to them.To perform the evaluations, the reviewers first completedtheir HScan sections based on the information supplied bythe proposers. The proposals were then evaluated and rankedusing the predefined AHP decision model. The reviewers usedspecial evaluation forms to make the AHP comparisons.Completed HScan/AHP packages were returned to thedevelopment team. Both the proposers and the reviewers wereable to complete the HScan/AHP sections with minimalassistance.WT02-B17-10IA060-000330-B027-155http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/lloyd.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115043351 text/html 1908HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 04:33:48 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:26 GMTContent-length: 1734 Hydrogen InfoNet ALAN LLOYD Alan Lloyd, who is currently co-chairing the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel, has had more than 25 years of research experience in atmospheric chemistry, urban airshed modelling, and advanced low-emission technologies.

Turner, Principal Investigator, National Renewable Energy Laboratory Our research focuses on the development of a stable, cost-effective, photoelectrochemistry-based system that will split water upon illumination, producing hydrogen and oxygen directly, using sunlight as the only energy input. Our approach is to use the best available semiconductor materials and devices that are consistent with the energy requirements for a water-splitting system and that are stable in an aqueous environment. Near-term goals include the development of transparent and highly active colloidal water-splitting catalysts coupled with surface modification techniques to increase the lifetime and efficiency of photoelectrochemical devices. In current research work, we are developing novel photoelectrolysis devices based on tandem solar cell technology. This technology includes devices made of gallium indium phosphide/gallium arsenide and amorphous silicon/silicon carbide. We are looking for industry partners who are interested in developing this technology for commercial applications, and we are especially interested in partnerships with semiconductor manufacturers and all those involvedwith transparent catalytic coatings. Recent Advances:We developed synthetic procedures for synthesizing platinum and ruthenium dioxide colloidal catalysts and demonstrated that they are highly active for water oxidation and reduction when deposited on the surface of semiconductors. We also showed that multijunction devices made of gallium indium phosphide/gallium arsenide and amorphous silicon/silicon carbide can split water. Work is continuing on improving the efficiency and lifetime of these devices.

The project is managed by a consortium that includes the City of Palm Desert, California, the Schatz Energy Research Center, and E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. The project involves four main tasks: (1) designing, building, and operating a fleet of personal utility vehicles and neighborhood electric vehicles powered by hydrogen-fueled, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells; (2) designing, building, and operating a refueling infrastructure appropriate for future hydrogen-based transportation systems; (3) developing materials and manufacturing techniques for PEM fuel cell production; and (4) designing and constructing a PEM fuel cell service and diagnostic center. Recent Advances: The fuel cell has continued to run on the test bench since lateMarch with excellent performance. We planned to have the stackin the cart by this time but have been delayed by software andelectronics problems. We now estimate that the fuel cell willbe installed by mid-May. We continued discussions with Dupontabout the new membranes. Dupont has agreed to send us a sampleof the Nafion® 1135 experimental membrane for testing. Performanceshould improve with this thinner, more conductive membrane. The EZ-GO golf cart that will serve as our first delivered vehicle(Cart 1) was disassembled, and hydrogen storage tanks and associatedhigh-pressure fuel delivery hardware (solenoid valves, pressure-reliefvalves, regulators) and the water circulation system have beeninstalled and tested. The heat exchangers and fans also havebeen installed. Structural changes to the frame have been completedto allow installation of the batteries and fuel cell. We are adding some extra safety features to Cart 1: a front bumper and a roll bar. We continued collaborating with personnel from Sandia NationalLaboratories on development of hydride storage for the vehicles. They have completed a preliminary computer model predicting behaviorof the cart thermal and fuel systems using data we delivered tothem. Sandia personnel have also begun negotiations with HydrogenConsultants to obtain a prototype hydride storage system for testingin August. One of our major tasks has been to analyze,modify, document, and debug existing software. We have writtenthe manual cart control and diagnostic software and the foundationof the automated control software, which allows the cart to berun and sensors to be debugged. We moved forward in identifying a neighborhood electric vehicle(NEV) appropriate for this project by speaking to individualsat CALSTART, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the PersonalIndependent Vehicle Company (PIVCO) of Norway, and several otherelectric vehicle manufacturers and retrofitters. We decided thatthe best possibility for an NEV, given our time constraints, isthe Kewet, a Danish car marketed in Southern California and costingaround $15,000, which meets U.S. safety standards. Although spaceis at a premium, it appears to meet all our requirements. We ordered a Kewet and began testing it in May. The preliminary layout of the photovoltaic hydrogen generatingand refueling station was completed. An artist's rendition ofthe station was presented to the Palm Desert city manager, economicdevelopment director, and director of buildings and safety inApril. The response was uniformly positive. While we werein Palm Desert, we visited a sunline natural gas refuelingstation and a local 12-kW photovoltaic system and met with anadvanced transportation task force to discuss safety and refuelingissues. We have nearly completed the development of SERC web pages. We exhibited and ran the prototype PUV at the L.A. Fleet Auto Show and Eco Expo, as well as at the City of Palm Desert Clean Cities Celebration. The reception from the public and from officials was very positive.The BBC filmed the prototype in action in Arcata and Palm Desert.A six-minute clip aired in Great Britain in May. Hoes Engineeringis interested in continuing to work with us to ensure safety in all systemsin the PUV, the NEV, the generating and refueling stations, and the service center.Dr. Michael Swain of the University of Miami has also agreed to work with us on safety issues.WT02-B17-15IA060-000330-B032-287http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hychula3.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115045959 text/html 2971HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:00:04 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:24 GMTContent-length: 2797 Hydrogen InfoNet Chula Vista Hydrogen Bus Project City of Chula Vista Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus Project; Barbara Bamberger, Principal Contact, Environmental Resource Manager, City of Chula Vista, California The City of Chula Vista, California, has undertaken a $6.34 million collaborative project todemonstrate zero-emission transit buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells. One of the objectives of this project is to compare the performance of buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells with the performance of today's diesel engine buses; another objective is to demonstrate and test hydrogen fuel cell buses in a real-world environment. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells used in each bus combinehydrogen and oxygen to form water; an intermediate step in this reaction produces electrons for the electric current used to run the on-board motor that propels the bus. The PEM fuel cells demonstrated in this project will produce electricity using molecular hydrogen fuel and ambient air as a source of oxygen, providing a zero- emissions power source. The PEM fuel cells, supplied by Ballard Power Systems, are smaller versions of the hydrogen fuel cells developed for NASA for the space shuttle program. The buses are to be New Flyer H40LF low-floor vehicles fitted with Ballard 275 HP fuel cellsin the place of an internal combustion engine. The performance of these buses meets FederalTransit Administration criteria. Each bus can hold up to 60 passengers, is fueled by compressed hydrogen gas, and has a range of 250 miles. The vehicles perform as well as or better than a diesel equivalent. The project members hope to demonstrate and test at least three of these vehicles. The project will also gather and report data on the following, among other statistics: fuel cell engine performance, cost, and reliability; fuel consumption; operating costs; service miles; passengers; fare revenue; road calls; and complaints. The PEM technology demonstrated in the project should be of interest to operators of centrally fueled fleets covered by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Recent Advances: The City of Chula Vista has been obtaining funds and developing strategic partnerships for this project. Current partners include the California Energy Commission, the State of California Legislature, the Department of Energy, the local Transit Development Agency, and Praxair, Inc., which will supply the hydrogen fuel and assist the city in developing a fueling facility. The City of Chula Vista is currently developing a world wide web site.

HTAP was established in 1992 to advise the Secretary of Energy on present and future hydrogen opportunities in the United States. Among the recommendations outlined in the 1995 report, HTAP has suggested the development of demonstration programs involving hydrogen-based surface transportation applications. Foremost among the demonstration programs would be a 10-bus demonstration 'on a highly visible route in a region where there is a major market for low-emission vehicles.' The panel noted that emission-free buses would make significant contributions to improvements in clean air quality on a per vehicle basis, and that the proposed demonstration should serve as a starting point in the development of technologies that would have potential for application in the private motor vehicle market. The panel report suggested that the Department of Energy should contribute approximately $21 million to the bus demonstration program through 2000. The total budget for the demonstration would also include significant cost-sharing with stakeholder institutions. In addition, the panel report suggested the establishment of a design for a light-duty vehicle utilizing hydrogen and for the production of a limited number of these vehicles. These light-duty vehicles would be tested under fleet conditions. To obtain a copy of 'The Green Hydrogen Report(145k), contact the National Technical Information Service, phone 703-487-4650.

Currently,however, about 62% of our municipal waste is being buried in landfills. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Texacoare working together to develop a commercial process for gasifyingMSW to produce hydrogen. The laboratory will focus on pretreatingMSW to prepare a slurry of suitable viscosity and heating valueto allow efficient and economical gasification and hydrogen production. Initial pretreatment approaches include hydrothermal processingat saturated conditions around 300°C with or without chemical/pHmodification, and mild dry pyrolysis with subsequent incorporationof the product gas into an appropriate slurry. In initial experiments, newspaper is used to represent the majorconstituent of MSW--cellulose. These experiments will be followedby others in which progressively more representative MSW samplesare used. Overall system modeling with special attention to energyefficiency and wastewater handling of the pretreatment processwill provide guidance for scaling up the experimental process. Ultimately, scale-up of the pretreatment process will providesufficient material for demonstration in the Texaco pilot facility. Additional long-term objectives of this work include a more detailedeconomic analysis of the process and development of a measurement/controlsystem to ensure slagging ash for variable MSW feedstocks. Recent Advances: A hydrothermal pilot-plant experiment was carried out to shakedown the modified product let-down system with a feed mixtureconsisting of paper and 10% polyethylene plastic. This let-downsystem consists of a lock hopper that allows the treated productto be "blown down" to disperse the plastic component. The lock hopper let-down system performed as designed, but wefound that the hydrothermally treated product segregated in thereactor allowed the water to exit but not the bulk of the solids. A consequence was that the level of dispersion of the plasticcomponent could not be determined in the final blow-down product. We are installing a modified mixer in the reactor to break thebridging tendency of the solids. One possible process for creating a high-energy slurry from MSWsuitable for gasification in a high-pressure gasifier is to firstpyrolyze the MSW at 500°C. Products from the pyrolysis wouldinclude gases, water, organics, and char. The liquid and solidproducts should form a suitable slurry, and the gases producedmay be useful in providing energy for the pyrolysis process. To explore this possible process option, we are putting togetheran ASPEN-based process model of the pyrolysis process similarto models developed for slurries produced using hydrothermal means. The model will initially be used to investigate the use of rotarykiln pyrolyzers, which have been used in Europe to process MSWand require a minimum of upstream preparation of the MSW feedstream. Our preliminary modeling shows that the hydrothermalprocess option for slurry production is more energy efficientthan the dry pyrolysis option. For the same feed and a similaraccounting for energy streams, the hydrothermal process requiresabout 15% of the heat represented by the product slurry in theprocessing compared to the 25% estimated for the dry pyrolysisoption. However, the dry pyrolysis option could deliver a higherheating value slurry which, depending on the manner in which thedownstream gasification is operated, may influence the overalleconomics of the integrated process.WT02-B17-19IA060-000326-B040-12http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/superconductivity/index.html 205.168.79.27 19970115013657 text/html 2469HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 01:37:04 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Fri, 13 Sep 1996 14:56:45 GMTContent-length: 2295 Superconductivity for Electric Systems Welcome to the Superconductivity for Electric Systems World Wide Web site—your resource for current information on superconducting technologies and the national Superconductivity for Electric Systems Program.

S. Department of Energy today announced a partnership with Arkenol, Inc., of Mission Viejo, Calif., to evaluate Arkenol's commercial process for the production of low-cost ethanol for use as a transportation fuel from agricultural wastes and dedicated energy crops. The three-phase project is expected to lead to the development of several commercial plants to produce ethanol from materials high in cellulose. Under the $670,000, cost-shared agreement, Arkenol will combine its concentrated acid hydrolysis process with NREL's genetically engineered bacteria, Zymomonas mobilis, to test the commercial viability of the combined processes to produce ethanol from sugar cane wastes, softwoods and napier grass. Sugar cane wastes, such as bagasse and cane trash, are underutilized resources, whose successful conversion to ethanol could improve the competitiveness of the U.S. sugar cane industry. Arkenol has obtained several patents on its innovative process. In addition, the bacteria, developed by DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, won a 1994 R&D 100 Award, for its ability to convert multiple sugars to ethanol. "A healthy biomass ethanol industry can create thousands of new jobs, decrease our dependence on foreign oil and help clear the air in our nation's cities," said Christine Ervin, DOE assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. "This partnership will take us to the doorstep of a new era and is typical of the way this Department of Energy does business. By partnering with industry and sharing the cost, we accomplish important national goals at lower cost to the taxpayer." The production of ethanol adds little additional carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, as compared to fossil fuels. For every pound of carbon dioxide released, a pound is recaptured from the growth of new feedstock materials. Historically, fuel ethanol has been produced from grains (primarily starch from corn). The use of agricultural wastes and energy crops will greatly expand the resource base and market potential for ethanol. Arkenol plans to create a supply of ethanol for Hawaii, and take advantage of legislation passed by the Hawaii State Legislature which requires that all gasoline sold in the State of Hawaii contain 10 percent ethanol.

The performance of this study will result in the development of information necessary for possible follow-on work in Phases II through IV. Information to be developed will include items such as: a detailed description of the proposed integrated system including status of the individual component technologies; technology development requirements; anticipated market for the technology/system; energy efficiency compared to conventional technology; environmental impacts; economic performance; regulation, safety, and reliability issues; capabilities, experience, and commitment of the applicant for possible follow-on work; and a business plan. Phase I awardees will be required to prepare a detailed Technical Progress Report. The Report must address all topics in the general report outline included as Item 3 of the Solicitation Attachments. Other information and sections may be added to the Report, as deemed appropriate by each awardee. There is no page limit for the Report. The Technical Progress Report is due to DOE by no later than the last day of the Phase I budget period. In addition, a business plan shall be developed during Phase I using one of the commercially-available computer software packages designed for this purpose. Acceptable computer software packages include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. BizPlan Builder, by JIAN, $90 approximate cost; 2. Business Plan Pro, by Palo Alto Software, $80 approximate cost; 3. Business Plan, Success, Inc., by Dynamic Pathways Co., $80 approximate cost; 4. Business Plan Writer, Graphite Software, $70 approximate cost; In all responses to this solicitation, one of the above computer software packages (or an equivalent package) shall be proposed as a tool to be used in the development of a business plan. The cost of the software package may be included in the project budget to be cost-shared by DOE and the applicant. At the conclusion of Phase I, the Technical Progress Report must include a description of the software package, the methodology used for the business plan development with the package, and a detailed description and evaluation of the results. The following summarizes the general types of work envisioned by DOE for each of four project phases. However, in the Technical Progress Report provided to DOE at the conclusion of Phase I, awardees may recommend deviations from the suggested progression of Phases II through IV if the proposed integrated hydrogen system work warrants a different progression. The proposed work must not include any duplication of efforts with ongoing DOE programs. Phase I - Technical and Business Feasibility Study As described above, Phase I involves the investigation of business and technical feasibility of the ultimate commercialization of integrated hydrogen systems, both for near-term 'niche' markets and for long-term energy markets. Phase I is intended to result in the development of information for DOE to evaluate and, as a result, select awardees for participation in Phases II through IV. Phase II - Technology Development Phase II will involve any required research and development of one or more component or sub-system technology elements which will eventually be used in the integrated hydrogen system. Phase III - Technology Validation Phase III will address the integration of the component or sub-system technology elements (usually two or more, such as production and storage; storage and utilization; etc.) which will be required for the commercial system. The Phase III efforts may involve small-scale demonstrations or laboratory experimentation to validate the technologies. Phase IV - Demonstration of Scale-Up Phase IV will address the technical and economic issues associated with scale-up of the complete, integrated hydrogen system. Phase IV may involve a pilot-scale demonstration of the integrated system. A commercial-scale system would be the follow-on step performed by the awardee subsequent to Phase IV. At the conclusion of Phase I, selected awardees for Phases II through IV may each be funded by DOE for up to five additional years. During Phases II through IV, research and development activities will be cost-shared by the awardee at a minimum level of 20%, with a 50% minimum cost share if the activities involve demonstration or commercialization activities. All Phase I awardees will be required to participate in the annual DOE Hydrogen Program review meeting (the next meeting should be held in April or May). During this meeting, each awardee will be required to present their project rationale and results to-date for an evaluation by a peer review panel. The results of this peer review will be one factor used by DOE in selecting projects to be continued into Phases II through IV.WT02-B17-23IA060-000330-B035-34http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/berry.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115051209 text/html 2218HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:12:14 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:20 GMTContent-length: 2044 Hydrogen InfoNet Technical and Economic Assessments of the Transport and Storage of Hydrogen; G. Berry and R. Smith, Principal Investigators, Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory Our goal is to identify promising ways to produce hydrogen for use as atransportation fuel. Market size and flexibility, energy efficiency, the existing infrastructure, safety, and environmental benefits are all part of the equation. Making a smooth transition to hydrogen and overcoming the infrastructure challenges faced by every alternative to today's gasoline-powered vehicles are the main barriers to introducing hydrogen-fueledvehicles. We have assessed hydrogen-fueled vehicles and compared them with otheroptions. Our assessment included the costs, efficiencies, and emissions of storing,delivering, and using hydrogen produced thermochemically and electrochemically. Hydrogen produced at central plants and delivered by truck was compared with hydrogenproduced on-site at filling stations, fleet refueling centers, and residences. The impactsof hydrogen vehicles, fueled by these pathways, were compared with those of today sgasoline vehicles, advanced battery-powered vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles usinggasoline or natural gas. Recent Advances: Our results indicate that many hydrogen production and delivery options areaffordable with high-efficiency vehicles. Depending on the production and distributionmethod, hydrogen will cost 4.5-7 cents per mile in an 80-mpg hydrogen vehicle. Thesevehicles represent the most economically feasible way to use hydrogen for this kind oftransportation. It appears that hydrogen fuel can remain affordable at small scales,enabling us to make a smooth transition to hydrogen-hybrid vehicles. A residentialelectrolysis unit, purchased for $3500, could provide fuel for an individual hydrogen carfor about 9 cents per mile.

Christine Ervin, DOE assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy, announced the new Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) program at Denver's City and County Building. Denver Mayor Wellington Webb joined Ervin and officials from Boulder, Jefferson County and the Colorado Office of Energy Conservation in endorsing the program. "In this country alone, more than 123 million vehicles spew out almost 720 million tons of air pollutants every year, and the numbers are rapidly increasing," Ervin said. "But we can change things if we work together. New computerized transportation technologies can double the efficiency of existing vehicle fleets--and that means fewer vehicles on the road while improving the quality of life for our citizens." In Jefferson County, senior citizens and the physically challenged will be able to schedule rides on a new "transit on demand" system, which uses global positioning satellites and digital cellular technology to streamline passenger pickups and arrivals. In Boulder, an Internet home page will provide citizens with information on transportation alternatives, including public bus routes, light rail, carpooling and bike paths. The home page will enhance coordination among city departments that provide transportation and related services. And in Denver, DOE will support the development of better ways to monitor transportation trends, including the number of people using various modes of transportation, vehicle emissions and preferred fuels. This information can be used by citizens, city planners and legislators to shape the transportation future of the region. "Maintaining Denver's quality of life will be a challenge as we move into the 21st century," Mayor Webb said. "The partnerships announced here today are part of a regional effort to clean up air and reduce traffic congestion not just one city at a time, but throughout the whole region." The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will provide technical assistance for the projects, under the direction of DOE's Denver Regional Support Office. Both organizations are located in Golden, Colo.The transit on demand system is an 18ƒmonth demonstration program beginning in early July. The pilot demonstrations in Boulder and Denver also are scheduled to go online within the next few months. "The technologies are available," Ervin said. "All we need is the will."

This Federal Technology Alert(FTA) of the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), one ofa series on new energy-efficient technologies and renewable energytechnologies, describes the various types of solar water-heatingsystems, the situations in which solar water heating is likelyto be cost-effective, considerations in selecting and designinga system, and basic steps for installing a system. There are a variety of different types of solar water-heating systems, butthe basic technology is straightforward. A collector absorbsheat from the sun and the system transfers that heat to water. That water is stored for use as needed, with a conventional systemproviding any necessary additional heating. A typical systemwill reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds,eliminating the cost of electricity or fossil fuel and the environmentalimpacts associated with their use.

The High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) fault current limiter is expected to provide significant cost savings and operational efficiency for the utility industry, with benefits passed to consumers through lower electrical bills and improved power quality. The fault limiter team, lead by Lockheed Martin's Energy & Power Systems unit, includes Southern California Edison, Intermagnetics General Corporation and DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory. The $8.4 million, cost-shared project to build and test a 15-kilovolt, fault current limiter is the next step toward commercialization of the device and one of four industry-lead Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI) projects funded by DOE. The SPI is a two-year program involving cost-shared cooperative agreements with industry to develop and commercialize new high temperature superconducting (HTS) components for electric power systems. The fault current limiter project could be the first commercial application of HTS. The capacity of an electric power system to withstand high, short-circuit current is essential to a stable system. Systems without this capability are subject to safety hazards, equipment damage and revenue loss. Traditionally, large resistors or series reactors are used to limit short circuit currents to safe levels. Existing system designs limit current not only during disturbances, but also under normal operating conditions, thereby weakening the entire system. The new HTS current fault limiter can reduce current only during surge conditions, allowing an electrical system to operate efficiently and cost effectively during fault current disruptions. Such disruptions can be caused by a variety of conditions, including equipment failures, lightning strikes, falling tree branches, kites, animals shorting the circuits or metallic balloons landing on wires, etc. The project is one of the most near-term HTS applications and builds on Lockheed Martin's successful first phase: development of a 2.4-kilovolt fault current limiter for electric utility application. The new device is to be built and tested by mid-1997, with commercial units available shortly thereafter. Benefits of this technology directly correlate with the utility industry's ability to successfully compete in a deregulation environment. "Industry's partnership with DOE on the HTS fault current limiter is speeding the success of this program," said Christine Ervin, DOE Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. "By working together, the public and private sector can develop technologies to improve energy efficiency and commercialize the technology, which can also mean lower costs and improved power quality for utilities and savings for the consumer." The U.S. Department of Commerce projects an annual world market of $5 billion for HTS devices by the end of the century with the primary market sector being the electric utility industry. DOE's Superconductivity Partnership Initiative, by accelerating development of products, will help improve U.S. technological competitiveness and leadership in the international marketplace.

Badin, Principal Investigator, Energetics, Incorporated Each potential hydrogen application has a variety of performance requirements and a unique set of competing energy systems. The goal of this project is to provide DOE with an analytical framework that can be used to evaluate and screen hydrogen pathways by developing Energy, Economics, and Emissions (E3) Pathway and Network Analysis Models. The models are applied to specific case studies that are of interest to the DOE Hydrogen Program. The E3 models provide a consistent basis by which we can evaluate and compare the life-cycle costs, primary energy requirements, and emission impacts of different energy systems. They also enable an objective and comprehensive assessment to be made of the near-, mid-, and long-term competitiveness of hydrogen systems in specific applications. The E3 Pathway Analysis Model was developed to analyze energy systems that consist of a series of transformation steps (e.g., hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use). The cost of capital equipment, annual operating costs, energy efficiency, and other performance data are estimated for each step and input to the model. The model then calculates the capacity requirements and cost of each step per unit of energy consumed at the final stage. In this way, the model determines the total amount of primary energy consumed (e.g., natural gas, biomass, or solar energy). The model's output includes the energy system's total present worth, annual cost, and life-cycle cost. The combined capabilities of the models provide the DOE Hydrogen Program with information to support future decision making. The models ensure that all contributors to system cost, from primary energy consumption to end use, are considered when comparing different hydrogen technologies; they thus help to guide R&ampD efforts to the components that have greatest effect on the total cost of hydrogen systems. Recent Advances: In 1996, Energetics performed a number of analysis tasks supportingthe Hydrogen Program. We completed five detailed pathway analysesin 1996. These are summarized in the table, and the full reportsare contained in a compendium entitled Independent Analysisand Verification of Key Hydrogen Energy Concepts, which wasdistributed to the members of the Hydrogen Technical AdvisoryPanel. We revised the Hydrogen Technology Cost and Performance Databaseto include additional data from equipment manufacturers, improvedunits of measure, enhanced definitions of efficiencies and capitalcost bases, and additional data categories (e.g., membranes). In addition, the data base was moved to a Paradox platform tofacilitate the evaluation and updating of data and to enable futurelinkage with the E-3 Pathway Analysis Model. Energy System Concept Pathway Analysis Results Municipal solid waste (MSW) is suspended in a water-based slurry and charged to a gasifier, producing hydrogen. The low base-case cost of hydrogen ($8/MBtu) is due to the low-value feedstock. Economics are strongly dependent on sustained tipping fees and MSW classification costs. A large-scale geothermal electricity generation unit (100 MW) supplies full electricity service (both peak and baseload) to a load center. Surplus electricity fuels an electrolyzer supplying hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles in the Los Angeles basin. Waste heat from a geothermal unit makes it a good match with HTS electrolysis. However, the cost of transporting hydrogen from remote geothermal sites is significant. The scale of the project is large compared to vehicle penetration forecasts. Distributed generation fuel cells are fueled by hydrogen from electrolyzers using surplus, off-peak electricity on the island of Hawaii. The island setting is attractive because of high fossil fuel costs and large max/min load ratio. Project requires commercially available hydrogen-fed fuel cells. Location of the fuel cells at the load center can reduce peak-time reliance on transmission lines, improving reliability. Low avoided costs for peak electricity limit this concept's viability. Golf carts are retrofitted with a 4-kW PEM fuel cell and used for personal transportation in the city of Palm Desert, California. Hydrogen fuel is produced by a wind-turbine/electrolysis system. Low-pressure PEM technology eliminates the need for the on-board air compressor, which is important for small vehicles. Battery-electric vehicles are well suited for the low-range golf cart application. Revised analysis of the integrated electricity storage and hydrogen production system incorporating a solar-powered HBr reactor and a reversible HBr cell. Pathway model has been revised. Analysis will be completed after results from the 10 kW pilot plant test are available.WT02-B17-35IA060-000328-B025-18http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/rfptoc.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115030737 text/html 2079HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 03:07:38 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:27 GMTContent-length: 1905 Hydrogen InfoNet SOLICITATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS HYDROGEN FEASIBILITY STUDIES: PHASE I SOLICITATION NUMBER DE-PS36-96GO10160 Issuing Office: U.S. Department of Energy Golden Field Office 1617 Cole Blvd. Golden, CO 80401 Date Issued: June 28, 1996 CLOSING DATE AND TIME: September 2, 1996 at 3:00 pm MST Point of Contact: John P.

Members of a consortium could include entities such as profit and non-profit organizations, public-sector organizations, educational institutions, etc. Federal national laboratories cannot be applicants, but can participate in a consortium responding to this solicitation during any of the Phases. Only one entity can be considered an applicant, so each consortium must submit an application through a private-sector firm. Eligible organizations currently receiving financial assistance under the DOE Hydrogen Program may submit applications for non- overlapping work. An individual firm or a consortium must cost share at least 50% of the total project costs in order to receive an award under this Phase I solicitation. In-kind contributions incurred as part of the project tasks may be counted as all or part of the cost share as described in 10CFR Part 600, Section 600.123. The required 50% minimum cost share must be provided from non-Federal funding sources, i.e., private funding, state or local government funding, or any other sources that were not derived from Federal funds. If Federal national laboratories participate in a consortium, then the value of the laboratory contribution to the work effort (i.e., Federal funds provided through the laboratory for the benefit of the consortium) will be considered to be part of the total DOE contribution to the projectand, thus, will be subject to cost share requirements from non-Federal funds. The application must accurately define the business arrangement between Federal national laboratory participants and private-sector firms, including the accounting method for Federal funds. Awards under this solicitation are subject to the eligibility requirements stated in Section 2306 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), Public Law Number 102-486. Per this Section, an applicant private-sector firm shall be eligible to receive financial assistance under this solicitation only if it is a United States-owned company, or the firm is incorporated in the United States and has a parent company which is incorporated in a country which affords to United States-owned companies: (1) opportunities comparable to those afforded to any other company to participate in any joint venture similar to the one described in this solicitation; (2) local investment opportunities comparable tothose afforded to any other company; and (3) adequate and effective protection for United States companies' intellectual property rights. In addition, the Applicant must show that the project, as a whole, is in the economic interest of the United States. To fulfill this requirement, the Applicant must consider the contributions of all entities involved in the consortium, including any contractors or suppliers that the Applicant has named and relied upon in its application. This can be evidenced by: (1) investments in the United States in research, development, and manufacturing, such as the manufacture of major components or subassemblies in the United States; (2) significant contributions to employment in the United States; (3) agreement with respect to any technology arising from assistance provided under this solicitation to promote the manufacture within the United States of products resulting from that technology, taking into account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States industry, and to procure parts and materials from competitive suppliers. Applicants will be requested to complete EPACT Section 2306 documents. The documents will constitute a statement of eligibility under Section 2306 of EPACT, addressing the Applicant's and consortium members' location, ownership and owner's location, location of project performance, and benefits to accrue to the United States economy. Based on the information received, a determination by DOE that the EPACT eligibility requirements are met shall be made prior to award of a Cooperative Agreement.

The purpose will be to select those awardees, if any, that will be awardedcontinuations to their Phase I Cooperative Agreement. The continuations will be awarded for proposed activities in Phases II through IV, with DOE funding provided on a year-by-year basis. Each subsequent yearly award, if any, will be based on technical, business, and programmatic merit as determined by DOE. The following general evaluation criteria will be used by DOE in the selection of awardees for Cooperative Agreements following the completion of Phase I. Other factors in making these selections, such as additional programmatic considerations, will be at the discretion of DOE and will be described in the Phase I Cooperative Agreements. GENERAL SELECTION CRITERIA FOR COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTSFOR PHASES II - IV BASED ON PHASE I TECHNICAL PROGRESS REPORTS I. Business and Technical Feasibility of the Awardee's Integrated Hydrogen System DOE will develop criteria for evaluating the awardee's results addressing business andtechnical feasibility contained in Section II (Technical Approach) and Section III (Business Plan for Commercializing the Integrated System) of the Phase I TechnicalProgress Report. DOE anticipates that these criteria will be similar to the ApplicationEvaluation Factors for Sections II and III of the Phase I application. II. Plans and Associated Activities for Completion of the Project DOE will develop criteria for evaluating the Awardee's plans contained in Section IV (Project Planning for Phases II - IV), Section V (Teaming Arrangements for Phases II- IV), and Section VI (Resource Requirements for Phases II - IV) from the Phase ITechnical Progress Report. DOE anticipates that these criteria will also be similar tothe Application Evaluation Factors for Sections IV and V of the Phase I application. In developing these evaluation factors, DOE will consider the following aspects asparticularly important: soundness of the overall plan, clear understanding of thephase-to-phase progression, and schedule/budget realism. III. Project Peer Review Each awardee shall participate in the annual DOE Hydrogen Program Review Meeting to present their project rationale and results to-date for an evaluation by a peer review panel. The results of this peer review will be a factor used by DOE in selectingprojects to be continued into Phases II through IV. IV. Program Policy Factors Program policy factors may be used by the Selection Official to select a range of projects that will ensure the DOE Hydrogen Program objectives are achieved inPhases II through IV. Program policy factors will be identified and imposed after theindividual evaluations of all Phase I Technical Progress Reports have been completed. V. Total Project Cost The apparent advantages of individual applications may be weighed against evaluatedprobable cost to DOE (including cost share) to determine whether the superiority ofmore costly applications is justified compared to less-costly applications. As a resultof this project/cost trade-off analysis, evaluated probable cost to DOE may form thebasis for selection.WT02-B17-44IA060-000330-B029-86http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/attach.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115044400 text/html 1398HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 04:44:07 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:20 GMTContent-length: 1224 Hydrogen InfoNet SOLICITATION ATTACHMENTS 1.

The rates of both CO2fixation and hydrogen/oxygen production are similar for the mutant and a wild-type strain containing both photosystems. The wild type showed stable photosynthetic activity, measured as CO2 fixation, under both aerobic (oxygen is present) and anaerobic (oxygen is not present) conditions, while the mutant was stable only under anaerobic conditions. Our research illustrates a new type of photosynthesis being performed by the PSII light reaction. It also hints at the evolution and origin of water-splitting photosynthesis. Previous researchers have suggested that some sort of genetic fusion took place between two bacteria using the two different photosynthetic mechanisms. Subsequently, the two systems were linked, and the oxygen-producing system (PSII) was added to plants' capabilities. However, no examples of the intermediate stages of this type of evolution have been observed. Our hypothesis is that bacteria first evolved using PSII photosynthesis and later added the PSI capability when molecular oxygen became a major component of the Earth's atmosphere. Recent Advances: Photoautotrophic growth was studied under photoinhibitory conditions: high light intensity with air. Photoautotrophically grown cultureswere used as inocula for the experiment. The experimental resultsshowed that PSI-deficient mutants can grow under high light intensitywith air, although they have less resistance to photoinhibitionthan the wild type. In 12 day-and-night cycles, the mutants grewfrom an initial population of 6.5 x 104 cells/ml to a final culturedensity about 8.5 x 105 cells/ml, and 46.6% of the cells becamecolorless (photobleached), while the wild type reached a culturedensity of 1.72 x 106 cells/ml with only 7.8% of the cells photodamaged. This is an important result, since it indicates that PSI-deficientmutants can survive under high light intensity even in air.WT02-B17-47IA060-000326-B034-74http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/menus/addasite.html 205.168.79.27 19970115010458 text/html 1982HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 01:05:03 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 17:13:13 GMTContent-length: 1808 Add a Site on EREN Add a Site on EREN Before you submit information about an Internet resource to usfor consideration, please review the following criteria.

The Department of Energy (DOE), under authority ofSection 2026 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486, and the Matsunaga HydrogenResearch, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-566, is requestingapplications as a follow-on to a Notice of Interest published in the Commerce Business Daily (onApril 21, 1995). DOE is seeking private-sector led, cost-shared projects in research, development,and technology validation that include the integration of hydrogen technologies such as production,storage, transport, and end-use applications. The purpose of the solicitation is to assist the privatesector in the development of integrated hydrogen systems for applications to near- and long-termmarkets. DOE encourages the submission of development plans for integrated systems related tolong-term hydrogen energy markets, although DOE will consider applications for systems addressingnear-term hydrogen niche markets. The request for proposals is expectd to be issued in June, 1996. A series of plenary lectures followed, on an issue of great importance to industry and the program -transferring our technologies from the lab to the marketplace. A diverse and exciting panel wasassembled for a lively and informative session. Mr. Joseph King, vice president of Technology andBusiness Development for International Fuel Cells, discussed his experience in transferringtechnology from the development phase to commercialization. Air Products and Chemical s RobertMiller presented an informative discussion of the industry perspective of partnering with DOE. GaryNoland, president of G & A Associates, gave his perspective on small-business involvement intechnology development. Finally, Clyde Feyrer, president of First Colonial Funds, provided us withan overview of existing financing mechanisms and presented an interesting concept for capitalizationof technology development projects. Following the plenary session on Monday, the individual working groups met in breakout meetingsfor most of Tuesday. Each of the group leaders (Production, Storage, Utilization, and SystemsIntegration) arranged an agenda that continued the theme of the plenary as it applied to specifictechnology areas. In the late afternoon, we reassembled as one group to discuss several proposeddemonstration projects and their applicability to the Hydrogen Program goals. On Wednesday, we began our Annual Review Meeting, which is the primary peer-review mechanismused by the program to maintain the highest level of quality in our research and analysis efforts. We began with a discussion of the mechanics of the meeting by Neil Rossmeissl, DOE HydrogenProgram Manager. Following introduction of the review panel, four technology summaries werepresented. Because the program is growing so large (more than 50 projects), we conducted parallelsessions this year; these technology summaries afforded an opportunity for the reviewers andattendees to get a flavor of the entire program. Finally, we heard about exciting outreach activities,including hydrogen at the Olympic Games. The parallel sessions began after lunch on Wednesdayand concluded on Thursday afternoon. The recommendations of the peer review panels areexpected in June, 1996.WT02-B17-49IA059-000325-B001-47http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/femp/tech_demo.html 205.168.79.27 19970115003144 text/html 2512HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 00:31:45 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Fri, 08 Nov 1996 16:29:07 GMTContent-length: 2338 FEMP - New Technology Overview Program Overview U.S. Department of Energy Technology Demonstrations Demonstrations provide first-hand independently gathered performance data tofederaldecision-makers and support timely federal adoption of energy saving andenvironmentally beneficialtechnologies. Demonstrations are formalized through means such as cooperativeresearch anddevelopment agreements, through which public and private collaborators share costsand results for theproject. A demonstration brings together a federal host site, a technology manufacturer,a trade association, alocal utility, and a national laboratory. The federal site provides on-site supportfor the technologyevaluation, hoping to reduce energy and operations and maintenance costs. Themanufacturer donatesthe equipment for evaluation, hoping to establish a federal track record andimprove technologiesbased on performance analysis. The local utility validates technology contributionsand helps its federalcustomer offset increasing capacity requirements. Trade associations disseminateresults in order topromote new technologies, emphasize technology transfer, and communicate technologybenefits to awide audience. The national laboratory provides technical staff to perform theanalysis and prepare thetechnical report on the demonstration.

The Triathlon is a three-ton, gas-engine-driven heat pump. A single-cylinder, four stroke 5-hp engine fueled by natural gas drives the heat pump's compressor. A distinctive feature of the technology is an inherent load-matching capability. The heat pump can vary engine speed and blower fan speed, and thereby dynamically control capacity to balance with thermal loads. The balance minimizes the need for cycling and reduces the associated thermal losses, fluctuations in room temperature and humidity, and equipment wear. In the heating season, the gas heat pump provides supply-air temperatures warmer than conventional heat pumps because of waste-heat recovery from the engine. The waste heat is delivered via a water-glycol loop to a separate radiator in the indoor unit. This feature eliminates the uncomfortably cool supply air produced by electric heat pumps during defrost cycles and periods of low outdoor ambient temperatures. The heat recovery also improves heating capacity. Compared to electric heat pumps, the gas heat pump has nearly twice the heating capacity at 0 F. Recovered heat can also be used for domestic hot water heating. On summer days, it can meet up to 100% of water heating needs, though water heating performance was not specifically monitored during the demonstration. In the demonstration, the Triathlon was compared to three units representing the range of HVAC systems at Fort Sam Houston, from the best available (pulse-combustion furnaces and air conditioners with scroll compressors) to the oldest of the Fort's conventional air conditioners and furnaces. Through life-cycle costing methods, the cost-effectiveness of the Triathlon was measured for five other federal sites: Naval Air Station Willow Grove, Fort Irwin, Fort Dix, Fort Drum, and Fort Stewart. Triathlon proves reliable during demonstration Findings from the summer-cooling test demonstrated the Triathlon gas heat pump to be a reliable system. There were no forced outages during the cooling test, giving the unit a 100% reliability record during the summer. However, during the heating season the availability of the unit was less than 100%, with two downtimes due to a discharge flange gasket leak and a failed starter motor; pre-production design deficiencies leading to the component failure have been corrected in all Triathlon production units. Triathlon meets needs for occupant comfort The occupants concluded that the gas heat pump provided good comfort levels with acceptable levels of operating noise. Monitoring of indoor humidity during cooling operation showed nearly identical average humidity levels (and associated comfort) by the Triathlon and comparison air conditioners during the summer test. Monitoring of indoor temperatures during heating operation showed the variable-speed gas heat pump to provide better temperature control than the comparison systems. Triathlon demonstrates superior energy performance The Triathlon demonstrated a thermal coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.128 during the summer-cooling test and 1.278 during the winter-heating test, operating at the manufacturer's anticipated performance levels, and demonstrating performance levels slightly above those established in the Phase I Field Test program conducted by the unit's developers. The Triathlon yielded a reduction in cooling-energy costs over the conventional air conditioners at Fort Sam Houston. In a normal summer at the San Antonio test house, it uses 41.5 kcf of gas and 864 kWh of electricity. This amount of fuel costs $224 (based on internal commercial gas and electricity rates established at Fort Sam Houston) and corresponds to a savings of $37 to $59 over the three comparison air conditioners in this field test. The savings relative to the best of the comparison units (10.45 seasonal energy efficiency rating or SEER) was $37 (14.2%). The gas heat pump demonstrated a reduction in heating-energy costs from those recorded for the condensing furnaces existing at the base. In a normal winter at the San Antonio test house, it uses 27.9 kcf of gas and 510 kWh of electricity. This amount of fuel costs $147 and corresponds to a savings of $33 (18.3% of Unit 1 consumption; annual fuel utilization efficiency or AFUE = 97.0%) to $101 (40.6% of Unit 3 consumption; AFUE = 69.2%) over the costs recorded for the three comparison furnaces in this field test. However, on a total operating cost basis, the Triathlon does not offer annual savings at Fort Sam Houston when compared with the most efficient of the three systems in the field comparison. Lower than national-average electricity prices, $100 higher maintenance costs, and a mild winter climate all contribute to higher annual-operating costs for the gas heat pump, compared to the other units monitored during the demonstration. Life-cycle cost comparison shows Triathlon's potential for some federal sites. The life-cycle cost (LCC) of the Triathlon was compared to the LCC of three commercially available AC/furnace systems at six federal bases. The assumed system costs are provided in the table below: 		Triathlon	System A	System B	System CSEER, Btu/wh	-----		10.2		15.6		12.2AFUE, %		-----		 97		 97		 80AnnualMaintenance	$175		$75		$75		$75	Installed Cost	$8000		$4018		$5917		$3500	 The goal of the LCC was to take the thermal performance results established at Fort Sam Houston and project them to several commercially available AC/furnace systems and make an LCC comparison under different fuel pricing and climate situations. The six locations were therefore chosen to reflect the division of fuel pricing and climates at U.S. federal facilities. Of the six bases analyzed, the Triathlon was found cost-effective at two: Willow Grove Naval Air Station in Philadelphia and Fort Irwin near Barstow, California. Both bases had high energy-cost savings mainly because of relatively high gas and electric prices. Willow Grove NAS has an ideal combination of energy-cost saving indicators for yielding high gas heat pump savings. Electricity rates are structured to have low base rates with high demand charges. This results in a large difference in the effective costs between gas and electric cooling. As a result, relatively low summer thermal loads yield high cooling energy savings for the Triathlon. Also, low base-rate electricity charges reduce the performance penalty the Triathlon receives from having higher fan electricity than furnaces during the winter. Finally, a strong winter coupled with higher than average gas prices yields good heating season savings. The Triathlon at Fort Irwin also achieves high energy-cost savings with a somewhat different combination of fuel-price and thermal-load indicators in comparison to those at Willow Grove NAS. The ratio between effective electricity prices and gas prices is high for electric systems at Fort Irwin as they are also at Willow Grove NAS. However, the emphasis on demand charges is less. The result, when compared to Willow Grove NAS, is slightly higher cooling energy savings, but they are achieved because an increase in thermal cooling loads compensates for the reduction in price advantage. The lower winter thermal load, lower gas prices, and higher base-rate electricity all cause a significant reduction in heating-energy-cost savings. The net result is that the gas heat pump shows less LCC advantage over the high-efficiency AC/furnace system at Fort Irwin than at Willow Grove NAS. At a lower price ($6,000 installed) and lower annual maintenance cost ($150), Fort Drum (Watertown, NY) and Fort Dix (Trenton, NJ) are also shown to be cost-effective locations. Although the standard Triathlon evaluated in this analysis is generally not selling at single-unit prices below $6,000, a two-pipe version (using electric-resistance back-up heat in substitution for the standard gas-boiler auxiliary heater) can offer as much as a $1,000 reduction in price. This version is potentially less efficient in the heating mode (no engine waste-heat recovery) but could be the cost-effective choice in locations with mild heating seasons. This substitution potentially reduces LCC for the Triathlon to a level competitive at the remaining two bases, Fort Stewart (near Savannah, GA) and Fort Sam Houston (San Antonio, TX).

Seahorse is relatively recent addition to residential water heating market The Seahorse gas hot water conversion system is a relatively recent addition to the residential water heating market that allows a residence or small building to easily convert an existing electric resistance water heater to a water heating system fueled by natural gas or propane. The Seahorse consists of a natural-gas-fired tankless water heater and a small water pump, housed in a metal case installed outside the home. The conversion system includes adapters which allow plumbing the input and output water flows from the Seahorse to the existing electric hot water tank. The heater is equipped with a freeze protection device (freezestat), which will turn on the pump and circulate the water in the system for a short period of time during sub-freezing conditions. Auxiliary freeze protection, available as an accessory, has been used in the solar industry as freeze protection for over 25 years, and does not require any electricity. The Seahorse has a nominal gas input of 60,000 Btu/h and is available in either propane or natural gas models. According to Robert Glass, Vice President of Engineering and Manufacturing, Gas-Fired Products, the large input is about twice the input of a standard gas water heater, so it lends itself to innovative installations. For example, Gas-Fired Products has hooked one Seahorse to multiple storage tanks, and has also used the technology for both home heating and water heating. In addition, the American Gas Association has certified the Seahorse for installations including manufactured (mobile) homes. Seahorse evaluated using several parameters The Seahorse system was installed in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom duplex, with approximately 1,300 ft2 floor area; two adults and two children occupy the home. Hot water use is limited to three sinks, two tub/showers, a clothes washer, and a dishwasher. The technology was installed in March of 1994 and monitored until November of 1994. The Seahorse installed in the demonstration used a two-stage gas valve and a direct spark ignition device to ignite the gas flame. The thermostat used to trigger operation of the Seahorse can be either the original tank thermostat or a submersible thermostat or aquastat supplied by Gas-Fired Products. Through the demonstration, staff of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory measured the electric and gas consumption of the Seahorse, the hot water energy supplied to the storage tank by the Seahorse, and the hot water energy supplied to the house from the storage tank. From this data, researchers generated a performance map relating the energy consumption of the Seahorse to the residential hot water energy requirements as well as the outside temperature. The researchers then used the performance map to calculate the efficiency of the Seahorse and the Seahorse/hot water tank system. The cost to meet typical hot water requirements with the Seahorse system and the cost to meet the same requirements with conventional electric and gas residential water heaters were then compared on a life-cycle cost basis. Hot water delivery efficiencies included in demonstration results The average hot water consumption during the testing period was 60.7 gal/day resulting in a hot water energy use of 28,100 Btu/day or 68% of the Department of Energy's estimate for typical residential hot water energy consumption. The average hot water delivery temperature to the residence during the testing period was 128 F. The final average hot water delivery-to-residence efficiency of the Seahorse system (system implies the new technology and existing tank combined) was determined to be 46.8%. High standby losses and the relatively low hot water consumption contributed to the relatively low delivery-to-residence efficiency recorded during this test. Much of the standby losses could be reduced through the addition of a simple check valve, which would increase the delivery-to-residence efficiency in future Seahorse installations. The final average hot water delivery-to-tank efficiency (Seahorse alone) was determined to be 77.4%. The delivery-to-tank efficiency is defined as the hot water energy provided by the Seahorse to the hot water storage tank, divided by the gas energy input to the Seahorse. The manufacturer obtained an average thermal efficiency of 83.9% as determined by an independent laboratory. Observation of the demonstration unit suggests that attaining this efficiency level requires properly setting the Seahorse temperature control during installation. Larger thermostat differentials between the Seahorse and tank reduce the cycling of the Seahorse unit and provide higher efficiency. Short cycling times and sporadic cycling occurred during the earlier stages of the demonstration, allowing researchers to try several compensatory strategies. Because reduced efficiency and short-cycling operation occurred when the tank thermostat was used for control, the demonstration results indicate that an aquastat be used for any new Seahorse installations. Seahorse system nets significant life-cycle energy cost-savings of $778 Based on the measured performance, the Seahorse gas hot water conversion technology demonstrated at Fort Stewart was estimated to net a life-cycle energy cost-savings of $778 for a typical residence at that site with a hot water consumption equivalent to 64.3 gallons/day of 135 F water. The estimate was calculated using avoided energy costs of $0.025/kWh for electricity, $8.85/kW for electric demand, and $0.30/therm for natural gas. Based on national average electrical costs of $0.0867/kWh and natural gas costs of $0.604/therm, the life-cycle energy cost savings for the Seahorse system would be $1,365. After analysis, the cost-savings were not enough to offset the initial estimated installation costs of $835 at the Fort Stewart location. Marginally higher water consumption or electric energy costs would make the technology a life-cycle cost effective retrofit for electric water heaters at Fort Stewart. Seahorse proves comparable to tank-type gas water heaters, with potential for greater efficiency A comparison of the Seahorse performance with more typical tank-type gas water heaters suggests that the installed Seahorse/hot water tank system at Fort Stewart performed at roughly the same level of efficiency as a typical 40- gallon gas water heater with an energy factor of 0.54, the minimum efficiency level allowed for installation at a federal site. Improvements in system design in the present generation of Seahorse units may make new Seahorse models more efficient than base tank-type gas water heaters. Inaddition, installation of a check-valve in the Seahorse flow loop would alsoimprove the Seahorse efficiency beyond what was measured in the Fort Stewartdemonstration. Similar levels of improvement are available in residentialtank-type gas water heaters but often at higher costs. Based on the measured data, the author of the technical report on the demonstration, Dave Winiarski of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,recommends that the decision to purchase a Seahorse versus a tank-type gas waterheater be based primarily on capital and installation cost consideration. Alife-cycle cost comparison with gas-fired, tank-type water heaters will dependheavily on the installation costs for the tank-type gas water heaters,particularly the cost of providing an exhaust flue for ventilation of the gas water heater. In the technical report, Mr. Winiarski presents two nomographs, one showing the electric and natural gas costs leading to a positive net present value for the Seahorse conversion, and one illustrating which gas water heater type would be more cost effective based on the cost to provide a flue system for the tank-type water heater. Demonstration indicates that Seahorse is robust technology In conclusion, the Seahorse gas hot water conversion system appears to be a robust technology for which there are cost-effective applications in the federal sector. Federal energy managers supervising areas with the right combination of energy costs should consider the Seahorse as an alternative to electric resistance water heaters for residences that have natural gas or propane gas available to them.

This collection represents a lifetime of work done by the late Akira Mitsui of the University of Miami, a graduate of the University of Tokyo. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Japan Ministry of International Trade and Industry, in recognition of the importance of this resource, are providing the initial funding to maintain the collection in Hawaii. The collection was established as an international marine biological repository for research, development, data collection, and information sharing. It should help to stimulate new, multinational industries in biotechnology and provide a fundamental base for worldwide cooperation in solar hydrogen production and sustainable energy systems. The initial transfer of 360 cyanobacteria and 160 other photosynthetic bacteria from the University of Miami to the University of Hawaii was successfully completed in September 1995. The dedication of the new International Marine Biotechnology Culture Collection took place on September 27, 1995, with dignitaries from DOE and the Japan Ministry of International Trade and Industry in attendance. Recent Advances: An inventory of all of the purple nonsulfur bacteria and the cyanobacteriacultures (the triplicate import set of test tubes and vials andthe sets that have subsequently been subcultured from the importedset) was done to check for viability. For the cyanobacteria,145 strains are viable and the majority exhibit visibly increasingbiomass. For the purple nonsulfur bacteria, of the 462 strainslisted for importation on the import permit, 408 were actuallyimported. If these, 394 survived the importation and all weretransferred. Of the 394, there are at present 355 that are stillviable with visibly healthy cells. Documentation of all strainstransferred and growth conditions has been recorded on an Exceldatabase. Conditions on these organisms are now being optimizedto promote increased growth rates. The same technique as thatfor the cyanobacteria is being used: larger inoculum-to-mediaratio (decrease lag phase). Also, higher light and temperatureare being added. The aSy medium has been used with selected culturesunder high light, and the growth response has been positive.WT02-B17-53IA060-000328-B024-133http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/remeet.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115030605 text/html 910HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 03:06:02 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:27 GMTContent-length: 737 Hydrogen InfoNet Recent Meetings The Hydrogen Program organizes and participates in a number of meetings that are important to advancing the vision of a hydrogen future.

The symposium would consist of international governments, companies, andacademia who would come together to create partnerships and discuss ideas for the future. Aparallel project would also be hosted for high school and college students. Green Report Recommendations - James MacKenzieThe Green Hydrogen Report discusses research and development, problems in transporting energysupply, various areas where more research is needed and the need for demonstrations. The Reportdoes not provide enough analysis or background to help the Department set research and analyticalpriorities. More specific guidelines are needed to set the focus and priorities, established incooperation with industry and staff. A Hydrogen Energy Consortium, proposed in the GreenHydrogen Report, needs to be better defined. Year-by-year budget tables should be presented. HTAP is going to require more support from DOE staff to assist with the analysis of the variousprograms, the rationale, funding levels, and competing priorities, in order to help the Departmentbetter focus the program to achieve the goals that HTAP supports. The recommendation was made that the Strategic Directions Committee will integrate all of thesuggestions and develop an outline for the follow up report to the Green Hydrogen Report. The Role of HTAP - Alan Lloyd Dr. Lloyd began the discussion on the role of the panel by stating that one of the challenges thatHTAP faces is how to assist DOE in coming up with an expanded and technically defensible budgetrequest that will be successful in Congress. Mr. Lynch recommended that HTAP make their positionon issues available as guidance within the government. Mr. Nahmias suggested broad criteria belaid out by HTAP as to the direction of the program. Dr. Takahashi stated that HTAP needs to gainthe confidence of the entire system. Mr. Rossmeissl suggested that HTAP find a way to work withDOE on a regular basis on specific projects as individuals and keep the panel recommendations andvision on a much broader scale. Dr. Kamal stated that the panel needs to use their diversity to reacha consensus on what advice they need to give to the Secretary. Dr. Lloyd suggested that otherfederal government agencies make presentations on their hydrogen programs to HTAP at futuremeetings. Legislative Update - Kevin Aylesworth of Senator Harkin's Office There are three bills dealing with hydrogen being considered. Senator Harkin and CongressmanWalker each introduced bills that are nearly identical. The third bill, by Senator Burns, iscontroversial in that it is a waste reduction project and does not have much to do with hydrogen. Congressman Walker has decide not to run for reelection, Senator Harkin is still interested inhydrogen, and Domenici is gaining interest. Federal Report - Russell Eaton There has been a reorganization in DOE and the Hydrogen Program is now in the Office of SolarThermal, Biomass Power and Hydrogen Technologies with Gary Burch as the director. In puttingtogether the 97 budget for EERE, there was a push for near-term activities in deploying renewableenergy technologies. The near-term activities in the hydrogen program were not as far along as thedeployment activities of renewable energy technologies. As a result, the hydrogen program requestwas reduced by approximately three and a half million over current funding. Five Year Implementation Plan - Catherine Gregoire Padr� The basic outline for the report will consist of a program overview detailing program structure andmanagement coordination, technology transition strategy, the history of the program, the programvision, the goals and a discussion on legislative drivers. Also discussed will be the program withinDOE, the programs outside DOE, HTAP, and the role of NHA. There will be discussion about thecoordination with the Hydrogen program of DOE-related and other federally-funded research andalso international cooperation and industry participation. Technology development and validationwill follow up on last year s notice of interest. Market transformations will include guidelines to moveto where we would like to be. The plan will report the technical aspects of the program whichconsists of production, storage, transport of hydrogen and utilization. A rough draft of the plan willbe sent to a few people for comments in May. DOE Hydrogen Program Overview - Neil Rossmeissl/JoAnn Milliken Mr. Rossmeissl showed a chart of the offices that have hydrogen technology associated with themincluding solar, thermal, biomass, hydro technologies, and the Office of Industrial Technologies Fuelcell programs and fossil energy will both be active participants. The program is organized into fourareas; production, storage, utilization and analysis. The integration analysis group has be added onthe advisement of HTAP. He suggested that HTAP members participate in the program at the peerreview. In an overview of the Office of Transportation Technologies, Ms. Milliken described the structure inOTT; fuels development, advanced automotive technologies, heavy vehicle technologies and theoffice of Technology Utilization. The fuel cell program is located under the advanced automotivetechnologies office. The focus of the program is on proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Thedemonstration of a full-size power system is projected in 1998, a concept vehicle at the turn of thecentury and production of a prototype vehicle around the year 2004. The goal is fuel cell vehicleshaving approximately 10 percent of the market in 2015 with 50 percent by the year 2050. Hydrogen Program Structure - Patrick Takahashi Dr. Takahashi stated that from the beginning there was a sense that the program should becombined in some way between Utilities and Transportation as opposed to only Utilities. The panelneeds to determine what they would want this program to be and where it will be in the Departmentof Energy. Dr. Takahashi suggested that a special day be set aside at the next meeting to discuss the details of this. Hydrogen 2000 - William Hoagland The first project of Hydrogen 2000 is a one hour documentary on the opportunity of hydrogen to beshown in the interest of public education. The crew has filmed in the United States, Canada, Europeand Japan. The project is receiving funding from three, possibly four, countries, the state ofCalifornia, municipal governments and about a dozen private organizations. The documentary willpremiere at the World Hydrogen Energy Conference in Stuttgart the night of June 24th, 1996. Hydrogen Program Budget - Neil Rossmeissl/JoAnn MillikenThe program was appropriated $14.5 million dollars in FY96. The long-term component is distributedamong the national labs and universities. The determination of funding allocations to the labs andto the individual projects is based on an annual peer review and the recommendations made by thereviewers. Research priorities in the hydrogen program include the core activities developing thelonger term technologies, followed by other programs in utilization, analysis and near-term industryprojects. Mr. Hoffman suggested that the National Research Council review the hydrogen programand evaluate where it has been and where it needs to go in the future. The funding level for the fuel cell program has been relatively constant over the past three years:63% allocated to systems development, 30% to R&D, with the remainder to supporting analysis and institutional assessment. The program is developing a fuel cell operating on reformed methanol withGeneral Motors. They have a direct hydrogen project involving Chrysler PentaStar, Allied Signal andAerospace. They are developing ten kilowatt fuel cell stacks led by Ford. Other subcontractsaddress the issues of hydrogen infrastructure and storage. The fuel cell program requested $40million for FY96 and is requesting $30 million for FY97. 1996 HTAP Budget - Catherine Gregoire Padr� The budget was steady in FY93 and FY94 and took a big increase in FY95 because of thepublication of the Green Hydrogen Report and the establishment of four new committees. In FY96the four committees continue to meet, and three panel members will be attending the Stuttgartmeeting and holding an international panel discussion. The program office did a large distributionof the Green Hydrogen Report and got requests for additional copies. HTAP information andactivities as well as the Green Hydrogen Report will be on the Internet. Dr. Hoffman stated that he is a strong supporter of hydrogen. He sees the program as long-termwith the priority of building a solid core program. The Office of Utility Technologies encourages anddemands that programs work with the private sector to expedite technology transfer. Hydrogenneeds to build a strong constituency that can effectively present its argument both to theAdministration and to the Hill. Hydrogen and its applications in the transportation and utility sectorscan represent major markets for the United States and this potential should be strongly emphasizedwhen making the case for hydrogen. The Olympic games in Atlanta this summer will be used as ashow case for hydrogen technologies. Savannah River is expected to have a hydrogen bus readyfor the event. Hydrogen Program Research Success Story - David Benson/David Haberman Mr. Benson has developed a fiber optic sensor to detect hydrogen leaks and has entered into acooperative agreement with AMERISEN. An overview of the technology was given by Benson,followed by a discussion of the marketing aspects of the project by Mr. Haberman. NHA Hydrogen Industry Perspective - C.E. (Sandy) Thomas Dr. Thomas presented a list of possible roles for the National Hydrogen including facilitator ofinformation, selecting projects for hydrogen, codes and standards, international representation, andrecommending hydrogen demonstration projects. The NHA will be putting together a five-yearindustrial hydrogen plan this year. They are working to establish a more viable relationship withDOE. Dr. Thomas suggested that HTAP and NHA collaborate on putting together the five-yearindustrial plan. HTAP will be invited to join the NHA industrial program workshops. Dr. Takahashisuggested that NHA write a vision statement which is more philosophical with a broader, longerrange. Tuesday, April 2, 1996 Hindenburg Story - Addison BainMr. Bain presented a status report on his investigation of the Hindenburg disaster to determinewhether it was caused by the hydrogen fuel onboard. Using pictures taken of the incident, heexplained that the fire was actually a result of the combustion of a combination of materials. He haspieces of the ship that are being analyzed in the micro-chemistry lab in NASA to determine if nitrouscellulose was used in the lacquer coating on the aluminum surfaces and also to determine if a blackcompound on the girder was used to provide a conductive bond. The entire investigation will bedocumented on video and will look at the peripheral issues of the incident. There will be a technicalreport and analysis of some of the theories. It will also be a document for the younger generation to uncover the truth of the story. Applications Committee Report - Mounir Kamal Dr. Kamal presented the panel with a report from the Applications Committee. The report assessesthe current state of technology for hydrogen-powered vehicle relative to competitive technologiesaccording to the following criteria: vehicle operating and driving range, refueling infrastructure, andthe specific power of propulsion system. The attributes were plotted with gasoline-powered vehiclesranking best on power, costs, range and infrastructure but falling short on efficiency of propulsion,emission and renewable fuel potential. Fuel cell vehicles are best in efficiency, emissions andrenewable fuel potential, but deficient in customer attributes. Electric vehicles are superior to fuelcells in infrastructure. Natural gas will probably be the transition fuel before hydrogen in nichemarket applications. Hydrogen s high score on societal attributes make it more suitable for nichemarkets such as government fleets and buses. The report clearly shows a need to recognize thathydrogen is superior on certain attributes while on other attributes, it is not competitive. Researchneeds to focus on those attributes in order for hydrogen to compete. Demonstration Committee - Alan Lloyd This committee met in Reno, Nevada in March and discussed various demonstration programs,funding agencies, and the appropriate goal for the committee. The recommendations included thesupport of regional demonstrations and linking various isolated demonstrations, the continuation of the demonstration of buses and heavy-duty vehicles, and working with FAA and NASA with hydrogenand aircraft. Sustainable Energy Centers - David Nahmias A questionnaire based on sustainable energy center concept resulted in strong support for theformation of regional hydrogen centers. A hydrogen center has been proposed in connection withthe Westinghouse Savannah River laboratory and ETEC - Rocketdyne Technology and EngineeringCenter. Recommendations include HTAP support of the formation of hydrogen centers andmonitoring activities without taking a lead role, the creation of centers that support demonstrationsprojects and commercialization activities, and centers of excellence that focus on basic R&D. Industry/Government Consortium - Addison Bain The concept of a hydrogen industry/government consortium was recommended in the GreenHydrogen Report. Dr. Lloyd cautioned against having the consortium driven by big industry to theexclusion of entrepreneurs. Dr. MacKenzie suggested that the mission and the objectives of analliance of this sort be made clear. Dr. Takahashi suggested that Mr. Bain and Dr. Lloyd write aposition paper on the subject and present it to HTAP. International Energy Agency - Catherine Gregoire Padr� The IEA Hydrogen Implementation Agreement Annex 11 dealing with integrated systems met inMarch to discuss the design and evaluation of potential hydrogen demonstrations. They will collectexperience and operating data on existing facilities in order to develop a design guideline tool. Subtask A will evaluate hydrogen energy systems that are at the pilot and demonstration scale. Subtask B will evaluate existing data using analysis tools. Subtask C is focused on the developmentof design guidelines. These will be established to allow future demonstrations to meet operating anduser requirements, and also to facilitate systematic integration. Public Comments Malcolm LaBar of General Atomics Company addressed the panel concerning the production ofhydrogen without the generation of CO2 through nuclear energy and the use of a thermal chemicalprocess. General Atomics is developing a gas turbine modular helium reactor that combines a melt-down proof reactor and advanced power conversion system using a gas turbine. Safety issues areresolved with ceramic coatings that have high temperature capability that result in the system beingable to tolerate very high temperatures without meltdown. The hydrocarbon and silicone carbidecoatings have life times in the depository environment to a million years. General Atomics isoperating with a higher efficiency cycle than any other system. Dr. Larry Berg of Ballard was successful in getting the California ZEV mandate changed to includefuel cells as a viable technology that will be included and considered as advanced technology underthe ZEV program. Dr. Berg urges that the hydrogen community move their visibility into the areaof those who are not informed but are in key decision-making positions. Mr. William Chesshire of Hydrogen Development Corporation spoke of politics as the world of peopleand that no one is going to make an economic investment without assurance of a return. The bestreassurance that they could have is a credible hydrogen system. There is a need and a market forpublic educational and informational products. Mr. Bob Miller of Air Products and Chemicals presented the panel with a technology being developedby Amoco Production Company for membrane materials that has demonstrated high oxygen fluxesfor the conversion of methane to synthesis gas. They are looking for a new low-cost means ofproducing, converting gas to liquids as well as producing hydrogen. ITM syngas may haveapplication to large-scale production of hydrogen as well as smaller scale because of the lowerthermal and energy efficiency of this technology. Lower-cost hydrogen will develop a new sourceof hydrogen for upgrading crude oils as they become low in quality. Mr. Paul Scott of Touchstone Technology addressed the importance of using hydrogen as the fuelin fuel cells. The need for diversity of fuels, the pollution problem, global warming, safety, andeventual lower cost of hydrogen are among the reasons for using hydrogen. HTAP Suggestions With direction from HTAP, Addison Bain will meet with NASA and FAA to see if there is a basis forcontinued support for the hydrogen-fueled aircraft issue and perhaps convince NASA to participatein HTAP activities. Mr. Rossmeissl suggested that HTAP write an annual synopsis report ofactivities and accomplishments that could be presented to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary. Committee reports will be incorporated into this final report. HTAP will review the draft five-plan. The next HTAP meeting will be held September 9-11, 1996 in Colorado. HTAP will work on theirconsensus of program scope. Mr. Hainsselin would like to see a continuation to push for the existingfuture market focus in future discussions. Mr. Lynch suggested that someone from a federal agencycome to give HTAP an Air Resources Board viewpoint. Dr. Lloyd will try to get someone from EPAas well. Dr. Takahashi thanked all of the participants and adjourned the proceedings at 2:50 p.m.WT02-B17-56IA059-000325-B001-103http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/femp/heatpumps.html 205.168.79.27 19970115003215 text/html 2059HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 00:32:18 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 19 Sep 1996 15:38:33 GMTContent-length: 1885 FEMP - Fort Sam Houston U.S. Department of Energy Ground Source Heat Pumps for Commercial Applications Overview Ground source heat pumps can provide an energy-efficient, cost-effective way to heat and coolFederal facilities. Through the use of a ground-coupling system, a conventional water-source heatpump design is transformed to a unique means of utilizing thermodynamic properties of earth andground water for efficient operation throughout the year in virtually any climate. The ground (or groundwater) serves as a heat source during winter operation and a heat sink for summer cooling. Manyvarieties in design are available, so the technology can be adapted to almost any site.

DOE is seeking private-sector led, cost-shared projects in research, development, and technology validation that include the integration of hydrogen technologies such as production, storage, transport, and end-use applications. The purpose of the solicitation is to assist the private sector in the development of integrated hydrogen systems for applications to near- and long-term markets. DOE encourages the submission of development plans for integrated systems related to long-term hydrogen energy markets, although DOE will consider applications for systems addressing near-term hydrogen 'niche' markets. In any case, all awardees will be required to participate in a Phase I effort prior to consideration by DOE for a subsequent award to participate in later phases. The anticipated progression of projects awarded under this solicitation will be: Phase I - - Feasibility Studies (the subject of this solicitation); Phase II -- Technology Development; Phase III -- Technology Validation; and Phase IV --Demonstration/Scale-Up. The applications should provide detailed information regarding Phase I efforts, butshould also include a sufficient description of anticipated efforts in follow-on Phases II through IV to provide an overall characterization of necessary steps to allow commercialization of the hydrogen technology/system at the conclusion of Phase IV. After the conclusion of the Phase I efforts by all awardees, DOE will evaluate the Phase I results and future plans of each awardee. Based upon technical, economic, and programmatic considerations, DOE may select awardees to participate in follow-on agreements without further competition. In Phase I, a cost-shared business and technical feasibility study will be undertaken which will result in the development of information necessary for follow-on applications in Phases II through IV. Applications submitted in response to this solicitation for Phase I should provide information including, but not limited to: a description of the proposed integrated system, including status of the individual component technologies; technology development requirements; anticipated market for the technology/system; energy efficiency; environmental impacts; economic performance; regulation, safety, and reliability issues; and capabilities, experience, and commitment of the proposer. In addition, the proposer will be required to report data using the HScan Planning Method. DOE will only consider awards to entities which are led by private-sector firms. The entity can include business partnerships, joint ventures, or other business relationships between such organizations as profit or nonprofit corporations, educational institutions, etc. All respondents must propose to cost-share at least 50% of the total Phase I project cost from non-Federal sources (cost share in subsequent phases will be negotiated subject to statutory guidelines). Awards under this solicitation will be cooperative agreements, with a term of up to 9 months for Phase I. Depending on the availability of Fiscal Year 1997 funding for the DOE Hydrogen Program, it is anticipated that total DOE funding available for the Phase I efforts will be approximately $1,000,000. Individual awards under this solicitation for Phase I will not exceed $150,000 of DOE funding. The solicitation will be issued in June 1996 and will contain detailed information on funding, cost sharing requirements, eligibility, application preparation, the HScan Planning Method, DOE proposal evaluation criteria, and the proposal selection process for awards.

Energy efficiency is a feature which often, but notalways, adds to the first-cost of a product. For many governmentagencies, limited budgets make it tempting to select a product with thelowest initial purchase price. Many government agencies in the U.S.have adopted policies that require consideration of the lowestlife-cycle cost, including not only purchase price but energy and otheroperating costs. Life-cycle costing is viewed as a sound businesspractice, and investments in energy-efficient products may offer a muchhigher return than most other uses of available funds. For someenergy-using equipment such as motors and air conditioners, energyoperating costs over the product's lifetime will represent many timesthe initial purchase price of the product. In some cases (for example,lighted exit signs) the payback from choosing a more efficient productcan be less than one year. This allows an agency to "finance" the addedpurchase cost for an efficient unit from its annual operating budget. For larger equipment such as chillers or boilers, financing of the addedcost of efficient features may be available as part of the purchaseloan, or on as part of an equipment lease from a supplier or contractor. In some cases, an "energy savings performance contract" can be used, toobtain third-party financing that is repaid (partly) through sharedenergy cost savings. Finally, some energy-efficient products maycost no more than less efficient models--especially if they arepurchased competitively, in large volumes. As energy-efficientelectronic ballasts for fluorescent lights are becoming more common inU.S. commercial buildings, their added cost has declined sharply. Arecent purchase of refrigerators for several thousand public housingunits in New York City found that a new model, 30% more efficient thanthose previously available, actually had a lower first-cost than theconventional model.

Proposed Rule Language Subpart D -- ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROVIDER VEHICLE ACQUISITION MANDATE I. Background The Alternative Fuel Provider Vehicle Acquisition Mandate is intended to covera broad range of alternative fuel providers in a flexible, workable programthat will allow for compliance in the most economical fashion possible. Theprogram allows alternative fuel providers flexibility in the acquisition of newalternative fuel vehicles via purchase, lease, or conversion, and in thegeographical placement of alternative fuel vehicles. It also provides aminimum of restrictions on how the alternative fueled vehicles are to beused. The program specifies the criteria for determining whether an alternative fuelprovider is covered and under what circumstances exemptions from the programwill be granted. Only those alternative fuel providers who are classified as"covered persons" are subject to the requirements of this proposed regulationand only that affiliate, division, or other business unit which issubstantially engaged in the alternative fuels business may be subject to theacquisition mandate requirements of the Act. Proposed [[section]]490.300 Purpose and scope. Proposed [[section]]490.300 defines the purpose and scope of part 490 SubpartD as implementing the statutory requirements of section 501 of the EnergyPolicy Act of 1992, which sets forth a mandate for those alternative fuelproviders, who are classified as covered persons, to acquire alternative fuelvehicles at an escalating percentage of their new vehicle acquisitions. Proposed [[section]]490.301 Definitions. Proposed [[section]]490.301 sets forth the definitions for part 490,Subpart D. Proposed [[section]]490.301 defines the term "alternative fuels business" asmeaning an activity undertaken to derive revenue from: (1) producing, storing,refining, processing, transporting, distributing, importing, or selling atwholesale or retail any alternative fuel other than electricity; or (2)generating, transmitting, importing, or selling at wholesale or retailelectricity. This definition tracks the language of section 501(a)(2). Proposed [[section]]490.301 provides definitions for the terms "affiliate,""division," and "business unit" which are used in section 501 of the Act andproposed [[section]][[section]]490.303 and 490.304. The first two aredictionary definitions. "Business unit" is defined to make clear the groupingof business activities must be similar in autonomy to affiliates anddivisions. Proposed [[section]]490.301 defines the term "normal requirements andpractices" as meaning the operating business practices and required conditionsunder which the principal business of the covered person operates. In arequest for an interpretive ruling or in a civil penalty proceeding, the burdenwould be on the fuel provider to show that actions to acquire alternative fuelvehicles and/or obtain alternative fuel are outside the normal practices of thecovered person's principal business. Proposed [[section]]490.301 defines the term "principal business" as meaningthe largest sales-related gross revenue producing activity. If an organizationderives a plurality of gross revenue from sales-related alternative fuelsactivity then the organization's principal business is alternative fuels. Asit is used above, plurality does not require that over 50 percent of anorganization's sales-related gross revenue be based on activities related toalternative fuels. Sales-related in this context means that the gross revenuedoes not come from investments such as corporate stocks. In determining whether an organization's principal business is alternativefuels, the important criterion to look at is what is the organization's singlelargest source of sales-related gross revenue. For example, if an organizationderives 35 percent of its sales-related gross revenue from alternative fuelsand the next largest single source of sales-related gross revenue comprises 25percent of the organization's gross revenue, the organization's principalbusiness is alternative fuels. Proposed [[section]]490.301 defines the term "substantially engaged" to meanthat a covered person, or affiliate, division, or other business unit thereof,regularly derives sales-related gross revenue from an alternative fuelsbusiness. To determine whether a covered person or affiliate, division, orother business unit thereof is "substantially engaged" in the alternative fuelsbusiness, it is important to look at the involvement the covered person,affiliate, division, or other business unit has with the alternative fuelsbusiness. Thus, only that affiliate, division, or business unit that meets thesubstantially engaged criteria, as defined above, is subject to the acquisitionrequirements of this program. The covered person is responsible for clearly defining the specific affiliate,division, or other business unit that is substantially engaged and is thereforesubject to the acquisition requirements of this rule. If this designation isnot made or is not made clearly, DOE will assume that the entire organizationis subject to the acquisition requirements of this rule and will enforce it assuch. Proposed [[section]]490.301 defines the term "substantial portion" to meanthat at least 2 percent of a covered person's refinery yield of petroleumproducts is composed of alternative fuels. Alternative fuel is as defined inproposed [[section]]490.2. This proposed definition was formulated usingreliable data compiled by the Energy Information Administration and publishedin its Petroleum Supply Annual 1993, Volume 1 (DOE/EIA-0340(93)/1). Table 19provides aggregate data on refinery yield for the Petroleum Administration forDefense districts and can be readily verified. The 2% threshold was chosen because it represents the average yield for theproduction of alternative fuel by petroleum refiners as reported by the EnergyInformation Administration. DOE believes that the use of this percentage inthe definition of "substantial portion" allows for the initial identificationof that group of covered persons described in Sec. 501(a)(2)(c) of the Act andprovides a sound basis for identifying those affiliates, divisions, or otherbusiness units of such covered persons which are substantially engaged in thealternative fuel business. The Department considered including some measure of the gross revenueattributed to the production of alternative fuels as an alternative in thedefinition of "substantial portion." The first measure that was considered wassetting a minimum level of gross revenue from the sale of alternative fuelsthat an organization would have to equal or exceed to be classified as analternative fuel provider. The second measure that was considered wasestablishing a minimum percentage, that reflects the percent of total grossrevenue attributed to the sale of alternative fuels, that an organization wouldhave to equal or exceed to be classified as an alternative fuel provider.Unfortunately, the information available on these measures is too fragmented tobe the basis for proposed regulatory language. DOE seeks comment on whetherreliable information exists that would allow establishment of a monetarymeasure (or any measure apart from the measure in the proposed rule) fordetermining whether alternative fuels production comprises a substantialportion of a company's business. DOE also seeks comment recommending any otheralternative definitions for "substantial portion." Proposed [[section]]490.302 Vehicle Acquisition Mandate Schedule Proposed [[section]]490.302 describes the vehicle acquisition schedule thatalternative fuel providers must comply with if they are classified as coveredpersons. Proposed paragraph (a) requires that of the new light duty motorvehicles acquired by alternative fuel providers, the following percentagesshall be alternative fueled vehicles for the following model years: (A) 30 percent for model year 1996. (B) 50 percent for model year 1997. (C) 70 percent for model year 1998. (D) 90 percent for model year 1999 and thereafter. For example, if an alternative fuel provider purchases or leases 50 light dutymotor vehicles in model year 1996, 30 percent, or 15, of the vehicles have tobe alternative fueled vehicles. Proposed paragraph (b) states that, except as provided by [[section]]490.304,these requirements apply to all new light duty vehicles acquired by a"covered person," not just those vehicles acquired for the fleets whichinitially qualified the alternative fuel provider as a "covered person." Theserequirements also apply regardless of where the new vehicles are to be located.For example, if an alternative fuel provider, which is a covered person, isacquiring new light duty motor vehicles for a location that is not in a subjectMSA or CMSA, the required percentage of these vehicles must be alternativefueled vehicles. The MSA/CMSA requirement is used for classifying "coveredpersons," not for determining how many light duty vehicles must be alternativefueled vehicles. The provisions of proposed [[section]]490.302(b) are notdiscretionary because they follow the wording of section 501(a)(1) of the Act.42 U.S.C. [[section]]13251(a)(1). Proposed paragraph (c) provides for rounding off to the next higher number ifapplication of a percent to the base number of new light duty vehicles acquiredresults in a requirement to acquire a fraction of a vehicle. This procedure isconsistent with the statutory objective of promoting the acquisition ofalternative fuel vehicles. Proposed paragraph (d) states that only acquisitions satisfying the mandate,as described in proposed [[section]]490.305, and/or Alternative Fueled Vehiclecredits will be counted toward compliance with the acquisition schedule inproposed paragraph (a). Proposed [[section]]490.303 Who must comply. Proposed [[section]]490.303 gives an answer to the question: who is a coveredperson that must comply? This proposed section tracks section 501(a)(2) of theAct. There are two components to this determination. The first componentinvolves determining whether the organization fits the profile of analternative fuel provider as provided by section 501(a)(2) of the Act. Thesecond component eliminates from coverage those alternative fuel providerswhose principal business uses alternative fuel to create a product that is notan alternative fuel. Types of companies likely to be covered persons subject to the alternativefuel providers mandate include, but are not limited to, private and publicelectric and natural gas utilities; natural gas distribution companies;pipeline companies; petroleum companies; propane producers, distributors, andsuppliers; methanol providers; ethanol providers; and fuel transportcompanies. Municipal utilities possessing the required fleet size, fuelingcharacteristics, and located within the specified geographical areas areclassified as alternative fuel providers under section 501(a)(2)(B).Therefore, they are expected to comply with the requirements of the mandateunder [[section]]490.302 and will not be subject to any future municipal fleetmandate imposed by rule under section 507 of the Act. If an organization produces, imports, or produces and imports in combination,an average of 50,000 barrels per day or more of petroleum, and regularlyderives gross revenue from the production of alternative fuels, thatorganization has a "substantial portion" of its business in alternative fuels.To determine whether an organization has a substantial portion of its businessin alternative fuels it is important to look at the organization's involvementin the alternative fuels business, not just the amount of gross revenue fromalternative fuels production or the level of investment in alternative fuelsproduction. DOE's determination of whether an organization has a substantialportion of its business in alternative fuels will be made on a case-by-casebasis. Comment is invited as to what criteria might be used in making thisdetermination. Paragraph (b) of proposed [[section]]490.303 deals with covered persons whoare excluded from having to comply with this subpart. This section tracks thelanguage of section 501(a)(3)(B) of the Act. Two types of covered persons maybe excluded from the requirements of this regulation: (1) those who transformalternative fuels into a product that is not an alternative fuel; and (2) thosewho consume alternative fuels as a feedstock or fuel in the manufacture of aproduct that is not an alternative fuel. An example of an excluded person described in paragraph (b)(1) would be amanufacturer of windshield washer fluid. The manufacturer would be classifiedas an excluded person because it blends an alternative fuel, methanol, inproducing windshield washer fluid, which is not an alternative fuel. An example of an excluded person described in paragraph (b)(2) would be acompany that burns natural gas to provide a heat source for a manufacturingoperation. An example of an excluded person under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b) (2) would bean entity whose principal business is the production of alcoholic beverages. Proposed [[section]]490.304 Which new light duty motor vehicles arecovered. Under section 501(a)(3)(A) of the Act, if the covered person has more than oneaffiliate, division, or other business unit, only the vehicles of an affiliate,division, or business unit that is "substantially engaged in the alternativefuels business" are subject to the vehicle acquisition mandate. Proposed[[section]]490.304 reflects the provisions of section 501(a)(3)(A), and shouldbe read in conjunction with the proposed definitions of "affiliate,""division," and "business unit" in [[section]]490.301. Proposed [[section]]490.305 Acquisitions satisfying the mandate. Proposed [[section]]490.305 deals with the three types of acquired vehiclesthat will count toward compliance with proposed [[section]]490.302, in additionto alternative fueled vehicle credits under Subpart F. These categoriesprovide flexibility for organizations in acquiring vehicles to meet thisregulation. An alternative fueled light duty motor vehicle shall be considerednewly acquired, regardless of model year, if: (a) The vehicle is an Original Equipment Manufacturer vehicle capable ofoperating on alternative fuels and was not previously under the control of thecovered person; or (b) The vehicle is an after-market converted vehicle and was not previouslyunder the control of the covered person; or (c) The vehicle is an Original Equipment Manufacturer vehicle that has beenconverted to operate on alternative fuels prior to the vehicle's first use inservice. A vehicle that meets the description of paragraph (a) is one that ismanufactured by an Original Equipment Manufacturer to be capable of operatingon alternative fuels. For example, if a covered person acquires a 1993flex-fuel light duty motor vehicle during model year 1996, this vehicle isclassified as being a new acquisition for that organization. A vehicle that meets the description of paragraph (b) is one that has beenconverted by a licensed converter to be capable of operating on alternativefuels. A vehicle that meets the description of paragraph (c) is a vehicle thatupon acquisition by the organization is taken to a licensed converter forconversion to an alternative fueled vehicle and is never intended to beoperated solely on petroleum-based fuel. It is important to note that section507(j) of the Act states that no fleet owner shall be required to acquireconverted vehicles in order to meet compliance with this or any fleetacquisition requirement. Proposed [[section]]490.306 Vehicle operation requirements. Proposed [[section]]490.306 largely tracks the provisions of section501(a)(4), which requires that all alternative fueled vehicles acquiredpursuant to section 501 be operated solely on alternative fuels, except whenthese vehicles are operating in an area where alternative fuel is notavailable. Proposed [[section]]490.307 Option for electric utilities. Proposed [[section]]490.307 deals with the statutory option for electricutilities. Proposed paragraph (a) tracks the provisions of section 501(c) ofthe Act, which provides that a covered person whose principal business isgenerating, transmitting, importing, or selling, at wholesale or retail,electricity has the option of delaying the alternative fuel vehicle acquisitionschedule in section 501(a) of the Act until January 1, 1998, if that coveredperson intends to comply with this regulation by acquiring electric motorvehicles. DOE considered delaying the date that electric utilities would haveto start acquiring vehicles until the beginning of model year 1999 which startson September 1, 1998. But given that the California Air Resources Boardrequires that 2 percent of all vehicles sold in California by major autoproducers be Zero Emission Vehicles, (emission level currently only achievableby electric vehicles) starting September 1, 1997, DOE decided not to propose adelay in the effective date of the 30 percent alternative fueled vehicleacquisition requirement. Also, the States of New York and Massachusetts haveenacted laws which adopt California standards and timetables. Proposed paragraph (b) provides the date (January 1, 1996) by whichnotification must be received by DOE for an electric utility to be eligible forthis delayed schedule. That date is dictated by section 501(c) of the Act.This notification should be in letter format and must explain the utility'scommitment to electric vehicles. Proposed paragraph (c) describes the acquisition schedule that an electricutility must comply with if the electric utility notifies the Secretary by therequired date. Proposed [[section]]490.308 Process for granting exemptions. Proposed [[section]]490.308 deals with the requirements of section 501(a)(5)of the Act which provides for a simple and reasonable exemption process forthose covered persons seeking exemptions either because alternative fuel is notavailable or alternative fueled vehicles are not reasonably available.Proposed paragraph (a) describes the procedure that a covered person needs tocomplete to receive an exemption. The first category of exemption is if anycovered person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary thatalternative fuels that meet the normal requirements and practices of theprincipal business of that person are not available in the area where thevehicles are to be operated. The second category of exemption is if anycovered person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary thatalternative fueled vehicles that meet the normal requirements and practices ofthe principal business of that person are not reasonably available foracquisition because they are not offered for acquisition commercially onreasonable terms and conditions in the United States. These exemptions wouldbe granted for one model year only. To receive exemptions for additional modelyears, alternative fuel providers must re-apply to the Secretary each year.Criteria for granting exemptions will be based on documentation thatspecifically relates to the availability of alternative fuels and alternativefueled vehicles. To determine whether alternative fuel is "not available," an alternative fuelprovider must map out the operating area and base of operations for its fleetof vehicles. Next it must locate on the map the alternative fueling facilitieswithin its MSA or CMSA. Then, for each vehicle, it must determine whether anylocation providing alternative fuel is in the area in which the vehicle isoperated. If there is any location providing alternative fuel within thevehicle's operating area, alternative fuel is available. If there are nolocations providing alternative fuel, for any alternative fuel thatmeets the normal requirements and practices of the covered person's principalbusiness, within the vehicle's operating area, then alternative fuel is "notavailable." The Act requires that the exemption process be reasonable and simple. DOEinvites comment on the proposed process for exemptions, in whole or in part. It is anticipated that alternative fuel will be available and accessible foralmost all alternative fuel providers, and that it will be difficult for fuelproviders to prove that alternative fuel is not available. Since alternativefuel providers stand to benefit greatly from the expanded use of alternativefuels and the proliferation of alternative fueled vehicles, it is alsoanticipated that they will help accelerate the establishment of the alternativefuels infrastructure and be less likely to seek exemptions based on alternativefuels being "not available." To receive an exemption based on the criteria in subparagraph (a)(2) a coveredperson must show that there are no alternative fueled vehicles available forcommercial acquisition on reasonable terms and conditions in any State. Thecovered person also must show good faith effort in attempting to obtain thesevehicles. DOE requests comment on the extent to which vehicle cost, eitherinitial cost or life-cycle cost, should be considered in determining whethervehicles are available on "reasonable terms." If a covered person normally and historically acquires vehicles from oneautomobile dealer or from one automobile manufacturer, but is unable to acquirealternative fueled vehicles of the model type needed from these same sources,this is not sufficient to qualify for an exemption under subparagraph (a)(2) ifappropriate alternative fueled vehicles are available from other dealers ormanufacturers. Having to use another dealer or manufacturer is not classifiedas outside the normal requirements and practices of the covered person, becausethe same procedures that are currently being employed by the covered person toobtain these vehicles can be used to obtain them from different sources. Having to wait slightly longer for delivery of alternative fueled vehiclesthan for conventionally fueled vehicles is not a sufficient reason for grantingan exemption. If, however, the time delay will result in a covered personviolating the regulation, DOE will consider the covered person to be incompliance with this regulation if the delivery delay was through no fault ofits own. Thus, if alternative fueled vehicles are ordered during the modelyear with expectations that they will be delivered by the end of the modelyear, but are not delivered until the next model year, the covered person willbe deemed to be in compliance if it can provide DOE with proof of order dateand anticipated delivery schedule. On the other hand, if a covered personorders alternative fueled vehicles and knows, at the time of the order, that itwill not be receiving these alternative fueled vehicles by the end of the modelyear, it will be deemed to be in noncompliance and no exemption will begranted. Additionally, in determining whether alternative fueled vehicles arereasonably available, a covered person must examine whether alternative fueledvehicles of the appropriate type are available in any alternative fuelconfiguration. Thus, the availability of the type of vehicle a covered personneeds that operates on the fuel that the covered person provides is not theappropriate test for determining whether alternative fueled vehicles are "notreasonably available." The test for determining whether alternative fueledvehicles are "not reasonably available" is whether there are alternative fueledvehicles available that operate on any alternative fuel and meet thenormal requirements and practices of the business, including the vehicleperformance requirements of the business. Proposed paragraph (b) sets forth the types of documentation in support ofexemption requests that should be provided to DOE. Proposed paragraph (e) states that exemption determinations are letter rulingsbinding for the covered person only and cannot be used to establish a precedentfor other exemption requests. DOE will review each exemption request on acase-by-case basis. In proposed paragraphs (f) and (g) DOE is proposing an administrative remedyfor those aggrieved by the initial decision of the DOE Deciding Official, whowill be the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Inorder to exhaust administrative remedies, it will be necessary to appeal toDOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals. This procedure has two virtues. Itwould be less expensive than pursuing a judicial remedy immediately. It wouldalso ensure that DOE has made a record which is appropriate for judicial reviewin the event a petition for review is filed in a Federal court. Proposed [[section]]490.309 Annual reporting requirements. Proposed [[section]]490.309 sets forth annual reporting requirements. Anannual report to verify regulation compliance is required of all alternativefuel providers. Proposed paragraph (a) sets forth where and by when annualreports should be sent. Proposed paragraph (b) describes the required information that would beincluded in this annual report. Most of the requirements are self-explanatory;however, several of them deserve discussion for clarification purposes. Proposed subparagraph (b)(2) would require covered persons to calculate thenumber of new light duty alternative fueled vehicles that they are required toacquire. To determine this number, a covered person would multiply the numberentered for proposed subparagraph (b)(1), by the acquisition percentage from[[section]]490.302 or [[section]]490.307 that applies for that model year. Forexample, in model year 1996, if the number of new light duty motor vehiclesacquired is 50, the number of new light duty vehicles that are required to beacquired is 30 percent of 50, or 15 (50 x .3 = 15). The number of new lightduty alternative fueled vehicles acquired, added to the number of alternativefueled vehicle credits applied, from proposed subparagraph (b)(5), should begreater than or equal to the number calculated for proposed subparagraph(b)(2). Proposed paragraph (c) sets forth the procedure that a covered person mustfollow if it is applying alternative fueled vehicle credits against itsacquisition requirements. Consistent with the requirements of 5 CFR Part 1320.6(f), proposed paragraph(d) would require that records related to this reporting requirement bemaintained and retained for a period of three years. DOE seeks comment on the reporting requirements, especially relating to theinformation that is requested to be included in the report. Return to Subpart D beginning Subpart F -- ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLE CREDIT PROGRAM Background Section 508 of the Act requires DOE to establish an alternative fueled vehiclecredit program that will allocate alternative fueled vehicle credits to a fleetor covered person that is required to acquire alternative fueled vehicles underTitle V of the Act if that fleet or covered person acquires alternative fueledvehicles in excess of the number that fleet or covered person is required toacquire or acquires alternative fueled vehicles prior to the date that fleet orcovered person is required to acquire alternative fueled vehicles. Analternative fueled vehicle credit may be used to comply with alternative fuelprovider or fleet program requirements in a later year, or may be traded orsold for use to another fleet or covered person who is required to acquiredalternative fueled vehicles by Part 490. The purpose of establishing a credit program is to provide purchasingflexibility for the regulated fleet operators without sacrificing the program'senergy security goals. The general concept is that some fleet operators may,at times, find it attractive to buy more alternative fueled vehicles thanrequired, if in doing so they can get credit against future acquisitionrequirements, or can sell or transfer the credits to another party. If thecredits program is properly implemented and managed, there will be no decreasein energy security compared to a program based strictly on compliance throughacquisitions. Both section 246(f) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7586(f)) and section 508of the Act (42 U.S.C. 13258) allow for awarding credits to entities thatinitiate clean fuel vehicle or alternative fueled vehicle programs sooner or ingreater numbers than required. But the laws differ in their goals: the goal ofthe Clean Air Act Amendments is to improve air quality while the goal of theAct is energy security. Thus, the credit programs and implementing regulationsemanating from these acts also have different goals and objectives. The EPA has a program called the Clean Fuel Fleet Credit Program (40 CFR[[section]] 88.304-94) that may be confused with the Department's AlternativeFueled Vehicle Credit program. In the Clean Fuel Fleet Credit program, a fleetowner obtains credits by implementing clean fuel vehicles earlier, in greaternumbers, or which meet more stringent emission standards than those establishedby EPA. Clean Fuel Fleet credits can also be obtained for Clean Fuel Vehiclepurchases in vehicle categories that are excluded from the Energy Policy Actdefinition of "fleet". These credits are awarded based on a formula thatcompares the clean fuel vehicle emissions with conventional vehicle emissions.By contrast, under section 508 of the Energy Policy Act, one credit isallocated for each alternative fueled vehicle acquired in excess of therequired number. Also, the Energy Policy allocates one credit for each yearthe alternative fueled vehicle is acquired before the required date. Another area of difference between the two statutes is where they allowcredits to be traded. Under the Clean Air Act, credit trading is onlyallowable within the same non-attainment area. For example, fleet operators inthe Baltimore non-attainment area can only buy, sell, or trade credits withother fleet operators in the Baltimore area. Congress appears to haveconcluded that it was not logical for non-attainment areas to trade creditswith other areas, because the air quality in the area where credits werepurchased and used would not be improved as a result of this transaction. Onthe other hand, the Energy Policy Act credits can be traded freely among thoseorganizations that are required to acquire alternative fueled vehicles, whichare located within the United States. However, there is an exception to thistrading provision, based upon the last sentence of section 508(d) of the Act,which provides that vehicles representing credits generated or transferred toalternative fuel providers operate solely on alternative fuel. (42 U.S.C.13258). This requirement is discussed under [[section]]490.506 of thisSupplementary Information. Because one of the major goals of the Act is thereduction of our Nation's foreign oil dependency, it makes little differencewhere in the United States this reduction takes place. Proposed [[section]]490.500 Purpose and scope. Proposed [[section]]490.500 defines the purpose and scope of part 490 subpartF as implementing the statutory requirements of Section 508 of the Act, whichinstructs the Secretary to allocate credits to fleets or covered persons thatacquire alternative fueled vehicles in excess of the number required, or obtainalternative fueled vehicles prior to the date when they are required to acquirealternative fueled vehicles. Proposed [[section]]490.501 Applicability. Proposed [[section]]490.501 deals with the applicability of the credit programto fleets and covered persons. Proposed [[section]]490.502 Creditable Actions. Proposed [[section]]490.502 describes the actions associated with allocationof alternative fueled vehicle credits by DOE. Proposed paragraphs (a) and (b)are consistent with the language of section 508(a) of the Act, which authorizesthe Secretary to allocate credits to fleets or covered persons that acquirealternative fueled vehicles in excess of the number they are required toacquire, or acquire alternative fueled vehicles in advance of the date they arerequired to. Once a fleet or covered person is required to acquire alternativefueled vehicles the only way credits can be generated is by exceeding theirrequired acquisition number. For example, an alternative fueled vehicleacquired in excess of the number required in model year 1996 cannot be claimedto be an early alternative fueled vehicle acquisition for model year 1999. Theexcess alternative fueled vehicle will generate 1 alternative fueled vehiclecredit only, not 3 credits because it was acquired 3 years in advance. Additionally, DOE is proposing that one credit be allocated for theacquisition of a light duty alternative fueled vehicle in a category listed inproposed [[section]]490.3, such as motor vehicles held for lease or rental tothe general public, law enforcement vehicles, etc. Section 508(b) provides thestatutory basis for this proposal because it refers to the allocation ofcredits for the acquisition of alternative fueled vehicles in excess of thenumber required. Therefore, the acquisition of light duty alternative fueledvehicles in the excluded categories constitutes the acquisition of alternativefueled vehicles in excess of the number required qualifies for the allocationof credits. Because these excluded vehicles are not required to be acquiredthey are not eligible to earn credits for early acquisition which results inmultiple credits. Thus, DOE is proposing that the acquisition of thesevehicles in excess of the required number will generate only one credit pervehicle. It is reasonable to expect that any requirements placed on alternative fueledvehicles which are acquired to comply with alternative fuel provider or fleetprogram requirements would also apply to vehicles that generate credits. Forexample, the Act requires that alternative fuel providers operate theiralternative fueled vehicles solely on alternative fuels except when operatingin an area where the appropriate alternative fuel is unavailable. A net lossto energy security goals would occur if a credit-generating vehicle, such as analternative fueled vehicle bought a year earlier than required by analternative fuel provider, did not also operate solely on alternative fuel.This requirement applies only to those alternative fueled vehicles thatgenerate credits to be used by covered persons who are alternative fuelproviders. The Department is unaware of any possible requirements which wouldapply to vehicles purchased to demonstrate compliance and not to vehiclespurchased for credits. Therefore, DOE is proposing that any such requirementsapply equally to both types of vehicles. The Department considered whether to allow the acquisition of medium duty andheavy duty alternative fueled vehicles (those alternative fueled vehicles withgross vehicle weight ratings of greater than 8,500 lbs.), by covered personsand fleets, to generate credits. Many medium duty and heavy duty vehicles arepredominantly urban use vehicles, such as transit buses and delivery trucks,and could take advantage of the anticipated fueling infrastructure within theseurban areas. These vehicles possess larger capacity engines, which consumesignificantly more fuel than light duty vehicles and result in increaseddisplacement of petroleum-based fuel. However, paragraph (b) of section 508provides that credits can only be allocated for the acquisition of the sametype of vehicles that are required under the fleet mandates of Title V of theAct. The only type of vehicles that are required to be acquired in Title V arelight duty vehicles. Thus, credits cannot be awarded for the acquisition ofmedium duty and heavy duty vehicles because the Act does not require any fleetor covered person to acquire them. Proposed [[section]]490.503 Credit allocation. Proposed [[section]]490.503 deals with alternative fueled vehicle creditallocation. Proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) are consistent with the languageof section 508(a) of the Act, which describes how credits are to be allocated.Before alternative fueled vehicle credits are allocated they must be appliedfor using the procedure described in proposed [[section]]490.507. Proposed paragraph (a) provides for the allocation of one credit for eachalternative fueled vehicle a fleet or covered person acquires that exceeds thenumber of alternative fueled vehicles that fleet or person is required toacquire. If a fleet or covered person is required to acquire 10 alternativefueled vehicles in a model year and they acquire 15 alternative fueledvehicles, they can apply for allocation of five alternative fueled vehiclecredits. Proposed paragraph (b) provides for the allocation of one credit peralternative fueled vehicle for each year the alternative fueled vehicle isacquired in advance of the date the fleet or covered person is required toacquire alternative fueled vehicles. These credits cannot be allocated untilthe date that a fleet is required to acquire alternative fueled vehicles.Thus, only covered persons and State fleets are presently eligible for creditallocation. Until such time as private and municipal fleets are required toacquire alternative fueled vehicles, they cannot be allotted credits for earlyacquisition. At that time, all alternative fueled vehicles acquired betweenOctober 24, 1992, and the start date of the private and municipal fleet mandatewould eligible for credit allocation. Proposed paragraph (c) provides for the allocation of credits to alternativefuel providers and State governments for alternative fueled vehicles acquiredfrom October 24, 1992, the date the Energy Policy Act was enacted. Credit allocation is best explained by the following examples. In the firstexample a covered person acquires 10 alternative fueled vehicles in model year1994 and 15 alternative fueled vehicles in model year 1995. Because thecovered person is not required to acquire alternative fueled vehicles untilmodel year 1996, each alternative fueled vehicle acquired in model year 1994will generate 2 credits and each alternative fueled vehicle acquired in modelyear 1995 will generate 1 credit. Thus, the covered person generates 35credits [(10 x 2) + (15 x 1) = 35], which can be used against futurealternative fueled vehicle acquisition requirements or can be traded. In the second example a state fleet acquires 50 alternative fueled vehicles inmodel year 1995 and 15 alternative fueled vehicles in excess of their requiredacquisition number in model year 1996. The state generates 50 credits foracquiring alternative fueled vehicles early and 15 credits for acquiringalternative fueled vehicles in excess of their required number. If the statedoesn't trade away or use any credits, it will have 65 credits that it can useagainst future acquisitions or can trade. A database will be established that will keep a record of credit allocations,trades and credit balances. Proposed [[section]]490.504 Use of alternative fueled vehicle credits. Consistent with the language of section 508(c) of the Act, proposed[[section]]490.504 states that a credit shall be treated as the acquisition ofa light duty alternative fueled vehicle. Each alternative fueled vehiclecredit will represent one light duty alternative fueled vehicle and can beapplied against the required alternative fueled vehicle acquisition number forone model year only, designated by a fleet or covered person, in lieu of theacquisition of a light duty alternative fueled vehicle during that modelyear. Proposed [[section]]490.505 Credit accounts. Proposed [[section]]490.505 deals with Alternative Fueled Vehicle Creditaccounts. Proposed paragraph (a) states that DOE will establish a creditaccount for each fleet or covered person who obtains an alternative fueledvehicle credit. Proposed paragraph (b) states that each fleet or covered person will receivean annual credit account balance statement after the receipt and recording ofits annual activity report. This statement will reflect the credit accountactivity that occurred in the previous model year and can be used as proof ofthe credit balance for an account. DOE is considering whether to provide updated credit account balancestatements to fleets and covered persons upon request during the year and isalso considering whether to charge a nominal fee for this service. Theseupdated credit account balance statements would provide written proof of afleet or covered person's credit account balance as of the date they areprinted. These updated credit account balance statements may be required of acredit seller by a credit purchaser before proceeding with the credit transfer.Thus, the credit seller can use this updated credit account balance statementto gain independent private benefit. The charging of a fee for this service is authorized under 31 U.S.C. 9701,which provides that each Federal government agency may establish a charge for aservice of a thing of value provided by the agency if this service results inindependent private benefit. This charge must be fair and based on the coststo the Government, the value of the service or thing to the recipient, publicpolicy or interest served, and other relevant facts. DOE asks for commentsrelated to the desirability of providing updated credit account balancestatements and what value a fleet or covered person would place on thisservice. Proposed [[section]]490.506 Alternative Fuel Vehicle credit transfers. Proposed [[section]]490.506 deals with the transfer of alternative fueledvehicle credits. Proposed paragraph (a)(1) states that any fleet may transferan alternative fueled vehicle credit to any other fleet, which is required toacquire alternative fueled vehicles. In contrast, proposed paragraph (a)(2)states that any fleet may transfer an alternative fueled vehicle credit to analternative fuel provider, who is a covered person, if the fleet providescertification to the covered person that the credit represents a vehicle thatoperates solely on alternative fuel. This restriction on the transfer ofcredits from a fleet to an alternative fuel provider, who is a covered person,is necessary because of the vehicle operational requirement placed onalternative fuel provider vehicles. 42 U.S.C. 13251(a)(4). Section 508(d) ofthe Energy Policy Act permits alternative fuel providers to use credits only ifthese operational requirements are met. 42 U.S.C. 13258(d). Proposed paragraph (c) states that proof of credit transfer should be providedto DOE within seven days of the transfer date, and provides for the use of aDOE form, or other written documentation containing the dated signatures of thetransferor and transferee. This provision allows for the maintenance andverification of credit transfer activity. Proposed Section 490.507 Credit activity reporting requirements. Proposed [[section]]490.507 describes the credit program's activity reportingrequirements. An annual report is required of all fleets or covered personswho have generated or traded alternative fueled vehicle credits to record andtrack their credit activity. Proposed paragraph (a) sets forth where and bywhen annual reports should be sent. Proposed paragraph (b) describes the required information that would beincluded in this annual report. Most of the requirements are self-explanatory,however, subparagraph (b)(4) deserves discussion for clarification purposes. Proposed subparagraph (b)(4) would only allow a fleet or covered person toreport either the number of alternative fueled vehicles acquired in excess ofacquisition requirements or the number of alternative fueled vehicles acquiredin advance of the start date of the acquisition requirements, not both of them.Once the first model year in which acquisition requirements apply has begun,credits can no longer be earned for early acquisition of alternative fueledvehicles. Return to Subpart F beginning Subpart G -- Investigations and Enforcement Proposed [[section]]490.601 Powers of the Secretary. Proposed [[section]]490.601 sets forth the powers of the Secretary providedspecifically by section 513 of the Act. Some of these powers (e.g., subpoenasfor witnesses or documents) can be used either in a investigative effort begunwith orders to show cause or in connection with a civil penalty proceeding. Proposed [[section]]490.602 Special orders. Proposed [[section]]490.602 tracks the provisions of section 505(b)(1) of theMotor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C.[[section]]2005(b)(1). Those provisions are applicable under part 490 becausesection 505(b)(1) is cross referenced in section 513 of the Act. Orders underthis section could be used to deal with a wide variety of circumstances. Oneexample would be the failure to submit a required report. Another would be anorder to show cause why civil penalty proceedings should not be initiated forfailure to comply with subparts C, D, or F. Proposed [[section]]490.603 Prohibited acts. This proposed regulation tracks the language of section 511 of the Act. 42U.S.C. [[section]]13261. Proposed [[section]]490.604 Penalties and fines. This proposed regulation follows section 512 of the Act. 42 U.S.C.[[section]]13262. The text reflects DOE conclusions with regard to which ofthe subsections of section 512 provide for civil penalties and which providefor criminal fines. Proposed [[section]]490.605 Statement of enforcement policy. In rare instances, DOE may initiate enforcement with the object of ensuringcompliance and deterring future violations. This proposed section indicatesthat DOE will not proceed with enforcement if there is a satisfactorycompliance agreement. Proposed [[section]]490.606 Proposed assessments and orders. This proposed section provides for issuance of proposed assessments of civilpenalty and an order to pay which become a final order for the Department ifthe recipient fails to appeal on a timely basis to the Office of Hearings andAppeals. Proposed [[section]]490.607 Appeals. This proposed section provides for administrative due process if the recipientof a proposed assessment and order to pay wishes to contest the basistherefore. The appeal must be filed in the Office of Hearings and Appeals onor before 30 days from the date of the issuance of a proposed assessment andorder. Most of the applicable procedures for the Office of Hearings andAppeals are in subpart H of 10 CFR part 205. In addition, paragraph (b) ofproposed [[section]]490.607 provides that the appellant has the ultimate burdenof persuasion which is appropriate because the appellant will in most caseshave unequal access to the relevant evidence (its own records). Paragraph (b)also provides that a trial-type hearing on contested issues of fact may occuronly if the hearing officer concludes that cross examination will materiallyassist in determining the facts in addition to the evidence available indocumentary form. There should not be extended hearings in order to fill therecord with evidence which is largely repetitious. III. Opportunity for Public Comment A. Participation in Rulemaking Interested persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking bysubmitting written data, views, or comments with respect to the subject setforth in this notice. The Department encourages the maximum level of publicparticipation possible in this rulemaking.

The Department also encourages interested persons toparticipate in the public hearings to be held at the times and places indicatedat the beginning of this notice. Comments relating to the energy security,environmental, or economic effects that might result from the adoption of theproposals contained in this notice are specifically invited and desired.Whenever applicable, full supporting rationale, data and detailed analysesshould also be submitted. B. Written Comment Procedures Written comments (eight copies) should be identified on the outside of theenvelope, and on the comments themselves, with the designation: "AlternativeFuel Provider Vehicle Acquisition Mandate and Alternative Fuel Vehicle CreditProgram, N0PR, Docket Number EE-RM-95-110" and must be received by the datespecified at the beginning of this notice. In the event any person wishing tosubmit a written comment cannot provide eight copies, alternative arrangementscan be made in advance by calling Andi Kasarsky at (202) 586-3012.Additionally, the Department would appreciate an electronic copy of thecomments to the extent possible. The Department is currently using WordPerfect5.1 for DOS. All comments received on or before the date specified at the beginning of thisnotice and other relevant information will be considered by DOE before finalaction is taken on the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be availablefor examination in the Rule Docket File in DOE's Freedom of Information ReadingRoom both before and after the closing date for comments. In addition, atranscript of the proceedings of the public hearings will be filed in thedocket. Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11 any person submitting informationor data that is believed to be confidential, and which may be exempt by lawfrom public disclosure, should submit one complete copy, as well as two copiesfrom which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. TheDepartment of Energy will make its own determination of any such claim andtreat it according to its determination. C. Public Hearing Procedures The time and place of the public hearings are indicated at the beginning ofthis notice. The Department invites any person who has an interest in theproposed regulation or who is a representative of a group or class of personswhich has an interest to make a request for an opportunity to make an oralpresentation at the hearing. Requests to speak should be sent to the addressor phone number indicated in the "ADDRESSES" section of this notice and bereceived by the time specified in the "DATES" section of this notice. The person making the request should briefly describe his or her interest inthe proceedings and, if appropriate, state why that person is a properrepresentative of the group or class of persons that has such an interest. Theperson also should provide a phone number where they may be reached during theday. Each person selected to speak at a public hearing will be notified as tothe approximate time that they will be speaking. They should bring ten copiesof their statement to the hearing. In the event any person wishing to testifycannot meet this requirement, alternative arrangements can be made in advancewith Andi Kasarsky, (202) 586-3012. The DOE reserves the right to select persons to be heard at the hearings, toschedule their presentations, and to establish procedures governing the conductof the hearing. The length of each presentation will be limited to tenminutes, or based on the number of persons requesting to speak. A Department official will be designated to preside at the hearing. Thehearing will not be a judicial or an evidentiary-type hearing, but will beconducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and Section 501 of the Department ofEnergy Organization Act. 42 U.S.C. 7191. At the conclusion of all initial oralstatements, each person will be given the opportunity to make a rebuttalstatement. The rebuttal statements will be given in the order in which theinitial statements were made. Any further procedural rules needed for the proper conduct of the hearing willbe announced by the Presiding Officer at the hearing. If DOE must cancel a hearing, DOE will make every effort to publish an advancenotice of such cancellation in the Federal Register. Notice ofcancellation will also be given to all persons scheduled to speak at thehearing. Hearing dates may be canceled in the event no public testimony hasbeen scheduled in advance. IV. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires thatregulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed forany substantial direct effect on states, on the relationship between theNational Government and the States, or in the distribution of power andresponsibilities among various levels of government. If there are substantialeffects, then the Executive Order requires a preparation of a federalismassessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating andimplementing policy action. This proposed rule establishes an Alternative Fueled Vehicle Credit Programunder which states may generate credits if they obtain alternative fueledvehicles in excess of their required quantity or if they obtain alternativefueled vehicles prior to the date when they are required and establishes amandate for state fleets to acquire alternative fuel vehicles. The allocationof credits is based on the measurable actions of obtaining alternative fueledvehicles and is available to fleets, that meet the requirements, throughout theUnited States. The granting of credits to states will be handled in the same manner as thegranting of credits to any other fleet operator. The enforcement of the statefleet mandate will be handled in the same manner as other mandate programs.States can also apply for a hardship exemption which would exempt them fromacquiring alternative fuel vehicles in any given year. The Department has determined that since states are treated the same as anyother fleet operator in the allocation of credits and in the administration andenforcement of the fleet mandate, the proposed rule will not have a substantialdirect effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions ofStates. In addition, the provision for hardship exemptions included in thestate fleet mandate precludes any possible violation in the authority that theFederal government has over States. Thus, preparation of a federalismassessment is therefore unnecessary. V. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certainrequirements in promulgating new regulations. These requirements, set forth insection 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needlessambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation providing clear andcertain legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promotingsimplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to makeevery reasonable efforts to ensure that the regulation describes anyadministrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review and anyprovisions for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies thatthe proposed rule meets the requirements of section 2(a) and (b)(2) ofExecutive Order 12778. VI. Review Under Executive Order 12866 This regulatory action has been determined to be a significant regulatoryaction under Executive order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, October 4,1993. Accordingly, today's action was subject to review under the ExecutiveOrder by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). DOEconcluded that the proposed rule would not result in (1) an annual effect onthe economy of $100 million or more or (2) have significant adverse effects oncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on theability of the United States-based enterprises to compete in domestic exportmarkets. OIRA requested that DOE prepare a cost analysis. In this section ofthe Supplementary Information, DOE describes the assumptions and mainconclusions of that cost analysis. A copy of that cost analysis is availablefor public inspection in the administrative record on file in DOE's Freedom ofInformation Reading Room. DOE has also placed in that file a copy of thenotice of proposed rulemaking as transmitted to OIRA, as well as exchanges ofcorrespondence between DOE and OIRA showing changes in the notice agreed to bythe two agencies. The cost analysis spans a 25-year time frame, from 1995 to 2020, whichincluded the incremental vehicle purchase cost and the cost differentialbetween alternative fuels and gasoline under five different scenarios. Theanalysis examines the effects the proposed rule will have on the acquisition ofalternative fueled vehicles by fuel providers and State fleets, exclusive ofthe effects of non-mandated acquisition of vehicles by these and other fleets.In doing so it assumes that no alternative fueled vehicles will be acquired bythese fleets prior to model year 1996. In actuality, these fleets currentlyare acquiring alternative fueled vehicles - either because of economics, Statelaws or business strategies - and will probably continue to do so in thefuture. This assumption focuses the analysis on the estimated costs to fuelproviders and State fleets in complying with the proposed regulation withoutdistorting it in any substantial way. Assumptions about the number of vehiclesacquired, the operating characteristics of those vehicles, fleet vehiclereplacement rates, current and future alternative fueled vehicle incrementalcosts, and current and future retail fuel costs were based on previous analysesundertaken by the Department. The costs to fuel providers and State fleets in complying with the proposedrule varies depending upon vehicle type, fuel type and fuel consumption, but inno case are the annual costs estimated to exceed $61 million per year. Moretypically, the estimated annual costs are approximately $25 million, decreasingto $10 million per year in later years. In reaching these conclusions, theDepartment took into account the fact that some alternative fuel providers maynot operate vehicles solely on the fuel they provide and may have to purchaseother alternative fuels at retail prices. Retail fuel prices for allalternative fuels were used in the analysis. These prices have three maincomponents: (1) the wholesale fuel cost; (2) the cost of transporting the fuelfrom production points to retail outlets; and (3) the retail outlet mark-ups. In one scenario, the annual costs to State fleets decreased to a point whereit is estimated that these fleets would incur savings as a result of complyingwith the proposed rule. This scenario assumes that the most popularalternative fueled vehicles will be flexible-fuel vehicles that can operate ongasoline and/or methanol. Because the proposed rule does not impose a fuel userequirement on State fleets, it is logical to assume that States will choose tooperate these vehicles on the fuel which costs less at a certain point in time;currently that fuel is gasoline. It is expected that the nominal incrementalcost for these vehicles, together with the fact that their operation andrefueling is identical to a gasoline-only version, should make them veryattractive to State fleet managers. The expected popularity of these vehicles,combined with estimates that show methanol prices falling below gasoline bymodel year 2001, result in annual cost savings to State fleets, starting withmodel year 2005, in the range of $400,000 to $1 million. In order to provide commenters with a better understanding of the effects ofthis proposal, the Department plans to make revisions and improvements to itsanalysis before the close of the comment period. To aid in this effort, theDepartment seeks comments on all aspects of its analysis. In particular, theDepartment is interested in comment on the following elements of the analysis:the retail and net-of-excise-tax future price projections for gasoline andalternative fuels; the assumption that alternative fueled vehicle purchases,that would result in apparent life-cycle cost savings, would not occur in theabsence of this rule; and the assumption that the cost per gallon of gasolinedisplaced falls as the amount of gasoline displaced increases. The Departmentwould also be interested in data that would aid in estimating the extrarefueling costs for "covered persons" whose fleets use fuels other than the onethey themselves provide, e.g., a natural gas pipeline company whose alternativefueled vehicles operate on methanol or ethanol. VII. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, was enactedby Congress to ensure that small entities do not face significant negativeeconomic impact as a result of Government regulations. In instances wheresignificant impacts are possible on a substantial number of entities, agenciesare required to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis. DOE has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significantnegative impact on a substantial number of small entities. To be covered bythis rulemaking, an organization must own, operate or control at least 50 lightduty motor vehicles, of which at least 20 light duty motor vehicles usedprimarily within a single MSA or CMSA must be capable of being centrallyfueled. An organization that fits this description is usually not a smallorganization, but one of medium size or larger. VIII. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act New information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., and recordkeeping requirements are proposed bythis rulemaking. Accordingly, this notice has been submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget for review and approval of paperwork requirements. Theinformation DOE proposes to collect as reporting requirements is necessary todetermine whether an organization is in compliance with the proposed regulationand whether they are eligible for the allocation of alternative fueled vehiclecredits. The frequency of the information collection is annually and is duefour months after the end of the compliance period. It is estimated the numberof organizations submitting reports will be approximately 1000 for the years1996 through 1999. The estimated number of organizations who will besubmitting reports after that date has not been determined and is subject tothe DOE decision on future rulemakings. The public reporting burden is estimated to average 12 hours per response,including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and retrieving thecollection of information. The collection of information contained in thisproposed rule is considered the least burdensome for the Department of Energyfunctions to comply with the legal requirements and achieve program objectives.However, comments are requested concerning the accuracy of the estimatedpaperwork reporting burden. IX. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act The provisions of this proposed rule would establish procedures for theimplementation of an Alternative Fuel Transportation Program to assist in andmonitor the progress of State fleet and certain alternative fuel providerscompliance activity. The proposed rule provides for reporting procedures todemonstrate compliance with the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition mandatesas specified by Title V of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and includes proposedprocedures for interpretive rulings, exemption, appeals, and the approvalprocess for State plans. The proposed rule would also establish and define the parameters for who mustcomply, the parts of a vehicle inventory which are affected by the acquisitionmandates, the allocation of credits for voluntary acquisitions, theinvestigation and enforcement in the assessment of civil penalties, and thecontents of a State's light duty alternative fueled vehicle plan. Because ofthe foregoing non-procedural parts of the proposed rule, the Department hasdetermined that preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) is appropriate.The Department will complete the EA and any further analysis found to berequired prior to the issuance of a final rule. X. Impact on State Governments Section 1(b)(9) of Executive Order 12866 ("Regulatory Planning and Review"), 58FR 51735 (September 30, 1993) established the following principle for agenciesto follow in rulemakings: "Wherever feasible, agencies shall seek views ofappropriate State, local, and tribal officials before imposing regulatoryrequirements that might significantly or uniquely affect those governmentalentities. Each agency shall assess the effects of Federal regulations onState, local, and tribal governments, including specifically the availabilityof resources to carry out those mandates, and seek to minimize those burdensthat uniquely or significantly affect such governmental entities, consistentwith achieving regulatory objectives. In addition, agencies shall seek toharmonize Federal regulatory actions with regulated state, local and tribalregulatory and other governmental functions." Executive Order 12875("Enhancing Intergovernmental Partnership"), 58 FR 58093 (October 26, 1993)provides for reduction or mitigation, to the extent allowed by law, of theburden on State, local, and tribal governments of unfunded Federal mandates notrequired by statute. Section 507(o) of the Act explicitly prescribes the alternative fueled vehicleacquisition mandate which is reflected in subpart C of today's proposedregulations, but does not specifically authorize appropriation of funds todefray the costs of compliance. However, it is important to observe that theeffect of the mandate is mitigated in terms of its impacts and costs in anumber of respects. First, section 507(o) authorizes approval of acceptable alternative State plansto comply with the acquisition mandate by enlisting the voluntary commitmentsfrom other fleet operators with fleets that are not subject to vehicleacquisition requirements under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Second, section507(i) authorizes the Department to grant exemptions from vehicle acquisitionrequirements for States in cases of financial hardship. Third, Congress hasauthorized and appropriated some fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 fundsfor financial assistance to State alternative fuel transportation programs someof which may include plans to fund the incremental costs of acquiringalternative fueled vehicles. Section 409 of the Act specifically authorizesfinancial assistance to States for this purpose. However, the funds, even ifexclusively used to pay for such incremental costs, may not be sufficient tofund all such costs incurred by each State annually. The Department preliminarily estimates that, in the aggregate, the costs toStates in model year 1996 will be between $3.3 million and $7.4 million. Theannual aggregate costs should never exceed $13 million in FY 1995 dollars. Acopy of the analysis which includes these figures is in the public file in theDOE Freedom of Information Reading Room and is available upon request from theinformation contact identified at the outset of this notice. The Departmentdoes not have estimates for each State. The Department would welcome commentsfrom State financial officials knowledgeable about near term State plans forreplacing existing vehicles so that DOE can refine its estimates of incrementalcosts attributable solely to the section 507(o) mandate. In developing today's notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department consultedwith a focus group of State officials from the National Association of StateEnergy Officials which represents energy offices in 53 States, territories andthe District of Columbia. The principal concern expressed by some of theseofficials was conflict between the DOE program and similar programs operatingunder EPA or State regulations. With respect to EPA, DOE has attempted toavoid unnecessary differences between its proposed regulations and thosealready promulgated by EPA. When asked for comments on a draft of today'snotice, EPA did not suggest any changes to eliminate or mitigate unnecessarydifferences. Earlier in this notice, DOE noted that the overlap between the proposedregulations and the EPA regulations is limited because the DOE program wouldapply in MSAs and CMSAs with a 1980 Bureau of Census population of 250,000 ormore and the EPA program applies only in non-attainment areas. EPA haspublished a table, 59 FR 50043, listing the 22 non-attainment areas as follows: States and Areas Affected by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program Affected area State(s) 1. Atlanta Georgia 2. Baltimore Maryland 3. Baton Rouge Louisiana 4. Beaumont-Port Arthur Texas 5. Boston-Lawrence-Worcester (Eastern Massachusetts) Massachusetts, New Hampshire 6.

San Joaquin Valley California 19. Southeast Desert Modified AQMA California 20. Springfield (Western Massachusetts) Massachusetts 21. Ventura County California 22. Washington (District of Columbia) Maryland, Virginia As indicated above, 11 of these 22 areas have applications to opt out of theEPA Clean Fuel Fleet Program which are still pending as of the date ofpublication of this notice. With respect to the State programs, DOE is unaware of any that would be inconflict with the program proposed today. If DOE has overlooked any suchconflicts, State officials are invited to submit comments explaining theconflicts.

Heben, Principal Investigator, National Renewable Energy Laboratory This work investigates new hydrogen storage options that could be significant improvements over currently available technologies. The current focus is on hydrogen adsorption in the recently discovered family of materials known as carbon nanotubes. These tiny tube-like configurations made of carbon have large surface areas in comparison to their volume, which allows more hydrogen to adsorb onto the structure. They also pack together easily for more efficient hydrogen storage and transport. In previous studies, the properties of carbon storage materials (e.g., surface area, pore size and distribution, micropore volume, heat of adsorption) were measured but not controlled. A key goal of this work is to identify the optimal dimensions and other properties at which the carbon nanotubes adsorb the most hydrogen and then synthesize the nanotubes in large amounts at low cost. Recent Advances: We performed a detailed analysis by atomic force microscopy andtransmission electron microscopy to assess the amount of single-wallcarbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in the arc-generated soots produced inour lab. In essence, SWNTs were found at a 0.05 wt % level in arc-generated soots. This result allowed us to determine theamount of hydrogen stored in the 285 K temperature-programmeddesorption peak observed for SWNT materials to be ~ 10 wt % onan SWNT weight basis. The SWNT materials will become a viablehydrogen storage technology only if they can be fabricated inhigh yields cost effectively. The demonstration on 50% conversionof evaporated carbon into SWNTs at Rice University is an encouragingsign that high-yield, cost-effective production may be possible. We have begun to evaluate the performance of Rice's samples inhydrogen storage. We performed experiments at NREL's High-Flux Solar Furnace designedto explore the feasibility of producing SWNTs with concentratedsunlight. We developed two new methods for fabricating Co-dopedcarbon targets for use in these experiments. The first methodinvolved vapor transport of Co2(CO)8 into degassed graphite powder, followed by subsequent heating to 510°C in vacuum to drive the thermal decomposition ofCo2(CO)8. The second method employedrefluxing a mixture of Co2(CO)8, toluene, and graphite powder to produce Co2(CO)8-doped graphite. The solvent was then stripped, and the Co2(CO)8was thermally decomposed under vacuum. Transmissionelectron microscopy did not indicate the presence of cobalt nanoparticlesin either of the powders. However, electron probe microanalysisperformed on pellets pressed from the powders at 12,500 psi indicatedCo contents of 0.83 and 0.39 at % with the refluxing and vaportransport methods, respectively. These results indicate thatcobalt that had been introduced by the doping methods was in ahighly divided form with particle sizes less 1 nm. The targets were mounted on a graphite block and positioned ina reactor designed for C60 production. The reaction chamber wasevacuated and purged several times with argon before each run. A 3 L/min Ar flow rate was established to keep the concentratingoptics free of carbon and avoid overheating of the reactor. Thesamples were exposed to solar fluxes of ~ 14 kSuns for 7 minutestotal. Fibrous webbing formed inside the reactor in each of theruns. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the webbing consistedof bundles of SWNTs that were 10-20 SWNTs across. Spongy depositson the graphite support block were found to contain SWNTs. Sootdeposited in the bottom of the reactor also contained SWNTs invery low yield. We believe the SWNT yield is limited by the lackof a suitable annealing zone for the carbon fragments producedby the solar beam. Rapid quenching of the carbon vapor causedby the required argon flow and a small hot zone preclude the formationof equilibrium structures like SWNTs. A next-generation reactorwill address these issues; the goal is to generate SWNTs in highyield in a cost-effective manner.WT02-B17-92IA060-000333-B044-240http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/duelbed.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052901 text/html 3817HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:28:59 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:21 GMTContent-length: 3643 Hydrogen INfoNet Solar Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production from Water Using a Dual-Bed Photosystem; Clovis Linkous, Principal Investigator, Florida Solar Energy Center In this work, photocatalytic particles are arranged in a dual-bed configuration to decompose water into its hydrogen and oxygen components using solar energy. The experimental system would consist of two modules, each with a shallow, flat, sealed container in which micron-sized photocatalytic particles are immobilized. An aqueous solution would then be pumped between the two beds. Different photoparticles and catalysts would be used in the two modules to accommodate two different processes: oxidative water-splitting to produce oxygen gas, and reductive water-splitting to produce hydrogen. This is a direct photoconversion scheme that breaks down the energy requirements for water decomposition into a two-photon process and enables hydrogen and oxygen to be produced separately. Several different n-type and p-type semiconductors will be used as photoparticles in the oxygen- and hydrogen-producing beds, respectively. Different catalysts also will be evaluated to help promote the reactions. On the microscopic level, there are many ways to configure the catalysts and photoparticles in the beds, and tests will be done to find the best configuration. We will also try to determine whether the particles should be immobilized on an electronically conducting or insulating surface. Theoretical calculations of hydrogen production rates that include the energy band structure of free and immobilized particles are expected to provide guidance as to how the microstructure of the particles should be configured. Recent Advances: Photocatalytic compounds in particulate form are being employedin a dual-bed configuration to effect the solar-driven decompositionof water to its constituent elements, particularly hydrogen. The system advantages are low manufacturing cost, safe evolutionof H2 and O2 in separate vessels, and more efficient use of thesolar spectrum. Having tested numerous redox couples againstInP and TiO2, we may have found two redox couples that can effectO2-evolution in one system and H2-evolution in the other. Theyare iodide/iodate (T/IO3) and bromide/bromate (Br/BrO3). Theseare intrinsically alkaline systems, since they will conproportionateat neutral pH and below to form the respective halogen gases: XO3 + 5X + 6H+ = 3X2 + 3H2OX = I, Br The characteristics of these two mediators exemplify what is desiredin a redox mediator. High solubility, rapid charge transfer kinetics,optical transparency for both oxidized and reduced forms, andintermediate redox potential. The oxidized form (Ox) of the mediatorwas run against TiO2, while the reduced form (Red) was run againstInP. Now we are testing a more realistic situation, where H2-evolutionwill need to proceed against some background concentration ofOx, and O2-evolution will need to proceed against some backgroundconcentration of Red. Development is under way of methods formonitoring reaction progress via the mediator instead of H2 orO2 gas evolution.WT02-B17-93IA060-000328-B022-298http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/prjsumm.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115030053 text/html 861HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 03:00:56 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:26 GMTContent-length: 688 Hydrogen InfoNet Project Summaries The DOE Hydrogen Program is organized around three major areas of research and development: Technology Development and Validation, Analysis, and Proof-of-Concept.

In order for hydrogen to gain commercial acceptance, in niche markets and in the national energy mix, hydrogen energy systems must compare favorably on an economic, efficiency, and environmental basis with competing energy carriers and systems. The goal of analysis is to provide direction and support to the DOE Hydrogen Program by evaluating the technical and economic benefits and drawbacks of various hydrogen production, storage, transport, and use technologies. The economic competitiveness of a new technology can be assessed by comparing its estimated costs to the costs of technologies that are currently being used. This provides a basis for determining which technologies have the best potential for near-, mid-, and long-term success in the marketplace.

Researchers are working to increase the amount of hydrogen that can be stored in a given volume, reduce storage costs, and improve the compatibility of hydrogen storage systems with available and emerging hydrogen use technologies. Possible approaches to hydrogen storage include physical storage via compression or liquefaction, chemical storage in hydrogen carriers such as methanol or ammonia, metal hydrides, and gas-on-solid adsorption. Each of these storage methods holds some promise, but none satisfies all the DOE criteria for efficiency, energy and volumetric density, low cost, and safety.

New, high-strength glass microspheres (essentially, tiny bubbles) can be filled with high-pressure hydrogen for convenient bulk storage and transport. The walls of these microspheres, which can be 25 to 500 microns in diameter, are about 1 micron thick. We can fill them with hydrogen by first immersing them in a high-pressure bath of hydrogen and then raising the temperature of the glass to 200-400 C. At this elevated temperature, the glass becomes highly permeable to hydrogen and the spheres fill up. Cooling the microspheres to room temperature traps the hydrogen in them. The glass microspheres then become safe, cost-effective carriers for the hydrogen. Heating the microspheres again releases the hydrogen in them. Commercially produced microspheres for hydrogen storage were first studied in the late 1970s. These microspheres usually had defects that limited the hoop stress at failure to 50,000 psi. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed a method for producing much stronger, defect-free microspheres. These engineered microspheres have a hoop stress at failure of about 150,000 psi, permitting a threefold increase in the pressure limit for the engineered microspheres. Engineered microspheres could make the storage and transport of large amounts of hydrogen much more efficient. An analysis indicates that hydrogen in glass microspheres that is transported by rail can be economically competitive with liquid hydrogen. Recent Advances: The design for the pressurized, heated test system is complete. Hydrogen will be provided at pressures up to 8500 psi into atemperature-controlled chamber. Temperatures can be controlledfrom 20°C to 350°C. Hydrogen will be provided froma prepressurized cylinder rated for 30,000 psi operation. A preheatervolume and valve will permit the sequential process of heatingthe spheres in the absence of high-pressure hydrogen, and thenexposing them to the preheated high-pressure hydrogen. This will,for the first time, permit an accurate measurement of the hydrogenuptake rates by the spheres for a given temperature. Microsphere bed loading will be accomplished by exposing heatedmicrospheres to heated hydrogen. The increased permeability ofthe glass permits rapid loading of the spheres to the externalpressure. When the temperature is reduced to room temperature,the permeability decrease "traps" the hydrogen in thespheres.WT02-B17-104IA060-000330-B034-130http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hydride.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115050745 text/html 3641HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:07:48 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wed, 21 Aug 1996 21:37:11 GMTContent-length: 3467 Hydrogen Infonet Hydride Development; George J. Thomas, Principal Investigator, Sandia National Laboratories Certain metals are able to adsorb and retain hydrogen under specific temperature and pressure conditions and then release the gas under different conditions. These metal hydrides have some advantages over high-pressure or low-temperature techniques for storing hydrogen. They have very high volumetric density, are relatively safe, and do not require cooling or monitoring. In addition, they have already been used in vehicles. A major disadvantage of hydrides, particularly for transportation, is their relatively low weight density (that is, the weight of the hydrogen in comparison to the total weight of the system). The purpose of this research is to investigate and improve the hydrogen storage properties of lightweight hydrides. Many previous studies of hydride technology have focused on magnesium compounds. However, these studies often involved very high temperatures that significantly changed the microstructure of the compounds being measured, giving inaccurate results. Our approach in studying magnesium-based hydrides is to modify the surface to allow measurements to be made at lower temperatures (&lt300ºC); add different alloys to see which ones result in a more stable compound (notably, Mg2Ni and MgAlNi); and study the microstructure throughout the process to ensure that measurements are accurate. Recent Advances: The Hydride Properties Database The Hydride Properties Database is now available on the World Wide Web. Funded by theU.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Program in support of the International Energy AgencyAnnex 12 project on metal hydrides, this free database is the first of four databases that willeventually make up Sandia National Laboratories' on-line Hydrogen Information Center. TheHydride Properties Database was created to make basic property data available to those interested in utilizing hydrides or beginning research in this area. Structured to allow on-line searches, the database includes numerous hydriding elements, alloys, and intermetallic compounds. Properties covered include tabulations of basic pressure, composition, and temperature (PCT) data. Values of enthalpy and entropy changes are included, allowing users to calculate PCT thermodynamic conditions. Also included are metallurgy and synthesis, activation, kinetics, cyclic stability, morphology, and gas impurity effects. Commercial suppliers, applications, and references for further reading are also part of the database. A novel bed immobilization method was devised using a microporouspolymer. This method does not add significantly to the hydridebed weight and should be effective in the management of materialredistribution and heat flow within the bed. Our initial resultsindicated no adverse interaction between the polymer and the hydridealloy. We found no problems during activation, and thereare indications of faster hydrogen loading. With some optimizationof pore sizes and material density, a measurable improvement insystem kinetics may be achievable. A patent disclosure was submittedfor the process.

As a result, these complexes desorb the bonded hydrogen under mild conditions (i.e., there is no need to use extreme temperatures or pressures when recovering the hydrogen for use). In this work, we are attempting to produce new nonclassical polyhydride complexes that contain large amounts of available hydrogen. We have already demonstrated that the hydrogen-release characteristics of these complexes can be fine-tuned by making small changes in the composition of the complex. Recent Advances: Reversible dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to toluene in the presence of platinum group metals has long been considered as a potential hydrogen storage system. But because the dehydrogenation occurs at high temperatures (300F,186C), these systems had been precluded from practical consideration. We have found, however, that polyhydride complexes and their precursors catalyze the reversible dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes under mild conditions. Thus it appears that a cyclic system is available.

Handrock, Principal Investigator, Sandia National Laboratories In this work, we are developing a lightweight hydride storage system that integrates hydride bed and vehicle operating characteristics. Initially, researchers at SNL are designing, building, and demonstrating a hydrogen storage system that uses a lightweight hydride, and then integrating this system with high-efficiency engines. Previous engineering demonstrations of hydride storage for vehicles used hydride materials that required low temperatures but were very heavy. Because the additional weight affects the range and performance of the vehicles, it is a major obstacle to the use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel. We are investigating improvements in hydride properties that will make it feasible to use lightweight hydrides in vehicles. Recent Advances: A paper was presented at the 7th Annual National Hydrogen Associationmeeting in Alexandria, Virginia, on the "Design and Developmentof Hydrogen Storage and Delivery Systems." Analytical modelingactivities in the areas of lightweight hydride utilization forhigh-efficiency lean-burn internal combustion engines and low-temperaturehydride utilization for fuel-cell powered vehicles were the primaryareas discussed. An analytical model of the Palm Desert demonstration vehicle hydrogenhydride/fuel cell storage and delivery system is being developed. The model is based on the linking of energy and mass balancemodules of individual system components. These modules will allowperformance characteristics of the vehicles to be evaluated undera variety of operating conditions. To date, modules have beendeveloped for the hydride bed, recirculation tank, circulationpump, heat exchangers, air blower, battery, parasitic loads, andpower logic controller. Work currently focuses on developmentof a fuel cell module. On completion of this work, the individualmodules will be linked together, allowing calibration of the model. Schatz Energy Research Center (SERC) provided Sandia with fuelcell heat generation data from both dynamometer and road testsimulations. This information will be used for initial modelcalibration. After that, Sandia will collaborate with SERC todetermine which additional test data and model refinements areneeded to complete the model calibration. Construction of the hydrogen gas handling system for the HydrideBed Experimental Test and Evaluation Facility was completed. The first version of acquisition software for the system, basedon LabView®, was also completed. The design of the systemwas determined primarily by the requirements of providing a simulationfacility for testing metal hydride beds for use in the Palm DesertVehicle Program. Leak checking of all system components is underway, and initial testing of the entire system (gas handling +acquisition) has started. Bed testing, using a 200-L capacity,commercially available bed, will begin when leak checking isfinished.

Our previous research suggests that renewable hydrogen could become competitive for use in efficient, low-polluting systems (such as fuel cells), beginning in the early part of the next century. In assessing alternative pathways for producing and using hydrogen, we considered the entire energy system. We estimated the cost and performance of hydrogen production systems, the cost of delivering hydrogen for various end uses, the cost and performance of hydrogen end-use equipment, the consumer's life-cycle cost of energy services, environmental effects, resource constraints, and infrastructure issues. Our recent work has focused on three major tasks: assessing near-term options for supplying hydrogen transportation fuel from natural gas; assessing the feasibility of using the existing natural gas infrastructure to supply hydrogen and hydrogen blends; and studying fuel cells for residential cogeneration applications, a market that might have less stringent cost requirements than the transportation sector. In addition, we are assessing potential markets for hydrogen in Southern California. Our results suggest that, even at projected market entry costs of $2000/kW, fuel-cell systems may be cost effective for cogenerating residential hot water and electricity in remote locations where access to a power grid is inconvenient or expensive, or both. For other locations, fuel-cell cogenerated power will become more attractive as system costs are reduced, lifetimes are extended, and low-cost hydrogen becomes more available. Recent Advances: One of the key challenges in developing hydrogen as a transportationfuel is the current lack of infrastructure. In this study, weassess various near-term possibilities for producing and deliveringgaseous hydrogen transportation fuel, including (1) hydrogen producedfrom natural gas in a large, centralized steam reforming plant,and truck-delivered as a liquid to refueling stations; (2) hydrogenproduced in a large, centralized steam reforming plant, and deliveredvia small-scale hydrogen gas pipeline to refueling stations; (3)hydrogen produced at the refueling station via small-scale steamreforming of natural gas; and (4) hydrogen produced via small-scaleelectroylsis at the refueling station. Small-scale reforming of natural gas could be an important technologyin the early stages of a hydrogen economy. We assessed the technicaloptions for low-cost small-scale production of hydrogen from naturalgas, considering (1) steam reforming, (b) partial oxidation, and(c) autothermal reforming. Although small-scale steam reformersare commercially available today, relatively few small units (lessthan 1 million scf/day) have been constructed. Fuel cell manufacturersare developing advanced designs which are more compact and offerhigher efficiencies for coupling with fuel cells. Small-scalepartial oxidation systems and autothermal systems are also underdevelopment. We assessed the cost, performance, and emissionscharacteristics of commercially available steam reforming unitsand explored the potential for improving performance and reducingcost. We also assessed the potential impact of improved reformertechnology on the delivered cost of hydrogen transportation fuel. We are conducting a case study of how hydrogen markets might developin Southern California over the next five years. It is likelythat fleets of hydrogen vehicles will be introduced in Californiain the early part of the next century, in response to the zeroemissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate. Other possible uses of hydrogenenergy in this time frame include co-firing and fuel cells. Weare estimating the size of these potential hydrogen markets. This work is being carried out with input from Southern CaliforniaGas Company, the South Coast Air Quality Management District,and industrial hydrogen suppliers. We are also comparing hydrogen to other fuels for fuel cell vehicles,such as methanol and hydrocarbon fuels derived from crude oil. We are interacting with fuel cell manufacturers and with automotivecompanies (including Ford, Chrysler, and GM and their subcontractors)which are considering fuel cell vehicle demonstrations as partof the DOE/OTT and PNGV programs. We also interact with groupsat Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories that are studyingfuel cell vehicle systems, as well as other academic groups (UCDavis, U of Michigan, Georgetown U). We are evaluating the projectedperformance, cost and emissions characteristics of alternativefuel cell vehicles with (a) compressed gas hydrogen storage; (b)onboard reforming of methanol; and (c) onboard partial oxidationof hydrocarbon fuels derived from crude oil. Although considerablemodeling work has been done on hydrogen and methanol fuel cellvehicles, there is little published data on vehicles where hydrogenis produced onboard via partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuelsderived from crude oil. We are concentrating on understandingthe issues for this alternative. We are assessing near-term options for producing and delivering gaseous hydrogen transportation fuel to users in Southern California. We found that a considerable amount of hydrogen would be availablein the LA Basin from existing industrial gas supplies and fromrefinery excess hydrogen. Fleets of perhaps 50,000 to 100,000fuel cell cards or 1000-2000 PEM fuel cell buses might be fueledwithout building new hydrogen production capacity. Once demandfor hydrogen exceeded this level, on-site production via small-scalesteam reforming or electrolysis would allow the addition of hydrogenproduction capacity in small increments, without building a newhydrogen pipeline system. In the long term, for large, geographicallyconcentrated demands, pipeline distribution might ultimately yieldthe lowest delivered fuel cost.WT02-B17-108IA060-000330-B035-84http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hstatus.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115051250 text/html 3214HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:12:46 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:24 GMTContent-length: 3040 Hydrogen InfoNet Renewable Energy Production and Integrated Storage; J. Ianucci, Principal Investigator, Distributed Utility Associates In this project, we show the technical potential for hydrogenused as an energy storage medium to couple time-dependent renewableenergy into time-dependent electric utility loads. This technicalanalysis will provide estimates of regional and national opportunitiesfor hydrogen production, storage, and conversion, based on currentand near-term leading renewable energy and hydrogen productionand storage technologies. Appropriate renewable technologieswill be matched to their most viable (high-quality and quantity)regional resources (e.g., examining solar thermal electricityproduction in high direct normal insolation areas only). Therenewables will be assumed to produce electricity which will beinstantaneously used by the local utility to meet its loads; anyexcess electricity will be used to produce hydrogen electrolyticallyand stored for use later in the day, week or year. Hydrogen productionfrom renewables and hydrogen storage use will be derived basedon a range of assumptions of renewable power plant capacity sodfraction of regional electric load to be met (e.g., the amountof hydrogen storage required to meet the Northwest region's top10% of electric load). Renewable production/utility load hydrogenstorage coupling models will be developed for wind, photovoltaics,and solar thermal technologies. Hydro power (which normally hasinherent storage capability) will be analyzed separately. Distributed Utility Associates (DUA), with partner Longitude 122West, Inc. (122 West), will determine the technical potential forhydrogen production and the need for storage using renewablesas the primary energy source. For hydroelectric power (whichusually entails its own storage facility), we will do a simpleper annum energy production analysis; for the intermittent renewableswe will simulate the hour-by-hour time dependence of three leadingtechnologies (wind, photovoltaics, and solar thermal) in appropriateregions of the United States. Their electricity production patternswill be compared with typical regional electric load demand patterns. The electric load growth in each region will be projected tothe year 2010. An assumption of a target renewables energy penetrationwill be used to help size the renewables plants to supply thatenergy in each year. The analysis will determine the amount ofhydrogen to be produced and the hydrogen storage capacity requiredin each region to meet the mismatch between renewables productionand the electric load pattern using a time-dependent model. Wewill investigate the sensitivity of the answers to the fractionof peak load to be served and the land area dedicated to renewableresources.

(Sandy) Thomas, Principal Investigator, Directed Technologies, Inc. Most experts agree that hydrogen-powered vehicles could simultaneously reduce crude oil imports, urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, particularly if that hydrogen were eventually produced from renewable energy such as solar, wind, hydroelectric or biomass. We all know the end goal, but how do we get from here to there? How do we convince legislators, government officials, the public and particularly industry that hydrogen-powered vehicles can compete in the marketplace without government subsidy? How do we construct a realistic, viable pathway to move from virtually total dependence on gasoline-powered vehicles to clean hydrogen vehicles? Previous studies have independently analyzed hydrogen production, storage and distribution options, along with fuel cell vehicle technology and, to a limited degree, market penetration scenarios for hydrogen powered vehicles. This project will integrate previous work into a set of coherent programmatic pathways that illustrate how hydrogen-powered vehicles can enter the market in substantial quantities. Each programmatic pathway will include a computer model integrating four elements of the transportation sector: vehicle technology; hydrogen refueling infrastructure; market scenarios; and government actions. Each segment is represented in the model by a time series, such as the price of hydrogen over time, or the number of fuel cell vehicles sold over time, or the amount of industry investment in fuel cell vehicles or hydrogen infrastructure over time. The elements are interrelated; the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) price depends on the total number of vehicles manufactured through the previous year. The number of FCVs sold depends in part on the price. And price depends on government and industry investments. The key inputs to this model are government actions, including but not limited to R&D investments, incentives, codes and standards, demonstration projects, and education. The primary outputs are the return on investment for industry and, for government, the contribution to societal objectives of cleaner air, reduced oil imports and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The intent of the model is to permit the DOE Program Manager to assess the effects of making government investments - by investing a relatively small amount now in hydrogen R&ampD, industry will be induced to make the much larger investments needed later to make fuel cell vehicles a reality. Recent Activities: We completed a preliminary literature search in the three targetareas: fuel cell vehicle technology, hydrogen infrastructurestudies, and fuel cell vehicle market penetration analysis. Wealso identified major reports on the environmental impact of fuelcell vehicles. A time-dependent, interactive model structurewas written that includes eight major time series from 1996 to2030: Cumulative number of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs)sold over time FCV price over time FCV investment over time (government and industry) Industry profit over time Hydrogen production required over time Hydrogen cost over time Hydrogen investment over time Hydrogen industry profits over time. These various functions are interdependent. For example, themodel assumes that the number of FCVs sold each year depends onthe FCV price relative to the competition. The FCV price dependson the initial price, the degree of R&D investment (inputparameter) in fuel cell systems, and the cumulative number ofFCVs sold. Initially, the FCV price is too high for significantsales, so the model assumes government-industry cost-shared demonstrationprojects to bring the price down. A manufacturing "learningcurve" is assigned to each element of the FCV, so thatthe price falls as more units are produced. As more FCVs are sold,the price falls further, simulating the actual marketplace. Wehave entered reliable data on hydrogen costs, based primarilyon the extensive hydrogen gas industry study conducted by theFord Motor Company as part of the DOE direct hydrogen fuel cellvehicle project. The amount of hydrogen is linked to the cumulativenumber of FCVs on the road.WT02-B17-110IA060-000330-B035-188http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/quality.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115051350 text/html 5653HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:13:56 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:27 GMTContent-length: 5479 Hydrogen InfoNet Quality Metrics; Jim Ohi, Principal Investigator, National Renewable Energy Laboratory This project aims to identify and quantify, as much as possible, the benefits of hydrogen-based energy systems for DOE's Hydrogen Program. Specifically, DOE hopes to develop a comprehensive, systematic metric that will measure the program's contributions to fuel savings, emissions reductions, economic productivity, international competitiveness, and environmental quality. A secondary goal of the project is to identify strategies for getting hydrogen into the marketplace in the near term through research and development (R&ampD) partnerships with industry. To begin defining the costs and benefits of the Hydrogen Program in the transportation sector, we have characterized four major vehicle types: gasoline-powered conventional vehicles (GCV), hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV), hydrogen-powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV), and hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles (FCV). Our analysis considers the benefits of displacing gasoline technologies with hydrogen-fueled alternatives by studying reductions in criteria pollutant emissions, oil imports, and carbon emissions. Market penetration scenarios were constructed along the following general guidelines: penetration is slow in the first years of development, increasing more rapidly as new technologies are proven and fuel becomes available; a general transition from the ICEV to HEV to FCV technology permits storage technologies and the fueling infrastructure to evolve incrementally; and as new hydrogen-powered technology becomes available, it rapidly replaces the older technologies. Emissions of the three regulated criteria pollutants from the hydrogen-powered ICEV, HEV, and FCV were estimated using the GCV as a benchmark. The FCV operating on hydrogen is a zero-emissions vehicle. Because hydrogen contains no carbon, the HEV and ICEV have very low emissions of CO and NMOG but variable NOx emissions. Our analysis assumes that lean-burn technologies will be developed by 2010 that permit hydrogen-powered vehicles to operate at a high air-to-fuel ratio. This would reduce NOx emissions by 25% for the ICEV and 50% for the HEV relative to the GCV. We further assume that all the oil displaced by hydrogen technologies will be imported oil, estimated to average $4 per barrel, given occasional supply disruptions and market manipulations. All in all, we estimate that the net gains achievable through hydrogen use in the transportation sector are very large, totaling a cumulative discounted value of $80 billion by 2030 ($320 billion undiscounted) in 1990 dollars. Recent Advances: In March, NREL conducted a meeting of the technical team to definean integrated analysis program based on portfolio planning andmanagement. The team developed a list of key questions that mustbe answered to achieve the goal of the analysis: a 5-15 yearroad map for R&D investments under the Hydrogen Program. NREL then formed three subteams to develop a list of tasks toanswer the key questions. Each subteam (led by Princeton, LawrenceLivermore, and Directed Technologies) submitted a list of tasksto NREL from which NREL created a single, integrated list of tasks. Also in March, NREL participated in the meeting of the HTAP DemonstrationCommittee and gave a presentation on DOE/OTT's fuel cell program. In April, NREL met with staff of the NHA, IGT, and Hoagland Associatesto discuss the format and schedule for reconvening the industryworking groups on codes and standards established at the July1995 workshop at Hilton Head. NHA agreed to hold a workshop atthe end of May with the industry working groups (on containers,fueling stations, and connectors). NREL continued to coordinate a team effort to develop a set of"quality metrics" (QM) for the Hydrogen Program as partof the overall DOE/OUT and DOE/EE QM effort. The other membersof the team are Energetics; Princeton Economic Research, Inc.;and Pacific Northwest Laboratory. A new series of metrics weredeveloped based on the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 1996 (AEO 96),which projects significantly lower natural gas prices until 2020than did AEO 95. These revised metrics for the grid-connectedutility sector were submitted to the Hydrogen Program managerand to the HTAP. NREL and Energetics helped respond to questionsfrom Congress concerning QM included in the FY97 budget request. NREL continued discussions with both HTAP and IAG members on strategicdirections and portfolio analysis, respectively. NREL-Goldencontinued to work with NREL staff in Washington, DC, to coordinatework on strategic principles and portfolio planning for the HydrogenProgram and DOE/EE. On April 30, NREL convened a meeting of thetechnical team in Miami to discuss the integrated task list. The team reached consensus on five key tasks around which theintegrated analysis agenda will be formed. The team will developspecific task proposals and submit them to NREL. The technicalteam will discuss the task proposals and develop an analysis packagefor the program manager.

The incident light, absorbed in a semiconductor electrode, splits the water directly. This one-step system eliminates the need to generate electricity externally and then feed it to an electrolyzer. The goal of photoelectrochemical research is to develop a stable, cost-effective system that will split water upon illumination, producing hydrogen and oxygen directly and using sunlight as the only energy input.

First,the thermodynamic electrical energy required to drive the reactionwould be reduced. Second, activation barriers for the variouschemical reactions at the electrode surface would be easier toovercome. Currently, there is an 800- to 900-degree gap, withzirconia-based ceramic membranes at the high end and proton exchangemembrane (PEM) cells at the low end, in which there are no electrolyticsystems suitable for water electrolysis. Electrolysis in the200-400°C range appears to strike a good balance betweenspeeding up kinetics and lowering the open-circuit voltage byraising the temperature, and reducing corrosion and materialscompatibility problems by lowering the temperature. Most efforts to develop high-temperature proton conductors haveinvolved hydrated inorganic oxides. A less explored avenue isto use engineering polymers, specialized polymers whose structuresmake them suitable for applications requiring extremes in temperatureand corrosivity. However, because these polymers have been developedfor other applications, their behavior in an electrolytic environmentat high temperatures is not well documented. To date, we haveexamined more than 40 different polymeric materials, each knownfor its thermal and chemical resistance, under steam/oxygen andsteam/hydrogen conditions. Several of the tested polymer familiesshowed good stability at temperatures ranging from 200°Cto 300°C; none could withstand the combination of steam andoxygen at 400°C, but some did survive with steam and hydrogenat this temperature. Recent Advances: We have been trying to synthesize sulfonic acid polymers thatwill exhibit protonic conductivity without sacrificing thermaland hydrolytic stability. We continued our characterization ofthe thermal stability of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (S-PEEK)and sulfonated polyether sulfone (S-PES), by examining their weightloss after 24 hours in saturated steam. The samples were placedin either small borosilicate glass beakers or ceramic boats, sothat even if they melted, sample integrity could be maintained. This prevented melting, dissolution, or other mechanical failurefrom masking the fundamental thermohydrolytic stability. Samples of29%-sulfonated S-PES and 20%-sulfonated S-PEEK were chosen for testing. At 120°C, the S-PES sample underwent a 1.04% weight loss; S-PEEK samples lost only 0.82%. This is probably withinthe range of experimental error. Neither showed any visual signs of degradation. At 150°C, the 20% S-PEEK sample showed a weightloss of 1.6%. At 200°C, the S-PEEK lost 2.6% of its original mass;the S-PES lost 2.75%. Onset of discoloration was observed. Reexamination of the S-PEEK sample gave only an 11% degree ofsulfonation, out of 20% originally. This would account for only60% of the observed weight loss, however. The need to vac-ovendry the samples before and after steam testing could be causingthe sulfonic acid groups to decompose, releasing water and forminga sulfone cross-linkage. That would cause the titratable acidlevel and ultimately conductivity to drop without significantmass loss. Obtaining elemental analysis data, especially forsulfur, is being considered as a way to determine what is happening. We found that forming the sulfonic acid of polybenzimidazole (PBI)is more difficult than originally expected. Soaking PBI membranesin 10% H2SO4 and flashing the solvent off in an oven proved tobe an effective way of introducing acid into the membrane, butit is not covalently bound--it can be leached out with neutralwater, and so would be lost eventually in a water electrolysissituation. Apparently more forcing conditions will be necessaryto make the sulfonic acid. An anode having to perform electrolysis on the Br2/HBr solutionwould have an open-circuit potential of nearly 0.9 V. If theBr2 were distilled out, the voltage would drop to about 0.62 V. If the Hbr solution is further distilled to its concentratedform, voltage would fall further to 0.492 V. These results canonly approximate the true situation, since actual power consumptionwill depend on the current-voltage characteristic of the cell. Furthermore, the cathode potential is also likely to change somewhatas varying proton activities are presented.WT02-B17-114IA060-000330-B036-165http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hydprod.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115051836 text/html 3656HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:18:19 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:25 GMTContent-length: 3482 Hydrogen InfoNet Hydrogen Production from High-Moisture-Content Biomass inSupercritical Water; Michael Antal, Principal Investigator, University of Hawaii Wet biomass (plants such as water hyacinth, banana trees, cattails,green algae, and kelp) grows rapidly and abundantly around theworld. For example, water hyacinth produces more than 100 tonsper hectare per year of dry organic matter. However, wet biomassis not regarded as a promising feedstock for conventional thermochemicalenergy-conversion processes because the cost of drying the materialis too high. Our research addresses this problem by using wateras the medium for converting the biomass to gas. Previous work in this area showed that low concentrations of amodel compound (glucose) and various wet biomass species couldbe completely gasified in supercritical water at 600°C and34.5 MPa (5,000 psi) after 30 seconds. But higher concentrationsof glucose resulted in incomplete conversion. For this reason,we constructed flow reactors that could accommodate packed bedsof catalyst and initiated studies of the steam reforming (gasification)reactions in the presence of various candidate catalysts. Ourgoal is to identify active catalysts for steam reforming biomassslurries in supercritical water. The gaseous products (primarilyhydrogen, CO2, and methane) separate from the water upon coolingat the reactor exit and are then available for storage or furtherprocessing at a pressure of 34.5 MPa. Soon after tests began, we discovered a suitable class of carbon-basedcatalysts. These catalysts promote complete conversion (>99%)of high-concentration glucose (up to 22% by weight) to a hydrogen-richsynthesis gas. The catalyst we used, which is stable over a periodof several hours, exists in many forms and is inexpensive. Afterdiscovering this catalyst, we focused our work on four interrelatedtasks: (1) tests to identify the most active form and compositionof the catalyst; (2) tests employing the catalyst to study theeffect of feedstock composition on carbon conversion and gas composition;(3) studies of catalyst deactivation and reactivation; and (4)design and fabrication of a new, larger reactor with a slurryfeeder to handle high-concentration, wet biomass feedstocks. Recent Advances: Several long-resident-time (up to 24 hours) carbon activationexperiments were performed at a higher temperature (650°C). These experiments were designed to achieve further carbon conversionthan previously at 600°C and shorter residence times. Thepurpose is to examine the effect of residence time on surfacearea and activity. A reproduction experiment of glycerol gasificationwithout a catalyst at 600°C, 34.5 MPa, was conducted to investigatethe reasons for the inconsistency of the water-gas shift reaction. Wall effect and mass transfer effect on the gasification of theglycerol (2M) were examined. An activation experiment was conductedutilizing 0.8 M hydrogen peroxide as a reactant to oxidize thepacked activated carbon at 295°C, 34.5 MPa. The iodine numbersof the activated carbon before and after the experiment will indicatewhether such a process is effective in activating the carbon.WT02-B17-115IA060-000330-B036-204http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/biomass.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115051912 text/html 3040HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:19:11 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:20 GMTContent-length: 2866 Biomass to Hydrogen via Fast Pyrolysis & Reforming Biomass to Hydrogen via Fast Pyrolysis and Reforming; Esteban Chornet, Principal Investigator, National RenewableEnergy Laboratory Renewable-biomass-derived hydrogen is an attractive alternativeto petroleum- and natural-gas-derived hydrogen because it canhelp us conserve our fossil resources. Renewable biomass includeswood, forestry and agricultural residues, diversified solid wastes,and dedicated, high-production, regional energy-crop plantations.The challenge is to produce hydrogen at a cost similar to thatof hydrocarbon-based processes. Fast pyrolysis is a process thatconverts biomass into a mixture of low-molecular-weight oxygenateswith typical yields of 60-65 wt% of dry biomass. These oxygenatesare used as feedstock to a steam reforming operation to generatehydrogen, which is separated from the CO2 using commercially availabletechnology. The key focus of this project is the catalytic steamreforming step. We conducted catalytic screening using model compounds and monitoredthe product gas with a molecular beam mass spectrometer. Resultsindicate that Ni-based alumina preparations can reform the differentmodel compounds characteristic of the pyrolysis oils. A continuous-flow,tubular reactor was constructed to carry out time-on-stream studiesof different commercial catalysts as well as some improved non-commercialcatalyst formulations. A technoeconomic analysis of our biomass-to-hydrogen process showsthat the production costs of hydrogen can be profitable in today'shydrogen market in niches where hydrogen sells for at least $1.10per kilogram. Recent Advances: Bench-scale experiments in a fixed-bed reformer using whole pyrolysisoil suggest that the key to successful reforming lies in the feedingsystem. In order to minimize char formation, adequate feed atomizationand controlled temperature ramping are necessary. We are designinga mixer/nozzle injector to provide this control. Even with this control, however, we expect to observe char orcarbon formation on the catalyst, much the same as in commercialnaphtha reforming operations. Because of these carbon deposits,the catalyst becomes deactivated over time and periodic regenerationof the catalyst is needed. We have found that by-product carbondioxide is as effective as air in regenerating the catalyst. Inaddition, the product gas from the regeneration step is enrichedin CO, and because the CO reacts with steam in the water-gas shiftreaction to produce hydrogen, regeneration with CO2 has the addedeffect of increasing the overall hydrogen yield.

Muradov, Principal Investigator, Florida Solar Energy Center In the next few decades hydrogen production will continue to rely on fossil fuels, primarily, natural gas. The conventional method of hydrogen production from natural gas is steam reforming, a complex multi-step process resulting in the emission of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. One alternative is the single-step thermocatalytic decomposition (or cracking) of natural gas into hydrogen and carbon. The thermocatalytic decomposition of methane over various catalysts and supports in a wide range of temperatures (500-900°C) and flow rates was studied. A catalyst activity tests were conducted using two types of catalytic reactors; continuous flow and pulse reactors. The temperature dependence of the hydrogen production yield using metal and metal oxide forms of different catalysts was studied. It was found that alumina-supported Ni and Fe catalysts exhibited high activity in methane decomposition reaction. Pt/alumina catalyst rapidly lost its catalytic activity. The experimental results indicate that for the given pressure and space velocity the maximum hydrogen yield is a function of temperature. It was demonstrated that a short induction period of hydrogen production over Ni- and Fe-based catalysts corresponded to the reduction of metal oxide to the metallic form of the catalyst. Variation in the operational parameters makes it possible to produce CH4-H2 mixtures with the wide range of hydrogen concentrations from 30 to 98% by volume. It was found that Ni-based catalysts are more suitable for the operational temperatures below 750°C, whereas Fe-based catalysts can be used at temperatures 800°C and higher for the production of hydrogen with purity up to 95% by volume and higher. The studied process can be the basis for the development of the compact catalytic units for on-site production of the hydrogen-methane blends at gas refueling stations and for CO2 -free production of hydrogen for the fuel cell driven prime movers. Recent Advances: We conducted a series of experiments on methane decompositionusing tubular reactors made out of different materials: quartz,alumina, stainless steel, and nickel. The objective was to recovercarbon from the inner wall of the reactor. The reaction of methanedecomposition was carried out at a temperature range of 850-870°Cand atmospheric pressure. The maximum hydrogen concentrationin the effluent gas using a stainless steel tubular reactor wasless than 10% v. There was no methane decomposition reactiondetected in the quartz reactor. The ceramic (alumina) reactordemonstrated negligible activity (H2 concentration, 0.2% v.). The reactor made out of nickel tube demonstrated the highestactivity in methane decomposition reaction. After the methanedecomposition reaction was completed, carbon was mechanicallyremoved from the reactor wall. This procedure was repeated threetimes. We observed that the hydrogen concentration in the effluentgas after the first, second and third runs were 45.6%, 39.6%, and43.3% by volume, respectively. This is indication of effectiverecovery of carbon from the catalytic reactor.

Sorption-enhanced reaction (SER) is a new process being developed for the production of low-cost hydrogen through steam-methane reforming. In this process, the reaction of methane with steam is carried out in the presence of a mixture of a catalyst and a selective adsorbent for CO2. As a result, the reformation reaction occurs at a significantly lower temperature (300-500°C) than that of conventional steam-methane reforming processes (800-1100°C) while achieving the same conversion of methane to hydrogen. In addition, the product hydrogen is more than 99% pure directly from the SER reactor and only 70-75% pure from the conventional reactor; the new process thus eliminates or substantially reduces the traditional downstream hydrogen-purification step. The SER process is expected to make small, low-cost plants more economical, facilitating the growth of hydrogen delivery and service infrastructures. Our efforts have focused chiefly on developing a sorbent that will adsorb/chemisorb CO2 in the presence of H2O, methane, CO, and H2 at 300-500°C and a total pressure of 5-20 atmospheres. Early work also includes demonstrating the SER concept in a state-of-the-art, bench-scale test. Later work will include building a pilot plant to scale up the technology and develop engineering data. If successful, this technology will be commercialized by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., and used in its current hydrogen business. Recent Advances: Material E4 was reported last month to meet the target CO2sorption capacity at 400°C. Tests have been completed on(I) dry sorption-desorption cycling of the sorbent and (ii) exposureof E4 to process levels of steam and CO2at 400°C for one month on the Hydrothermal Stability TestingUnit (HSTU). The data show that after 60 sorption-desorptioncycles and exposure to steam, the CO2 sorptioncapacity is retained at > 0.60 mmol/g at 400°C, a verysignificant result. Analysis of the sorbent after exposure to30 days of steam at 10 atm pressure showed the formation of a3-phase crystalline product mixture. Laboratory preparation andanalysis of one of the products resulting from this 30-day steamingtest, E8, indicates that it contributes only a minor componentto the overall observed capacity of this material. B2 was shownto have a CO2 desorption capacity intermediatebetween those of C31 and E4 under process levels of steam andCO2 as measured on the Binary DesorptionUnit (BDU). A laboratory hydraulic extruder was set up for theextrusion and pelletization of sorbents for the H2 SER program. The testing of sorbents in the BDU or the HSTU will require theuse of formed materials. Pelleted sorbents will be used in thereaction process. An invention disclosure was filed coveringthe preferred adsorbents for the H2 SER process. Sorption and desorption characteristics of CO2at 400°C on pelleted E4 sorbent were carried out in the labprocess equipment. CO2 sorption was carriedout at different flow rates, and the length of the mass transferzone (where the CO2 composition in theeffluent changes from zero to the feed condition) measured. Thedata showed that at an industrial G-rate of 10 lb-mole/hr/ft2,the length of the mass transfer zone was only 11", indicatingthat the sorption kinetics are fast and acceptable for the SERprocess. Desorption experiments were also carried out with hotnitrogen at 400°C to regenerate the sorbent. Different N2flow rates were used in the regeneration experiments. A plotof (total CO2 in the effluent) vs. (thetotal effluent out) showed that the desorption is independentof the flow rate. The desorption profile, calculated from localequilibrium theory, matched experimental profiles at differentflow rates. These data show that the kinetics of desorption islocal-equilibrium-controlled and fast. A novel condensing vapor shell-and-tube reactor was designed forSER-SMR. The heat required for the reaction is provided by thecondensation of a heat transfer fluid vapor. The reactor operationis nearly isothermal; heat is provided where it is needed (inthe moving reaction-mass transfer zone) in the reaction tubes. Also, a process flow diagram was prepared for the SER-SMR processusing the condensing vapor reactor. Heat and mass balances werecarried out. An economic analysis was done by the APCI H2business area for this process, which showed that the SER-SMRprocess can lower the H2 production costby 20% compared with conventional SMR. Two patent disclosureson the SER-SMR process were filed.WT02-B17-118IA060-000333-B043-92http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/hyplsma3.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052155 text/html 2316HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:22:00 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:25 GMTContent-length: 2142 Hydrogen InfoNet Hydrogen Production from Plasma Reforming Leslie Bromberg, Principal Investigator, Massachusetts Institute of Technology High-temperature, noncatalytic reforming using plasma technologycan provide a number of advantages over conventional catalyticreforming. A plasma reformer is being investigated at the MITPlasma Fusion Center as a method for reforming hydrocarbon fuels.The hydrogen-rich gas could be used for decentralized electricitygeneration or in transportation. A plasma reformer system increasesfuel flexibility because it can operate using any hydrocarbon,including heavy fractions. In addition, it may be possible tooperate in a pyrolytic mode, where the carbon from the hydrocarbonfuels is converted to soot and is not consumed, virtually eliminatingCO2 production. The fast kinetic rates obtained at the high gastemperatures enabled by plasma technology can greatly reduce thevolume and weight of the reformer, making reformers more compact.This feature is important for onboard transportation applications. In this project, plasma reformer operation in pyrolytic, partialoxidation, and steam reforming modes will be studied. Experimentaland theoretical studies are being carried out to investigate thefeasibility and engineering of compact plasma reformers and thekinetics of high-temperature uncatalyzed reforming.

Among the biological options, systems of intact cells of photosynthetic bacteria are the most advanced. Unlike cyanobacteria or algae, photosynthetic bacteria do not oxidize H2O. They do, however, evolve H2 from biomass (previously generated from sunlight, H2O, and CO2). These bacteria use several different enzymatic mechanisms with near-term commercial potential for biological H2 production from biomass. We are working on producing a pure H2 stream from thermally gasified biomass (synthesis gas) using a bacterial catalyst for gas conditioning. A unique type of H2-producing activity was found in a strain of photosynthetic bacteria that functioned only in darkness to shift CO (and H2O) into H2O (and CO2). We have isolated more than 400 strains of photosynthetic bacteria from local sites that perform this shift in the dark but also quantitatively assimilate CO into new cell mass in the light, which makes them easier to grow. We have tested many of our strains for CO shift activity and growth with crude (water-scrubbed only) synthesis gas (primarily CO and H2) generated from thermally gasified wood chips. In the light, the novel photosynthetic bacteria assimilate the CO and H2 components and a portion of the trace gases. In the dark, all of the isolates respond similarly by shifting the CO into additional H2, thereby leaving a product gas highly enriched in H2. No inhibitory effects of synthesis gas on long-term photosynthetic growth are noted. At ambient temperature and pressure conditions, starting from 20% CO in the gas phase, less than 18 ppm of CO (0.0018%) remain at equilibrium. To determine the feasibility of using the biological catalysts for large-scale conditioning of synthesis gas, we need further information on the maximum activities and durabilities of the enzymes involved. From an engineering standpoint, the rate-limiting step is in the mass transfer of the gaseous substrate into the aqueous phase of the bacteria. This is being addressed by using reversibly immobilized bacteria in the absence of a bulk water phase. A number of photosynthetic bacterial isolates were selected for O2-tolerant hydrogenase enzymes. Genetic transfer, expression, and linkage of an O2-tolerant hydrogenase enzyme in a cyanobacterial or algal host will create a photobiological system that can conditionally evolve H2 from H2O for extended periods of time. Recent Advances The water-gas shift activity of Rhodobacter sp. CBS ismore fully expressed when the cells are exposed to 10% CO at elevatedpressures. About a fivefold increase in activity from the entirebacterial population was observed in going from one atmospherepressure to 10 atmospheres. The culture readily utilizes 100%CO at 2 atmospheres pressure but is inhibited by 7 atmospheresof 100% CO. Spontaneous mutants able to tolerate the latter conditionsare being examined. In principle, their increased CO toleranceshould be due to further over-expression of the shift enzymes. The CBS-2 mutant strain was isolated by exposing a CBS cultureto 5% O2 while growing on CO. The mutant was selected probablybecause it has 364% of the shift activity of its parent and couldbetter survive O2-inactivation of the sensitive proteins. Further rounds of both mutant selection techniques are being performedto significantly enhance shift activity. Both are positive selectiontechniques that permit a bacterium's selection in the 1 in 1010range. Since these are gain-of-function mutants, they are potentiallyuseful in application schemes and will out-compete revertantsor invading wild-type bacteria in bioreactors. This is absolutelynecessary since none of the application schemes utilizes sterileconditions. The mutant strains will be incorporated into bioreactordesigns that have shown enhanced mass transfer activity (principallythe hollow-fiber, trickle-filter, and bubble-train designs). The trickle-filter and bubble-train bioreactors can be pressurizedto about 10 atmospheres. The combination of improved microbesand enhanced mass transfer should significantly elevate H2 productionrates.WT02-B17-120IA060-000333-B044-113http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/devalgal.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052713 text/html 3354HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:27:16 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:21 GMTContent-length: 3180Development of an Efficient Algal Hydrogen-Producing System; Maria Ghirardi, Principal Investigator, National Renewable Energy Laboratory The primary objectives of this work are to produce oxygen-tolerant, hydrogen-producing mutants from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, test these hydrogenase mutants in a laboratory-scale system in which continuous photoproduction of hydrogen takes place under aerobic conditions, and collaborate with researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production in this organism. Hydrogen production from green algae has significant advantages compared with production from other biological systems. Here, hydrogen production is theoretically more efficient; water is the direct substrate for the reaction, and there is no need for intermediary metabolites or biomass. However, there are also several practical limitations to using green algae in a photobiological hydrogen-producing system. These include, first, the sensitivity of hydrogenase to oxygen; second, an oxy-hydrogen back reaction; and third, less efficient hydrogen production at high light intensity. Our approach is to treat cell suspensions of Chlamydomonas with a mutagen and then select cells that survive under photoreducing conditions, which favor an oxygen-tolerant, hydrogen-consuming hydrogenase, as well as cells that survive under conditions that favor an oxygen-tolerant, hydrogen-producing hydrogenase. This dual approach allows us to select for mutants that not only show increased oxygen tolerance but may also exhibit decreased levels of the oxy-hydrogen reaction. Any mutant strain isolated will be characterized in detail and tested for the continuous production of hydrogen under aerobic conditions in a bioreactor that also will be developed as part of this project. Finally, we will attempt to transfer the oxygen-tolerance trait to organisms being developed at ORNL that function more efficiently at high light intensity. Our efforts to date included setting up optimal growth conditions for two strains of Chlamydomonas, a wild-type strain (137c) and a cell-wall-less strain (cw15) that may be more amenable to genetic transformation techniques. We also made preliminary measurements of simultaneous oxygen and hydrogen production in both strains, and studied the levels of oxygen required to inhibit hydrogen production. With these baseline parameters established, we will begin our selection for mutants. Recent Advances We recently completed characterization of the response of wild-type and cw15 Chlamydomonas to photoreductive and hydrogen-producing selective conditions. In preliminary experiments, we selected for a few surviving organisms in nonmutagenized cultures, and we are now testing whether their sensitivity to oxygen has decreased.

Renewable sources of biomass include cellulose, starch and lactose. These represent a vast supply of reducing power and, although themselves not reducing, the individual glucose molecules constituting these renewables (together with the galactose of lactose) can be oxidized using the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). This is an NADP+-requiring enzyme and this cofactor serves as a trap for the reducing equivalents from glucose. If NADPH could be oxidized to yield molecular hydrogen, then it could be feasible that renewables could represent a vast source of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the cofactor NADP+ would have its own self-regenerating system. Based upon the Z-scheme of photosynthesis and the known midpoint potential of the NADP+/NADPH couple (versus the HSE), which is -0.32 volts, this reducing potential is close to that required for the reduction of ferredoxin coupled to the enzyme hydrogenase. Only two hydrogenases are known, so far, to interact with NADH or NADPH. They are from the bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus and from the Archeon Pyrococcus furiosus. We have discovered a new in vitro pathway for the generation of molecular hydrogen from glucose. The reaction is based upon the oxidation of glucose by Thermoplasma acidophilum GDH with the concomitant oxidation of NADPH by P. Furious hydrogenase. It is of interest that both of these enzymes are from the separate group of microorganisms called Archaea which thrive in extreme environments. This property clearly would be advantageous in a future bioprocess for hydrogen production based on this enzymatic reaction. Stiochiometric yields of hydrogen were produced from glucose with continuous cofactor recycle. We have also shown that if the substrate is cellulose or starch molecular hydrogen is generated if cellulase or amyloglucosidase, respectively, is included simultaneously in the reaction mixture. Current studies include the optimization of conditions for hydrogen production from enewable sources of glucose as well as the immobilization of GDH and hydrogenase for their recovery and reuse. An economic evaluation of this process will also be conducted. It is of interest to note that the only other product of this reaction is gluconic acid, a high value commodity chemical. Cellulose- and starch-derived glucose cost 7-8 cents/lb; solid glucono-8-lactone sells for $1.20/lb in aqueous solution the lactone hydrolyzes to gluconic acid. Recent Advances: Several hydrogen generation experiments were performed to studythe effect of pH and temperature on yields and rates. At pH 8.0,two temperatures were tested, 40°C and 50°C. At 40°Cthe yield was 72% and the rate was 1,959 nmoles H2/hour. At 50°C,the yield was lower (59%) and the rate was 3,058 nmoles H2/hour. The effect of temperature at pH 7.5 was also tested. The highestyield, 97%, was obtained at 40°C with a rate of 4,713 nmolesH2/hour. At 70°C the highest rate (7,763 nmoles H2/hour)was obtained with a yield of 66%. The ability of the enzyme ß-galactosidaseto degrade lactose was also studied. Lactose degradation wasmeasured after 2, 5, and 10 minutes by measuring the amount ofglucose generated. The activity of the enzyme was 92.23 units/mlat pH 7.5 and 40°C.WT02-B17-122IA060-000333-B044-181http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/photelch.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052758 text/html 3068HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:27:54 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:26 GMTContent-length: 2894 Hydrogen InfoNet Photoelectrochemical Production of Hydrogen; Richard Rocheleau, Principal Investigator, University of Hawaii The University of Hawaii's integrated research program involves electrode fabrication, characterization, and engineering modeling; the objective of this work is to develop a high-efficiency, low-cost photoelectrochemical system for the direct production of hydrogen. Progress in developing an efficient system for direct photoelectrolytic production of hydrogen from water has been limited by the high voltage required to dissociate water and the corrosiveness of the aqueous electrolytes. Loss analysis and reactor models indicate that high direct photoelectrolysis efficiencies (solar to hydrogen) can be obtained by using multijunction solid-state devices with appropriate catalytic surfaces. These designs provide greater flexibility in the photoelectrode design and offer a wider choice of materials for protection and catalytic activation of the interface. The focus of future work will be to continue collaborations with industrial partners to demonstrate stable performance using electrodes that are larger in area than the ones previously investigated. Recent Advances: Additional outdoor testing of PEC cells was performed to confirmthe hydrogen production efficiency of 7.5% and to characterizePEC performance under a broader range of conditions. A differenttriple-junction cell from the same batch was used to fabricatea new set of photoelectrodes for these new tests. Experimentswere conducted on a clear day with minimal cloud interference. The hydrogen production efficiency was 7.8% during the initialpart of the experiment, decreasing very slowly to around 7.7%for the first 90 minutes of the experiment and to approximately7.6% by the end of the two-hour test. Since the oxygen and hydrogencatalysts have been shown repeatedly to be very stable for morethan 140 hours, we speculated that the decrease in the efficiencywas due to spectral sensitivity of the triple-junction solar cell. The solar spectrum in the evening is considerably different thanthat in the afternoon. In the evening, the solar radiation, comingat an angle, travels a greater distance in the Earth's atmosphere. This results in increased scattering of UV and blue rays. Hence,the evening solar spectra are less rich in UV and blue radiation,which lends the yellow and red colors to sunsets. Because thetop layer of a triple-junction cell is normally optimized for theabsorption of blue light, one would expect the triple-junctionsolar cell to be sensitive to the evening solar spectrum. Additionaltests were designed to confirm this.WT02-B17-123IA060-000333-B044-275http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/hydrogen/photohy.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115052925 text/html 1409HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 05:29:18 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 08 Jul 1996 22:35:26 GMTContent-length: 1235 Hydrogen InfoNet Photovoltaic Hydrogen Production; T.N.

If you are new to this subject, you may find a brief, general article such as "The Hydrogen Solution" of interest. "The Hydrogen Solution" "Hydrogen Viable Prospect for Near-Term" "Harnessing the Big H; Hydrogen Seems the Ideal Energy Source--Plentiful, Efficient and Clean. Can Something This Perfect Be Real? Just Ask the Japanese." If you prefer, scroll down below to find each article in the consecutive order they appear. The Hydrogen Solution Will we ever find inexpensive ways to produce energy and fuel without harmingthe environment? Let's find out, in this imaginary journey to the future ... Our first stop is the year 2005. We're in the middle of a large, busy city on theU.S. West Coast. We can hear the familiar roar of internal combustion engines allaround us, but there are almost no toxic emissions coming from all these cars, trucks,and buses; most of them emit little more than harmless water vapor. The next stop is the year 2050. Now we're in a more agricultural setting, in themiddle of the Great Plains. On the horizon, we spot some large solar and wind energysystems; they are helping to produce a new source of electricity and transportation fuelwithout spewing tons of harmful gases or particulates into the air. We zoom ahead to the year 2150, to a lush, green park in the middle of a largebut uncrowded metropolitan area on the East Coast that's unlike anything we've everseen before. No electric power lines are visible anywhere, the sky is a bright blue, andthe air smells fresh and clean. On the horizon we can see a row of large storage tankson slender pipes that poke like tree roots into the ground. These tanks store hydrogen,which is piped into the city and used for transportation, heating, cooling, and electricpower by all those who live and work there. Mere fantasies? Perhaps not--especially if we keep finding new and better waysto produce and use hydrogen for our energy and fuel needs. Researchers funded bythe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at our national laboratories have already joinedwith experts at universities and in industry to explore promising new hydrogenproduction, storage, and use technologies. These new technologies should allow us toput nature's most basic element to work for us as a versatile energy carrier and a cleanfuel. DOE researchers are exploring new ways to produce hydrogen for energy andfuel from water, plant materials, and other sources, such as fossil fuels, using threemain technical approaches: photolysis, electrolysis, and thermal processes. Photolyticresearch includes the investigation of photelectrochemical processes (which make useof light and chemical reactions to produce hydrogen) and photobiological processes (inwhich living things, such as plants and bacteria, use light to produce hydrogen). Inelectrolysis research, we are investigating novel ways to electrolyze water at highertemperatures, which "splits" the water into hydrogen and oxygen. Research in newthermal processes includes investigations of advanced gasification and pyrolysissystems; biomass (grasses, trees, and agricultural residues) and municipal solid wasteare the target feedstocks (starting materials) for these thermal processes. In some photoelectrochemical processes, sunlight striking a semiconductorimmersed in water produces high-purity hydrogen gas. These processes make use ofthe photovoltaic effect, in which semiconductors made of silicon and other materialsconvert light directly to electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Solar cells similar to the ones used in space can be used to electrolyze thewater to produce hydrogen and oxygen. DOE-funded researchers have already beenable to convert 8% of the energy in solar radiation to hydrogen, as they work toward amaximum theoretical efficiency of more than 20%. The goal is to reach 15% conversionefficiency by the year 2000 and begin commercial production of hydrogen with thistechnique by 2010. The primary challenge is to find an appropriate semiconductor. Mostsemiconductors do not generate enough voltage for this process, and they corrode inwater. Researchers are investigating new materials, changes in device surfaces, andprotective coatings on solar cells to overcome these problems. They are alsoinvestigating the use of tandem cells with high voltages and different metal catalysts;this is important because today's best hydrogen-producing catalysts are expensive. In photobiological processes, photosynthetic microorganisms -- bacteria andalgae, for example -- produce hydrogen directly from sewage or food-processingwaste. Photosynthetic algae can generate hydrogen directly from water. Severalteams of researchers have already isolated a number of photosynthetic microorganismsthat use light to generate hydrogen. In sunlight, without oxygen, some of these bacteria produce hydrogen efficientlyfrom soluble organic acids, such as those found in sewage or waste materials fromfood-processing plants. Other photosynthetic bacteria, when denied both light and air,convert carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This makes itpossible to turn various thermal (heat-based) processes for generating synthesis gas(primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into hydrogen-production processes. Thebacteria are so efficient that they can remove 99.99% of the carbon monoxide fromtheir surroundings while producing hydrogen at 20 times their own volume per minute. Exciting recent discoveries in this research program have resulted in theisolation of photosynthetic microorganisms that can generate hydrogen even in thepresence of oxygen. This opens the door to the possibility of developing an industrialprocess for splitting water photobiologically. Using thermal processes such as fast pyrolysis allows us to vaporize biomass atmoderately high temperatures without oxygen; these vapors are then catalyticallyreformed to produce hydrogen. Researchers are currently investigating the possibilityof producing hydrogen from biomass in a fast-pyrolysis reactor. Any of these new production technologies could develop into an efficient,economical means of producing hydrogen. And any of them could be combined with anumber of promising storage and utilization technologies to help hydrogen fulfill itspotential as the "ultimate fuel"--one that DOE predicts will join electricity as a primaryenergy carrier in the not-too-distant future. Hydrogen Viable Prospect for Near-Term Despite the fact that technical and societal factors stand in the way of hydrogen becoming a fuel for the masses, a new analysis conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) suggests that there are viable scenarios for making the transition to high-mileage electric vehicles powered by a combination of batteries and hydrogen-fueled power systems. In the report, "Hydrogen as a Transportation Fuel: Costs and Benefits," analysts look at hydrogen's economic viability for powering a five-passenger vehicle such as a Ford Taurus with a range of about 80 miles per gallon. LLNL concluded that over time there are compelling reasons to try to shift away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles. For example, with a sizable fleet of alternative vehicles operating in the United States by 2030, oil imports could be cut by two billion barrels per year, saving $1.2 trillion at $30 per barrel of oil. But such savings cannot be achieved overnight, LLNL warned. "The most striking point about oil-use reductions and alternative-fuel vehicles is the very long lead times necessary for large-scale change. Alternative-fuel cars introduced in 2005 do not begin to materially influence aggregate oil use for another decade, and two decades more (2035) are required to replace gasoline vehicles," the report says. "We have shown that you could put hydrogen-fueled vehicle on the road in the near term," said Robert Schock, associate director for energy at LLNL. "It does not have to be as far off as people have supposed." Schock added that policymakers have erred in the past by focusing on the total costs of a hydrogen-fueled auto economy and the associated infrastructure requirements. "What DOE needed to do is to look at the transition phase and ask, How do you get there?" The study points out that hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can fill the niche for hydrogen vehicles without awaiting the development of cost-effective fuel cells. "HEVs coupled with small-scale hydrogen production and/or storage are among the most promising systems," the LLNL report says.

Just Ask the Japanese.By Alan Weisman, Contributing editor Alan Weisman lives in Sonaita, Ariz. His last piece for the magazine was about a progressive community in Columbia Los Angeles Times Sunday March 19, 1995Home EditionLos Angeles Times Magazine, Page 18 West of Denver, Interstate 70 enters Golden, Colo., and begins tocurl through the foothills of the Rockies. There it bisects an unassumingclump of brick buildings--the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Amongthe government's national laboratories, NREL is modest, operating on afraction of the billions commanded by atomic research giants like Sandia,Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. Inside, there are no monstrousparticle accelerators; experiments here are more likely to proceed intest-tube racks, bell jars and small glass beakers, like the one JohnTurner is filling with a clear solution of water and household lye. Turner, a chemist with a graying blond beard and gold-rimmed glasses,sticks a narrow glass slide, coated on one end with a black, mica-likesubstance, into the lye solution. The humming lab ventilators mask thesound of the vehicles whizzing by on the nearby interstate, but Turnerhas spent most of his career here, and during those years he's always hadthe cars in mind. As he aims a pencil-thin beam from a high-intensitylamp at the flask, he puts it this way: "Suppose someone announced heintended to ship millions of gallons of a carcinogenic, explosive fluidthat emits toxic fumes through our downtown and then store it undergroundin our neighborhoods. People would rise up in anger, right?" Wrong. Just outside on I-70, cars are spraying residues of that verypoison all over the mountains. After 11 decades of tinkering, theirinternal combustion engines are miracles of technology with hundreds ofmoving parts. Yet various laws of physics still limit their ability toextract energy from petroleum. Nearly three-fourths of its potentialsimply radiates away or pours, partly combusted, out the tailpipe, risingin geologic layers of brown murk until the Rockies themselves dwindle toghostly smudges. John Turner is among a cadre of scientists trying tosuppress what he regards as humanity's most pervasive, andself-inflicted, epidemic. In a little more than a century, since ThomasAlva Edison invented the light bulb and Henry Ford began to mass-produceautomobiles, man-made energy has become the most addictive drug inhistory. Everybody today was born into this dependency: No one any longercan imagine life without electricity or motorized vehicles. To slake ourcraving, we must dose ourselves and our surroundings daily with deadlyfilth. This ritual is now doomed to spread, as China, India and otherdeveloping nations bestow family cars and refrigerators upon 2 billionnew recruits to the industrial age. Getting an entire world to kick a habit is futile, so Turner is tryingto at least find us a clean needle. As the beam strikes the shiny blacksquare centimeter of semiconductor glued to the submerged portion of hisslide, the surrounding liquid begins to fizz. Electrons stimulated bylight, he explains, are rushing to the semiconductor's surface, hittingwater molecules and splitting them into their component parts: oxygen andhydrogen. He watches the tiny bubbles rise. "For years," he says, "this has beenthe Holy Grail of photoelectric chemists. We're witnessing the directconversion of solar energy into hydrogen." * Cape Canaveral, June, 1994: A group of visiting scientists andengineers is touring the John F.Kennedy Space Center in blue-and-whiteair-conditioned buses. They're here for the World Hydrogen Energy Conference, a biennial event born of the energy crisis 20 years earlier.Although the price of petroleum has since calmed considerably (adjustedfor inflation, it's actually cheaper than pre-1973), a groundswell ofconcern, coupled with numerous breakthroughs, has ballooned thisgathering to nearly 600 researchers from 34 countries. They've come toCanaveral this year for inspiration: The huge tank on the pad, where theshuttle Columbia will presently lift spaceward, is filled with purehydrogen. Since even before the moon shots, all U.S. astronauts' heat,electricity and drinking water have been derived from hydrogen. The U.S.space program is the first step toward realizing these scientists' dream:to switch the planet from an economy fueled with dirty coal and petroleumto one run on clean hydrogen. The idea of something so ubiquitous--hydrogen is the most abundantelement, composing three-fourths of the mass of the universe--replacingdiminishing fossil fuels seems the stuff of fiction. Once, in fact, itwas: In 1870, Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island" described a world thatwould one day derive "an inexhaustible source of heat and light" fromwater's component parts. Back then, Verne didn't realize that this source was also virtuallypollution-free. The cycle is so elegant it seems nearly miraculous:Separate water into its two constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. Burnthe hydrogen for fuel, and it re-couples with oxygen to form water again.No nasty particulates, no insidious carbon monoxide, no eye-stingingozone or sulfur dioxide (at high temperatures, however, small,controllable amounts of nitrous oxides can form when hydrogen is burnedin the presence of air). Mainly, though, hydrogen's exhaust is plainwater vapor--which can then be recaptured and neatly converted again tohydrogen. According to Bill Hoagland, founder of NREL's hydrogen program, itwould take less than a gallon of water to get the same range fromhydrogen that cars currently get from a gallon of gasoline. Becausehydrogen can be made anywhere, I'm told repeatedly, there would be nomore dependency on imported oil. No more OPEC. Maybe no more globalwarming, either, because it emits no greenhouse gases. As for hydrogen'sunfortunate association with bombs and blimps, like the ill-fatedHindenburg, Hoagland reminds me that fossil fuels also readily explode,and studies rate hydrogen safer because it's nontoxic and dissipatesquickly. It seems like the perfect fuel. Yet, these scientists insist, it'sbeen under-researched, under-funded and virtually ignored in Detroit,which perseveres in its allegiance to petroleum, and in Washington, whichpersists in keeping troops ready to defend the Persian Gulf. So why aren't we leaping at this chance to end pollution, energy warsand economic bondage to a few privileged locations that float atop theearth's ebbing supplies of oil? Much of it comes down to money and theseemingly incontestable reign of the petroleum industry. Unlike naturalgas, to which hydrogen is often compared, you can't dig a hole and findit. To tap hydrogen's energy, you have to expend energy because it'salways combined with something else. Having to un-combine it makes itmore expensive, at least in the near term, than crude petroleum products,including natural gas. And no alternative-energy constituency has theclout to buck powerful fossil-fuel lobbies and find a way to pay forretrofitting the world for a brand-new technology. Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy allots hydrogen aboutone-ninetieth of what it spends on continuing petroleum research. (Andtwo-thirds of the DOE's budget doesn't go for energy at all, but fornuclear weapons research and cleanup.) Nor has the public thus fardemonstrated much interest in trading the ease of dirty energy, availableat the turn of an ignition key or click of a light switch, for a majorcommitment to something cleaner and renewable. Yet the learned crowd gathered at the World Hydrogen Conference isconvinced that hydrogen's time must come. Fossil fuels will becomeexpensive again; even today, their true price isn't revealed at the gaspump, where the numbers don't include the cost of pollution and theexpense of protecting our interests in the Persian Gulf. Other countries are less reluctant about hydrogen than the UnitedStates. Two years ago, Japan, an island nation frightened by the prospectof rising seas if the icecaps start to melt, unveiled amultibillion-dollar, 28-year program to form a global hydrogen system.The Japanese are talking power plants, cars, buses, planes, ships androckets, all over the world, all fueled with renewable hydrogen. And there's a recent surprise announcement by Daimler-Benz, the parentcompany of Mercedes-Benz, that has excited many people here: The Germanauto maker claims it has cleared the major obstacles to producing thefirst commercially viable hydrogen-powered automobile. Unless Mercedes isjust trying to spook the competition, hydrogen's prospects have suddenlyimproved faster than anyone dared hope. The Mercedes in question runs ona fuel cell, a refillable device that, like a battery, chemicallyconverts fuel directly to electricity without having to burn it. Fuelcells can function on methanol or natural gas, but with hydrogen, they'reup to three times more efficient than conventional engines. The most advanced models, including the one Daimler-Benz uses, comefrom the Vancouver-based Ballard Power Systems Inc., which designed fuelcells for the Canadian defense department, using technology NASAdeveloped for the Gemini mission and then shelved. Originally large, boxyaffairs of stackable metal plates separated by membranes resemblingplastic wrap, Ballard's fuel cells are now small enough to fit inside aminivan chassis. "When we start producing them in volume," says Ballardco-founder Keith Prater, a former University of Texas chemist, "the pricewill shrink, too." * Surrounded by conference booths promoting the latest in photovoltaics,fuel cells and electrolyzers--devices that separate water into oxygen andhydrogen--I ask Princeton physicist Joan M. Ogden if the United States isletting the future slip away to foreign competitors. She tells me of arecent, unreleased General Motors study admitting that non-polluting fuelcells could be mass-produced for the same cost as a conventional engine."Actually, they should cost less, because they have no moving parts," shesays. "They'll also last longer and be cheaper to maintain." But whileMercedes, BMW and Mazda race to bring a hydrogen car to market, U.S. automakers, by comparison, don't seem very interested. A few years ago, Ogden quit Princeton's glamorous fusion energy program to engage in relatively impoverished research in renewable hydrogen. "Fusion will take decades," she told aghast colleagues. "I wantresults in my lifetime." Soon after, she co-authored a book that proposedmaking hydrogen by splitting water with electricity from solarphotovoltaic (PV) cells. (In this process, as electricity made fromsunlight passes through a pair of electrodes immersed in water, hydrogenbubbles collect around one pole and oxygen around another.) Although PVis still expensive, Ogden argued that mass production and technologicalimprovements would lower costs until they intersect with rising oilprices. The book has been alternately praised and scorned, the latter becauseof a map showing how much of the United States would have to be coveredby photovoltaic cells to produce sufficient hydrogen to meet the totalU.S. annual energy needs. The area is denoted by a circle that reachesfrom Albuquerque nearly to the Mexican border. Critics who derisively tryto guess the value of all that real estate miss the point, she insists.No one ever suggested putting all the PV in the same place. "Obviously, deserts are ideal, because they get the most sun, andminimal rainfall is enough to make plenty of hydrogen. But I did a littlecalculation once. Let's say 2,000 people who work at Princeton drivethere every day. If I wanted to run their cars on hydrogen, how much roofspace would I need to cover with PV to make enough hydrogen fuel forthem? I figured that by putting panels on fewer than half the universityrooftops, even with New Jersey's humble sunshine levels, we could convertall those cars to hydrogen. Think if we did that all over the country." That same afternoon, Peter Lehman, an environmental engineer fromHumboldt State University in Northern California, tells me what it wouldtake to do the same for the 9 million cars in the Los Angeles Basin: "Anarea about 340 square miles. About two-thirds the size, say, of EdwardsAir Force Base." Cover Edwards Air Force Base with shiny photovoltaic panels? "Sure. It would mean a fairly dramatic reorientation of priorities,and a huge expenditure, probably like building the interstate highwaysystem. That took $100 billion and 34 years. But we did it because as asociety we decided it was important. Wouldn't you think that eliminatingall smog might be important?" All week, people here have been repeating a mantra of massive Americaninvestments in the future that paid off, like the Marshall Plan, theinterstate highway system and--especially during a pilgrimage to the oldApollo launching pad--President Kennedy's decision to put men on themoon. Although these ventures involved enormous expense, they wereembraced by the public because of visionary, daring leadership, but theyalso coincided, rather than conflicted, with powerful interests. Acommitment to transform America's energy infrastructure to accommodateclean hydrogen would, I suspect, evoke awesome resistance from thepetroleum and auto industries. And decisions these days seem dictatedmore by the global marketplace than by the foresight of leaders. Yet the one vision these scientists from Argentina, Egypt, Russia,Germany and Japan tell me may save civilization from choking on its ownexhaust emanates from California. They refer specifically, andreverently, to mandates by the California Air Resources Board and theSouth Coast Air Quality Management District, which require thatzero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) constitute 2% of all cars sold in the stateby 1998 and 10% by 2003. The allure of these requirements is the fact that, with one out of 18Americans living in the L.A. Basin alone, whoever can first manufacture aviable car that meets this standard will get rich. Everybody assures methat batteries aren't going to do it; the acceleration is rotten, therange is too short, and they must be recharged by plugging into dirtypower plants that only shift the pollution elsewhere. The assumption hereis that the only way to build a real ZEV is by using a hydrogen fuelcell, and California's regulations will help force that technology intoexistence. The air quality district's chief scientist, Alan Lloyd, who'sspeaking at the conference, agrees. Lloyd's problem, though, is that he is not exactly considered aprophet in his own land. Rather than instilling native pride,California's world champion air-quality laws, which some believe havewrecked the state's economy, have barely survived legislative plots toscuttle them. And despite the vaunted environmental pedigree of Vice President AlGore, the Clinton Administration hasn't been much help either. While afew projects like experimental wind farms have been encouraged, federalefforts have focused more on improving energy efficiency than ondeveloping clean new sources. Most frustrating to Alan Lloyd is amultimillion-dollar Administration program called PNGV: the Partnershipfor a New Generation of Vehicles, whose goal is to deliver a prototypecar that gets triple today's expected gas mileage--about 80 miles pergallon--by the year 2004. "Which means that after 10 years, they'lldevelop a vehicle that will be illegal in California because it's toodirty," he says, gazing heavenward. "That's unacceptable. Anew-generation vehicle should be fuel-efficient and clean.Leadership should come from the White House, but their agenda is beingdriven more from Detroit." Other energy advocates claim the technology for an 80-m.p.g. vehiclealready exists, but the Administration has simply caved in to the BigThree auto makers and the oil industry. But since I haven't seen fillingstations dispensing hydrogen on American street corners, I ask Lloyd if afuel-cell vehicle designed to run on the stuff is really practical. In the interim, there are lots of ways to make hydrogen besides solar energy, Lloyd explains. Using steam, it can be derived from natural gasor even mixed with it--known as town gas, that was what America onceburned for light and cooking. Hydrogen improves the potency and lowersthe emissions of natural gas, and with some modification it might even beshipped through natural gas pipelines. As for a dearth of servicestations: a similar alarm was once sounded by buggy-whip manufacturers. The real obstacle, Lloyd says, is America's current lust to pawn thefuture for the sake of profits today. "While Detroit hires 100 attorneysto defeat every new emissions standard we establish, Japan assigns 1,000engineers to meet the challenge." Maintaining energy's status quo might make some sense, or at leastsome money, for purveyors of petroleum and internal-combustion engines.But the conference's keynote speaker assures us that the decision won'treally be theirs. University of Colorado physicist emeritus Albert A.Bartlett says he knows little about hydrogen but something about basicarithmetic. He's particularly drawn to calculating the time it takes forthings to double. This is pertinent, he says, to consumption of fossilfuels, because it allows the petroleum and coal industries to deceive theworld about how long those resources will actually last. To illustrate what he means, he proposes that we imagine a species ofbacteria that reproduces by dividing in two. Those two become four, thefour become eight, and so forth. "Let's say we place one bacterium in abottle at 11 a.m, and at noon we observe the bottle to be full. At whatpoint was it half full?" The answer, it turns out, is 11:59 a.m. "Now, if you were a bacterium in that bottle, at what point would yourealize you were running out of space? At 11:55 a.m, when the bottle isonly one-thirty-seconds full, and 97% is open space, yearning fordevelopment?" Everyone giggles. "Now suppose, with a minute to spare, the bacteriadiscover three new bottles to inhabit. They sigh with relief: They havethree times more bottles than had ever been known, quadrupling theirspace resource. Surely this makes them self-sufficient in space. Right?" Except, of course, it doesn't. Bartlett's point is that in exactly twomore minutes, all four bottles will be full. Likewise, when PresidentJimmy Carter noted that in each of three previous decades the world hadburned more fuel than had been consumed previously in all of history, itmeant that fuel consumption was doubling every decade. That rate slowedtemporarily with the energy crisis, but now, with world population risingand today's breakneck industrialization in the Third World, theexponential gobbling of limited resources is again accelerating. "It's seriously misleading when we hear, for example, that at currentlevels of output and recovery coal reserves can be expected to last 500years. We get the mistaken impression that there's 500 years' worth ofcoal left, forgetting that the sentence began with 'at current levels.'That's 500 years, only if there's no growth of production." And petroleum? "In 1993, they announced the largest discovery of oilin the Gulf of Mexico in the last 20 years: 700 million barrels. Itsounds like an enormous number, until you realize that we Americans gothrough roughly 17.7 million barrels a day. Divide 700 by 17.7. It'lllast about 40 days." The auditorium is now silent. "That indicates," he tells us, "thatwe've already made the big petroleum discoveries. Now we're pickingaround the edges, getting the last ones." * In 1975, during the depths of the energy crisis, Tom Harkin arrived inWashington as an Iowa congressman. In his first year on the House Scienceand Technology Committee, he decided that the threat to the future of energy was genuine. Then Carter was elected President, and, to Harkin'srelief, the Administration began dispensing billions and creatingincentives for solar, photovoltaic, wind and ocean thermal energy. Then the next President, Ronald Reagan, dismantled Carter'ssolar-heating apparatus on the White House roof and all the tax breaksand funding for alternative-energy research along with it. During thoselean years, Harkin, now a senator, joined forces with longtime hydrogenzealot Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga of Hawaii to convince whomever they couldthat hydrogen wasn't some dumb fantasy. After Matsunaga's death in 1990,Harkin and the only other hydrogen devotees around, Reps. George E. BrownJr. (D-Colton) and Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.),pushed through a five-year research bill in his memory. The appropriation was minimal, but after Clinton and Gore wereelected, Harkin was sure that would change. Shortly after theirinauguration, he presented the new Administration with a 40-page proposalfor a sustainable energy future based on hydrogen. It showed how, byusing solar photovoltaic electricity to split water, hydrogen actuallybecomes a way to store the power of the sun, because it can be burned atnight or shipped to cold climates where solar energy is scarce. Itexplained that the cheapest way to produce hydrogen could be through"electro-farming": using marginal land to grow energy crops like switchgrass, which could be reduced to hydrogen in a simple device called abiomass gasifier. The gasifier, in turn, would run on excess heat from ahydrogen fuel cell, providing power for the farm. Harkin also rebutted the myth that hydrogen is more dangerous thantraditional fuels, a belief dating to the 1937 explosion that destroyedthe German airship Hindenburg. The 36 who died, he explained, were killedin the fall, not from burning hydrogen, which simply floated away (as itwould have had the Exxon Valdez transported hydrogen instead of oil). Infact, the 61 Hindenburg survivors would not have lived had the blimpcarried natural gas. But, Harkin concluded, in order to make fuel cells or hydrogen carsaffordable, they have to be mass-produced, and before manufacturers willmass-produce them, delivery systems--hydrogen pumps at the corner gasstation--have to be in place. That won't happen until there's mass demandfor them, and so on. This classic chicken-and-egg dilemma, he argued,could be resolved by a federal commitment to a comfortable transitionfrom fossil fuels. He didn't get very far. "I told the President he should grab thepublic's imagination the way Kennedy did with the moon shot, byannouncing in his first State of the Union speech that the U.S. was goingall out for hydrogen and fuel cells. He looked at me like I was slightlynuts." Later Harkin ran into Al Gore in the Executive Office Building. If thegovernment purchased large quantities of photovoltaics, he told the vicepresident, it would lower the cost immensely. The same for fuel cells. Noluck there, either. Instead, the tiny hydrogen coalition in Congressactually has had to fight the Administration's proposed cuts in fundingprovided by the Matsunaga Act. In Washington, Harkin's hydrogen consultant, Sandy Thomas, shows me achart of the Department of Energy' s budget. Out of $18.6 billion, $10billion goes for nuclear-weapons research and cleanup. "That's eventhough we aren't building nuclear weapons anymore. It's anupper-middle-class welfare program for nuclear scientists. Then there'snearly $1 billion for fossil-fuel research and conservation, even thoughthey're running out; $300 million for atomic fission, though we'vestopped building nuclear reactors, and nearly half a billion for fusion,the practical application of which even its most optimistic proponentsadmit is at least 40 years away." "And for hydrogen research?"I ask. "Ten million." I gape. "I know," he says. "We've argued for shifting even $100million out of DOE's nuclear-weapons fund. But those decisions are madeat the top. It's hard to get Hazel O'Leary's ear on this one." At a White House conference on environmental technology in December,chaired by Gore, Energy Secretary O'Leary admits to me that in the wakeof a new Republican Congress that threatens to cut not just budgets butthe entire DOE, she questions the wisdom of bankrolling fusion. Onhydrogen, however, she doesn't yield. "I'm not an apologist fortraditional energy. We've backed some exciting research into wind power.But my strong opinion is that hydrogen isn't there yet. We have to bewilling to deliver more mature technologies to market first. Exceptingfusion, I think our investments fairly represent the energy marketplacefor the near and midterm." At the conference, Gore, five Cabinet officers and President Clinton'sscience adviser meet with 1,400 industrialists, entrepreneurs andenvironmental representatives to discuss how the U.S. can prosper in thegrowing international market for clean, green technology. There areseminars on environmental export financing and transitions to industrialecology--yet barely any mention of energy, except for a small workshop onfuel cells and another on transportation technologies. In the latter, I join a study group chaired by Ford's representativefor the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. Among the pointswe're asked to consider are the prospects for introducing alternativefuels like hydrogen for motor vehicles in the near future. The first tospeak up is General Motors' federal research coordinator. "Very dim. Aslong as gas and diesel stay around $1.20, consumers have no incentive touse anything else." Alternative fuels, he says, all lack the energy density of petroleum, so it will always cost more to get the same amountof power. No one contradicts him, so Ford moves on to the next question. Iinterrupt. "Wait. Isn't the whole reason for this conference the ideathat consumer demand today involves things other than price, such asproducts that don't pollute us to death?" "I'll believe that," GM replies, "when Californians start buying the50 miles-per-gallon vehicles that are already available. The fact is,they don't want cars that are more efficient or cleaner." * "So how would you get people to buy this thing?" I yell to ThomasKlaiber, but he doesn't hear me, because a low-slung, Class C racingseries model and a black, V-12 600SL roar past us at that instant, one oneither side. We're on the Mercedes-Benz test track in Stuttgart, Germany.Klaiber, a mechanical engineer, is head of the Daimler-Benz hydrogen fuelcell group; the van he's driving is the hydrogen-powered vehicle thatprompted Mercedes' grand announcement. If this is really the future we're driving into, at a top cruisingspeed of 50 miles per hour, it's a little like riding the tortoise whilebeing passed by a flock of jeering hares. Even Mercedes buses are passingus as we negotiate banked curves and climb steep little hills thatsuddenly appear in the middle of the straightways. Yet the van itselffeels surprisingly normal. Amid the surrounding internal combustionthunder, the most noticeable difference is how quietly it runs. The fuelcell itself makes no sound. There's only the hum of an air compressor. Some significant technological challenges remain unmet, however. Muchof the cargo area is filled with fiberglass pressure tanks. Althoughhydrogen has up to three times the efficiency of gasoline, its lightnessgives it such low density that even when compressed, its storage requiresat least four times the space of a conventional gas tank. This is finefor the fuel-cell buses that Ballard Power Systems is operatingsuccessfully in Vancouver, because there's plenty of room on their roofsto store hydrogen. To partly alleviate this problem for passenger cars,Daimler-Benz plans to shrink the fuel cell to one-fourth its currentsize, even as it increases horsepower. "The alternative is we store the hydrogen in metal hydrides," Klaibersays, referring to a process in which certain metals absorb hydrogen likea sponge, then release it when heated. "They're fine for commuter cars;citizens tested a fleet for us in Berlin for four years. But for a rangeof 250 miles, you'd need a ton of hydride. Too much." I have just come from Munich, where I rode in a silver 7-Series BMWthat uses a third storage option: liquid hydrogen, exactly like the spaceshuttle. Its ride, acceleration, speed and internal combustion enginemade it virtually indistinguishable from a regular car. Underneath thechassis, however, was a double-walled tank to keep the fuel at -423degrees F. But even with that much insulation, too much hydrogen boilsoff after three days, making it impractical, say, to leave a liquidhydrogen car in an airport parking lot during summer. Plus, it takes one-third the energy of hydrogen to cool it to a liquidstate. So the simplicity and high efficiency of fuel cells, which run atnormal temperatures, seem to be winning the race to the future--wheneverthat is. Riding with Klaiber, it doesn't feel distant. His face is glowing,almost cherubic. He confesses that he loves driving this thing justbecause he knows it's so clean. We pull over. He doesn't turn off the engine but finds a paper cup andholds it over the exhaust pipe. "Drink?" he offers. It's pure, distilled water. * Consumers, I'm told by hydrogen skeptics, won't buy a vehicle whosepower and performance fall short of what we've grown to expect from ourautomobiles. In the Daimler-Benz headquarters, Mercedes' vice presidentof marketing for passenger cars, Jochen Placking, shows me a typical adthey use for the United States: a convertible speeding across a NewMexico desert. "We're selling freedom. The limitless power to goexplore." In the halls here, decades of Mercedes advertising posters show womenwith long, shapely legs protruding from fur coats, leaning againstgorgeous roadsters. How can you make an environmentally correct car intoa sexy status symbol, like a sports coupe? Placking strokes his mustache. "We'll have to find a way to make cleancars fascinating," he says. "Like selling people on safe sex." It's not an altogether encouraging analogy, especially in the context.Germany, world leader in hydrogen research investment--about $12 milliona year since the late 1970s until it was blindsided by the expense ofreunification--is hardly the renewable-energy economy I imagined. Anofficial from the state of Bavaria's electric utility, which has theworld's biggest hydrogen pilot facility, admits there are no plans toscale up to a full-sized working plant. So what will they do in 30 years,when Bavaria's aging nuclear plants must be phased out and fossil fuelsare expected to be scarce? "I can't answer that question. Nobody can. Nobody gives a damn aboutthe future." Back in my own country, I share this story with Michael Heben, a lankyyoung materials scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.Even at BMW and Daimler-Benz, I tell him, hydrogen only gets a smallchunk of the research budget compared to conventional engines. I supposeit's not in a company's interest to invent something that renders itsmost successful product obsolete. Heben shrugs. He reminds me we've seen computers grow smaller, fasterand cheaper at a breathless pace, all because a couple of kids in agarage dared to try to build something better. When Edison was inventinglight bulbs and phonographs, electricity cost 300 times what it does now.As soon as people saw what it could do, they started using it en masse,and the price became practical. Maybe, he suggests, one key discoverywill do the same for hydrogen--like the semiconductor work of JohnTurner, who's splitting water without the intermediate step of firstmaking photovoltaic electricity. Other researchers here are cultivating strains of algae that exhalehydrogen. Heben himself is after a revolutionary way to store it. He'strying to prove that submicroscopic tubes made of activated carbon,developed at IBM, suck up hydrogen atoms via capillary action, like astraw. A fuel tank full of the tough, light tubules, each about abillionth of a meter in diameter, could actually hold far more diffusehydrogen gas than a tank that was empty. "Our goal should be a vehicle that performs like today's cars: samesize, weight, acceleration, frequency of refueling. With good, compact, energy-efficient storage, there's no reason we can't do that with cleanhydrogen." On NREL's lean hydrogen budget, he's currently able to create enoughof a soot-like substance, which contains carbon nanotubules, to oat theinside of a countertop bell jar. To scale up to working size will cost alot more. At this point, he has no idea where funds will come from, butsomething makes him believe they will. "We're so close. So much has been accomplished with just a little. Ifwe really decided that we wanted a clean hydrogen economy, we could haveit by 2010. No more oil spills. Fresh air in Denver and L.A. Think ofit." Maybe he's right. Curiously, amid panic over Republican threats todismember research budgets, hydrogen may prove to be not just a survivorbut also a winner. The new chairman of the House Committee on Science isBob Walker, longtime science mentor to House Speaker Newt Gingrich andhydrogen ally of Tom Harkin. In his office, decorated with pictures of the space shuttle, Walkerreminds me that one of the most powerful forces in the marketplace is"the love Americans have for roaming the planet freely in their own cars.Hydrogen will make that possible when the present technology gets toodirty to extend into the future." He has introduced legislation callingfor a quadrupling of research funds for hydrogen over the next threeyears. Part of the money will be matched by non-federal sources and partexpropriated from technologies Walker believes are either futile oroutmoded. He has little pity for industries that resist change, including automakers. "If Edison were to invent the light bulb today, the headlineswould read, '200,000 candle makers lose their jobs.' We've been throughthis before, like when cars put blacksmiths out of business. It'swrenching, but overall our national competitiveness gets stronger. Thesame thing will happen in energy. The people themselves will demand it." He pauses to gaze at a plaque naming him the latest recipient of theNational Hydrogen Assn.'s Spark M. Matsunaga Award. "Driving on theinterstate, I watch them stringing fiber-optic cable up the median stripfor the Internet. The government talks about the Internet but can't comeup with a structure. Meantime, it's happening because people want it.When they realize they need clean hydrogen, somebody will find a way tosupply that, too." Copyright, The Times Mirror Company; Los Angeles Times, 1995.

In the report, "Hydrogen as a Transportation Fuel: Costs and Benefits," analysts look at hydrogen's economic viability for powering a five-passenger vehicle such as a Ford Taurus with a range of about 80 miles per gallon. LLNL concluded that over time there are compelling reasons to try to shift away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles. For example, with a sizable fleet of alternative vehicles operating in the United States by 2030, oil imports could be cut by two billion barrels per year, saving $1.2 trillion at $30 per barrel of oil. But such savings cannot be achieved overnight, LLNL warned. "The most striking point about oil-use reductions and alternative-fuel vehicles is the very long lead times necessary for large-scale change. Alternative-fuel cars introduced in 2005 do not begin to materially influence aggregate oil use for another decade, and two decades more (2035) are required to replace gasoline vehicles," the report says. "We have shown that you could put hydrogen-fueled vehicle on the road in the near term," said Robert Schock, associate director for energy at LLNL. "It does not have to be as far off as people have supposed." Schock added that policymakers have erred in the past by focusing on the total costs of a hydrogen-fueled auto economy and the associated infrastructure requirements. "What DOE needed to do is to look at the transition phase and ask, How do you get there?" The study points out that hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can fill the niche for hydrogen vehicles without awaiting the development of cost-effective fuel cells. "HEVs coupled with small-scale hydrogen production and/or storage are among the most promising systems," the LLNL report says.

Just Ask the Japanese.By Alan Weisman, Contributing editor Alan Weisman lives in Sonaita, Ariz. His last piece for the magazine was about a progressive community in Columbia Los Angeles Times Sunday March 19, 1995Home EditionLos Angeles Times Magazine, Page 18 West of Denver, Interstate 70 enters Golden, Colo., and begins tocurl through the foothills of the Rockies. There it bisects an unassumingclump of brick buildings--the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Amongthe government's national laboratories, NREL is modest, operating on afraction of the billions commanded by atomic research giants like Sandia,Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. Inside, there are no monstrousparticle accelerators; experiments here are more likely to proceed intest-tube racks, bell jars and small glass beakers, like the one JohnTurner is filling with a clear solution of water and household lye. Turner, a chemist with a graying blond beard and gold-rimmed glasses,sticks a narrow glass slide, coated on one end with a black, mica-likesubstance, into the lye solution. The humming lab ventilators mask thesound of the vehicles whizzing by on the nearby interstate, but Turnerhas spent most of his career here, and during those years he's always hadthe cars in mind. As he aims a pencil-thin beam from a high-intensitylamp at the flask, he puts it this way: "Suppose someone announced heintended to ship millions of gallons of a carcinogenic, explosive fluidthat emits toxic fumes through our downtown and then store it undergroundin our neighborhoods. People would rise up in anger, right?" Wrong. Just outside on I-70, cars are spraying residues of that verypoison all over the mountains. After 11 decades of tinkering, theirinternal combustion engines are miracles of technology with hundreds ofmoving parts. Yet various laws of physics still limit their ability toextract energy from petroleum. Nearly three-fourths of its potentialsimply radiates away or pours, partly combusted, out the tailpipe, risingin geologic layers of brown murk until the Rockies themselves dwindle toghostly smudges. John Turner is among a cadre of scientists trying tosuppress what he regards as humanity's most pervasive, andself-inflicted, epidemic. In a little more than a century, since ThomasAlva Edison invented the light bulb and Henry Ford began to mass-produceautomobiles, man-made energy has become the most addictive drug inhistory. Everybody today was born into this dependency: No one any longercan imagine life without electricity or motorized vehicles. To slake ourcraving, we must dose ourselves and our surroundings daily with deadlyfilth. This ritual is now doomed to spread, as China, India and otherdeveloping nations bestow family cars and refrigerators upon 2 billionnew recruits to the industrial age. Getting an entire world to kick a habit is futile, so Turner is tryingto at least find us a clean needle. As the beam strikes the shiny blacksquare centimeter of semiconductor glued to the submerged portion of hisslide, the surrounding liquid begins to fizz. Electrons stimulated bylight, he explains, are rushing to the semiconductor's surface, hittingwater molecules and splitting them into their component parts: oxygen andhydrogen. He watches the tiny bubbles rise. "For years," he says, "this has beenthe Holy Grail of photoelectric chemists. We're witnessing the directconversion of solar energy into hydrogen." * Cape Canaveral, June, 1994: A group of visiting scientists andengineers is touring the John F.Kennedy Space Center in blue-and-whiteair-conditioned buses. They're here for the World Hydrogen Energy Conference, a biennial event born of the energy crisis 20 years earlier.Although the price of petroleum has since calmed considerably (adjustedfor inflation, it's actually cheaper than pre-1973), a groundswell ofconcern, coupled with numerous breakthroughs, has ballooned thisgathering to nearly 600 researchers from 34 countries. They've come toCanaveral this year for inspiration: The huge tank on the pad, where theshuttle Columbia will presently lift spaceward, is filled with purehydrogen. Since even before the moon shots, all U.S. astronauts' heat,electricity and drinking water have been derived from hydrogen. The U.S.space program is the first step toward realizing these scientists' dream:to switch the planet from an economy fueled with dirty coal and petroleumto one run on clean hydrogen. The idea of something so ubiquitous--hydrogen is the most abundantelement, composing three-fourths of the mass of the universe--replacingdiminishing fossil fuels seems the stuff of fiction. Once, in fact, itwas: In 1870, Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island" described a world thatwould one day derive "an inexhaustible source of heat and light" fromwater's component parts. Back then, Verne didn't realize that this source was also virtuallypollution-free. The cycle is so elegant it seems nearly miraculous:Separate water into its two constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. Burnthe hydrogen for fuel, and it re-couples with oxygen to form water again.No nasty particulates, no insidious carbon monoxide, no eye-stingingozone or sulfur dioxide (at high temperatures, however, small,controllable amounts of nitrous oxides can form when hydrogen is burnedin the presence of air). Mainly, though, hydrogen's exhaust is plainwater vapor--which can then be recaptured and neatly converted again tohydrogen. According to Bill Hoagland, founder of NREL's hydrogen program, itwould take less than a gallon of water to get the same range fromhydrogen that cars currently get from a gallon of gasoline. Becausehydrogen can be made anywhere, I'm told repeatedly, there would be nomore dependency on imported oil. No more OPEC. Maybe no more globalwarming, either, because it emits no greenhouse gases. As for hydrogen'sunfortunate association with bombs and blimps, like the ill-fatedHindenburg, Hoagland reminds me that fossil fuels also readily explode,and studies rate hydrogen safer because it's nontoxic and dissipatesquickly. It seems like the perfect fuel. Yet, these scientists insist, it'sbeen under-researched, under-funded and virtually ignored in Detroit,which perseveres in its allegiance to petroleum, and in Washington, whichpersists in keeping troops ready to defend the Persian Gulf. So why aren't we leaping at this chance to end pollution, energy warsand economic bondage to a few privileged locations that float atop theearth's ebbing supplies of oil? Much of it comes down to money and theseemingly incontestable reign of the petroleum industry. Unlike naturalgas, to which hydrogen is often compared, you can't dig a hole and findit. To tap hydrogen's energy, you have to expend energy because it'salways combined with something else. Having to un-combine it makes itmore expensive, at least in the near term, than crude petroleum products,including natural gas. And no alternative-energy constituency has theclout to buck powerful fossil-fuel lobbies and find a way to pay forretrofitting the world for a brand-new technology. Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy allots hydrogen aboutone-ninetieth of what it spends on continuing petroleum research. (Andtwo-thirds of the DOE's budget doesn't go for energy at all, but fornuclear weapons research and cleanup.) Nor has the public thus fardemonstrated much interest in trading the ease of dirty energy, availableat the turn of an ignition key or click of a light switch, for a majorcommitment to something cleaner and renewable. Yet the learned crowd gathered at the World Hydrogen Conference isconvinced that hydrogen's time must come. Fossil fuels will becomeexpensive again; even today, their true price isn't revealed at the gaspump, where the numbers don't include the cost of pollution and theexpense of protecting our interests in the Persian Gulf. Other countries are less reluctant about hydrogen than the UnitedStates. Two years ago, Japan, an island nation frightened by the prospectof rising seas if the icecaps start to melt, unveiled amultibillion-dollar, 28-year program to form a global hydrogen system.The Japanese are talking power plants, cars, buses, planes, ships androckets, all over the world, all fueled with renewable hydrogen. And there's a recent surprise announcement by Daimler-Benz, the parentcompany of Mercedes-Benz, that has excited many people here: The Germanauto maker claims it has cleared the major obstacles to producing thefirst commercially viable hydrogen-powered automobile. Unless Mercedes isjust trying to spook the competition, hydrogen's prospects have suddenlyimproved faster than anyone dared hope. The Mercedes in question runs ona fuel cell, a refillable device that, like a battery, chemicallyconverts fuel directly to electricity without having to burn it. Fuelcells can function on methanol or natural gas, but with hydrogen, they'reup to three times more efficient than conventional engines. The most advanced models, including the one Daimler-Benz uses, comefrom the Vancouver-based Ballard Power Systems Inc., which designed fuelcells for the Canadian defense department, using technology NASAdeveloped for the Gemini mission and then shelved. Originally large, boxyaffairs of stackable metal plates separated by membranes resemblingplastic wrap, Ballard's fuel cells are now small enough to fit inside aminivan chassis. "When we start producing them in volume," says Ballardco-founder Keith Prater, a former University of Texas chemist, "the pricewill shrink, too." * Surrounded by conference booths promoting the latest in photovoltaics,fuel cells and electrolyzers--devices that separate water into oxygen andhydrogen--I ask Princeton physicist Joan M. Ogden if the United States isletting the future slip away to foreign competitors. She tells me of arecent, unreleased General Motors study admitting that non-polluting fuelcells could be mass-produced for the same cost as a conventional engine."Actually, they should cost less, because they have no moving parts," shesays. "They'll also last longer and be cheaper to maintain." But whileMercedes, BMW and Mazda race to bring a hydrogen car to market, U.S. automakers, by comparison, don't seem very interested. A few years ago, Ogden quit Princeton's glamorous fusion energy program to engage in relatively impoverished research in renewable hydrogen. "Fusion will take decades," she told aghast colleagues. "I wantresults in my lifetime." Soon after, she co-authored a book that proposedmaking hydrogen by splitting water with electricity from solarphotovoltaic (PV) cells. (In this process, as electricity made fromsunlight passes through a pair of electrodes immersed in water, hydrogenbubbles collect around one pole and oxygen around another.) Although PVis still expensive, Ogden argued that mass production and technologicalimprovements would lower costs until they intersect with rising oilprices. The book has been alternately praised and scorned, the latter becauseof a map showing how much of the United States would have to be coveredby photovoltaic cells to produce sufficient hydrogen to meet the totalU.S. annual energy needs. The area is denoted by a circle that reachesfrom Albuquerque nearly to the Mexican border. Critics who derisively tryto guess the value of all that real estate miss the point, she insists.No one ever suggested putting all the PV in the same place. "Obviously, deserts are ideal, because they get the most sun, andminimal rainfall is enough to make plenty of hydrogen. But I did a littlecalculation once. Let's say 2,000 people who work at Princeton drivethere every day. If I wanted to run their cars on hydrogen, how much roofspace would I need to cover with PV to make enough hydrogen fuel forthem? I figured that by putting panels on fewer than half the universityrooftops, even with New Jersey's humble sunshine levels, we could convertall those cars to hydrogen. Think if we did that all over the country." That same afternoon, Peter Lehman, an environmental engineer fromHumboldt State University in Northern California, tells me what it wouldtake to do the same for the 9 million cars in the Los Angeles Basin: "Anarea about 340 square miles. About two-thirds the size, say, of EdwardsAir Force Base." Cover Edwards Air Force Base with shiny photovoltaic panels? "Sure. It would mean a fairly dramatic reorientation of priorities,and a huge expenditure, probably like building the interstate highwaysystem. That took $100 billion and 34 years. But we did it because as asociety we decided it was important. Wouldn't you think that eliminatingall smog might be important?" All week, people here have been repeating a mantra of massive Americaninvestments in the future that paid off, like the Marshall Plan, theinterstate highway system and--especially during a pilgrimage to the oldApollo launching pad--President Kennedy's decision to put men on themoon. Although these ventures involved enormous expense, they wereembraced by the public because of visionary, daring leadership, but theyalso coincided, rather than conflicted, with powerful interests. Acommitment to transform America's energy infrastructure to accommodateclean hydrogen would, I suspect, evoke awesome resistance from thepetroleum and auto industries. And decisions these days seem dictatedmore by the global marketplace than by the foresight of leaders. Yet the one vision these scientists from Argentina, Egypt, Russia,Germany and Japan tell me may save civilization from choking on its ownexhaust emanates from California. They refer specifically, andreverently, to mandates by the California Air Resources Board and theSouth Coast Air Quality Management District, which require thatzero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) constitute 2% of all cars sold in the stateby 1998 and 10% by 2003. The allure of these requirements is the fact that, with one out of 18Americans living in the L.A. Basin alone, whoever can first manufacture aviable car that meets this standard will get rich. Everybody assures methat batteries aren't going to do it; the acceleration is rotten, therange is too short, and they must be recharged by plugging into dirtypower plants that only shift the pollution elsewhere. The assumption hereis that the only way to build a real ZEV is by using a hydrogen fuelcell, and California's regulations will help force that technology intoexistence. The air quality district's chief scientist, Alan Lloyd, who'sspeaking at the conference, agrees. Lloyd's problem, though, is that he is not exactly considered aprophet in his own land. Rather than instilling native pride,California's world champion air-quality laws, which some believe havewrecked the state's economy, have barely survived legislative plots toscuttle them. And despite the vaunted environmental pedigree of Vice President AlGore, the Clinton Administration hasn't been much help either. While afew projects like experimental wind farms have been encouraged, federalefforts have focused more on improving energy efficiency than ondeveloping clean new sources. Most frustrating to Alan Lloyd is amultimillion-dollar Administration program called PNGV: the Partnershipfor a New Generation of Vehicles, whose goal is to deliver a prototypecar that gets triple today's expected gas mileage--about 80 miles pergallon--by the year 2004. "Which means that after 10 years, they'lldevelop a vehicle that will be illegal in California because it's toodirty," he says, gazing heavenward. "That's unacceptable. Anew-generation vehicle should be fuel-efficient and clean.Leadership should come from the White House, but their agenda is beingdriven more from Detroit." Other energy advocates claim the technology for an 80-m.p.g. vehiclealready exists, but the Administration has simply caved in to the BigThree auto makers and the oil industry. But since I haven't seen fillingstations dispensing hydrogen on American street corners, I ask Lloyd if afuel-cell vehicle designed to run on the stuff is really practical. In the interim, there are lots of ways to make hydrogen besides solar energy, Lloyd explains. Using steam, it can be derived from natural gasor even mixed with it--known as town gas, that was what America onceburned for light and cooking. Hydrogen improves the potency and lowersthe emissions of natural gas, and with some modification it might even beshipped through natural gas pipelines. As for a dearth of servicestations: a similar alarm was once sounded by buggy-whip manufacturers. The real obstacle, Lloyd says, is America's current lust to pawn thefuture for the sake of profits today. "While Detroit hires 100 attorneysto defeat every new emissions standard we establish, Japan assigns 1,000engineers to meet the challenge." Maintaining energy's status quo might make some sense, or at leastsome money, for purveyors of petroleum and internal-combustion engines.But the conference's keynote speaker assures us that the decision won'treally be theirs. University of Colorado physicist emeritus Albert A.Bartlett says he knows little about hydrogen but something about basicarithmetic. He's particularly drawn to calculating the time it takes forthings to double. This is pertinent, he says, to consumption of fossilfuels, because it allows the petroleum and coal industries to deceive theworld about how long those resources will actually last. To illustrate what he means, he proposes that we imagine a species ofbacteria that reproduces by dividing in two. Those two become four, thefour become eight, and so forth. "Let's say we place one bacterium in abottle at 11 a.m, and at noon we observe the bottle to be full. At whatpoint was it half full?" The answer, it turns out, is 11:59 a.m. "Now, if you were a bacterium in that bottle, at what point would yourealize you were running out of space? At 11:55 a.m, when the bottle isonly one-thirty-seconds full, and 97% is open space, yearning fordevelopment?" Everyone giggles. "Now suppose, with a minute to spare, the bacteriadiscover three new bottles to inhabit. They sigh with relief: They havethree times more bottles than had ever been known, quadrupling theirspace resource. Surely this makes them self-sufficient in space. Right?" Except, of course, it doesn't. Bartlett's point is that in exactly twomore minutes, all four bottles will be full. Likewise, when PresidentJimmy Carter noted that in each of three previous decades the world hadburned more fuel than had been consumed previously in all of history, itmeant that fuel consumption was doubling every decade. That rate slowedtemporarily with the energy crisis, but now, with world population risingand today's breakneck industrialization in the Third World, theexponential gobbling of limited resources is again accelerating. "It's seriously misleading when we hear, for example, that at currentlevels of output and recovery coal reserves can be expected to last 500years. We get the mistaken impression that there's 500 years' worth ofcoal left, forgetting that the sentence began with 'at current levels.'That's 500 years, only if there's no growth of production." And petroleum? "In 1993, they announced the largest discovery of oilin the Gulf of Mexico in the last 20 years: 700 million barrels. Itsounds like an enormous number, until you realize that we Americans gothrough roughly 17.7 million barrels a day. Divide 700 by 17.7. It'lllast about 40 days." The auditorium is now silent. "That indicates," he tells us, "thatwe've already made the big petroleum discoveries. Now we're pickingaround the edges, getting the last ones." * In 1975, during the depths of the energy crisis, Tom Harkin arrived inWashington as an Iowa congressman. In his first year on the House Scienceand Technology Committee, he decided that the threat to the future of energy was genuine. Then Carter was elected President, and, to Harkin'srelief, the Administration began dispensing billions and creatingincentives for solar, photovoltaic, wind and ocean thermal energy. Then the next President, Ronald Reagan, dismantled Carter'ssolar-heating apparatus on the White House roof and all the tax breaksand funding for alternative-energy research along with it. During thoselean years, Harkin, now a senator, joined forces with longtime hydrogenzealot Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga of Hawaii to convince whomever they couldthat hydrogen wasn't some dumb fantasy. After Matsunaga's death in 1990,Harkin and the only other hydrogen devotees around, Reps. George E. BrownJr. (D-Colton) and Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.),pushed through a five-year research bill in his memory. The appropriation was minimal, but after Clinton and Gore wereelected, Harkin was sure that would change. Shortly after theirinauguration, he presented the new Administration with a 40-page proposalfor a sustainable energy future based on hydrogen. It showed how, byusing solar photovoltaic electricity to split water, hydrogen actuallybecomes a way to store the power of the sun, because it can be burned atnight or shipped to cold climates where solar energy is scarce. Itexplained that the cheapest way to produce hydrogen could be through"electro-farming": using marginal land to grow energy crops like switchgrass, which could be reduced to hydrogen in a simple device called abiomass gasifier. The gasifier, in turn, would run on excess heat from ahydrogen fuel cell, providing power for the farm. Harkin also rebutted the myth that hydrogen is more dangerous thantraditional fuels, a belief dating to the 1937 explosion that destroyedthe German airship Hindenburg. The 36 who died, he explained, were killedin the fall, not from burning hydrogen, which simply floated away (as itwould have had the Exxon Valdez transported hydrogen instead of oil). Infact, the 61 Hindenburg survivors would not have lived had the blimpcarried natural gas. But, Harkin concluded, in order to make fuel cells or hydrogen carsaffordable, they have to be mass-produced, and before manufacturers willmass-produce them, delivery systems--hydrogen pumps at the corner gasstation--have to be in place. That won't happen until there's mass demandfor them, and so on. This classic chicken-and-egg dilemma, he argued,could be resolved by a federal commitment to a comfortable transitionfrom fossil fuels. He didn't get very far. "I told the President he should grab thepublic's imagination the way Kennedy did with the moon shot, byannouncing in his first State of the Union speech that the U.S. was goingall out for hydrogen and fuel cells. He looked at me like I was slightlynuts." Later Harkin ran into Al Gore in the Executive Office Building. If thegovernment purchased large quantities of photovoltaics, he told the vicepresident, it would lower the cost immensely. The same for fuel cells. Noluck there, either. Instead, the tiny hydrogen coalition in Congressactually has had to fight the Administration's proposed cuts in fundingprovided by the Matsunaga Act. In Washington, Harkin's hydrogen consultant, Sandy Thomas, shows me achart of the Department of Energy' s budget. Out of $18.6 billion, $10billion goes for nuclear-weapons research and cleanup. "That's eventhough we aren't building nuclear weapons anymore. It's anupper-middle-class welfare program for nuclear scientists. Then there'snearly $1 billion for fossil-fuel research and conservation, even thoughthey're running out; $300 million for atomic fission, though we'vestopped building nuclear reactors, and nearly half a billion for fusion,the practical application of which even its most optimistic proponentsadmit is at least 40 years away." "And for hydrogen research?"I ask. "Ten million." I gape. "I know," he says. "We've argued for shifting even $100million out of DOE's nuclear-weapons fund. But those decisions are madeat the top. It's hard to get Hazel O'Leary's ear on this one." At a White House conference on environmental technology in December,chaired by Gore, Energy Secretary O'Leary admits to me that in the wakeof a new Republican Congress that threatens to cut not just budgets butthe entire DOE, she questions the wisdom of bankrolling fusion. Onhydrogen, however, she doesn't yield. "I'm not an apologist fortraditional energy. We've backed some exciting research into wind power.But my strong opinion is that hydrogen isn't there yet. We have to bewilling to deliver more mature technologies to market first. Exceptingfusion, I think our investments fairly represent the energy marketplacefor the near and midterm." At the conference, Gore, five Cabinet officers and President Clinton'sscience adviser meet with 1,400 industrialists, entrepreneurs andenvironmental representatives to discuss how the U.S. can prosper in thegrowing international market for clean, green technology. There areseminars on environmental export financing and transitions to industrialecology--yet barely any mention of energy, except for a small workshop onfuel cells and another on transportation technologies. In the latter, I join a study group chaired by Ford's representativefor the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. Among the pointswe're asked to consider are the prospects for introducing alternativefuels like hydrogen for motor vehicles in the near future. The first tospeak up is General Motors' federal research coordinator. "Very dim. Aslong as gas and diesel stay around $1.20, consumers have no incentive touse anything else." Alternative fuels, he says, all lack the energy density of petroleum, so it will always cost more to get the same amountof power. No one contradicts him, so Ford moves on to the next question. Iinterrupt. "Wait. Isn't the whole reason for this conference the ideathat consumer demand today involves things other than price, such asproducts that don't pollute us to death?" "I'll believe that," GM replies, "when Californians start buying the50 miles-per-gallon vehicles that are already available. The fact is,they don't want cars that are more efficient or cleaner." * "So how would you get people to buy this thing?" I yell to ThomasKlaiber, but he doesn't hear me, because a low-slung, Class C racingseries model and a black, V-12 600SL roar past us at that instant, one oneither side. We're on the Mercedes-Benz test track in Stuttgart, Germany.Klaiber, a mechanical engineer, is head of the Daimler-Benz hydrogen fuelcell group; the van he's driving is the hydrogen-powered vehicle thatprompted Mercedes' grand announcement. If this is really the future we're driving into, at a top cruisingspeed of 50 miles per hour, it's a little like riding the tortoise whilebeing passed by a flock of jeering hares. Even Mercedes buses are passingus as we negotiate banked curves and climb steep little hills thatsuddenly appear in the middle of the straightways. Yet the van itselffeels surprisingly normal. Amid the surrounding internal combustionthunder, the most noticeable difference is how quietly it runs. The fuelcell itself makes no sound. There's only the hum of an air compressor. Some significant technological challenges remain unmet, however. Muchof the cargo area is filled with fiberglass pressure tanks. Althoughhydrogen has up to three times the efficiency of gasoline, its lightnessgives it such low density that even when compressed, its storage requiresat least four times the space of a conventional gas tank. This is finefor the fuel-cell buses that Ballard Power Systems is operatingsuccessfully in Vancouver, because there's plenty of room on their roofsto store hydrogen. To partly alleviate this problem for passenger cars,Daimler-Benz plans to shrink the fuel cell to one-fourth its currentsize, even as it increases horsepower. "The alternative is we store the hydrogen in metal hydrides," Klaibersays, referring to a process in which certain metals absorb hydrogen likea sponge, then release it when heated. "They're fine for commuter cars;citizens tested a fleet for us in Berlin for four years. But for a rangeof 250 miles, you'd need a ton of hydride. Too much." I have just come from Munich, where I rode in a silver 7-Series BMWthat uses a third storage option: liquid hydrogen, exactly like the spaceshuttle. Its ride, acceleration, speed and internal combustion enginemade it virtually indistinguishable from a regular car. Underneath thechassis, however, was a double-walled tank to keep the fuel at -423degrees F. But even with that much insulation, too much hydrogen boilsoff after three days, making it impractical, say, to leave a liquidhydrogen car in an airport parking lot during summer. Plus, it takes one-third the energy of hydrogen to cool it to a liquidstate. So the simplicity and high efficiency of fuel cells, which run atnormal temperatures, seem to be winning the race to the future--wheneverthat is. Riding with Klaiber, it doesn't feel distant. His face is glowing,almost cherubic. He confesses that he loves driving this thing justbecause he knows it's so clean. We pull over. He doesn't turn off the engine but finds a paper cup andholds it over the exhaust pipe. "Drink?" he offers. It's pure, distilled water. * Consumers, I'm told by hydrogen skeptics, won't buy a vehicle whosepower and performance fall short of what we've grown to expect from ourautomobiles. In the Daimler-Benz headquarters, Mercedes' vice presidentof marketing for passenger cars, Jochen Placking, shows me a typical adthey use for the United States: a convertible speeding across a NewMexico desert. "We're selling freedom. The limitless power to goexplore." In the halls here, decades of Mercedes advertising posters show womenwith long, shapely legs protruding from fur coats, leaning againstgorgeous roadsters. How can you make an environmentally correct car intoa sexy status symbol, like a sports coupe? Placking strokes his mustache. "We'll have to find a way to make cleancars fascinating," he says. "Like selling people on safe sex." It's not an altogether encouraging analogy, especially in the context.Germany, world leader in hydrogen research investment--about $12 milliona year since the late 1970s until it was blindsided by the expense ofreunification--is hardly the renewable-energy economy I imagined. Anofficial from the state of Bavaria's electric utility, which has theworld's biggest hydrogen pilot facility, admits there are no plans toscale up to a full-sized working plant. So what will they do in 30 years,when Bavaria's aging nuclear plants must be phased out and fossil fuelsare expected to be scarce? "I can't answer that question. Nobody can. Nobody gives a damn aboutthe future." Back in my own country, I share this story with Michael Heben, a lankyyoung materials scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.Even at BMW and Daimler-Benz, I tell him, hydrogen only gets a smallchunk of the research budget compared to conventional engines. I supposeit's not in a company's interest to invent something that renders itsmost successful product obsolete. Heben shrugs. He reminds me we've seen computers grow smaller, fasterand cheaper at a breathless pace, all because a couple of kids in agarage dared to try to build something better. When Edison was inventinglight bulbs and phonographs, electricity cost 300 times what it does now.As soon as people saw what it could do, they started using it en masse,and the price became practical. Maybe, he suggests, one key discoverywill do the same for hydrogen--like the semiconductor work of JohnTurner, who's splitting water without the intermediate step of firstmaking photovoltaic electricity. Other researchers here are cultivating strains of algae that exhalehydrogen. Heben himself is after a revolutionary way to store it. He'strying to prove that submicroscopic tubes made of activated carbon,developed at IBM, suck up hydrogen atoms via capillary action, like astraw. A fuel tank full of the tough, light tubules, each about abillionth of a meter in diameter, could actually hold far more diffusehydrogen gas than a tank that was empty. "Our goal should be a vehicle that performs like today's cars: samesize, weight, acceleration, frequency of refueling. With good, compact, energy-efficient storage, there's no reason we can't do that with cleanhydrogen." On NREL's lean hydrogen budget, he's currently able to create enoughof a soot-like substance, which contains carbon nanotubules, to oat theinside of a countertop bell jar. To scale up to working size will cost alot more. At this point, he has no idea where funds will come from, butsomething makes him believe they will. "We're so close. So much has been accomplished with just a little. Ifwe really decided that we wanted a clean hydrogen economy, we could haveit by 2010. No more oil spills. Fresh air in Denver and L.A. Think ofit." Maybe he's right. Curiously, amid panic over Republican threats todismember research budgets, hydrogen may prove to be not just a survivorbut also a winner. The new chairman of the House Committee on Science isBob Walker, longtime science mentor to House Speaker Newt Gingrich andhydrogen ally of Tom Harkin. In his office, decorated with pictures of the space shuttle, Walkerreminds me that one of the most powerful forces in the marketplace is"the love Americans have for roaming the planet freely in their own cars.Hydrogen will make that possible when the present technology gets toodirty to extend into the future." He has introduced legislation callingfor a quadrupling of research funds for hydrogen over the next threeyears. Part of the money will be matched by non-federal sources and partexpropriated from technologies Walker believes are either futile oroutmoded. He has little pity for industries that resist change, including automakers. "If Edison were to invent the light bulb today, the headlineswould read, '200,000 candle makers lose their jobs.' We've been throughthis before, like when cars put blacksmiths out of business. It'swrenching, but overall our national competitiveness gets stronger. Thesame thing will happen in energy. The people themselves will demand it." He pauses to gaze at a plaque naming him the latest recipient of theNational Hydrogen Assn.'s Spark M. Matsunaga Award. "Driving on theinterstate, I watch them stringing fiber-optic cable up the median stripfor the Internet. The government talks about the Internet but can't comeup with a structure. Meantime, it's happening because people want it.When they realize they need clean hydrogen, somebody will find a way tosupply that, too." Copyright, The Times Mirror Company; Los Angeles Times, 1995.

How are the noble gases obtained? What is the temperature of a lightning bolt? High school students comprising 44 teams and some 250 students from schools across Colorado will face such mind-boggling questions as they test their mental agility in the 1996 Colorado Science Bowl, Feb. 24 at the Auraria Campus of Metropolitan State College in Denver. The two winning Colorado teams will receive an expense-paid trip to the finals in Washington, D.C., May 3-6 where they will compete against winners of other regional competitions. Some 1,500 schools will participate in regional competitions in 37 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia prior to obtaining a final spot in the National Science Bowl Competition. Prizes include international and domestic trips to work with laboratory and field scientists on hands-on scientific research activities. The competition resembles the General Electric College Bowl and includes a number of round robin competitions in the morning and double elimination contests in the afternoon. Student teams of four, with one alternate, face-off in a fast-paced match of questions and answers in physics, math, biology, chemistry, computers and the earth sciences. The contest not only puts the students' knowledge and logic to the test, but involves strategy, quick recall and quickness on the buzzers. The regional competition is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the DOE Golden Field Office, Kaiser-Hill, Midwest Research Institute and Metropolitan State College. The National Science Bowl is a public/private partnership between DOE, Cray Research Foundation, Bechtel, Texas Instruments and British Petroleum (Alaska), among others. DOE began the National Science Bowl six years ago, and the competition has evolved into one of the Department's premier educational programs designed to help stimulate young people's interest in science and math. DOE hopes student contenders will become the engineers and scientists of tomorrow. The Science Bowl is scheduled from 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. in the North Classroom Building at Metropolitan State College (at Speer and Larimer) on the Auraria Campus.

While carbon dioxide is emitted during biomass combustion, an equal amount of carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere during the biomass growth phase, thus biomass fuels "recycle" atmospheric carbon, minimizing global warming impacts. The use of waste biomass reduces the volume of material sent to landfills, extending the life of existing landfills. Biomass combustion results in lsess ash than coal, reducing ash disposal costs and landfill space requirements. The biomass ash can also be used as a soil amendment in farm land. Perennial energy crops (grasses and trees) have distinctly lower environmental impacts than conventional farm crops that are replanted annually. Energy crops require less fertilization and herbicides and provide much more vegetative cover throughout the year, providing protection against soil erosion and watershed quality deterioration, as well as improved wildlife cover.

This technology converts natural gas into electricity to provide a quiet, clean, and highlyefficient on-site electric generating system and thermal energy source that can reduce facility energyservice costs by 20 percent to 40 percent over conventional energy services. The natural gas fuel cellutilizes an alternative cogeneration technology for improving natural gas utilization and efficiency. vThe natural gas fuel cell is an environmentally friendly fossil-fueled energy generator with cleaneremissions than the ambient air in some cities. Natural gas fuel cells can serve effectively as an on-siteenergy supply to meet needs for base-load electricity, heat, and hot water, while local electric andnatural gas utilities provide for energy demand beyond the natural gas fuel cell capacity.

Heat pump water heaters presently comprise only a very small fraction of the residential waterheaters sold in the United States. Laboratory testing and theoretical analysis have shown heat pumpwater heating technology to be technically valid, and its performance has been conclusivelydemonstrated in the field. They have been successfully used in a number of Federal facilities, mostly in Hawaii and other Pacificislands.

By Susan Moon, National Renewable Energy Laboratory September, 1995 A technology that stands at the vanguard of biomass gasificationhas found a home in a state with the resources, the leadership,and the track record to prove its merit. Vermont has forests covering80% of its land, leaders who vigorously support the value of harvestingwood residues from this home-grown energy source, and experienceoperating the nation's largest wood-fired power plant. That plant, the McNeil Generating Station in Burlington, is alsothe site of the first industrial scale-up of Battelle ColumbusLaboratory's biomass gasification process. Patrick Leahy, UnitedStates Senator from Vermont, has been a long-time project supporter.At groundbreaking ceremonies on August 17 of this year, he offeredcongratulations to all. "It was kind of taking a leap offaith in this when I started moving for help from the Departmentof Energy and, thank goodness, the Secretary and those in hertop organization have been so helpful to us," he said. Senator Leahy added, "Whether we're talking about gasificationor wind energy or any of the other major energy areas, the federalgovernment can help-at least in the development... and once youprove it can be done, you can be on your own. And here's a casewhere we as Vermonters can be extremely happy to see somethingthat will work, that uses the renewable resource that we have,and cuts dependence on foreign oil. If it works here... it willwork everywhere else in this country. We're proving as Vermonters,and with help from the federal government, that if we work togetherrather than at cross purposes, all of us benefit." The Vermont gasifier project is part of a major U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE) initiative to demonstrate gasification of renewablebiomass for electricity production. The project will integratethe Battelle high-throughput gasifier with a high-efficiency gasturbine. DOE has provided financial and technical support forthe project since 1980 in a variety of ways-by supporting Battelle'sgasifier technology since its inception, by providing technicalexpertise and stewardship through DOE's National Renewable EnergyLaboratory (NREL), and by participating in the McNeil scale-upas a cost-share partner. Karl Rabago, who heads up DOE's Office of Utility Technologies,was clearly pleased to be taking part in the groundbreaking ceremonies."We're here on the verge of a really, really exciting future,"he said. "It's a future in which we can enjoy entirely neweconomic vitality in rural areas and in agricultural productionin this country. It's a future in which our business and our industrycollaborate to make and sell these technologies not just aroundthis country, but all around the world. That future begins withefforts like these." Planting the Seed in Ohio The effort referred to by Rabago began 15 years ago in the agriculturallyand technologically fertile valley of central Ohio with Battelle'sinitial investigations of biomass gasification from a coal-gas perspective. After all, says Battelle's Mark Paisley, "We'ddone that. Battelle has had experience in coal gasification sinceour starting in 1929." Those early investigations showed that wood gasification is muchless troublesome than coal, and that wood is much more reactivethan coal--this high reactivity is one of the characteristics ofbiomass in general that make it an excellent feedstock for gasificationpurposes. With funding from DOE throughout the process, Battellein 1980 built a pilot plant to take advantage of these inherentproperties of biomass and, in 1983, expanded the size of the gasifierto 10 inches in diameter and made other improvements, such asautomating the feed system. "We found that the generation of gas, the characteristicsof what went on, and the throughputs that we could get were unique,"says Paisley. During 1983 the substance of the patent was defined(with Paisley and Herman Feldmann as inventors of patent), andsince then, ongoing experimentation has helped to further definewhat the process is all about. The McNeil design will be finetuned from the perspective gained from 15 years of meticulousresearch and the resulting solid data base--and Paisley is convincedthat this can make the difference between success and failurein Burlington. Referring to the Battelle gasifier as "high throughput"is no exaggeration. Paisley notes, "The upper limit in ourpilot plant is how fast can the feeder be run. It is not the reactor,it is not reactivity, it is not residence time--it's the motorwill only go that fast. That really has been our limit so far." The scale-up design is based on the same throughput (pounds ofbiomass per unit cross section of the reactor) as the pilot plant,which means that Paisley, along with others who have been monitoring the technology over the years, will be watching with great interestto see if that upper limit will be reached in Burlington. Any kind of gasification is an endothermic, or heat-consuming,reaction; with Battelle's process, that heat is provided by circulatinghot sand (1800 to 1900 F) through the gasifier. "We're literallysurrounding every particle of biomass with hot sand and that makes it break down very quickly and produces as much gas as possible,"says Paisley. "In that 10-inch gasifier, we're feeding overa thousand pounds of wood an hour. That's one of the reasons theprocess is as economical as it is. Burlington's gasifier, forexample, is three and a half feet in diameter. It will feed 200tons a day of dry wood. That's 400 tons a day of the green woodas it comes in." With Contributions from Colorado Based in Golden, Colorado, NREL is a national laboratory responsiblefor facilitating DOE's mission with regard to research, development,and implementation of renewable energy technologies. During thelast few years of the1980s, the interest level and funding forbiomass gasification had waned. But the picture brightened in1990. As DOE's contract administrator, NREL issued a request forproposals on projects involving hot gas cleanup and hot gas conditioning.Battelle was selected to do, primarily, the hot gas conditioningwork at its gasifier pilot plant. In the ensuing years, NREL continued to work with Battelle throughthis subcontract, which has propelled the overall biomass gasification process forward. During this time, the two laboratories have workedclosely on identifying catalysts for the hot gas conditioningwork, which is of critical importance because of the presence of tars in biogas. These tars constitute only a small componentof biogas, but they can cause large problems (e.g., equipmentfouling) during the gas's downstream use. Working together, researchers at Battelle and NREL have identified and tested an extremely promisingcatalyst, DN-34. Biogas Powers the Turbine The technical advantages of Battelle's biomass gasification processversus other comparable technologies offer ample proof that DOE'sinvestment over the years has arned major dividends. The Battelleprocess: Features an inherently high throughput, which allows for smallerand less costly reactors. Incorporates the use of indirect heating, thereby producinga gas with consistent heating value regardless of the feedstock'smoisture content. Produces a medium Btu gas--one that is interchangeable with naturalgas--without the added expense of an oxygen plant. Produces a gas that is free of nitrogen, resulting in a productgas with a higher energy content than would be the case if airgasification of biomass were used. All of these factors have allowed biogas production technologyto take a huge and long-awaited efficiency leap. As part of Battelle'sgas-conditioning subcontract work with NREL, the next logicalstep--or in this case, leap--was to use biogas to power a gas turbine.Accordingly, biomass industry history was made on June 23, 1994,at Battelle's pilot plant when biogas successfully powered a gasturbine--from wood chips to biogas to gas turbine to electricalpower. Solar Turbines, a division of Caterpillar, loaned Battelle a standardSpartan® 200 kW natural gas turbine; its only modificationis an added parallel fuel line so that either natural gas or productgas can be run. The turbine itself is unchanged--the operator simplythrows a switch to go from natural gas to biomass-derived gas. The gasification process--and particularly the Battelle process--getsmore Btus from the wood than simply burning the wood, and also captures waste heat for recycling back into the process. A gas turbine is much more efficient for power generation than a steamturbine. These factors have propelled the Battelle pilot plant toward a net wood-to-electricity efficiency of 35%. For comparison,the net efficiency of the current McNeil mode of operation, wherewood chips are burned in a boiler to run a steam turbine for electrical power, is on the order of 25%. This 10% efficiency improvement is dramatic--especially when one considers that such improvementsare typically measured by a few tenths of one percent at a time. Two Brothers from Georgia No wonder Milton and Glenn Farris are so excited. These Atlanta brothers are big believers in the technology--so big, in fact,that their Future Energy Resources Company, or FERCO, stands readyto invest millions of dollars in it. FERCO signed on as Battelle'slicensee in 1992 and will share the cost of the scale-up withDOE and the McNeil joint owners. The Farrises have backgrounds in finance and real estate development,which includes energy-related projects such as oil and gas drilling and pipeline drilling. By virtue of their father's 45 years ofemployment with Gulf Oil, the brothers grew up with an appreciation of the energy business. Glenn Farris, Project Director for the McNeil scale-up, commentsthat FERCO couldn't pass up the opportunity to take advantageof the licenses and patents on Battelle's gasifier technology. FERCO likes the technology's potential for applications in thepower industry, the pulp and paper industry, and the gasification of biomass fractions from municipal solid waste. "We never looked at it purely from the stand point of alternative energy,but as an environmentally friendly technology that produced energy." As Battelle's exclusive licensee for North America, FERCO owns the technology. The company's role involves providing up-front risk money--the money that's needed to do the first demonstrationof a technology; identifying potential customers for the nextinstallations; and making sure that the best interests of thetechnology are being represented through potential conflicts withother technologies. Of particular interest to Glenn Farris is that "It's a greatopportunity to work on something that could be incredibly important one day. It may sound trite--and don't get me wrong... we expect to make bags of money--but there aren't too many opportunities that come along that give one the ability to do something that at the end of the road can make a difference--that have a place in the future of energy development." Vermont's Biomass Energy Vision The Farrises found leaders in Vermont's state government who sharethis vision. The state's offices in Montpelier are heated withwood-chip power--and have been since the mid-1970s. A state-sponsoredprogram has enabled schools to install self-contained, fully automated,wood-chip gasifiers that fill all heating and hot water needs--andtrim heating bills by up to 80%. It's readily apparent that Richard Sedano, Commissioner of thestate's Public Service Department, relishes discussing the biomasscomponent of Vermont's overall energy plan. "First, we havea sense that our economy is greatly affected by how successful our wood industry is. A lot of folks in rural Vermont rely onwood harvesting for some of their income. The idea is to promote integrated harvesting--lumber, paper, energy--three different linesof products rather than just two--to create a volume of energy from wood that will create economies of scale. Those are the kinds of real growth opportunities that rural Vermont really needs." He points out that New Englanders are very interested in air quality--andthe prospect of hastening the retirement of some dirty power plantsand replacing them with clean biomass facilities is attractive. "I don't have any illusions that we're going to replace the whole kit and caboodle with biomass, but to the degree that wecan go from 5% to 20%, that will create a lot easier nut to deal with." Sedano credits the pioneering spirit of the Burlington ElectricDepartment (BED) for its installation of the 50-megawatt McNeilwood-fired generating plant in 1984. "It has worked terrifically for 11 years," says Sedano, "except that oil pricesdidn't hit $70 a barrel like we had all thought." Nonetheless, the experience gained from operating this plant--learning about silvicultural practice as it relates to energy, what kindof ordering cycles are needed, how to manage fuel contracts betweenutilities and the fuel supplier--convinced Sedano and others thatbiomass was something Vermont needed to view as a strength. But25% efficiency? "The break for me came when I learned about gasification," says Sedano. Vermont's "Wood Energy Specialist" is in full agreementon that score. Norm Hudson is a 66-year-old, lifelong forester who believes that treetops, and other parts of trees not used by loggers, should never be wasted. He wants foresters, loggers,and forest landowners to have markets for selling those materials--andfor selling their "weed" trees as well. More than this, he wants his fellow Vermonters to get full value from forest assets. "Wood-chip gasifiers are efficient and clean burning," says Hudson, "but most people don't understand that. That'swhat I'm about. That's what I do." He makes videos such as "Heating Schools with Wood Chips"and shows them to local Lions and Kiwanis clubs, to townspeople,and to businesses that could profit from gasifier technology.He knows that the gasifier and gas turbine technology representedby the McNeil project is the way of the future... that it mayrevolutionize the way electricity is generated in the world. Hewhispers (yes, whispers), "The wood-fired steam turbine isa dinosaur--we're not going to make those here anymore." Thisis awful knowledge to keep all to yourself, but saying it outloud... well, what would people think? "One of these days, I've got to quit," Hudson says."But I get charged up--almost every day I get some high becauseof what I see happening around me." He says the Burlingtonscale-up will be tiny in comparison to the rest of the plant,but it's going to have close to the wallop of the big one. And he's already planning that video. Coming Together in Burlington All the ingredients were in place--an ace technology, a wood-firedpower plant with years of successful operation, private investorseager to drive the project, and multiple layers of governmentsupport. So from here, it must have been easy--right? Well, not quite. A year's worth of tenacity was required of allparties involved. To begin with, says Sedano, "In a marketplacewhere there was some risk of overcapacity, where people are retrenchingand regrouping, to try something new is sort of against the grain." McNeil was an ideal situation, says FERCO's Glenn Farris, but"negotiations were an arduous task." Sedano acknowledges that "it was a tough road... and finally,it was the ability of the government and the developer and theutilities to realize that we just needed to talk about it."He says the breakthrough came when the disparate entities finallygot to the point of asking, "How can we do it?" ratherthan just rehashing everything that was "wrong" withit. The McNeil Generating Station is jointly owned by BED, CentralVermont Public Service Corporation, Green Mountain Power Corporation,and the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority. A major impetusin driving the project forward is the joint owners' interest inhaving access to commercially available, clean, efficient, andcost-effective renewable resource generating technologies. Construction Begins FERCO has designated Zurn NEPCO as the project's Engineering andConstruction firm. In the last decade, Zurn has built approximatelyone-third of all the biomass electric facilities in North America.The company is keenly interested in maintaining its involvementin biomass gasification, especially where it concerns advancedconversion technologies (such as the gas turbine component ofthis project). This industrial scale-up, which is 20 times the size of Battelle'spilot-scale plant, is being constructed in three phases. Phase1, which included the design, engineering, and permitting, hasbeen completed on time and under budget. Under Phase 2, scheduled to last approximately 15 months, a 400 green ton per day gasifier will be installed and tested. The gasifieroutput will be fired as a supplementary fuel in the existing McNeilboiler. Phase 3 will begin after operating experience is gained with the gasifier, and specific emissions from product gas combustion aredetermined. Under this phase, a gas combustion turbine will be installed to accept product gas from the gasifier and form an integral part of a combined-cycle system; the biogas producedshould account for 15 megawatts of the plant's current 50-megawatt capacity. The launching of the gasifier construction phase seems long overdue to many of those involved. From Battelle's Mark Paisley: "WhenI was in college and was told it took 10 years to develop new technology, I thought the professor was crazy. And now here I am with a piece of new technology that's taken 15 years." He notes that it takes a long time and a lot of resources, pointingout that FERCO has identified many companies interested in buildingthe second gasifier system, but only one that was ready to trythe first one. The fact that even one stepped forward speaks tothe risk reduction that DOE funding has brought about. With thisfunding, says Paisley, "We have been able to demonstrate not just pieces of the technology, but rather an integrated system." At the project's ground breaking on August 17, DOE's Karl Rabago looked out over the crowd of interested onlookers. Many of thoseassembled had worked energetically and diligently for many yearsto make the day's events a reality. "We're here because ofthe potential of what can and will be done by the collaboration of all these people, this wonderful technology, and all the supportwe've seen," he said. And, once again, Rabago looked to the future. "It's a future in which vital energy... doesn't come at the expense of our environment,doesn't come with huge price tags for capital investments andfor decommissioning. It doesn't come with an enslavement to somebody else's energy supply. We didn't get here by accident. It has taken years of long commitment by Senator Leahy and his staff, by peoplein industry and business with vision, and yes, even those bureaucrat sat the Department of Energy and the National Renewable EnergyLaboratory, to make this event possible. It will take years more commitment. We can't leave the grabbing of this golden ring tochance."

Research that interacts with and supports thework of NREL's subcontractors (such as Battelle Columbus Laboratory)is of particular relevance to the success of projects such asthe gasifier scale-up at the McNeil Generating Station. NREL hasplayed an important role by working with Battelle to develop thecatalyst (DN-34) that will be used for biogas conditioning atthe McNeil site. When biomass is gasified, the resulting gas contains trace amountsof tar (which is a collective term for generally high molecularweight hydrocarbons). Steve Gebhard, NREL chemical engineer, explainsthe problems that can result: "Many of the chemical compoundsthat make up the tar are not very volatile, so even small amountsof tar will eventually "plate out" on downstream equipment, graduallyfouling it in the process. If you've got tar in a gas that's runningdown a pipe, for example, it will end up coating cooler sectionsof the pipe," says Gebhard. "Even worse, you can imaginewhat would happen if you put that tar in a gas turbine, whichhas internal workings much like those in a jet engine--a lot ofdamage could be done to a very expensive piece of equipment." Gebhard describes the work leading to the development of the tar-crackingcatalyst DN-34 as a complementary effort by Battelle and NREL."We would do catalyst development work, catalyst characterization...We would see certain behavior out there [in Ohio], and would comeback here in the lab and do experiments on a small scale and figureout what was going on in terms of the chemistry." This practical approach makes sense--it costs much more to runBattelle's pilot-scale plant than NREL's lab-scale equipment.It also adds flexibility to the process, says Gebhard. "Testingonly 10 to 20 grams of catalyst at a time allows us to try newideas--like doubling up catalysts, changing temperatures, adjustinghow much steam is used, raising or lowering the flow rate of gasover the catalyst. We can also try experimental designs to seeif potential catalysts or processes look promising before Battelletests them." This pairing of the two laboratories has proven its worth withthis development of a valuable new catalyst. "In one passover the catalyst bed, the majority of the chemical compoundsthat make up the tar are reduced in concentration by better than80%," says Gebhard. "And the good news is that the DN-34catalyst doesn't deactivate nor does it simply trap the tar--itchemically converts it into additional fuel gas for the turbine." The research process was markedly enhanced by the use of a newanalytical tool developed by NREL--the transportable molecularbeam mass spectrometer, or TMBMS for short. Its compact size andtransportability are major assets--assets that allowed this $300,000instrument to be used on site at the Battelle laboratory, helpingto ascertain just how well the DN-34 catalyst was performing.Gebhard offers a simplified explanation of how the TMBMS works:"It separates the molecules in the gases and vapors in thebiogas according to weight, which, because each molecule has aunique molecular weight, allows us to determine the chemical compoundsthat are present in the gas." The TMBMS can directly sample biogas coming straight out of thegasifier or out of the DN-34 catalyst reactor. Biogas in bothcases is very hot (up to 1500 F), which makes the use of othersampling methods difficult. The TMBMS operates in real time, taking"snapshots" of biogas composition as fast as once persecond. These capabilities allowed the NREL researchers to takedata fast enough to see any fluctuations in the flow and get afull chemical analysis at the same time. "When we looked at the raw gas, we saw a lot of differentchemical compounds in the tar--when we looked at the gas afterone pass over DN-34, we saw that a large number of these couldno longer be detected," says Gebhard. "The decreasewas quite dramatic, and told us that gas conditioning with DN-34was lowering the concentrations of some tar compounds down intothe low parts-per-million range."

His involvementbegan with plant design in 1979, to Project Engineer during theconstruction phase, and finally, to Plant Superintendent in 1985when the plant's managing entity, Burlington Electric Company,offered him that position. Irving believes using wood as fuel has brought many benefits tothe region. "We've done good things for the environment.Our emissions are very, very low and have become the standardby which other plants are judged. I think we've done a lot forthe local economy." "The problem we're having right now is that it's hard tocompete economically with low-cost oil and coal," he says."If this technology will allow wood again to be a competitivesource of energy, I'm pretty excited about it... it'll kind ofput us back in the viability column again." Most of the plant's 40 employees have been around since McNeilwas commissioned in 1984. As a dispatched plant, the McNeil personnelwait for their daily phone call from the New England Power Poolto find out when, and if, they will go on line the next day. Rightnow, other available power sources--nuclear, oil, coal--are cheaperalternatives when considering only the price of the fuel, whichhas a lot to do with why McNeil is not a baseload plant. Operating a wood-fired plant that often starts up at 4:00 a.m.can bring some extra noise and dust to a neighborhood--and McNeilsits in the middle of a Burlington neighborhood. Irving citescreative solutions--silencers on the silencers, strobe lights insteadof beepers on the front-end loaders, containment systems for ashand sawdust--for keeping complaints to minimum. And the neighborsknow that each January they can make their annual contributionto Mount Balsam--the huge pile of discarded Christmas trees thatgets chipped up and burned as fuel in McNeil's boiler. Approximately 75% of McNeil's regular wood supply is in the formof chips made from the residue portions (the tops and bark) ofharvested trees, or trees removed for thinning operations so thatthe better trees have room to grow; it is material that has nohigher market value. Burlington Electric employs four degreedforesters who supervise the wood harvesting. They work closelywith Vermont's Department of Fish and Wildlife to develop a harvestprescription, and follow through by visiting harvest sites atleast weekly during the cutting phases to ascertain that the prescriptionis being followed. These same foresters are responsible for ensuring that an appropriatevolume of wood flows to McNeil. This can be challenging when consideringall the variables involved--for example, storing wood too longcan cause fermentation, and prices in the wood market change quicklyand impact the cost of power to McNeil, which impacts whetherthe plant will even be operating. The reasons that DOE and its cost-share partner, Future EnergyResources, view McNeil as an ideal site to prove this gasifiertechnology are clear. In Irving's words, "Most of the problemsyou have with a wood-fuel plant involve getting the wood to thesystem and getting the ash away from the system. That's goingto be pretty much the same whether it's a regular boiler or agasifier, and I think we've got pretty good experience in howto do that."

NHA also works with industry and others to identify the institutional, regulatory, and nontechnical issues that must be resolved before commercial markets for hydrogen can emerge. NHA projects include assessing the production, transport, and use of hydrogen by region; identifying industry's interest in developing hydrogen as a commercial fuel; determining NASA's interest in hydrogen vehicle demonstrations; and assessing the feasibility of building a hydrogen pipeline from the southeastern states to southern California. The NHA also develops demonstration projects that can result in public and private partnerships to develop hydrogen as a fuel of the future. Information exchange and transfer are important activities of the NHA. Publications distributed to members include the H2 Digest and the Legislative Update. A quarterly newsletter that will be a forum for NHA member activities is also planned. Information exchange among industry members is facilitated by the NHA's participation in technical meetings. The association also develops exhibits, papers, and presentations for industry and the public. The chief means of disseminating information is the NHA Annual Hydrogen Meeting; held in the spring, it draws experts in the field from all across North America. The NHA is also the focal point for the development of codes and standards for the commercial use of hydrogen as an energy source. Recent Activities: The premiere issue of the NHA's quarterly newsletter, NHA Advocate,was distributed to approximately 125 NHA members and DOE officials. And the March/April issue of the H2 Digest was also distributed to approximately 125 individuals. The NHA exhibited at the Renewable Energy Expo hosted by the HouseRenewable Energy Caucus. As part of the exhibit, NHA recruiteda scientist to demonstrate the properties of hydrogen and an industryrepresentative to demonstrate a "hydrogen-powered, manned-portable,fuel cell power system" that powered a TV and VCR at theexhibit. The 7th Annual U.S. Hydrogen Meeting was held April 2-4, 1996. This year's meeting was one of the most successful in the historyof the NHA; 200 representatives from industry, small business,government, research, and nonprofit institutions attended. Thewrap-up of the 7th Annual Meeting continued into May. Collectionof papers for the final proceedings has begun. Planning for the8th Annual U.S. Hydrogen Meeting has also begun. A "Callfor Papers" flyer should be distributed at the DOE HydrogenProgram Annual Review Meeting. A draft agenda was prepared for an Executive Committee Planning Meetingfor the Industry Plan Workshop scheduled for June. The agenda was sent to the Chairman of the Board for review and suggestions. The codes and standards workshop was held May 30-31.

S. Department of Energy today announced the 1996 incentive payments to renewable energy generation facilities under the Renewable Energy Production Incentive (REPI) program. Four state-owned, six city-owned, and one cooperative-owned facility received a total of $2,398,472 in incentive payments to produce electricity from renewable energy sources in fiscal year 1995. REPI, established to advance the commercialization and use of renewable energy electricity generation systems in the U. S., provides incentive payments of $0.015 per kilowatt-hour (after adjustment for inflation from the base year of 1993). Qualified state- or local government-owned facilities or non-profit electrical cooperatives which generate and sell electricity using solar, wind, biomass and certain types of geothermal resources can participate in the program. "This nation's non-profit and municipal utilities are forging a path we hope all utilities will follow one day," said Christine Ervin, assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. "They are helping accelerate the commercial viability of renewable energy technologies for utility use, and they are helping bring about a cleaner environment and improved energy security for all of us." The total energy produced by these utilities using wind, solar and biomass in fiscal year 1995 was 152,609,779 kilowatt-hours. Of the eleven facilities that applied for, and received, production incentive payments, two use wind and four use photovoltaic solar energy sources. The remaining five facilities use methane to produce electricity. Utilities seeking to qualify for payment for energy produced during fiscal year 1996 may apply through Dec. 31. Potential applicants should see the final rule published in the Federal Register on July 19, 1995 or call Jim Spaeth, REPI project manager, DOE Golden Field Office, at (303) 275-4706. In addition, DOE soon will publish supplemental interpretations and procedures in the Federal Register for future applicants for the renewable energy production incentive.

In general, the benefits of subcooling are higher in regions with constantly highyear-round temperatures; several of these new subcooling devices have been installed in theWashington, D.C. area, seven of them in Federal facilities. Most installations are custom-designed toobtain optimum system performance. The Federal Technology Alert focuses on a relatively new variation on subcooling technology, whichutilizes an external heat sink (mini-cooling tower or ground-source water). The technology is provingparticularly applicable in direct-expansion vapor-compression air-conditioning equipment, especiallywhere old units are being replaced or where new construction/expansion or new installation is planned.It is not recommended as an add-on device.

Each group focuses on one of these four areas: hydrogen production, storage, utilization, or systems integration. The groups solicit recommendations from industry and other key stakeholders (interested parties) on important research and development (R&D) issues. The working groups enable industry to provide input to the program and create mechanisms for technical evaluations of R&D activities. The working groups are more than just a means for keeping researchers and industry members informed about the work of their colleagues, however. They also address technology issues beyond the program to identify new areas that should be included. Descriptions of each group follow: The Production Working Group examines and evaluates process designs and configurations for hydrogen production technologies; analyzes critical issues that lie between the science of hydrogen production and the engineering of process design; and coordinates activities under the International Energy Agency (IEA) Hydrogen Agreement Annex 10--Photoproduction. The Storage Working Group develops plans to address the scientific and engineering constraints on the practical application of new storage concepts; explores innovative near-term storage concepts; and coordinates activities under IEA Hydrogen Agreement Annex 12--Metal Hydrides. The Utilization Working Group coordinates R&D activities on internal combustion engines and fuel cells for mobile and stationary applications; addresses safety and codes and standards issues; and specifies technical requirements for broader applications and utilization of current and near-term technologies, especially the use of hydrogen blends. The Systems Integration Working Group coordinates and evaluates analyses of technology pathways; develops appropriate parameters for economic evaluations; addresses key issues in subsystem integration; provides evaluation tools for systems validation and demonstrations; addresses infrastructure issues; and coordinates activities under IEA Hydrogen Agreement Annex 11--Integrated Systems.

The program also seeks to assist U.S. businesses in becoming more competitive in the global economy by providing clean industrial technologies, enabling industry to be less energy- and resource-intensive, and eliminating or reducing the need for environmental cleanup and remediation. The program focuses on achieving the technological advances that will enable hydrogen to become an economically viable part of the national energy resource mix, and has set near-term, intermediate, and long-term research and development (R&D) goals. Projects to develop advanced technologies for hydrogen production, storage, transport, and use that appear competitive in terms of energy consumption, emissions, and capital investments have priority. The DOE Hydrogen Program selects R&D projects through open and competitive procurements. This section of the InfoNet contains program meeting announcements and notices of current or active solicitations to identify new projects. There are many opportunities for small and large U.S.-based businesses to participate in this program.

S. Department of Energy and Public Technology, Inc. (PTI) showcases experiences communities across the country are having with sustainable development. "Cities and Counties: Thinking Globally, Acting Locally" contains 10 detailed case studies showing how communities are facing such challenges as air and water pollution, traffic congestion, urban sprawl and decreased quality of life without sacrificing economic development. Among the many solutions outlined are home energy loan programs, solar access laws, outdoor lighting standards and eco-industrial parks in communities across the nation, including Austin, Tex.; Boulder, Colo.; Chattanooga; Metro-Dade County, Fla.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Portland; San Jose; Northampton County, Va. and Chittenden County, Vt. Sustainable development is a strategy through which communities seek economic development approaches that also benefit the local environment and quality of life. "Sustainable development allows economic progress and environmental quality to be compatible goals," said Christine Ervin, DOE assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. "Communities are finding that sustainable development strategies save taxpayer money, improve the profits of local businesses and make the community much more liveable." According to PTI President Costis Toregas, advances in building, recycling and conservation technology are putting the goals of sustainability within easy reach of most communities. "New technological breakthroughs allow local governments to more effectively conserve and safeguard energy and natural resources," Toregas said. "By those actions--not in spite of them--cities and counties can tone their economic muscle in an increasingly competitive world, and leave future generations the asset base necessary for their prosperity."

These discussions focused on markets, technology development, and regulatory issues. An Industry Outreach Workshop was held in June 1995 to continue the dialogue with industry decision makers that began in a series of meetings earlier in the year. Workshop attendees discussed preliminary findings, greater industry participation in the program, and obtaining input from industry on key issues. Three groups were formed to discuss the transition of program work from research to commercialization; the roles of government and industry; and communication mechanisms. We learned that industry is interested in participating with DOE in field validations of component technologies and subsystems in areas where industry and DOE interests are compatible. However, intellectual property rights and competitiveness issues remain significant obstacles to industry participation. Effective two-way communication was stressed. Current communication mechanisms were viewed favorably, and some suggestions were made on how to expand them and how to establish new ones.

Gregoire Padro Abstract The National Hydrogen Program of the United States is dedicated to encouraging and supporting the development of safe, practical, and economically competitive hydrogen technologies and systems to meet our energy needs. The future world energy industry will need to use hydrogen from renewable resources to satisfy energy demand and to reduce pollution. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages the National Hydrogen Program. In this role, DOE provides national leadership and acts as a catalyst through partnerships with industry. These partnerships are needed to assist in the transition of sustainable hydrogen systems from government-supported research and development to commercial successes in the marketplace. The challenges that the program is addressing include infrastructure issues, process efficiency, environmental impacts and advantages, safety issues, reliability, and cost competitiveness. We are addressing these obstacles through core research and development, technology validation, demonstrations, industry interaction, and systems analysis. The U.S. Hydrogen Program is poised to overcome the technical and economic challenges that currently limit the impact of hydrogen on our energy picture. With cooperative research, development, and demonstrations, the hydrogen future will become a reality. Introduction Hydrogen will join electricity in the 21st century as a primary energy carrier in a sustainable energy future. Hydrogen and electricity will ultimately come from renewable energy sources, although fossil fuels will provide a long-term transitional resource. Future hydrogen suppliers will deliver a significant portion of our energy for transportation and other applications. For these applications, hydrogen offers a nonpolluting, inexhaustible, efficient, and potentially cost-effective energy system derived entirely from domestic energy sources. To encourage and support the development of safe, practical, and economically competitive hydrogen technologies and systems, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) conducts research in the production, storage, and use of hydrogen. DOE provides national leadership and acts as a catalyst through partnerships with industry. These partnerships are needed to assist in the transition of sustainable hydrogen systems from government-supported research and development to commercial successes in the marketplace. The outcome of the program is expected to be the orderly phase-out of fossil fuels as a result of market-driven technology advances, with a least-cost, environmentally benign energy delivery system. The goals of the program include doubling, by the year 2005, current hydrogen use in the chemical and petroleum sectors as a feedstock for reformulated gasolines. In addition, the program has set a goal for 25% of all new vehicles sold in the United States in 2010 to be hydrogen powered, either as hybrids or as fuel cell vehicles. This will result in an important reduction in NOx, CO, and CO2 emissions. A significant portion of the hydrogen required for these vehicles will be produced from biomass and municipal solid waste gasification and pyrolysis. Finally, the program has set a goal of an 8%-10% hydrogen contribution to the total energy market by 2025. Legislative Actions Legislative initiatives are in place to facilitate the incorporation of hydrogen into the United States' energy economy. The Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Program Act of 1990 (often referred to as the Matsunaga Act, after the late Senator Spark M. Matsunaga of Hawaii, who sponsored the legislation), established a number of requirements for the program. DOE prepared a comprehensive 5-year program management plan for hydrogen research and development, with renewable energy as the primary source for the production of hydrogen. An implementation plan for a technology assessment and transfer program among other federal agencies was also developed. The legislation shifted the focus of the program to emphasize production from renewable resources, with fossil fuels serving only in the transition to hydrogen production from renewable resources. The Matsunaga Act also established the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel (HTAP), which advises the Secretary of Energy. The panel is appointed by the Secretary of Energy and consists of representatives from industry, universities, professional societies, government laboratories, financial, environmental, and other appropriate organizations. The panel makes recommendations to the Secretary of Energy on implementing and conducting the program; economic, technical, and environmental consequences of hydrogen production and use; and improvements to the comprehensive 5-year plan. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 supplemented the Matsunaga Act by requiring the assessment and development of hydrogen production from renewable resources; systems for hydrogen storage that may be suitable for electric vehicles powered by fuel cells; natural gas pipelines to carry hydrogen; and other research and development programs as deemed necessary by DOE. Recent legislative action includes a bill that will extend and expand the Matsunaga Act. Current bills in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate call for a substantial increase in funding, and industry participation in research, development, and demonstration projects. The Hydrogen Future Act of 1995, which will extend many of the provisions of the Matsunaga Act, was passed by the House of Representatives and awaits action by the Senate. Program Activities The Hydrogen Program provides rapid and aggressive implementation of a well-balanced portfolio of research and development projects that minimize technology risks. The development and demonstration of processes and technologies to produce, store, transport, and use hydrogen form the basis of the effort. Through interactions with other federally funded programs, the Hydrogen Program is able to leverage significant federal research funds. The Program funds research and development activities in hydrogen production, storage, and use to ensure that the technologies are available for industrial consideration. Production research is being conducted in three main areas: photolysis, electrolysis, and thermal processes. Photolytic processes include enzymatic production systems and photoelectrochemical systems. Enzymatic research is focused on isolating bacteria and algae with oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases and efficient photosynthetic systems. Engineering issues include designing systems that are easy to operate and control, and reactors that are efficient. Photoelectrochemical development issues include the separation of hydrogen and oxygen, system costs, and materials of construction. Research in electrolytic systems includes the development of solid electrolytes for water electrolysis at higher temperatures than current systems, and the production of hydrogen using an HBr system. Issues include materials of construction and system costs. Thermal research is being conducted in gasification and pyrolysis systems, with biomass and municipal solid waste as the target feedstocks. Research needs include production cost reduction and improved system integration. Hydrogen storage for stationary and mobile applications presents significant challenges. Recent industry cost-shared research efforts have resulted in potential demonstration projects, with integrated storage systems that are efficient and cost effective. Fundamental research continues in more advanced storage systems, including a number of projects using carbon-based systems and glass microspheres. The goal of the program is to develop storage systems that result in an added cost of 50% or less to the cost of delivered hydrogen. Opportunities exist for cost reductions through capacity and efficiency increases and weight reduction, while maintaining and enhancing system safety and reliability. The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is being studied in a collaborative effort with other offices in DOE. The work is directed toward the development of a mechanical equivalent to the fuel cell. In a partnership among three national laboratories, industries, universities and DOE, the participants are providing fundamental combustion and engine data, information on hydrogen use in internal combustion engines, chemical kinetics calculations of hydrogen and hydrogen/methane combustion, design of hybrid vehicle, and materials for hydrogen storage systems. The selection of a particular engine by the industrial partner will be based on technical merit and the probability of market penetration. The Hydrogen Program uses a number of techniques to evaluate and compare hydrogen technologies and integrated systems. Analytical models have been developed to provide comparisons of advanced and conventional hydrogen energy pathways on an equivalent basis. Studies have been conducted to identify infrastructure issues and to determine potential optimum delivery system designs. An analysis was conducted of hydrogen production via small- and large-scale natural gas steam reformers for vehicle refueling stations. The study focused on the use of zero emission vehicles in southern California, where legislation will likely result in the first use of hydrogen as a motor vehicle fuel. In the study, the large-scale system was centrally located, with hydrogen delivered to refueling stations as compressed or liquid hydrogen. The small-scale system was located at the refueling station, and produced fuel-cell quality hydrogen. Preliminary cost estimates were performed for a non-optimized design. The reformer capital cost was an important factor in the overall cost of hydrogen. Economic analysis is also used to identify areas requiring further research and to track research progress. Different levels of analysis are used for fundamental, advanced, and near-commercial processes. The appropriate level depends on the availability of data and system design. Studies are under way to develop base-line economics for current hydrogen production and storage research projects. Related Research Programs In addition to the Hydrogen Program, DOE funds a number of programs that are directly related to developing a hydrogen energy economy. Overall funding for hydrogen research in fiscal year 1995 was $122.3 million, more than ten times the Hydrogen Program budget of $9.5 million in fiscal year 1995. Funding for the Hydrogen Program in fiscal year 1996 is $14.5 million. Information sharing and communication between the programs are important in maximizing the benefits of these diverse research efforts. Biomass gasification and solid waste management research programs are working closely with the Hydrogen Program to develop systems that can be used to produce hydrogen from sustainable and renewable resources. Funding levels for stationary molten carbonate fuel cell research and vehicle fuel cell research programs are also significant. Realizing the Hydrogen Future Our team of researchers is a highly motivated, talented group of scientists and engineers dedicated to seeing hydrogen become an important contribution to the United States' energy future. DOE endeavors to provide technology exchange with industry to facilitate the transition to renewable energy. Increased funding, provided by progressive legislation, will help accelerate the fulfillment of our vision.

Under these projects, industry teams are conducting feasibility studies and developing business plans focusing on the integrated use of energy crops for power production. These 10 projects are summarized in the table below. The Utility Biomass Energy Commercialization Association (UBECA) was formed in 1994 by electric utility and power producing members to "encourage the development of economical sustainable biomass resources and economically competitive technologies for the benefit of electric utilities, power producers, their customers and society." In many regions of Asia, India, Africa, Latin America and other developing areas, power demands are frequently in smaller increments and biomass resources are abundant, particularly biomass residues such as bagasse (from processing sugar cane), rice hulls, etc. As a result, biomass fuels are an excellent choice for electricity generation in the developing world, and their potential use creates significant export opportunities for U.S. technologies and component manufacturers. Other developed nations are exploring biomass resources and associated opportunities.

As the world's largestconsumer, the Federal Government can help "pull" theentire market towards greater energy efficiency. A thoughtfulprocurement policy targeting "green" technologies willhelp save taxpayer dollars, energy, water, and other natural resources,provide market leadership, and stimulate technology innovation. Both the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Executive Order 12902address this issue and provide guidance to Federal agencies. DOE's Federal Energy Management Program has developed recommendationsthat will help Federal energy managers identify energy efficientproducts for their purchase. These product recommendations areused by Federal supply agencies in designating energy efficientproducts in their catalogs and on-line databases and in directingvendors to designate such products in published or on-line schedules. The recommendations cover a broad range of technologies includinglighting, appliance, renewable energy, water saving, construction,and transportation. These recommendations will assist Federalagencies in complying with Executive Order 12902, which requiresthe purchase of "best-practice" energy efficient, renewable,and water-conserving products whenever practicable. These areproducts that have been found to be in the upper 25 percent oftheir category in terms of their energy and water efficiency. Federal agencies can achieve significant operating cost reductionsthrough the purchase and installation of energy-efficient andresource-conserving equipment; energy savings of 25 percent canoften be realized through the selection of "best-practice"products. Such products are typically the better choice whenselection is based on life-cycle cost, which takes into considerationthe operating cost of the product over its lifetime. For example,energy savings from a difference in purchase price of $229 betweena standard-efficiency 25 horsepower motor and a high-efficiencymodel may be recovered in 18 months. For some products, suchas fluorescent lamp ballasts, high volume buying has resultedin little or no premium in the purchase price of higher efficiencyproducts. As supply agencies to the Federal government, the General ServicesAdministration and Defense Logistics Agency are working with FEMPto identify all "best practice" products that are availablefrom Federal supply services. This identification system willmake it easy for procurement officials to locate such products,both electronically and through catalogs and schedules.

The Department of Energy encouraged the establishment of CSTRRand a Solar Enterprise Zone to serve as a site where private industrycould develop solar and other renewable resources to produce competitivelypriced energy. The Federal Energy Management Program is working with CSTRR tosecure pledges from Federal facilities over the next few months. This allows agencies to comply with the Energy Policy Act of1992 and Executive Order 12902 commitments to significantly increasethe purchase of energy from solar and other renewable resources. The Nevada Test Site is already leading the way with 10 MW thatCSTRR is using as a basis for moving ahead with its first project. EPA and Yuma Proving Ground have signed Letters of Interest,and DoD, Interior, USPS, and other agencies and DOE facilitiesare near commitments. The Letter of Interest is a non-bindingagreement for facilities to work with CSTRR and FEMP to analyzea solar power purchase. After signing the Letters of Interest,FEMP will provide technical assistance, contracting, and purchasingexpertise and advice on combining CSTRR power with other energyimprovements to make CSTRR power purchases a competitive partof a facility's energy portfolio. As part of this assistance, FEMP, the General Services Administration(GSA), and CSTRR will present a workshop titled "CSTRR SolarPower Opportunities" on October 29 and 30. The workshop willpresent representatives from government facilities, electric utilities,and other customers with information regarding the options availablefor purchasing CSTRR solar power. The workshop agenda includes:an overview of the CSTRR initiative; descriptions of potentialsolar projects from the developers; case studies on facilitiesthat have already agreed to explore purchases of CSTRR power;and contracting mechanisms for Federal facilities.

O Leary today joined industry leaders to launch a feasibility study on commercializing the technology for converting corn fiber into a clean transportation fuel. This project represents the Clinton administration's commitment to reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, improving air quality, and stimulating economic development. O Leary joined representatives of Amoco Corp., Stone and Webster Engineering Corp. and SWAN Biomass Company in a ceremony at the U.S. Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The dignitaries marked the successful operation of NREL s pilot plant using a process developed by Amoco to turn corn fiber into ethanol. Corn fiber, a byproduct of corn ethanol refining, is one of several feedstocks expected to make biomass ethanol commercially viable. The research at NREL has assisted Amoco and Stone and Webster to make significant progress toward the commercialization of corn fiber as an ethanol feedstock. O Leary noted the environmental and economic benefits of biomass ethanol and said it was appropriate that today s ceremony be held close to Earth Day. Ethanol from biomass can bring a major boost to the ethanol and agriculture industries and create thousands of new jobs, O Leary said. In addition to decreasing our dependence on imported oil, biomass ethanol is a clean-burning transportation fuel that will help clear the air in our cities and mean better health for our nation s citizens. The Department of Energy is proud to be working in partnership with industry leaders such as Amoco and Stone and Webster to speed its development. Under a cooperative research and development agreement, Amoco is using NREL s pilot plant to study the feasibility of using corn fiber in the production of biomass ethanol. Today s ceremony marked the plant s successful conversion of corn fiber into ethanol, but other feedstocks, including fast-growing trees and switchgrass, also hold promise as commercially viable feedstocks. Amoco and Stone and Webster formed SWAN Biomass Company late last year to commercialize Amoco s process for low-cost conversion of biomass to ethanol for fuel and industrial use.

FEMP's mission to save energy, save money, andincrease the use of green products is well underway. Since 1985,Federal energy and facility managers have achieved $11.2 billionin cost savings. They have ignited the economy by creating partnershipswith the private sector and stimulated new markets for energyefficient products. To continue their good work, FEMP recognizes that Federal energyand facility managers will need all the tools they can get inorder to accomplish their energy saving goals. FEMP relies onan extensive education and outreach program to help its customersmake sound energy investment decisions and obtain feedback abouttheir needs and general market environment. With the help of an interagency committee, a two-pronged educationalapproach was identified to facilitate implementation of energyefficiency, renewable energy, and water conservation projectsand promote the importance of using energy wisely throughout theFederal sector. To that end, FEMP is launching an exciting, multi-yeareducational campaign aimed at better serving FEMP's customersand achieving improved information goals. The campaign will relyon an integrated communications infrastructure that will improvethe flow of FEMP information, products, and services; rely ona network of partners; and move FEMP customers through the processof awareness, interest, commitment, and ultimately action. The theme of FEMP's information campaign is You Have thePower, and as the title suggests, FEMP will be working toencourage and motivate Federal energy and facility managers intoaction. FEMP announced its campaign at TeleFEMP Broadcast IV(September 26, 1996) and introduced a sampling of new and valuableproducts for meeting the information needs of the Federal energyand facility manager. New information tools include energy efficiencyawareness computer messages, posters, action kits, and other remindersto use energy wisely. Through the FEMP information campaign, apositive reflection will be cast on the good work of the energyand facility managers as well as all Federal workers! You have the power to achieve even greater success! Federal energy and facility managers who would like more informationabout the new FEMP information campaign can contact Tatiana S.Muessel of FEMP at (202) 586-9230.

S. Department of Energy and Public Technology, Inc. (PTI) shows how to design, build, operate and maintain environmentally friendly buildings. The "Sustainable Building Technical Manual: Green Building Design, Construction, and Operations" is one of the most comprehensive publications now available to help architects, developers, building owners, government officials and others implement sustainable development practices. It contains more than 300 pages of practical, step-by-step advice on sustainable buildings written by some of the foremost experts in the field. Among the issues the book addresses are the economics of green building; pre-design strategies; passive solar design; heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems; electricity; plumbing; indoor air quality; acoustics; selection of building and landscaping materials; and housekeeping. Sustainable development is a strategy through which communities seek economic development approaches that also benefit the local environment and quality of life. "Sustainable development allows economic progress and environmental quality to be compatible goals," said Christine Ervin, DOE assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. "Communities are finding that sustainable development strategies save taxpayer money, improve the profits of local businesses and make the community much more liveable." According to PTI President Costis Toregas, advances in building, recycling and conservation technology are putting the goals of sustainability within easy reach of most communities. "New technological breakthroughs allow local governments to more effectively conserve and safeguard energy and natural resources," Toregas said. "By those actions--not in spite of them--cities and counties can tone their economic muscle in an increasingly competitive world, and leave future generations the asset base necessary for their prosperity." Printed copies of the publication are available for purchase through the PTI Publications Center by calling (301) 490-2188 or faxing requests to (301) 604-0158. Soon, copies also will be available through the home page for DOE's Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development at "http://www.sustainable.doe.gov". The Center of Excellence offers information and technical advice to help communities become more energy-efficient and environmentally sound. In addition to the home page, interested communities can contact the center toll-free at (800) 357-7732 for other information about sustainable development. PTI is the nonprofit, technology research and development organization of the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties and International City/County Management Association. Now in its 25th year, PTI is dedicated to creating and advancing technology-based services and products in local and state government and is committed to sustainable development. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funded the manual. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency also provided financial support.

Replacing less efficient conventional boilers withadvanced biomass gasifier or gas turbines can increase the amountof electricity produced from biomass by 50% or more. For evenhigher efficiency, the gas-turbine cycle can be combined withthe steam cycle in either an integrated gasifier combined-cycleor steam injected gas turbine. Gasification can take advantageof biomass feedstocks unsuitable for direct burning. When biomassfuels are burned in conventional boilers, the inorganic materialsthat do not burn stick to boiler walls and reduce efficiency.Many fast-growing, desirable energy crops and residues have highproportions of these inorganic compounds. Inorganic compoundsare removed during gasification as part of the cleanup process.The filtered by-products are then recycled back to croplands. According to feasibility studies sponsored by the Program, threetypes of gasifiers—fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, and entrained-flowgasifiers—make economic sense when used in conjunction with gasturbine-generators. They are used in a direct-fired mode in whichair or oxygen is fed directly to the gasifier, or in an indirectmode in which externally supplied heat is used to gasify the biomass. Gasification with air produces a low-Btu gas, with a heating valueabout one-fifth that of natural gas. Indirectly heated gasificationand oxygen-blown gasification produces a medium-Btu gas, withheating values as much as one-half that of natural gas.

The answer is that most solar heating systems have a storage component of masonry rock, phase change materials or water. At the very least, any solar heating systems's storage component should absorb enough heat during a sunny day to keep a house warm throughout the night. The two main types of solar heating systems, passive and active, store heat differently. Passive systems use the building itself and/or heat storage components to collect and store solar energy, while active systems use pumps or fans to move heat to and from storage tanks or rock bins. Storage in Passive Systems Passive solar buildings absorb and store solar heat in masonry floors, walls, room dividers, water-filled tubes and drums or in containers filled with phase change material. A well designed passive building can store enough heat to keep it warm after sunset, through the night, and possibly through a day or two of sunless weather. The location of a passive building's storage mass depends upon which passive collection method is used. For the popular direct gain approach the room admits sunlight through large south-facing windows. Solar radiation strikes the masonry walls and floors where it is partly absorbed as heat. The heat remains in the masonry until the air in the room cools to a temperature below that of the masonry. Because heat flows from warmer to cooler areas, the stored heat is drawn into the room. However, if the amount of solar heat entering the room exceeds the storage system's capacity to absorb and store the heat, the house will overheat and valuable solar energy will be wasted. The key to the efficient use of the direct gain approach is to include the proper amount of heat storage material for the amount of south-facing glazing. The proper ratio depends upon the local climate and the amount of sunshine available, type of glazing used, type of heat storage material and its thickness and distribution, type of covering for the heat storage material (e.g. tiles, hardwood or paint), and the amount of heat storage materials exposed to direct sunlight. Floors and Walls Because there are so many factors to consider when sizing a storage system, general rules of thumb can be misleading. To show how the figures vary, a 6-inch thick concrete floor exposed to direct radiation requires 3 square feet of surface area for every square foot of window area, but an equally thick brick floor requires 5 square feet of surface area per square foot of window area. The figures are different if the mass receives only reflected radiation (5 square feet for concrete and 9 square feet for brick) or if the mass thickness varies in some places. Floors used for storage mass are usually poured concrete with a covering that is medium dark in color and has a non-glossy surface. Using very dark colors on floors that are exposed to direct sunlight all day may result in overheating. Ceramic tiles may be used over a concrete slab if the bonding material allows heat to be conducted to the floor. Mortar and Portland cement conduct heat well; chemical glues and adhesives do not. Other hard, dark colored floor covering such as sheet vinyl also works well. Sections of the floor that are exposed to direct sunlight should not be carpeted. Area rugs or thin carpeting without padding may be used on other areas of the floor. Carpeting large areas of a thermal storage floor will hinder the floor's ability to store and radiate heat back into the room. It is also best to leave storage walls uncovered, although plaster or wallpaper will only slightly reduce performance. Materials that don't absorb heat should have light colored surfaces to reflect solar radiation toward storage areas. It is important to place the storage mass where it will receive direct sunlight since mass heated indirectly by warm air requires four times as much area to store the same amount of heat as mass in direct sunlight. Generally, it is better to spread a relatively thin amount of mass over a large area than to concentrate the mass in a few thick storage areas. Trombe Walls The outside surface of the Trombe wall is painted a dark color to absorb heat. In addition, a single or, preferably, a double layer of glazing is mounted about 4 inches in front of the wall. Sunlight strikes the wall, charging it with heat which gradually migrates through the masonry. The heat reaches the room later in the day and radiates into the room through the night. Many Trombe walls have vents at the floor and ceiling. While the sun shines, the heated air in the space between the glazing and the wall rises and enters the room through the upper vents. This movement draws cooler air into the space through the lower vents. To prevent this natural circulation of heat from reversing itself at night, backdraft dampers or manual louvers should be installed on the upper vent. An insulating curtain or other types of movable insulation drawn between the glazing and the wall at night will reduce heat loss through the glazing. Vented Trouble walls are best for very cold climates where heating is required in the morning as well as at night. If the vents are not carefully sized, overheating can easily be a problem. In milder climates, or in households where no one is home during the day, unvented Trombe wall will provide heat in the evenings when it is most needed. A Trombe wall's surface area is equal to the window area. The wall should be 8-16 inches thick. The thicker the wall the longer it will take to transmit heat indoors. The wall is usually made of concrete. In colder climates a selective surface foil should be applied to the outside face to enhance solar absorption and reduce the amount of infrared energy lost back through the glazing at night. Water-filled containers (Fiberglass stubs, 55-gallon metal drums, plastic or metal modules, etc.) can be used to create a water wall. Water has about twice the heat storage capacity and one-fifth the weight of masonry of equivalent volume. Also, water absorbs heat and transfers it by convection so rapidly that the water at any level is of uniform temperature. Thus, heat will pass into the room at a much faster rate than for masonry walls of equal thickness. This can lead to overheating problems unless the containers are 16-20 inches thick. Keep in mind, however, that water does not readily convect downward. Consequently, the bottom of the container should have ample exposure to the sun to facilitate convection throughout the container. Furthermore, a conventional wall placed behind the water wall for aesthetic reasons will impede the transfer of heat into the living area. The containers can be painted a dark color to enhance absorption or, in the case of translucent containers, the water may be dyed a dark color. Leaving the water clear to allow extra light indoors is also an option. In any situation, the water must be chemically treated to prevent algae or other biological growth within the container. When an attached sunspace is used to collect solar heat, the storage area can include the masonry floor of the sunspace, the wall separating the sunspace from the main building and water containers such as the 55-gallon drums shown in the illustration on previous page. The wall can be either masonry, water-filled containers, or containers filled with phase change materials, and it can include windows for heating the main living space with charging it with direct sunlight. Storage in Active Systems In active solar heating systems the storage component is usually a large water tank or a rock bin housed in the basement or utility area. Active system storage is linked to the solar collectors and to a mechanical heat distribution system that uses pumps or air-handing units. If possible, storage bins or tanks should be located next to or under those rooms that require the greatest amount of heat. The storage area should also be accessible for maintenance and repairs. Air Systems Active solar air heating systems commonly use a bin filled with rocks for heat storage. The rock bin stores heat when hot air from the solar collectors is blown through the rocks via a plenum at the top of the bin. The hot air is distributed evenly through the bin. As the air reaches the bottom of the bin,the rocks have absorbed most of hits heat, and another plenum at the bottom returns it to the collectors for reheating. To retrieve the heat from the storage bin, house air is drawn into the lower plenum and blown upward through the rocks. The warmed air is drawn off at the top of the bin and distributed to the house. If the air is not warm enough, an auxiliary heater boosts its temperature before it is distributed. If hot air from the collectors is available and is needed to heat the house directly, it bypasses the rock bin and flows directly into the heat distribution system. Withdrawing and storing heat simultaneously is not practical since it takes energy to circulate air through the rock bins, and heat is lost during the distribution process. Likewise, an air system that heats both the house and the household water should bypass the bin in the summer to heat the water directly. Heating the rock bin in order to preheat the water will add to the house's summer cooling load. Rock bins can be made from cinder block, concrete or wood. When treated plywood is used for bin construction, it should be lined with plasterboard and a vapor barrier to protect the rocks and the entire system from any gases released by the plywood. A wood bin should also be lined with a non-combustible material. All bins must be tightly constructed and sealed to prevent air leakage from the storage bin. Air leaks from the bin or the ducts drastically reduce the system's efficiency. Sealing also prevents moisture, vermin and insects from entering. A storage bin works most efficiently when the rock depth is 5-7 feet and when there is an 8-inch separation between the bin and the rocks at the top and bottom. Air should flow vertically through the system at the rate of 1-3 cubic feet per minute for each square foot of collector. Ducts should be sized for a velocity of 5-10 feet per second, and the rock bin should provide 1/2-1 cubic foot of storage for every square foot of collector. This is roughly 2 1/2-3 times the volume of a water tank that would provide an equivalent storage capacity in a liquid system. The air flow rate is very important for optimum performance; consult other sources for detailed discussions of fan sizing. The plenums at the top and bottom of the bin ensure uniform air flow through the rock. Air filters are needed between both of the plenums and the ducts to and from the bin to prevent dust from blowing into either the collectors or the house. The filters should be inspected periodically and replaced when necessary. Dense rock, such as river rock (which is predominantly quartz), performs best. The rocks should be of uniform size, roughly 3/4 inches-1 1/2 inches in diameter. Before the rocks are put in the bin, they must be washed to remove dirt and insect eggs. Keeping the rocks dry will prevent problems with mold, mildew, and insects. Because of the weight of the rocks, the bin is usually located in the basement. Outside underground bins are an option but are not recommended because they are difficult to insulate and waterproof. Ground water can ruin the insulation, corrode the walls of the bin, and promote the growth of mind and bacteria in the storage area if the waterproofing materials fail. To reduce heat loss, an indoor bin should be insulated to a value of no less than R-19 (R-30 or greater if it is outside). Insulate concrete bins on the inside to prevent heat from the rocks from sinking into the concrete where the heat cannot be efficiently recovered. The ducts to and from the bin should be insulated to a value of at least R-16. Liquid Systems Water is the most common heat storage medium in active systems that circulate liquid through collectors. The water in the tank is either heated directly by circulating through the collectors, or it is heated indirectly by a heat transfer fluid that circulates from storage to the collectors within a closed loop. In the latter instance, the transfer fluid absorbs heat from the collector and then passes through a heat exchanger immersed inside the storage tank which transfers heat to the water. Because oxygen promotes corrosion, the heat exchanger should be completely submerged inside the tank. If, as is usually the case, the system provides hot water for domestic use, the heat exchanger needs to be double-walled so that the heat transfer fluid cannot contaminate the drinking water. A general rule of thumb for water storage tanks is 1-2 1/2 gallons of water for every square foot of collector space. The tanks can be made of concrete, steel or fiberglass reinforced plastic. All should be insulated to a value of R-19 or more, and all piping to a value of R-4. The cost and availability of suitable tanks vary widely. Steel tanks should be lined to prevent corrosion. For domestic water heating, steel tanks are available with glass or stone linings. Epoxy or butyl rubber (for space heating only) can also be used as linings. When lining a tank, carefully follow the manufacturer's recommendations. It is especially important to consider the type of system, its volume and maximum temperature, and the wet versus dry temperature limitations of the liner material. A rust inhibitor, such as disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) can be used instead of a lining, but inhibitors degenerate and must be monitored regularly for pH balance. If the pH is not what is specified by the manufacturer, the inhibitor must be replaced. Concrete tanks, such as the ones used for septic systems, are sometimes used outdoors where steel is more likely to corrode. Although concrete tanks are inexpensive and easy to install in retrofit projects, they are subject to seepage and must be water-proofed. Leakage can also be a problem due to concrete's tendency to crack, poor workmanship or poor design. Another drawback is that concrete tanks are only cost-effective for unpressurized systems. Fiberglass tanks are another option, although they cannot be used in a pressurized system. As with other storage tanks, pay particular attention to its maximum temperature range. All tanks should be well insulated and have drains, as well as a means of access for routine maintenance such as cleaning heat exchangers. Tanks also should be inspected for leaks before they are installed. They should not be built into the house's structure because they someday may need to be replaced. Temperature sensors for water storage tanks should be positioned for easy replacement. If the local water is hard (i.e. has a high mineral content), a commercial water softener should be used to prevent problems with scaling (i.e. carbonate residue). Usually, for domestic hot water systems, a stone-lined tank with an immersed heat exchanger serves as a solar pre-heat tank. It is installed between the potable water supply and regular hot water heater to form a two-tank system. In the summer, the regular hot water heater can be bypassed since the solar collector usually generates enough hot water to meet a household's needs. One-tank systems and other two-tank arrangements are also possible.One-tank systems occupy less space and are more efficient if flow rates are closely controlled to prevent thermal mixing in the storage tank. In a conventional water heater, the hot water rises in the tank and cold water moves to the bottom. This natural stratification permits the hottest water to be drawn from the top of the tank. In a solar storage tank, the water returning from the collector to the tank can disturb this stratification and mix the cold and warm layers. Several methods prevent this: * inlet and outlet piping should enter the tank horizontally to prevent vertical mixing; * place a diffuser valve at the end of the return pipe; * maintain a low flowrate of less than 2 feet per second; * use a two-tank system, although this is an expensive option. Stratification does not increase efficiency in systems with quick tank turnover or in a buffer tank. Radiant Slab Floors Concrete slab floors can replace or complement the heat storage component of air and liquid active solar energy systems. Solar-heated air or liquid is circulated through channels or tubes embedded in the concrete slab. The heated fluid transfers its heat to the concrete, which in turn radiates heat into the house. Radiant slab floors heat people directly instead of the entire house air volume. By heating the surrounding floor to 75-85 degrees F, the body feels comfortable even if the air temperature is only 55-60 degrees F. This reduces the amount of energy required to keep occupants comfortable, it produces no drafts and it concentrates the heat closer to the floor (as opposed to the ceiling where heat from forced air furnaces quickly ends up). Furthermore, radiant slabs only require 80-125 degrees F heat which is the temperature range at which solar collectors perform most efficiently. In liquid-charged systems, copper or polybutylene tubing is embedded in the concrete when it is poured. Careful design is required to ensure that the proper amount of tubing is laid to sufficiently heat the home. Accurate operating controls are also required to activate the system several hours before heat is needed. Another design option is to place a gravel storage bed directly under a slab floor. Heated air from the collectors (or a sunspace) circulates through the bed, heating the rocks and the slab floor. Because the storage is adjacent to the living space, the requirements for sizing are more crucial than for regular rock beds. For comfort, the floor temperature must be maintained between 60-72 degrees F. This is usually accomplished by using a larger rock bed (4-5 cubic feet of rock per square foot of collector). The distribution system must be designed so that the heated air reaches all parts of the storage bed in order to avoid hot spots in the floor above. With this type of storage system, it is better to oversize the bin than to undersize it. Hybrid Systems Elements of passive and active solar heating systems can be combined to create hybrid systems. The most common example uses a sunspace collector (passive) linked to a rock storage bin (active) by way of fans and ducts. Hybrid systems offer more options to solar designers and builders and increase the overall versatility of solar heating technology. For example, collectors and/or storage in hybrid systems do not need to be located directly in the main living spaces. Interior walls, doors, and stairwells may be designed with less regard for free air movement that is required for a strictly passive system. It is important not to mistake a situation where two separate systems are present - one active, the other passive - as being hybrid. A system is considered hybrid only when components are mixed within a single system. Phase Change Materials Phase change materials are another storage medium used in solar energy systems. These are substances that store energy as latent heat. Latent heat is the heat absorbed by a material as it changes phase, such as a solid changing to liquid at constant temperature (for example, the melting of ice or wax). This heat is released again as the liquid returns to its solid form. Phase change materials store 5-14 times more heat per unit volume than does water, masonry or rock. They are frequently used where space restrictions limit larger storage mass units or to supplement storage mass in direct gain or sunspace passive systems where they are exposed to direct, full sunlight. The two most common types of phase change materials are calcium chloride hexahydrate and sodium decahydrate. As a result of recent research, the long term stability of these products has been improved with additives. An important feature to consider is the type of container in which the phase change material is packaged. The packaging material should conduct heat well, be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as it changes phase, and should restrict the passage of water through the walls so the materials will not dry out. Steel and polyethylene are common packaging materials. Studies have found that 1-inch thick containers perform best. Situating these containers so warm air flows by both sides also increases performance. Phase change storage units are less common than conventional heat storage materials because they are more expensive and their storage capacities and characteristics are still being refined. Where To Go From Here This fact sheet is intended to familiarize the consumer with the available solar heat storage options. However, if you are having a home built or are renovating an existing one, the actual design of a solar heat storage system requires professional assistance. An improperly sized system will be less efficient and may make your house uncomfortable during much of the year.

In a world ofrapidly changing requirements for power production, there is aneed for long-range planning to help assure that new approachesand new technologies are available to keep pace with societies'need for new power alternatives. Advanced biomass power optionsinclude competitive, highly efficient technologies that also offerimportant environmental advantages, particularly in reducing greenhousegas emissions (carbon dioxide) and acid rain precursors. Thisstrategic plan establishes a vision for biomass power developmentover the next 20 years (1996–2015), and sets a framework for theDepartment of Energy's (DOE's) Biomass Power Program to help achievethis vision and meet the challenges that lie ahead. In 1991, DOE formed the National Biomass Power Program to help establish asustainable option to contribute to the 600 gigawatts of new electricgenerating capacity projected to be needed globally over the next10 years. The Biomass Power Program includes such activitiesas: Working with the biomass power industry to overcomeproblems in using some forms of biomass in existing boilers; Evaluating and developing advanced technologies such as gasificationand pyrolysis; Developing clean-up technology for high-temperaturebiogas; Sponsoring cost-shared feasibility studies withindustry; and Supporting cost-shared, small and large systemdemonstrations. In a continuing effort to increase its effectiveness,the Biomass Power Program is working cooperatively with a numberof other programs and Federal Agencies. For example, DOE is workingwith the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on theBiomass Power for Rural Development Initiative to help privateindustry demonstrate and deploy cost-competitive renewable biomasspower systems that also stimulate rural economic development. An ongoing collaboration is the Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS)Program, a joint effort between industry, DOE's Office's of FossilEnergy (FE) and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)to develop higher efficiency (gas-fired) turbines for industrialand utility applications using fuels derived from coal and biomass,as well as natural gas. The Biomass Power Program also accesses other programs within EERE, including the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program for short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous energy crops. The Biomass Power Program's continued success requires an awarenessof the current situation and future challenges, and a clear visionof where it is going and how it is going to get there. The purposeof this Strategic Plan is to address the challenges ahead andset a course for overcoming them during the next 20 years. Futurechallenges include identifying and validating new technologies,responding to the need to create more jobs, cost-effectively attainingthe environmental goals of federal, state and local governments,and wisely spending limited public monies. Finally, continuedsuccess requires explicit strategic tools to implement the BiomassPower Program's goals and objectives, which are described in detailin this strategic plan. Program Mission The mission of the DOE Biomass Power Program is to expand domestic and global marketsfor renewable electricity from sustainable biomass resources byfostering partnerships with U.S. industry, agriculture, and forestry. In this effort we will encourage the highest standards of stewardshipof our air, water, and soil resources, with improved biologicaldiversity, while providing strong economic and environmental benefitsto society. Vision Where we want to be in 20 years The integration of sustainable farms and forests with efficient biomass power production from dedicated feedstocks will be a major cost-competitive contributor to power supplies in both domestic and international markets. Collaborative partnerships between DOE and the privatesector will facilitate the commercialization of a range of small-to large-scale systems, substantially revitalizing rural economiesthrough the integrated development of biomass power and coproductssuch as feed, fiber or fuel. Situation Analysis BIOMASS IS A MAJOR RENEWABLE GENERATION SOURCE TODAY Domestically, grid-connected biomass electric capacity is nearly seven gigawatts,which is 1% of all generating capacity and about 8% of non-utility generationcapability. Much of this capacity is in combined heat and power(CHP) facilities in the industrial sector, mainly in the woodproducts industry using process residues. The next most viablesector for biomass power applications includes stand-alone, condensingcapacity. These facilities are typically fueled with noncaptiveresidues drawn from urban living, and smaller or seasonal industriesthat generate residues such as orchards, food processing, andbuilding construction and demolition. Stand alone power producersoften play an integral role in the management of residue and wasteflows in a region, accepting clean materials that otherwise wouldbe landfilled. As a consequence, the fuel cost to the generatingplant is often only that of transporting these materials. Thisadded dimension of waste and residue management is at the coreof sustainability issues for society. While many people recognizethe closed-loop carbon cycle offered by the future use of dedicatedbiomass crops for electricity production, few recognize the closingof many other material and environmental loops in its existinguse. The U.S. biomass power industry is located primarily in theNortheast, Southeast, and along the West Coast, representing aninvestment base of $15 billion and supporting about 66,000 jobs. For stand-alone facilities that produce only electricity, netpower efficiency in the existing biomass power industry is inthe 20 to 25% range, using steam-cycle technology with conventionalfurnace and fluidized bed combustors. While this efficiency islower than modern coal- and gas-fired units, recent projects havedemonstrated the potential to improve the reliability and efficiencyof existing biomass systems. Currently, biomass residue sources account for 100% of biomass electricityfuel—about 90% of the residues are wood waste and the remainder are agricultural residues.Use of these resources, coupled with favorable power contracts,fueled the rapid development of the industry up until the mid-1980s.Expiration of these early contracts and competition for biomassresources have put significant pressure on the power industryto close or revitalize the less efficient operations. In Californiaand the Northeast, stand alone biomass power facilities have beenvulnerable to competition for biomass fuel resources due to overbuilding of capacity. These facilities have also experienceddownward pressure on their revenue as "avoided cost"rates paid for electricity have declined. This is causing a shakeout of the least profitable power producers. CHANGES IN THE POWER GENERATION AND DELIVERY MARKET ARE CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND SOME PROBLEMS FOR ALL GENERATION SOURCES Restructuring of the electric generating industry is putting considerable downwardpressure on power prices, challenging both traditional electricutilities and independent power producers. In the U.S., utilitiesare devolving to multiple companies competing for pieces of theelectric power business: generation, power brokering, transmission,distribution, and on-site energy services. These same trendsare beginning to be felt even in other countries where the firsttests of privatization of power and competition for generationcontracts are ongoing. The existing fossil fuel supply infrastructure provides a competitive challenge. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a favorable fuel supply environment for coal and natural gas until 2010. Natural gas is setting the pace for new capacity using the best combinations of resources and technology. Environmental constraints have changed the way power is produced,but many environmental benefits of renewable energy are still notvalued or are under-valued in the market place. Biomass resources can be expanded through development of renewable energy cropsand can bring added value in coproducts, local environmental preservation(soil and water conservation and wildlife biodiversity), and globalclimate change insurance (since biomass sequesters carbon whilegrowing). THE MAJOR FACTORS WHICH MAY FACILITATE THE GREATER USE OF BIOMASS RESOURCES INCLUDE: Aging chemical recovery boilers in the pulp and paper industry may be repowered and/or reconfigured with biomass integrated gasification combined cyclesystems, where biomass can be uniquely used as fuel in combinedheat and power applications. The cofiring and repowering of coal facilities in regions where biomass resources are abundant provides another route to capacity growth at lower cost per unitof capacity. Cofiring may pave the way for other advanced technologiesinto commercial markets. Biomass power/natural gas hybrid systems may offer a reduced risk in electricity bids by independent system operators. Developing a local bioenergy sector and providing reliable electricity will providerural economic development benefits and help sustain biomass industry growthdomestically and in developing countries. Furthermore, expandeduse of biomass in developing countries will decrease the needfor subsidies to the power and fuels sectors while also reducingtheir reliance on imported petroleum products. Projected upward pressure on natural gas prices after 2010 has increasedthe EIA forecast for market penetration of biomass by the year2015. However, the price of coal is expected to remain steadyor decline over this time frame. The potential exists for biomass power to grow to an industry of 30,000 megawatt (MW)capacity employing 150,000 persons in mainly rural areas and producing150-200 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity by the year2020. This potential is not based on simply the sale of kWh asbulk power, but recognizes that there are drivers such as social/politicaland environmental factors that, along with technology development,can expand biomass power. Among these drivers are issues suchas stronger enforcement of landfill diversion rules to ensurethat clean materials are either recycled or reused as fuel forenergy production. Agricultural field residues represent anothernear-term opportunity to expand biomass fuel supplies, now thatthe practice of in-field burning of these residues is being bannedas a residue management approach. Increases in the efficiencyand a reduction of the capital intensity of commercial biomasspower plants are also required to expand the role of biomass power. This efficiency gain will provide a multiplier effect back throughthe supply chain by requiring less feedstock per kWh of electricityproduced. This increase in the productive use of biomass feedstockswill reduce the amount of land and other inputs needed per kWhfor energy crop production, while also displacing large amountsof fossil fuels. FOUNDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE DOE recognizes the critical role of industry-led partnerships and the need formultiagency collaboration if the full potential of biomass power is to berealized. DOE, in collaboration with USDA, has helped form partnershipsamong industry, agriculture, and forestry interests. These partnershipsare building a strong foundation for enhanced deployment of integratedbiomass power systems. DOE recently funded seven industry cost-sharedfeasibility studies which include business plans to develop viablepartnerships among electric power companies, equipment manufacturers,farmers, and universities to produce electricity from biomasscrops. DOE and USDA have entered into agreements with severalof the private consortia to demonstrate utility-scale biomassenergy projects. These pioneer facilities will set the stagefor a stronger and more competitive biopower industry becausethey are driven by the power industry and the energy crop growers,with DOE and USDA providing technical assistance and sharing therisks. DOE and USDA have also broken ground in test plots and systemscale-up projects for crops and conversion systems. These effortscould double the efficiency of conversion to power, halve thecost per unit output, create added value products from the farm,and increase the biomass resource supply by a factor of ten. The projects will demonstrate the essential elements for repoweringfacilities with an integrated gasification combined-cycle systemfired by biomass. The Program will provide visible evidence thathigh-yield energy crop species, together with efficient plantingand harvesting methods, can provide the tonnage needed for processingbiomass fuels at competitive costs. There is a substantial amount of agricultural land which is marginal for conventional crop production that can be brought into productive use to grow energy crops (since perennial herbaceous and woody energy crops can be selected whichprovide advantages such as erosion protection or drought tolerance,allowing them to be grown and harvested on land that is marginalfor conventional agricultural crops). In addition, the developmentof processes that generate multiple products for food, fuel, chemicalsand fiber in an integrated system are pointing the way to moreproductive agriculture, generating greater revenues for the farmer. For example, the figure on the following page illustrates theapproach that will be used in a joint project between DOE andthe Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers to produce electricityfrom alfalfa stems and animal feed from the alfalfa leaves. In addition to technology advancements, policy initiatives and environmentalmediation efforts are helping to create conditions favorable tothe development of biomass resources. The National Biofuels Roundtable,which included a variety of influential environmental organizations,has laid the groundwork for R&D and project development approachesthat will realize sustainable biopower systems. Current energyand agricultural policies directly and indirectly impact the attractivenessof biomass power. As an example, the 1992 Energy Policy Act introduceda 1.5¢/kWh tax credit for closed-loop biomass projects (thosethat use dedicated energy crops). Also, current USDA programsoffer assistance to growers who are switching to crops that placeless burden on the land and protect streams from chemical andsediment runoff. Processing to Feed and Power Alfalfa Processing & Production Statistics (tons per year) Alfalfa: 680,000 Stem to gasifier: 374,000 Leaf to animal feed: 306,000 Net Plant Power Statistics from Stem Gasification Output: 75MW Heat Rate: 8910 Btu/kWh Efficiency: 38.3% There are also new forest management projectsunderway by the U.S. Forest Service designed to protect primeforest lands from severe fire destruction, which may increasesupplies of biomass feedstocks/residues from low-grade forestmaterials. A number of environmental and development assistancepolicies will also help foster increased support for biomass powerdevelopment. For example, most countries signed the Global ClimateChange treaty and agreed to reduce air emissions, including CO2,and many international lending institutions incorporate a substantialenvironmental component in qualifying their loans. Market-basedenvironmental trading mechanisms included in the Clean Air ActAmendments encourage innovative transactions such as fuel switchingor blending with biomass. Power marketers are investigating thesalability of "green electrons," which gives consumersthe opportunity to purchase their electricity from producers usingrenewable energy technologies. All of these efforts provide the necessary foundation for future expansion of both the biomass power and biomass fuel supply industries. The Strategic Planfor the DOE Biomass Power Program builds on this foundation toachieve the mission, goals and strategic objectives of the Program. Overview Of The Program Strategy The basis of the strategy is to ensure that both the producers of biomass feedstocks and consumers of electricity obtain the benefits of biomass power, while meetingthe goals of rural development, environmental protection, developmentof new technologies to open export opportunities, and diversificationof the U.S. energy portfolio. Decreasing the cost of fuel supplyclearly helps the generator, while efficiency improvements andreductions in fixed and variable non-fuel costs at the generatingplants enables them to be competitive, while providing fair returnsto the biomass producers. There are many pathways by which this may be achieved. However,the central goal is to have an economically and environmentally sustainable system based upon a sustainable fuel supply infrastructure that will facilitate investment in modern high efficiency power production cycles. The first componentof the strategy is to create the conditions for a significantand early market for biomass in co-firing applications with coalin existing utility boilers. This strategy involves little riskin the power production component at a very low investment costper installed kilowatt (kW). Co-firing gives offsets in carbondioxide, sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions, while convertingbiomass at high efficiency (>35%) into electricity. Even at5% substitution of biomass for coal, a major coal fired plantcan provide a market for biomass at the 50 - 100 MW scale in agiven region, requiring in excess of 500,000 tonnes of biomassper year. This will build a sustainable fuel supply infrastructure—one which can be used in the future as a base for expanded,and even more efficient, power generation options that are currentlyunder development. This strategy minimizes the capital investmentsrequired, while aiding existing power producers in their carbonmanagement strategies. Since a significant portion of futurebiomass fuel supplies will be derived from residues in the sameway as today's industry, such a strategy will improve recyclingand reduce landfill impacts, while providing regional and ruralrevenues. Coal co-firing represents a huge market. However, thedistribution of suitable generating facilities is mainly in theeastern U.S., and due to location and transportation costs, thiswill still leave large quantities of available and/or potentialbiomass resources without a market. The provision of dedicatedfeedstocks will occur over the medium term as current initiativesprove the stabilizing effect of these resources on the existingsupply system. To reach this potential, new and efficient technologiesthat are less scale dependent are needed, such as gasifiers, gasturbines, fuel cells and other prime movers. Unlike the co-firingoption, such technologies will have global market potential. These markets will lead to worldwide sales of U.S. technologiesin developing economies that are undergoing electricity growthrates of greater than 10% per annum. Early investments in thedevelopment of improved biomass conversion technology could payoff in the rural American economy and in targeted industrial sectorsin developing countries, such as the tropical cane sugar processingindustries. Technologies with scale independence down to 100kW that maintain efficiency and low investment costs could openup enormous worldwide village electrification markets in countriessuch as India, China and Latin America. Goals Of The Biomass Power Program Establishing a set of qualitative goals that are of strategicimportance to the Program, DOE, and the nation is critical ifwe are to appropriately move forward with a comprehensive programplan. As such, we must identify the critical few, high-levelaccomplishments that will "make a difference" in fosteringa viable integrated biomass power industry. The Biomass PowerProgram has identified seven strategic goals that are containedwithin four primary program areas. These program areas and ourassociated goals are outlined below. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT Feedstocks Goal: Facilitate the commercialization and widespreadproduction of environmentally acceptable energy crops, dual-usecrops, and biomass wastes and residues as feedstocks for biomasspower facilities. Conversion Technology Goal: Facilitate the commercialization of advanced/high-efficiency biomass power conversion technologies integrated with dedicated feedstock supplysystems. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES Environmental Goal: Improve the capability of biomass resources to provide goods and services, including electricity, by fostering the highest standards of environmental performance consistent with the social and economic goals of society. POLICY, PLANNING, AND PRODUCER-USER LINKAGES Power Sector Acceptance Goal: Facilitate the establishment of biomass power as an economically credible and attractive option in the eyes of the power sectorindustry, particularly in the context of the future deregulatedutility environment. Fuel Supplier Acceptance and Risk Goal: Reduce fuel supplier risks associated with biomass supply andenergy crop production. Financial Goal: Address financial and investment hurdles for domestic and international markets. EDUCATION Educational Goal: Improve public understanding of the technical,economic and environmental attributes of biomass power. Technology Development Goals Facilitate the commercialization and widespread production ofenvironmentally acceptable biomass fuel supplies for power plants. Facilitate the commercialization of advanced/high-efficiency biomasspower conversion technologies integrated with dedicated feedstocksupply systems. Strategic Issues Technology development can be grouped into two categories: feedstock development and conversion technologies. To achieve the goal of 8000 MW of additional biomass power capacity over the next 15 years, an expanded sustainable supply of biomass feedstocks is needed. The supply sector needs to make the transition from a residues-based approach to an integrated, dedicated feedstocksupply system using energy crops and residues. The barriers toachieving this are: the uncertainty of decision-makers regardingthe potential role of energy crops in competing with or complementingproduction of food or fiber crops; the need to demonstrate theenvironmental and economic sustainability of energy crops; andthe need to reduce the average delivered cost of energy cropsby means such as improved crop yields and harvesting equipment. The barriers facing conversion technologies include: current limitedcost-competitive niche applications for biomass-to-electricitytechnology; the absence of incentives to invest in higher-risk,longer-term projects; the lack of demonstrated advanced biomassintegrated gasification combined-cycle technology; and the absenceof power technologies suitable for export to foreign markets. In light of these barriers, the program has identified the followingobjectives and strategies for overcoming barriers to advance biomassconversion technology in the competitive marketplace. Strategic Objectives FEEDSTOCK DEVELOPMENT Facilitate the transition from integrated use of residues to dedicated feedstocks by validating the technical and economic viability of integrated supply systems. Demonstrate the competitiveness and benefits of integrated energycrop systems. Facilitate the expansion of agriculture and itsrelated infrastructure for large-scale energy crop use, achievingdeployment of 3 million acres of energy crops within the next15 years. CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY Encourage biomass cofiring as a cost-effective, nearer-term opportunity. Cost-share the development of efficient pioneer technologies at small, industrial, and utility scales for domestic and internationalmarkets. Facilitate the deployment of an additional 8000 MW of improved biomass fuel supply and conversion technologies within the next 15 years. Environmental Issues Goal Improve the capability of the ecosystem to provide goods and services,including biomass electricity, by following the highest standardsof environmental performance consistent with the social and economicgoals of society. Strategic Issues The future success of biomass power development requires that feedstock supplyand conversion systems meet high standards of environmental acceptability. Keyissues that need to be addressed include uncertainty regarding the magnitude of biomass power's potential role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and questions regarding potential benefits and impacts on soil nutrients and habitat associated with use of agricultural and forestry residues for fuel. There is also insufficient datafor decision-makers regarding the emissions of conventional andadvanced biomass power conversion systems to assess life-cyclebenefits. Strategic Objectives Invest in stewardship of our air, water and soil resources to produce electricity, goods, and services by following the highest standards of environmental performance consistent with the social and economic goals of society. Establish criteria for environmentally acceptable integrated fuelsupply and conversion systems used in biomass power applications,in cooperation with EPA and other environmental groups. Improve methodologies for assessing and reporting the environmentalimpacts of feedstock supply and conversion systems used in biomasspower applications. Validate the ability of dedicated biomass feedstock and advanced conversion technology to meet high environmental standards for air, water, and soils. Support biomass power applications and approaches that maintain or enhance biodiversity and that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Policy, Planning And Producer-User Linkages Goals Facilitate establishing biomass power infrastructure as an economicallycredible and attractive option; Reduce fuel supplier risks associated with biomass energy supply and energy crop production; Address financial and investment hurdles for domestic and international markets. Strategic Issues There is a diverse array of constituency groups involved in biomass power, including consumers, farmers/landowners, forest products industries, power producers, and others. The wide range of constituency groups creates uniquechallenges to the growth of the biomass power infrastructure. Key strategicissues that need to be addressed include: opportunities createdby utility restructuring; continuing low fossil fuel costs forthe near to mid-term (2007); and existing energy and agriculturalpolicies, which include inadequate valuation for biomass externalitybenefits such as carbon recycling and local job creation. Internationalstrategic issues include: lack of adequate knowledge with respectto biomass resource availability and exploitation in emergingmarkets. In addition, for a number of developing countries thereare issues associated with protection of intellectual propertyrights and repatriation of profits. Fuel supplier acceptance and risk must be addressed, including: creating an efficient functioning market for wastes and residues to complement energy crop supplies; policies that favor conventional crops over energy crops; andlack of demonstrated large-scale competitive biomass energy cropproduction. Significant financial and fiscal challenges which biomasspower faces in domestic and international markets include: thefinancial community's unfamiliarity with biomass conversion andfuel supply issues, which creates difficulties in obtaining projectfinancing (both debt and equity); and failed or inadequate taxincentives that have hindered biomass power development, suchas the highly restrictive tax credit for "closed-loop"biomass supply systems. Strategic Objectives Cooperate with the private sector to foster market-driven approaches which encompass the externality benefits of biomass (distributed generation, green pricing, etc.). Provide inputs to legislative actions correcting failed incentives or policies which discourage integrated biomass power development. Continuously monitor the impacts of various trade policies and tariffs in relation to biomass power export opportunities for U.S. industry.

Education Goal Improve public understanding of the technical, economic and environmental attributes of biomass power. Strategic Issues The public is generally not familiar with biomass power technologies; and to the extent that it is aware of biomass, there is often a tendency to focus on potential drawbacks rather than recognizing the significant benefits biomass power offers. This will have to be overcome if biomass is to make alarger contribution to domestic and international fuel supplysituations. Environmentalists want more information on issuessuch as the potential impact of biomass energy crops on biodiversity,or the impacts of removing residues or low-grade trees from forests. How biomass is perceived by these various groups will have atremendous impact on the future of biomass industry growth. Forthis reason, education of the various interest groups and thepublic is considered to be a primary goal. Strategic Objectives Widely disseminate information on biomass power technologies andbenefits to a broad range of customer audiences, including thegeneral public, agricultural community, media, elected officials,and school-age children. Develop data on energy crops appropriate to important geographic and climatic zones. Develop an effective media outreach program to include story developmentand placement in a number of print and other media (includingthe Internet); and through support for conferences and roundtables. Databases will be developed for easy access to project information. Present the benefits of biomass power in reducing thethreat of global warming; facilitating sustainable forestry andagricultural practices; creating jobs; and solving waste managementproblems. Seek stakeholder participation where program managershave the opportunity to actively listen to and better understandconstituent concerns. Foster partnerships among constituents and between constituents and DOE. Encourage cooperation from other energy and related programs at the federal, regional, state and local levels. Work with USDA and other federal agencies to help educate legislative decision-makers regarding the barriers caused by current legislation, and potential waysto modify legislation to overcome these problems.

The Vermont Project has been undertaken to demonstrate the integration of the Battelle Columbus Laboratories (Battelle) "indirect" gasifier with a high-efficiency gas turbine. The demonstration and validation of this gasification/gas turbine system is being undertaken at the existing 50 megawatt wood-fired McNeil Power Generating Station in Burlington, Vermont, thereby significantly reducing the time-scale for deployment and the necessary capital investment for DOE and the Vermont project partnership. The development and commercialization of this technology is important for several reasons: 1) It does not require a hot-gas cleanup for gas turbine operation, thus removing this technical hurdle from the commercialization path; 2) It is the only biomass gasification system in the world that has successfully powered a gas turbine, proving its near-term viability for commercial deployment; and 3) It produces a higher BTU gas stream than other gasification systems, thus allowing the use of exising unmodified industrial gas turbines. FY 1996 Products The project's detailed design will be completed and construction will be initiated on a 15 megawatt installation that will complement the existing 50 megawatt output of McNeil Station. Payoffs Demonstration of this U.S. technology at a utility power station will significantly buy-down the perceived risk among domestic and international power project developers. It will also provide significant market opportunities for advanced-cycle, high-efficiency biomass power generation systems for application in domestic and international markets. Successful demonstration will provide substantial market pull for U.S. biomass gasification technologies, and provide a significant market edge over competing foreign technologies. Status Currently, Zurn Nepco, an engineering company with extensive experience in the design and construction of biomass-fired power plants, is preparing the detailed engineering design and is completing the permitting process for the start of construction, which is scheduled for late 1995. Operation and debugging of the gasifier component is forecast for 1996, and the addition of the gas turbine is forecast for 1997. Partners and Cost Share The Vermont Project is a scale-up of an indirect gasifier concept developed by Battelle, which is based in Columbus, Ohio. The principal industrial partner, Future Energy Resources Company (FERCO), of Atlanta, Georgia, is cost-sharing 50% of the overall project costs with DOE. Other project participants include the co-owners of the McNeil generating station located in Burlington, Vermont, which is operated by the Burlington Electric Department, and Zurn Nepco, of Portland, Maine. Related Programs This project parallels the Hawaii Biomass Gasifier Facility project in many respects. The Battelle indirect gasifier technology to be used in the Vermont project features several innovations that may offer advantages over air/oxygen blown gasification systems. One advantage is that it generates a fuel-gas that is free of atmospheric nitrogen, which makes it capable of easy catalytic cleanup prior to either combustion or use in the chemical synthesis of methanol, a future automobile fuel. The product gas has about half the heating value of natural gas, unlike other air-blown gasifiers that produce a biogas with a much lower heating value. As a consequence, existing gas turbines can be used with this fuel-gas without modification. DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies operates the Biofuels Development Program that is developing liquid fuels from biomass through gasification technologies, with a strong emphasis on the use of biotechnology to produce ethanol from lignocellulosics (such as woody or grassy materials). As such, the technology development and validation to be accomplished under this program directly benefits DOE's Biofuels Program as well. Vulnerabilities and Issues The major vulnerability concerns the worldwide competition for biomass gasification technologies. Currently, there are several biomass gasification commercialization activities underway in North America, Brazil, and Scandinavia. Two promonent international developments (the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility Gasifier Project in Brazil, and the Varnarmo Bioflo project in Sweden) indicate the European biomass gasification technologies are also close to commercial demonstration, which could provide direct international competition for this developing market. It is critical that U.S. tehcnologies not lose out to foreign interests in this vast arena of market opportunity. Accordingly, further development, demonstration, and deployment of this technology could be jeopardized should funding for this Biomass Power project be reduced.

Craig and Margaret K. Mann National Renewable Energy Laboratory Golden, CO 80401 Introduction Currently, there are approximately 8.5 GW of grid-connected biomass electricalgenerating capacity in the U.S., including that from landfillgas and municipal solid waste (see Figure 1). Unfortunately,a substantial fraction of this existing capacity employs relativelyunsophisticated and inefficient direct steam technology. Averageefficiencies for existing systems are less than 25%. As a consequence,the size of a given biomass power installation historically hasbeen limited by these low efficiencies and the amount of fuelwithin an economical transportation radius. The resulting lowoutput yields a high capital cost for these systems on a dollarsper kilowatt basis ($/kW). A number of recent developments arechanging the nature and constraints of the biomass power option,however. Significant technical advancements are being made thatwill allow for substantially increased utilization efficiencyof biomass as a fuel. Advanced gas turbine and combined cycletechnology is being commercially deployed and demonstrated withnatural gas as well as solid fuels such as coal through the useof gasification technology. Biomass gasification technologiesare also being developed and demonstrated. Linking these conversionand utilization processes will nearly double current biomass electricalgeneration efficiencies. Concurrently, DOE, NREL, and ORNL areactively pursuing development and demonstration of Dedicated FeedstockSupply Systems (DFSS). Such systems would allow operation ofplants requiring as much as 2000 dry T/day of biomass feed. Thecombination of advancing technology and improved fuel supply willincrease the feasible biomass power plant size into a range attractiveto utilities, and thus expand the market for biomass power beyondthe independent power producers and co-generators who have, todate, been the principal players in the biomass power industry. Moreover, these biomass power systems will further leverage researchdollars by directly and substantially benefitting from the technologicaladvances being made by government and industry funded gas turbineand fuel cell development programs. These utilization technologiesare the subject of substantial development efforts, and are beingdemonstrated in integrated systems with coal gasifiers under theClean Coal Technology Program. Figure 1. Grid Connected Electricity from Renewables Purpose of Study The purpose of this study wasto determine the efficiency and cost of electricity of IGCC systemsincorporating biomass gasification technology. The systems weexamined incorporate state-of-the-art, commercially availableaero-derivative and utility gas turbine technology as well asscale-appropriate modern steam cycle technology. The resultingperformance and cost numbers indicate the commercial potentialfor these systems, and define areas for continued and focusedresearch. We also examined different options for gas cleaningprior to combustion in the gas turbine combustor, and comparedour results to previous studies on this subject. Systems Studied ASPEN simulations were performed on three biomass IGCC systems: an air-blown(i.e. direct-fired) pressurized fluidized bed gasifier of thetype under development by the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT),the Battelle Columbus Laboratory (BCL) low pressure indirectly-heatedbiomass gasifier, and an air-blown low pressure gasifier similarto that developed by Thermiska Processor AB (TPS) in cooperationwith ABB-Flakt. Process development unit (PDU) experimental results,where available, provided the basis for gasifier performance predictions.A high degree of process integration between the gasifier andcombined cycle was incorporated to maximize system efficiency. The combined cycles investigated were based on aero-derivativeand state-of-the-art utility gas turbines of appropriate sizes. To make a direct comparison of different combined cycle systems,the high pressure direct-fired gasifier was integrated with bothan aero-derivative gas turbine and an utility gas turbine. Theaero-derivative gas turbine selected for this study was the GeneralElectric LM5000PC. This unit has a higher pressure ratio (24.8)and firing temperature (in excess of 1150°C) than the utilitymachines selected for most previous biomass IGCC studies. Theutility-scale gas turbine selected was the GE MS-6101FA, an advancedturbine that moves GE's "F" technology (high firingtemperature, high efficiency) down to a 70 MW-class machine. Because of lower overall system efficiencies (as compared withthe utility turbine case) and higher fuel pressures required,cases integrating the low pressure gasifiers with the LM5000 turbinewere not considered. All systems employing the utility turbineused a two-pressure reheat steam cycle. The LM5000 case useda small, non-reheat steam cycle. Gas cleanup in all cases includeda tar cracker to reduce the quantity of higher hydrocarbon speciesin the gas, followed by gas cooling via direct or indirect quenchto condense alkali species. For the high pressure gasifier, ahot ceramic candle filter of the type being offered by Westinghouseand being demonstrated under the Clean Coal Technology Programwas used to remove particulate matter including these condensedalkali compounds. In this case, the quench step cooled the gasdown to less than 538°C. Particulate removal in the low-pressuregasifier cases was accomplished with cyclones and a fabric filter. The direct quench that follows in these latter cases reducesthe fuel gas temperature to 96°C in preparation for compression. Other alternate designs that were studied include greenfield plant constructioninstead of an existing plant site basis, indirect cooling of thesynthesis gas, various levels of humidification of the syngas,and different moisture levels of the feedstock. It should benoted that not all of these variations were examined with eachgasifier combined cycle system. Performance, cost, and economicdata were developed for each of the cases tested, and are presentedin this report. Methodology The intentof this study was to evaluate the ultimate potential for applicationof IGCC technology to biomass-based power systems of large scale(> 30 MWE). Therefore, the plant designs examined were assumedto be for mature, "nth-plant" systems. The aggressivesparing and redundancies typically utilized for "first-plant"designs and the attendant cost associated with such an approachwere not applied to the systems examined here. However, the technologyand equipment utilized in all of the system designs is currently,though not in all cases commercially, available. In some cases,the technology selected for these systems is under developmentfor increased reliability, availability, and maintainability. However, projected technological advances that may result fromon-going research were not included or assumed. The base year of1990 was chosen for cost and economic analyses in this study. In part, this reference year was chosen to facilitate comparisonof our costs with previous studies in this area. Process Analysis Detailedprocess models were developed using the Advanced System for ProcessENgineering (ASPEN/SP) process simulator to evaluate the performanceof the three biomass IGCC systems. The material and energy balanceresults of these simulations were used to size and cost majorpieces of equipment from which the resulting cost of electricitywas calculated. As part of this development, data from PDU operationof the IGT and BCL gasifiers were regressed and incorporated intoa user-specified yield reactor. Detailed information on gasifieroperation and performance at a variety of conditions was not availablefor the low-pressure direct gasifier. Therefore, this case utilizeda quasi-equilibrium model and reactant ratios developed from limiteddata contained in a Lurgi report on fluidized bed gasificationof biomass[1]. Gas turbine performance when utilizing lowenergy content biomass derived fuel gas was estimated based onthe operating parameters (air flow, pressure ratio, firing temperature,outlet temperature) of the selected gas turbine[2], [3]. A simulation was developed that matches its performance (output,heat rate) on natural gas fuel by "tuning" the efficiencyof the various compression and expansion stages as well adjustingheat losses, cooling air extraction etc. Utilizing these same"tuning" parameters, the resulting turbine model wasincorporated, along with the biomass gasifier and cleanup sectionmodels, into an overall gasification combined cycle simulation. The simulation was configured such that the amount of biomassfed to the system was calculated based on the amount of gaseousfuel required by the gas turbine to achieve its design firingtemperature. Changes in the gas turbine output and efficiencybecause of the increased mass flow of the low energy content gasand the higher fuel gas temperature are thus roughly predicted. This approach has been employed in numerous studies performedat the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) for coal-basedIGCC systems. This prediction method has also been validated,within certain limits, by results obtained by turbine manufacturersand engineering firms that have prepared detailed designs of thesuch systems. It must be realized, especially in the air-blowngasifier cases, that modification of the gas turbine combustormay be required in order to efficiently combust the low calorificvalue fuel gas produced. The design limits of the turbine compressormust also be kept in mind when mass flow through the turbine sectionis increased. Such a scenario arises, again, due to the reduced(compared to natural gas) chemical energy content of the fuelgas produced from biomass. The simulation calculates the overallbiomass-to-electricity efficiency for the system based on totalfeed to the system and the net electrical power produced. Themajor auxiliary equipment items (feed water pumps, boost compressor,blowers, etc.) are explicitly included in the simulation, andtheir power requirements subtracted from the gross plant output. A 3% charge was taken against this preliminary net power (grossminus major equipment) to account for balance of plant electricalpower including wood handling and drying. Site Conditions Since this was not a site specific design, ranges of ambient conditionswere not available. Therefore, International Standards Organization(ISO) conditions (15°C, 1 bar atmospheric pressure, 60%relative humidity) were assumed as the ambient conditions forthis evaluation. Air fed to the plant was assumed to be composedof 20.73 mol% oxygen, 78.22 mol% nitrogen, 1.02 mol% water, and0.03 mol% carbon dioxide. Wood Analysis The biomass used in each analysis was that used most extensivelyin testing each gasifier. Wisconsin maple wood chips have beentested at a number of gasifier conditions in the IGT RENUGAS®9 T/day process development unit (PDU), and are therefore usedin the high pressure simulations. According to tests at BCL,the biomass used for the low pressure indirectly-heated gasifiersimulation is typical of woody biomass such as hybrid poplar. Wisconsin maple was also used as the feedstock in the low pressuredirect gasifier simulation. The ability to feed biomass to gasificationsystems, high and low pressure, has been demonstrated in experimentalwork at a variety of scales. Detailed analyses of the feedstock,product gas, and solid residues are available from experimentaldata for the IGT and BCL gasifiers. For the low-pressure directgasifier case, feed data is available and char and product gascomposition is estimated. In the ASPEN simulations, biomass andchar were simulated as non-conventional components; the elementaland property analysis for each biomass type are shown in Table1. The heat of combustion was calculated by adjusting the standardASTM correlation for biomass. Table 1: Biomass Analysis Wisconsin Maple Hybrid Poplar Ultimate Analysis (weight %, dry basis) Carbon 49.54 50.88 Oxygen (by difference) 43.73 41.90 Hydrogen 6.11 6.04 Nitrogen 0.10 0.17 Sulfur 0.02 0.09 Chlorine 0.00 0.00 Ash 0.50 0.92 Heat of combustion, HHV, Btu/lb, dry basis 8,476 8,722 Moisture, as received 38% 50% General Plant Requirements With the exception of the greenfield analysis of the high pressuredirect gasifier, the plants examined are assumed to be locatedat or near an existing generating facility and to share facilitiessuch as land and an electrical substation. Additionally, allplants are assumed to be in close proximity to roads or railroadspurs adequate for delivery of the biomass feedstock. This islikely to be true when a dedicated feedstock supply system (DFSS)is employed since the power plant would be sited near the centerof the agricultural area representing its biomass "shed". In addition to the major process areas and equipment discussedlater in the report, the following items and systems are assumedto be part of the plants evaluated in this study: cooling watersystems, plant and instrument air, potable and utility water,effluent water treatment, flare system, fire-water system, interconnectingpiping, buildings, lighting, computer control system, and electricalsystem. Process Descriptions Description of Plant Sub-sections The biomass-based IGCC electric generating plants considered in thisstudy consist of the following process sections: Fuel receiving, sizing, preparation, and drying Truck unloading system Wood yard and storage Sizing and conveying system Dryers Live storage area Gasification and gas cleaning (Gasification Island) Wood feeding unit Gasifier Char combustion and air heating Primary cyclone Tar cracker Gas quench Particulate removal operation Power Island Gas turbine and generator Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) Steam turbine and generator Condenser, cooling tower, feed water and blowdown treating unit General plant utilities and facilities All systems simulated incorporatea fairly high level of integration between plant sections. Ineach system examined, a char combustor is used to convert anyun-gasified carbon. The resulting energy provides pre-heatingfor the gasifier steam and air (where required), as well as heatfor the biomass drying. In actual practice, carbon conversionin the direct gasifiers may be sufficiently high that a separatechar combustor is not required. In the indirectly-heated gasificationsystem, the char is combusted to heat sand which is circulatedto the gasifier. There, the hot sand provides heat for the endothermicgasification reactions. Air for the direct-fired gasifiers wasremoved from the gas turbine compressor discharge scroll and boostedor let down in pressure, as appropriate, with a compressor orturbine. This air extraction is necessary to avoid significantlyincreased mass flow in the expansion section of the gas turbine,and thus compressor surge. Without air extraction, turbine massflow would be increased due to high fuel gas flows necessitatedby the fuel gas's low energy content. Gasification steam, whererequired, was extracted from an appropriate location in the steamcycle. For the aero-derivative turbine (LM5000) cases, a singletrain for all process sections and units was used. The "small"utility turbine (MS-6101FA) case required use of two gasificationtrains to provide adequate fuel gas. This also imparts some part-loadredundancy in these systems. Each plant section is discussedfurther below. Wood Preparation and Drying Design of the wood receiving, handling, and drying operations was basedon a number of existing studies in this area [4], [5], [6]. Wood chips sized to 0 x 2" are delivered by truck to theplant site at a cost of $46/bone dry Tonne ($42/bone dry ton).The feed requirements for each plant are shown in Table 2. Thewood was unloaded and moved to the paved storage yard that wassized to provide one week of feed storage. Wood reclaimed fromthe storage yard was sized to less than 1½" and conveyedto the wet feed storage silo (one day of storage). Wood fromthe silo was conveyed from the silo to the dryers (2 in parallel)and then to the "live" or "day" storage tankfrom which it is fed to the gasifier. Table 2: Biomass Feed Requirements for Each Analysis Feed Requirements (dry T/day) High pressure gasifier, aero-derivative gas turbine 712 High pressure gasifier, indirect quench 712 High pressure gasifier, greenfield plant 712 High pressure gasifier, advanced utility gas turbine 1,620 Low pressure indirectly-heated gasifier, utility gas turbine 1,486 Low pressure air-blown gasifier, utility gas turbine 1,352 The wood dryers are of the co-current rotary drum type. Designconditions selected for the wood drying section result in a moisturecontent of 11% by weight (17% in the low-pressure direct casefor reasons that will be explained later). In the direct-firedgasifier plants, the gas used for wood drying was a mixture ofcombustion products from a small fluidized bed combustor fluegas extracted from the HRSG. For the indirectly-heated gasifier,a mixture of ambient air and char combustor flue gas is used. For each design, sufficient ambient air is mixed with the combustionproducts to reduce the gas temperature to 204°C (400°F)prior to introduction to the dryers. While this can result ina relatively high oxygen content (16 mole %), the temperatureis believed to be sufficiently low to avoid the possibility ofdryer fires. Gas leaving the dryers at a temperature of 80°C(175°F) enters the dryer cyclone and then a baghouse to reduceparticulate emissions. The temperature level at the baghouse is,again, believed to be sufficiently low to mitigate fire danger. The dried wood exits the dryers at 68°C (155°F) andcools further during final transport to the feed system. High Pressure, Air-Blown Gasification The high pressure gasifier system selected for this study was a fluidizedbed unit similar to that under development by the Institute ofGas Technology (IGT) and marketed under the name RENUGAS®.A schematic of this gasifier integrated with the combined cycleplant is shown in Figure 2. This is a pressurized, air-blown,single stage fluidized bed gasifier. The gasifier bed materialis typically an inert solid such as alumina. The bed materialimproves fluidization quality and increases bed depth and heatcapacity, solid residence time, and carbon conversion. The IGTgasifier has been operated over a wide range of temperature, pressure,oxidant, and fuel types at the process development (PDU) scale,and is the subject of a larger scale demonstration projects inthe United States (Hawaii) and Europe (Finland). Wood from the feed lockhopper is introduced into the pressurizedfeed hopper with live-bottom metering screws to meter the feedinto an injection screw that introduces the feed into the gasifiernear the bottom of the bed. Air and a small amount of steam areintroduced to effect the gasification and combustion reactions. The operating temperature selected for the gasifier for thisstudy was 830°C (1526°F). The gasifier operatingpressure for aero-derivative turbine case was 3.24 MPa (32 atm)and 2.07 MPa (20 atm) for the utility gas turbine system. Theformer pressure is outside the currently demonstrated range forthis gasifier which is 23 atm, but is believed to be achievabledue to experience with coal gasifier designs operated at similarpressures. These pressures take into account the pressure dropthrough the gas cleaning systems and allow for a 25% pressuredrop across the gas turbine fuel control valve. Gasifier designand operating conditions are contained in Table 3. Compositionof the gasifier product gas was based on experimental data fromthe IGT PDU gasifier tests with maple wood chips. Continued developmentby IGT has lead to improved gas quality and increased carbon conversionsince these data were obtained. It is expected that the commercialdesign for this gasification technology would realize these benefitsas well. The product gas composition used in this study is containedin Table 4. Product gas from the gasifier enters the primarycyclone which removes char and ash particles prior to enteringthe tar cracking unit. Table 3: High Pressure Gasifier Design Parameters and Operating Conditions Gasifier temperature 830°C (1526°F) Gasifier pressure 3.17/2.07 MPa (31.3/20 atm.)

Solids throughput 6018 kg/hr-m2 (1,230 lb/hr-ft2) Air / wood ratio (wt/wt, MAF) 1.07 Steam / wood ratio (wt/wt, MAF) 0.32 Direct quenching produces a fuel gas witha lower heating value (LHV) of 4.3 MJ/m3 (115 Btu/standard cubicfoot). Indirect quench produces a fuel gas of slightly higherquality 4.8 MJ/m3 (128 Btu/standard cubic foot). Analysis indicatesthat indirect quenching is relatively cost neutral so could beused in cases where gas quality is important. Figure 2.

Additional demonstrationsof this technology include a 64 T/day unit in Finland. The solidthroughput, gas superficial velocity, and the ratio of bed todisengaging zone cross-sectional area were all maintained at thesame level as for the 91 T/day demonstration unit. This yieldeda gasifier vessel with a bed diameter of 2.86 meters (9.4 feet)between the refractory lined walls and a vessel outside diameterof 4.26 meters (14 feet). Gas Clean-up For this case, gas cleanup was accomplished by cooling the productgas to less than 538°C (1000°F) via direct quenchto condense alkali species. A hot ceramic candle filter of thetype being offered by Westinghouse and being demonstrated in theClean Coal Technology Program is then used for removal of particulatematter including, it is hoped, the condensed alkali compounds. Recent tests of tar cracking and this particulate and alkaliremoval strategy were conducted at the IGT PDU unit in Chicago. Results from these tests indicate that a tar cracker may notbe necessary in an eventual commercial system design. The tarsare produced in fairly small quantities, and appear to be substantiallycracked prior to reaching the tar cracking vessel. The particulatefilters tested at IGT also did not experience any plugging problemsdue to tars, and were successful in reducing the particulate matterand alkali species in the gas stream to very low levels. Long-termtesting of the filters will be conducted in the coming year atthe PICHTR facility. For the purposes of this study, thereforequenching followed by the ceramic candle filters was assumed tobe sufficient for fuel gas cleaning. High Temperature Gas Cooling Alkali species present in the fuel gas can cause corrosion and deposition if introducedinto the expansion section of a gas turbine. Therefore, it wasnecessary to remove these species prior to combustion. Thesemust be removed to extremely low levels, typically less than onepart per million. Fortunately, most alkali components presentin biomass synthesis gas have relatively high condensation temperatures. Therefore, cooling to below 538°C (1000°F) resultsin condensation of the bulk of these species, usually as fineparticles that can be removed with the rest of the particulates. This cooling can be accomplished in a number of ways. The basecase analyzed here performs this cooling by direct injection ofwater into the gas stream. While this dilutes the fuel gas streamand reduces its heating value, it was the simplest and least expensivefrom an equipment standpoint. An alternate case utilized indirectcooling of the fuel gas, utilizing the recovered heat in the steamcycle. High Temperature Particulate Removal Westinghouse has been developing high temperature ceramic barrier filters foruse in advanced IGCC and pressurized fluidized bed combustor (PFBC)systems. The most promising of these so far, is the ceramic candlefilter unit utilizing silicon carbide filters. A unit of thistype was currently being demonstrated at the Tidd PFBC site underthe Clean Coal Technology (CCT) Program. Several other demonstrationsof this unit are planned under additional CCT projects includingthe Tampa Electric IGCC demonstration and Sierra Pacific's PiñonPine IGCC project. This unit will allow removal of particulatesto levels acceptable to a gas turbine expansion section. Thisunit has recently become available as a commercial offering withthe attendant performance guarantees. Char Combustion In this system, the fluidized bed char combustor provides the energyfor gasifier air/steam heating, and boiler heat for the steamcycle. Char burned in the combustor has a carbon content of approximately87%. The combustor operates at a temperature of 843°C (1550°F)with 20% excess air. Tubes are included in the combustor systemto provide air/steam heating and to recover heat for the steamcycle. Carbon conversion in the combustor was assumed to be essentiallycomplete. As discussed earlier, the commercial version of thisgasifier is likely to have very high carbon conversion (> 99%). In this case, a char combustor would be unnecessary and energyfor air/steam heating and wood drying would be obtained from elsewherein the process. Low Pressure Indirectly Heated Gasification - The BCL Gasifier The low pressure indirectly-heated gasifier selected for this studywas developed at Battelle Columbus Laboratory specifically forbiomass gasification. A schematic of this gasifier integratedwith the combined cycle is shown in Figure 3. The distinctivefeature of the BCL unit was that unlike direct-fired gasifierswhich use both steam and air, only steam was injected with thebiomass to promote gasification. Therefore, the fuel gas hasa higher heating value than that produced by direct-fired gasifiers. Without rehumidifying the fuel gas, the higher heating valueof the fuel gas is 16.4 MJ/m3 (441 Btu/scf); if the fuel gas isrehumidified to 20% by weight, its higher heating value is 14.2MJ/m3 (379 Btu/scf). The heat necessary for the endothermic gasificationreactions was supplied by sand circulating between a fluidizedbed char combustor and the gasification vessel. In addition toacting as the heat source, the sand was the bed material for thegasifier, designed as an entrained fluidized bed reactor. Ofthe total amount of sand circulating between the gasifier andchar combustor, 0.5% is purged to prevent ash build-up in thesystem. Because this stream is nearly 100% sand, it is likelythat its means of disposal would not be subject to the same requirementsas pure ash from directly-heated gasifier systems. Figure 3. Low Pressure Indirect BIGCC Schematic This integrated gasification combined cycle plant was simulated in ASPEN/SP; aFortran subroutine controls the simulation of the gasifier. Theequations in this subroutine which control the component massbalance in the gasifier were developed from regressing the experimentaldata from the Battelle Columbus Laboratory 9 T/day PDU [7] [8]. Because of the low pressure, wood from the dryers was fed tothe gasifier using an injection screw feeder. According to thesimulation, the gasifier operates at nearly atmospheric pressure(172 kPa, 25 psi) and 825°C (1517°F). The design parametersand operating conditions of the indirectly heated gasifier areshown in Table 5. The product gas composition, calculated inthe Fortran subroutine during the ASPEN simulation is shown inTable 6. The composition of the char is dependent upon the temperatureof the gasifier, which in turn is dependent upon the heat balancebetween the char combustor and the gasifier. The char compositionis determined, therefore, by the Fortran subroutine, and is shownin Table 7.

Results, showingthe relationship between moisture content of the feed versus gasifiertemperature, are shown in Figure 4. These curves represent twosystem designs where the air to the char combustor is fed at eitherambient conditions (15°C) or is preheated to 538°C. It was found that as the moisture level increases, the heat availablefrom the char is no longer sufficient to maintain gasificationand also vaporize the water in the feed. Figure 4 shows thatif the char combustion air is not preheated, a dryer is necessary. In real operation, the gasifier temperature would continue toplummet below 650°C; the curve plateaus at this point becauseof the lower limit set on the gasifier temperature in the ASPENsimulation. Although a dryer is still deemed necessary if themoisture content of the feed is higher than approximately 25%and the air is preheated, the drying requirements can be reducedfrom what is typically thought to be required (approximately 10%moisture levels) and still maintain temperatures necessary forgasification. Figure 4. Gasifier Temperature as a Function of Feedstock Moisture Content Gas Clean-up Fuel gas produced by the low pressure indirectly heated gasifier was cleanedusing a tar cracker to reduce the molecular weight of the largerhydrocarbons, and a cyclone separator to remove particulates.A direct water quench was used to remove alkali species and coolthe gas to 97°C for compression. As an additional safeguard, a baghouse filter was also included to remove any fine particulatesthat were not removed in the cyclone separator, and to ensurethat any alkali species that were not removed in the quench arenot fed to the compression and turbine systems. Although a tarcracker was not necessarily required since the gas was cooledusing a direct water quench, one was included in this design toavoid losing the substantial heating value of the tars. Fuel Gas Compression Compression of the fuel gas prior to the gas turbine combustor was accomplished ina five stage centrifugal compressor with interstage cooling. This series of compressors increased the pressure from 172 kPato 2,068 kPa (25 psi to 300 psi). The maximum interstage temperaturewas 158°C, and the interstage coolers reduced the temperatureof the syngas to 93°C. This unit operation was optimizedat five stages according to the purchased equipment cost and horsepowerrequirements. After compression, the syngas is heated indirectlyto 371°C with process heat from the quench and char combustorflue gas. Rehumidification of the Syngas Prior to Combustion For the indirectly-heated gasifier, the efficiency, electricity output,and cost of electricity were also studied as a function of themoisture level of the syngas prior to combustion in the gas turbinecombustor. During quench and compression, the water in the syngasis reduced to 7% by weight. Feeding this syngas directly to thecombined cycle results in an efficiency of 35.67% and a cost ofelectricity of $0.0576/kWh on a constant dollar basis. If, however,a portion of the water that drops out of the syngas during compressionis compressed and re-added such that the moisture content is 20%by weight, the efficiency and constant dollar cost of electricityare 35.40% and $0.0572/kWh, respectively. Thus, rehumidifyingthe syngas prior to combustion decreases the overall efficiencyof the system but increases the power output; this results ina slightly lower cost of electricity, although 2% more biomassfeed is required. Increasing the moisture level of the fuel gaspast 20% is not feasible as the gas turbine mass flow limit isreached and the ability of the turbine combustor to burn the woodis decreased. Naturally, the heating value of the fuel gas isreduced when water is added to it. Without rehumidifying thefuel gas, the higher heating value of the fuel gas is 16.4 MJ/m3(441 Btu/scf); at 20% by weight, its higher heating value is 14.2MJ/m3 (379 Btu/scf). Low Pressure, Air-Blown Gasification The last commercially available gasifier type investigated was thelow pressure direct system. The most well-known gasifier of thistype is that offered by TPS and is also known as the Studsvikgasifier. The TPS gasifier has been selected for the World Bank'sGlobal Environment Facility (GEF) project in Brazil. The GEFproject will couple a TPS gasifier fueled with eucalyptus to aGE LM-2500 aero-derivative gas turbine system for power generationin northern Brazil. The TPS gasifier was also examined in a biomassIGCC application as part of a DOE/NREL sponsored site-specificfeasibility study conducted by Weyerhauser [9]. Other lowpressure, direct air-blown gasifiers that have been operated withbiomass include the Lurgi circulating fluidized-bed gasifier andthe Energy Products of Idaho (EPI) gasifier. A schematic of thesystem used in this study is shown in Figure 5. Table 8: Low Pressure, Direct-Fired Gasifier Design Parameters and Operating Conditions Gasifier temperature 870°C (1,600°F) Gasifier pressure 0.14 MPa (1.36 atm) Fuel gas pressure 1.89 MPa (18.6 atm) Dried wood feed to gasifier 1,460 T/day (1,606 t/day) Dried wood moisture content 15.8% Air / wood ratio (wt/wt, MAF) 2.1 Steam / wood ratio (wt/wt, MAF) 0 Unfortunately, little concrete data is publicly available on the operating conditions,reactant ratios, and fuel gas produced by the TPS gasifier. Forthis study, therefore, data from biomass testing in a small-scaleLurgi circulating fluidized-bed gasifier [10] was usedto estimate gasifier performance. The operating conditions selectedfor this gasifier were a temperature of 870°C (1,600°F)and a pressure of 0.14 MPa (1.36 atm). Survey of available dataon gasifiers of this type indicates that steam is rarely usedas part of the gasification process. It was noted that the moisturecontent of the dried biomass used in these gasifiers is somewhathigh (up to slightly over 20%); it is assumed that this moistureserves as the source of "steam" for the steam-carbon gasificationreaction. Relatively high air/biomass ratios also seem to becommon for gasifiers of this type, though again, detailed informationon this point is difficult to obtain. Table 8 summarizes theoperating conditions for the gasifier used in this case. Figure 5. Low Pressure Direct BIGCC Schematic In order to estimate gasifier performance and fuel gas composition, a quasi-equilibriummodel was used. This process employed the RGIBBS model in ASPEN/SPalong with its capability to accommodate equilibrium approachtemperatures for specified reactions. The problem was furthercomplicated by the lack of information on air preheat temperature. The problem was solved by selecting the gasifier temperatureand pressure and a probable air/biomass ratio. The air preheatlevel was adjusted to yield a heat loss expected for a unit ofthis scale (1.5%), and the equilibrium approach temperatures forthe various gasification reactions adjusted to match reportedfuel gas composition. These, of course, are not independent variablesso an iterative approach was required. Nitrogen in the fuel gasprovided a check on the selected air/biomass ratio. The derivedfuel gas composition after the gas cleaning and conditioning describedbelow is shown in Table 9. Table 9: Low Pressure, Direct-Fired Gasifier Product Gas Composition Component Volume % H2 18.87 CO 23.66 CO2 8.29 H2O 4.85 N2 44.22 CH4 0.11 LHV = 4.8 MJ/m3 (129 Btu/SCF) Gasifier Design Owing to the aforementioned dearth of detailed information on this gasifier, it was not possibleto perform a detailed gasifier design. Instead, the design andcost information for the TPS gasifier case contained in the Weyerhauserfeasibility study was scaled to fit the system examined in thisreport. Portions of the following system description in thissection are extracted from the Weyerhauser final report, and additionaldetails can be found therein. Biomass is fed to the gasifierby two screw feeders that are isolated from the upstream componentsby pressurized rotary valves. The gasifier is a two-zone fluidizedbed rector that used sand as a bed material. Biomass fed to thegasifier drops into the lower, dense phase fluidized bed. Thisportion of the gasifier provides sufficient residence time forgasification of the larger biomass particles. Preheated primaryair enters the gasifier near the base of the vessel and maintainsfluidization of this dense portion of the bed. Secondary airin added above the dense bed to produce a "fast" fluidizedbed region. In this section, remaining fuel is fully pyrolizedand gasified by the combined action of heat, air, and gas components. Air for gasification is extracted from the gas turbine compressorand let down to gasifier operating pressure through a turbine. This generates an additional 8.4 MWe of power, almost half theamount required to drive the fuel gas compressor. The air extractionrate in this case was such that the combined air and combustionproduct mass flow through the gas turbine expansion section and,thus the power output, was not significantly different from thedesign values on natural gas. Gas Clean-up Fuel gas exiting the gasifier cyclones enters a circulating fluidizedbed tar cracking unit. This unit reduces the quantity of higherhydrocarbon species in the fuel gas that could otherwise foulthe fuel gas cooler, plug the fabric filters, and increase wastewatertreatment loads from the gas scrubber. Dolomite is used as thebed material in the tar cracker. The higher temperature of thetar cracker (920°C, 1688°F) also ensures conversionof any un-gasified solids that escape the gasifier. After exiting the second stage tar cracker cyclone, the fuel gas enters thesyngas cooler. In a slight modification to the Weyerhauser reportdesign, this unit is used to preheat gasification air as wellas provide heat to the steam cycle. In actual practice, the potentialsafety risk of this scheme would have to be carefully evaluatedthough we have some assurances that such an approach is feasible[11]. In the syngas cooler, the temperature of the fuel gas is reducedto 288°C (550°F). Any particulates remaining in the fuel gas are removed in a bag filter unit. As the fuel gas iscooled, volatile alkali species present in the gas stream condenseon the remaining particulate matter and are removed from the systemby the filter bags. The particulate-free fuel gas is cooled furtherin a direct contact water scrubber that removes any trace higherhydrocarbons and most of the water in the fuel gas stream. Thisoperation also removes a significant amount of the ammonia fromthe fuel gas. Following this step, the gas is further washedwith a dilute sulfuric acid stream. These combined steps removeover 95% of the ammonia from the fuel gas. This ammonia wouldotherwise be likely to produce NOx in the gas turbine combustor. Purge streams from both towers are sent to wastewater treatment. The fuel gas then enters a knockout drum prior to the fuel gascompressors. Fuel Gas Compression Following final fuel gas cleaning, the fuel gas is compressed for introductioninto the gas turbine combustor. Although the turbine pressureratio is only 14.9, the fuel gas is compressed to 1.89 MPa (18.6atm) to allow for pressure drop across the fuel control valve. This compression is accomplished in a multi-stage, inter-cooledcentrifugal compressor. This portion of the process was not detailedin the Weyerhauser report and so was evaluated as part of theASPEN/SPsimulation. It was noted that fewer compression/inter-coolingstages were required to maintain gas temperature within acceptablelimits in this case than in the indirect gasifier case. Presumablythis is due to differences in the gas composition. Combined Cycle Power Generation Since the output, performance, and conditions of the combined cyclesvary across the cases examined, only the general features of thepower island are discussed here. Output and efficiency data arecontained later in the discussion of the results of this study. All of the equipment discussed in this section was commerciallyavailable. The MS-6101FA gas turbine will see its first commercialdemonstration at Sierra Pacific's Piñon Pine IGCC plantbeing funded under DOE's Clean Coal Technology Program. Gas Turbine Hot (538°C for the pressurized gasifier system, 371°C for the low pressure indirectly-heatedgasifier system, 225°C for the low pressure direct gasifier)clean fuel gas is introduced into the gas turbine combustor alongwith air from the high pressure turbine compressor. All scenariostested, including those with direct quench produced fuel gas thatwas well within the projected requirements for combustion of lowenergy content gas in gas turbines. The use of a direct quenchor humidification in some of the systems studied produces a fuelgas with higher moisture levels which helps reduce formation ofnitrogen oxides in the combustor and increases the mass flow throughthe turbine expander and, thus, the turbine's power output. However,in all if the cases studied, the overall increase in mass flowthrough the turbine expander was less than 10% since the increasedflow of low energy content fuel gas was partially offset by gasificationair extracted from the compressor discharge. An important technical qualification to selection of the turbines in this study is theability to extract gasification air for the air-blown gasifiersfrom the compressor discharge. This extraction was necessarynot only to realize the efficiency benefits of tight integration,but to maintain compressor/turbine power balance. Because ofthe reduced heating value of the gasifier product gas, a largeramount of this fuel gas (compared to natural gas) was requiredto achieve design turbine firing temperatures. This additionalfuel can increase the mass flow into the turbine section, dependingon the amount of air extracted, and thus the turbine's power output. Without air extraction, this increase can cause compressor stall. In the case of the indirectly heated gasifier, air extractionis probably not necessary because the fuel gas produced is ofa medium heat content. The air/biomass ratio for the low pressuredirect gasifier (and thus the air extraction rate) is such thatthe turbine mass flow and power output is essentially unchangedfrom the natural gas design values. The aero-derivative gas turbineselected for this study was the General Electric LM5000PC. TheLM5000 has a higher pressure ratio (24.8) and firing temperature(in excess of 1150°C) than the utility machines selectedfor previous biomass IGCC studies. The smaller size turbinesused in earlier studies were selected because of the smaller amountsof biomass fuel available compared to systems using coal or naturalgas. Unfortunately, small scale utility turbines are generallythe last to benefit from technological advances in the field. Therefore, resulting system efficiencies were correspondinglylow relative to coal or gas IGCC systems. One of the goals ofthis study was to evaluate the effect the latest turbines hadon biomass system efficiency. A combined cycle was selected ratherthan the steam-injected LM5000 because of the lower water usagerequired for the combined cycle. This allows maximum flexibilityfor siting the plant, reduces feed water treating, and conserveswater resources. The similarly sized and higher efficiency LM-6000turbine was not selected for the study because of its even higherpressure ratio of 30. Air extraction has not yet been demonstratedwith the LM5000 gas turbine; however, an investigation of thefeasibility and mechanics of this practice has been investigatedby DOE's Fossil Energy program and such a scheme has been investigatedwith the related LM2500 turbine being used in the GEF project. General Electric and other turbine manufacturers are incorporatingair extraction provisions into some utility turbine designs includingthe MS-6101FA discussed below. Westinghouse also commerciallyoffers for biomass-derived as well as natural gas fuels, the 251B12"ECONOPAC™" combined cycle system. This packageis nominally rated at 50 MW, includes low-NOx combustion technology,and has a net efficiency of 46.5% (LHV basis) on natural gas fuel. Within the last few years, a smaller, advanced utility gas turbinehas also become available, the GE MS-6101FA. This turbine movesGE's "F" technology (high firing temperature, high efficiency)down from the company's 160 MW MS-7221FA machine to a 70 MW classmachine. This increases the Frame 6 efficiency to 34.2% (simplecycle, LHV, natural gas) from the 30% range previously typicalfor this scale and type of machine. The increased mass flow andtemperature of the turbine exhaust also allows the use of moresophisticated steam cycles in this size range. The pressure ratioof utility machines (14.9 for the 6FA) was also more compatiblewith demonstrated biomass gasifier operation. Further, the MS-6101FAis able to accommodate extraction of up to 20% of the compressordischarge flow to supply a gasifier[12]. A recent Gas TurbineWorld article [13] also discusses GE's 20% uprate of thisturbine's power output when fueled with synthesis gas. For thesereasons, systems incorporating the Frame 6FA turbine were alsoevaluated. It was believed that the substantially increased efficiencywould offset the system size increase and keep the feed requirementswithin what might be available from a dedicated feedstock supplysystem (DFSS). Heat Recovery Steam Generator Gas turbine exhaust was ducted to the heat recovery steam generator(HRSG). For the LM5000 based cases, the HRSG design and conditionswere derived from published information on the LM5000 steam-injectedturbine [14]. This was done to avoid issues of availabilityof high performance HRSG's for small-scale turbines and the associatedcost data. The HRSG incorporates a superheater, high and lowpressure boilers and economizers. Superheated steam (394°C,5.3 MPa) was provided for the gasifier and the steam cycle. Mediumpressure steam (1.4 MPa) was also provided for the steam cycle. The exhaust temperature from the HRSG in all cases, 140°C(284°F), was sufficiently high to avoid any possible corrosionin the stack and to mitigate plume visibility issues. Given the higher turbine exhaust temperature (618°C, 1145°F),a more complicated HRSG was utilized for the systems integratedwith the MS-6101FA gas turbine. In this case, the HRSG providessteam superheating and steam reheat, as well as the high and lowpressure boilers and economizers. For all designs, HRSG's weredesigned with superheater temperature approaches of 16-33°C(30-60°F) and pinch points of 22°C (40°F). Boilerblowdown was assumed to be 2%, and feedwater heating and deaerationare performed in the HRSG system. All feedwater pumps are motordriven rather than steam turbine driven. In all direct gasifiersystems studied, supplemental heat for drying is provided by fluegas extraction from an appropriate point in the HRSG. Steam Turbine System The steam turbine system for the LM5000 cases was relative simple comprisinghigh (HP) and low pressure (LP) power turbines and a generator. Superheated steam (394°C, 5.3 MPa) was introduced into thehigh pressure turbine and expanded to 1.4 MPa (200 psia). Exhaustfrom the HP turbine was combined with additional steam from theLP boiler and introduced to the LP turbine which exhausts to thecondenser at 6,900 Pa (2 in. Hg). For the MS-6101FA case, thesteam cycle was somewhat more advanced. Superheated steam at538°C and 10 MPa (1000°F, 1465 psia) was expanded inthe HP turbine. Gasification steam, where required, was extractedfrom the HP exhaust. The remaining steam was combined with steamfrom the LP boiler, reheated, and introduced into the intermediatepressure (IP) turbine. Exhaust from the IP turbine was passedthough the LP turbine and condensed at 6,900 Pa (2 in. Hg). Expandedsteam quality leaving the LP turbine in all cases was 90 per cent. Assumed generator efficiency was 98.5%. General Facilities A mechanical induced-draft cooling tower was assumed for each design. This includes all of the necessary pumps for condenser coolingand makeup water needs. Balance of plant equipment includes plantwater supply and demineralization facilities, firewater system,waste water treating, service and instrument air system, and theelectric auxiliary systems. General facilities included are roads,administrative, laboratory and maintenance buildings, potablewater and sanitary facilities, lighting, heating and air conditioning,flare, fire water system, startup fuel system, and all necessarycomputer control systems. In addition, the greenfield case includedcosts for land and land development, as well as an electricalsubstation for transmission access. Overall System Performance Process conditions and system performance for each of the cases examinedare summarized in Table 10. Net system output ranges from 55.5MWe for the LM5000 cases to 131.7 MWe for the high pressure gasifierMS6101FA case. Net system efficiency ranges from 35.4% for thelow pressure indirect gasifier case to 39.7 for the high pressuregasifier MS-6101FA case. Gas turbine output and efficiency basedon fuel heating value are greater than those listed in the literaturefor natural gas fuel. These increases are primarily the resultof high fuel gas temperatures and the increased mass flow throughthe turbine expander (due to lower energy content fuel gas). The gas turbine power output in the high pressure gasifier caseis in excess of the 20% performance augmentation claimed by GEfor their turbine operated on synthesis gas fuel. The turbinemay need to be de-rated in this case using more sophisticatedmodeling techniques. The performance results from the simulationdemonstrate a number of salient points. It was clear that useof advanced turbine technology results in significant efficiencygains. Predicted efficiency of the worst case considered wasnearly eight percentage points higher than the best previous biomassIGCC system study. It is also clear that the lower gas turbineefficiency of the MS-6101F (as compared to the LM5000) was morethan compensated by the more advanced steam cycle that was possiblewith its increased exhaust flowrate and temperature.

Bycalculating the economics of the processes being studied and comparingthe results to the prices within the electricity generating market,the potential profitability can be assessed. Economic Analysis Methodology The levelized cost of electricity from three BIGCC systems was calculated by settingthe net present value of the investment to zero. The method andassumptions that were used are based on those described in theEPRI Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) [15] and reflect typical utilityfinancing parameters. Independent power producers or cogeneratorswould clearly have different analysis criteria. The spreadsheetused for COE calculations was developed at DOE's Morgantown EnergyTechnology Center. A summary of the economic assumptions is presentedin Table 11.

Capacity factored estimates utilize the ratio of thecapacity (flowrate, heat duty, etc.) of an existing piece ofequipment to the new equipment multiplied by the cost of the existingequipment to estimate the cost of the new equipment. A scale-upfactor particular to the equipment type was applied to the capacityratio. The equipment-based estimates were determined from moredetailed equipment design calculations based on the process conditionsand results of the simulations. All costs were estimated in instantaneous1990 dollars. Where necessary, costs were corrected to 1990 usingthe M&S or Chemical Engineering equipment cost indices. Acharge of 20% of the installed cost of the major plant sectionswas taken to account for all balance of plant (BOP) equipmentand facilities. Additional costs a for substation and land wereincluded for the greenfield case. The major equipment costs weremultiplied by a factor to arrive at the total direct cost of theinstalled equipment. Table 12 lists the factors used to determinetotal direct cost. In the design of the various pieces of processequipment, every effort was made to specify units that were modularand capable of being shop fabricated and shipped by rail. Itwas believed that this approach will help keep capital costs lowand shorten the learning curve in deployment of plants of thistype. Table 12: Cost Factors Used for Calculation of Total Direct Cost Installation 15% of delivered equipment cost Piping 45% of delivered equipment cost Instrumentation 10% of delivered equipment cost Buildings and Structures 10% of delivered equipment cost Auxiliaries 25% of delivered equipment cost Outside Lines 10% of delivered equipment cost Total Direct Plant Cost (TDC) 215% of delivered equipment cost Wood Preparation and Drying Costs The majority of the equipment necessary for solids handling, storage,sizing, and conveying was scaled from a study performed by Tecogenfor a similar sized IGCC plant based on the BCL indirectly heatedgasifier [16]. A magnetic separator was added as one was notexplicitly included in the Tecogen analysis. Costs for the separatorwere determined from a detailed study on wood handling equipment[17]. The dryers were sized based on the methodology outlinein the Tecogen study and the costs were developed from Perry'sChemical Engineers' Handbook [18]. A baghouse was addedto remove wood particles from the dryer exit. Costs for the baghousewere developed used the CHEMCOST program. The equipment includedin the wood preparation and drying section includes the following:truck unloaders and truck scales, chip yard handling equipment,one week storage paved chip yard, one day storage silo, sizingbin/chip hogger, conveyor/bucket elevator, magnetic separator,rotary drum dryers, and baghouse filter. Gasification Costs The costs of the high pressure air-blown gasifier and its associatedequipment were initially based on work done for EPRI by SouthernCompany Services [19]. Because of the similarities in designand operating conditions, the cost for the gasifier and its associatedequipment was based on that for the Kellogg-Rust-Westinghouse(KRW) coal gasifier. While the report was being revised and finalized,however, more recent and applicable cost data became available. In May of 1995, Northern States Power (NSP) completed a reporton a site-specific feasibility study that evaluated biomass gasificationcombined cycle technology for rural power generation [20]. This report included cost estimates for the Tampella Power Systems(not associated in any way with TPS) biomass gasifier. Tampellaare a licensee of the IGT gasifier technology and it is believedthat their design and costs are representative of the high-pressuregasifier used in this study. Therefore, the gasification sectioncost contained in the NSP report was scaled and modified to reflecta projected nth plant cost and used in the final version of thecost figures for systems incorporating the high pressure directgasifier. These revised, higher, costs also reflect the consensusposition on the cost of nth plant biomass IGCC systems developedin discussions with EPRI, Princeton, Colorado School of Mines,and others and documented in an EPRI paper [21]. The originalcost figures can be found in an ASME paper by the authors [22]. For the utility turbine case, two gasification trains of equalsize were used to provide the required quantity of fuel gas tothe turbine. The boost compressor for the gasification air wassized based on the ASPEN/SP simulation and its cost determinedfrom a standard references [23],[24],[25],[26]. The costs associated with the low pressure indirectly heatedgasifier were determined by studying and evaluating the accuracyof costs developed by several independent sources [27],[28],[29],[30]. It was assumed that two gasification trains of equal capacitywill be needed. Equipment included in the gasification sectioninclude the gasifier, char combustor, char combustor cyclone,sand surge pots, ash cyclone, sand makeup hopper, startup burnerand blower, and steam supply valves. The costs of the low pressureair-blown gasifier were developed from information contained inthe Weyerhauser feasibility study [31] for the TPS gasificationsystem. The capital costs are reported by overall plant section(e.g. "Gasification", "Power Block") so detailedanalysis and scaling was not possible for each piece of equipment. Given that the gasification system design was essentially identicalto that used in our simulation, the entire gasification sectioncost was scaled to the size required for use with an MS-6101FAgas turbine using an overall scale factor of 0.8. This assumes,of course, that a single train could be increased in scale by60%. Otherwise, two parallel trains would be required. Thiswould increase the gasification section capital cost by approximately15%. Gas Clean-up Costs Tar cracker The initial tar cracker design wasdeveloped using laboratory data [32] including space velocitiesof 2000 hr-1; however, this resulted in extremely large and shallowbeds. Further examination of the laboratory data revealed thatvery large space velocities were utilized to quickly test catalystlife. Therefore, a reduced space velocity (35% of the lab value)was adopted for the design. This resulted in reasonable superficialgas velocities and a vessel size of 4.26 x 12.8 meters (14 x 42ft.). The module cost for the tar cracker was determined usingthe CHEMCOST program and the cost factor applied. High temperature gas cooling For the cases that used a direct quench, the cost of a quench pumpwas determined with the CHEMCOST program. For the indirect gascooling case, the area and size of the heat exchanger requiredwas calculated utilizing standard methods [33] and based ondata from the system simulation. The cost of this indirect coolerwas determined from the CHEMCOST program. In both cases, a costfactor of 0.7 was applied to the basic equipment cost. High temperature particulate removal Based on information supplied by the equipment vendor [34], it wasbelieved that a hot gas filtration unit similar in size to thatbeing demonstrated with the Tidd pressurized fluidized bed combustor(PFBC) system under the Clean Coal Program would be appropriatefor a gasification train of the size being evaluated in this report. The vendor supplied an FOB cost for the hot gas filtration unit. The installation factor applied to the particulate filter wasreduced slightly given the highly modular, shop fabricated natureof the unit. This cost was further confirmed against data containedin the NSP report which used a similar system. Compression Costs for Low Pressure Gasifier Systems In the low pressure indirectly heated gasifier plant, a five stagecompression system with interstage cooling was used to boost thepressure of the syngas prior to combustion in the gas turbinecombustor. The purchase price and total power requirement forthis compression operation were estimated to be $3.8 MM and 9.6MWe, respectively. This unit was optimized at five stages accordingto the purchased cost and horsepower requirements which were higherfor both four stage ($4.1 MM, 9.7 MWe) and six stage ($3.9 MM,9.7 MWe) compression systems. The cost for the fuel gas compressoris included in the gasification section system cost from the Weyerhauserreport that was used to develop an overall cost for the gasificationsystem up to the combined cycle system. Therefore, cost detailsfor the compressor itself are not available. Data from the ASPENsimulation indicates that two or three compressor stages withinter-cooling would be required to raise the fuel gas to the necessarypressure. The number of stages is largely constrained by theallowable outlet temperature of each stage and the thermodynamiccharacteristics of the fuel gas. Char Combustor Cost for High Pressure Gasifier System The base cost for the char combustor for the direct gasification systemswas determined from the ENFOR reports [35] on commercially availableequipment for wood combustion and the result independently confirmed[36]. The size was determined based on the heat duty ofthe unit. The total cost for the combustor system was reducedby 30% from that found in the ENFOR reports, since a substantialfraction of the heat recovery in the commercial system (and thereforea substantial fraction of the heat exchange area) was not neededfor this application. The system cost included the feed system,primary air, boil, and ash removal system. The final cost forthe wood handling and drying section was compared with an independentcost estimate for a system of similar size[37], and foundto be similar. As discussed earlier, if gasifier carbon conversionachieves high levels in the final commercial, this plant sectionwill not be required. This would result in a total capital requirementsavings of $2.1 million in the aero-derivative turbine case and$3.3 million in the utility gas turbine case as well as an indeterminateamount of O&M expense. Combined Cycle Power Generation Costs Gas Turbine Costs for the gas turbines utilizedin this study were determined from published data [38] or fromthe manufacturer. Again, installation factors were slightly reducedbecause of the modular nature of the gas turbines and associatedequipment. Heat Recovery Steam Generator The cost of the HRSG for the LM5000 turbine was estimated from publishedsources [39], [40]. The HRSG cost for the MS-6101FAturbine was scaled from the cost for a similar unit for the MS-7001FAturbine [41]. Steam Turbine System The cost for the steam cycles for both systems were determined fromcapacity costs ($/kW) from a number of sources [42], [43], [44]. The estimated cost included all ancillary equipment for the cycle including mechanical draft cooling tower, feedwaterpumps, condenser, etc, and was estimated to be $250/kW of thesteam turbine output for the large steam cycles and $350/kW forthe smaller steam cycles. Total Plant Cost, Total Plant Investment, and Total Capital Requirements To obtain the total plant cost (TPC), capital costs were added tothe installed equipment cost for general plant facilities (10% of process plant cost), engineering fees (15%), and project contingency (15% of process plant cost + general plant facilitiescost). The percentages were selected from ranges provided inEPRI TAG [45]. No process contingencies were applied to theindividual plant sections as this was assumed to be a mature plant. The total plant investment (TPI) was determined by adding theinterest cost plus inflation to the TPC. The period of constructionwas assumed to be 2 years and construction interest was assumedto be 4.5%. The total capital requirement (TCR) for the plantwas the sum of the TPC, TPI, royalties, startup costs, initialcatalyst and chemicals, working capital, spare parts, and land(where applicable). A summary of the capital costs for each casewas contained in Table 13. Operation and Maintenance Costs Operating and maintenance costs for the plant were based on an 80% capacityfactor. Wood costs were assumed to be $46/Mg ($42 per bone dryton). It was assumed that 2 operators per shift were requiredfor the LM5000 based systems, and 5 operators per shift for theMS6101FA based system. This number of operators is substantiallyreduced over the EPRI TAG numbers and those contained in our earlierevaluation. This revised estimate is a result of developing operatingtrends and the consensus position arrived at between NREL, EPRI,Princeton, and others. A summary of annual operating costs foreach case is contained in Table 14. Ash disposal costs for theindirectly-heated gasifier case are significantly higher thanin the other cases because a large amount of sand was purged toprevent build-up of ash in the system. It is likely that thissand stream will not be disposed of in the same manner as pureash streams from the other gasifiers, but a more conservativeapproach was taken in assuming the cost per tonne was the same.

Cost of Electricity vs. Plant Size From Several Studies Figure 7. Capital Cost of Biomass IGCC Systems vs. Size From Several Studies Analysis, Discussion, and Conclusions It is clear from these analyses that gasification/turbine systemscan produce electricity at up to twice the average efficiencyof today's biomass power industry. The highest efficiency systemexamined here uses an advanced utility-scale gas turbine (the GEMS6101FA). Such a system benefits not only from economy of scale,but from the increased turbine efficiency and, perhaps most significantly,the reheat steam cycle that is feasible at this scale and turbineexhaust temperature. Historically, generating systems of thisscale (> 100 MWe) have been deemed infeasible for biomass-basedsystems because of the associated feedstock requirements. However,the use of advanced combined-cycle technology reduces fuel requirementsto manageable levels because of the striking increase in generatingefficiency. Also, smaller, industrial-scale, gas turbines withvery high efficiencies are being developed under the UDSOE's AdvancedTurbine System (ATS) program. These are likely to be attractivefor biomass systems as they will require reduced quantities ofbiomass to access high efficiency turbine systems. Complementary to this trend is the development of dedicated feedstock supplysystems that are intended to sustainably supply larger quantitiesof feedstock than were heretofore available. Properly managed,these trends are positioned to merge and provide a new generationof high-efficiency and cost-competitive biomass-based electricitygenerating stations. It is also clear from this study however thateven the most promising electricity cost from biomass is higherthan currently quoted avoided costs and new, high-efficiency naturalgas combined cycle systems. This is certainly one of the challengesfaced by the industry today. Deregulation is likely to bringmany opportunities as well as challenges however. Among theseare capturing the market for "green power" demonstratedby innumerable public surveys. Also promising is deployment ofthese technologies into the cogeneration and distributed generationmarkets. This avoids head-to-head competition with large centralstation fossil-fueled plants. Additionally, such systems mayhave access to low cost feedstocks or favorable treatment by regulatorybodies. Smaller scale distributed generations systems employingindustrial turbines or fuel cells are also applicable to the burgeoninginternational market for electricity generation. Advanced utilizationsystems are currently under development that hold the potentialfor even more significant improvements in cost and efficiencythan the systems examined here. It is important to continue developmentand demonstration of current technology and dedicated feedstocksupply systems to be positioned to take advantage of these advances.

It is predicted that by the year 2010, over 13,000 megawatts of biomass power could be installed, with over 40% of the fuel supplied from 4 million acres of energy crops and the remainder from biomass residues. This would support over 170,000 U.S. jobs and would substantially revitalize rural economies. Biomass energy crops can be a profitable alternative for farmers, which will complement, not compete with, existing crops and thus provide an additional source of income for the agricultural industry. It is envisioned that biomass energy crops will be grown on currently underutilized agricultural land. In addition to rural jobs, expanded biomass power deployment will create high skill, high value job opportunities for utility and power equipment vendors, power plant owners and operations, as well as agricultural equipment vendors.

Through competitive procurements, this initiative aims to demonstrate and deploy integrated biomass power systems that are economically and environmentally viable and sustainable. Additionally, the projects selected through this procurement must provide significant rural economic benefits. It is the mutual intent of DOE and USDA to successfully demonstrate the integration of biomass feedstock production with advanced high-efficiency power conversion systems which will produce power at cost-competitive rates. These demonstrations will validate the many benefits associated with deploying integrated biomass power technologies, including job creation (especially in rural areas), the introduction of alternative energy crops as a means to offset federal agricultural subsidy payments, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. FY 1996 Products Through this competitive solicitation, a minimum of 2 (and up to 5) integrated biomass power projects will be initiated through 50/50 cost-shared cooperative agreements with private sector partnerships. These projects will be the first step in demonstrating the successful integration of biomass feedstock production with advanced power conversion technologies. The plants will utilize environmentally and economically sustainable biomass feedstocks consisting of an appropriate mix of dedicated energy feedstocks and/or waste/residue resources. Payoffs It is anticipated that by the year 2000, each of the proposed integrated bioenergy systems will be operational, paving the way for future large-scale implementation of these rural energy systems. The beneifts include: 1) Demonstration of integrated feedstock supply systems with advanced power conversion technologies; 2) Economic revitalization of rural America; 3) Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; 4) Improvements in biodiversity and ecological health; and 5) Creation of a U.S. industry with significant export potential. Status The competitive procurement "Biomass Power for Rural Development", Solicitation No. DE-PS36-95GO10052, was issued on December 14, 1994. Final proposals were received as of May 9, 1995. This collaborative effort between DOE, USDA and industry will exploit near-term, niche market opportunities for integrated biomass feedstock conversion and power production systems. All proposals submitted in response to this solicitation include details regarding the rural economic benefits to be provided by the proposed project. In the first phase of this solicitation, the proposers will develop detailed engineering plans for both the conversion technologies and the feestock supply systems. They will also obtain all necessary environmental permits and authority to construct their facility prior to the second phase of the procurement, which will award development funds for the construction and operation of the successful projects. Direct cost-share funding is provided through DOE, and indirect support through existing USDA crop production and set-aside programs. The goal for 1995 is the award of several first-phase financial assistance packages to proposers. In 1996, final awards to selected projects will be issued along with permission to proceed. Related Programs The Biomass Power Program, which is under DOE's Office of Utility Technologies, addresses the technology validation and evaluation of biomass power systems, with the participation and resources of national laboratories and industry. The Biofuels Program, which is under DOE' Office of Transportation Technologies, addresses the development of liquid fuels from biomass, with a strong emphasis on the use of biotechnology to produce ethanol from lignocellulosics (materials such as wood or grass). The "Biomass Power for Rural Development" project addresses the coproduction of both ethanol and electricity and will further goals of the DOE Biofuels Program, as well as the Biomass Power Program. Interagency cooperation between DOE and USDA has greatly facilitated the near-term pursuit of viable, integrated biomass power systems. This program will help DOE and USDA achieve the mutual goals of rural infrastructure development, job creation, and opportunities to reduce federal subsidies provided to agricultural markets. Vulnerabilities and Issues Since this initiative is focused on the creation of integrated biomass production and technology development, there is a strong need for continuous commitment to enable a full crop cycle to be evaluated. Support from the USDA initially is through administrative rule-making on the basis of the 1990 Farm Bill legislation. During 1995, the next Farm Bill is up for negotiation. For DOE's program to be effective and for there to be adequate possibilities for commercial acceptance and follow-through on the systems developed under this initiative, there needs to be an accommodation of bioenergy crops under the 1995 Farm Bill.

Some of these factors, such as the low cost of natural gas inthe past several years, make it difficult for the biomass poweroption (and many other conventional or renewable fuels) to competeon a simple production cost bid basis. Other influencing factors,such as negative public perception, can be overcome with increasedinformation dissemination. Meetings with industry representativesfocused on the following issues as being the areas of greatestchallenge. 3.1 Cost of Electricity Biomass power projects are relatively capital intensive (comparableto coal, but less than nuclear) and must generally be operatedas baseload stations to make the investment economic. The busbarcost-of-electricity (COE) is a common figure of merit used tocompare generation alternatives. A high capacity factor reducesthe impact of the capital cost component of the plant COE. Thisincreases the relative importance of fuel and other operatingcosts as components of COE. Once a project is operational, theplant will be dispatched solely on its relative cost to operatecompared to other plants in the system. Thus, for a biomass powerproject to contribute value to the utility system, operating costsmust be competitive with other choices. The primary drivers foroperating costs are station heat rate and fuel cost with low heatrate and fuel cost being the winning combination. (IPPs generallyhave contracts requiring the utilities to buy as much electricityas the IPP can produce, but the price paid for power is fixed. Thus, the IPP has a similar motivation to minimize fuel costsand heat rate, though it is driven more by profitability thandispatchability.) 3.1.1 Low Cost Power Generation Options Natural gas prices have remained relatively low in recent years,while natural gas combined cycle plants have increased the efficiencyof power production dramatically. This price moderation for whatis usually viewed as a premium fuel has allowed electricity generationcosts to approach 4¢/kWh with this fuel source. Althoughmore regional in nature (i.e. in the northwest U.S.), low-headhydropower costs are in this range as well. Relicensing issuessurrounding existing hydro sites are expected to significantlyconstrain the use of this resource. Because the natural gas optionis widely available, it has become the standard for many utilitiesin setting a floor on resource bids. More recently, gas priceshave begun to rebound and will probably escalate at a moderatelevel during the rest of the decade. 3.1.2 Feedstock Availability and Cost Feedstock availability and cost strongly influence the COE associatedwith biomass power facilities. Biomass feedstock collection canbe labor intensive, especially when obtained from the forest floor. Also, because biomass has a higher bulk density per unit heatinput than coal, it has higher associated transportation and handlingcosts. In the northwest, environmental concerns (i.e. spottedowl habitat) have greatly affected the timber industry. Thisdirectly affects the feedstock availability for biomass powerplants in that region. In California, the rapid development ofbiomass power facilities in the 1980s (as a result of PURPA legislation),created a high demand, causing biomass fuel prices to skyrocket. Furthermore, as pulp and paper mill operations become more efficient,there is less byproduct resource available. Competing end-usesfor biomass resources, such as for landscaping mulch, maintaindemand-side pressure. Countering those forces to some degree are trends such as therestrictions on landfilling that may increase the availabilityof process byproduct resources in the market. As electricity pricesincrease, pulp and paper mills will want to become more self-sufficientin power, and repowering with high-efficiency biomass-fueled powersystems will be more desirable. 3.2 Financing/Lending Institutions Another obstacle encountered in the today's markets for new poweris securing financing. Securing financing for biomass projectscan be more difficult than for conventional projects due to higherperceived risks. For all IPP projects, the recent trend of requiringa higher equity stake on the part of the developer is forcingtechnology toward the tried and true. Lending institutions arevery reluctant to finance the construction of biomass power plantswithout an established long-term fuel supply infrastructure. Apower plant will not be financed without a fuel supply infrastructure,and the fuel supply infrastructure will not be created withouta market for the biomass fuel. In addition, despite the needfor the use of higher efficiency conversion systems to make biomasspower fuels competitive, most lenders are uncomfortable with newor unfamiliar power generation technology. Thus, perceived risksin financing can be a significant hurdle to the introduction ofthe technology that is needed to move the industry forward. 3.3 Environmental and Permitting Regulations A recurring concern echoed throughout the industry is dealingwith variable and changing permitting requirements. Federal,state, and local regulations present a veritable maze to the biomassplant developer. In addition, biomass power is seenas a relatively new technology concept where many regulators areconcerned. Therefore, whenever a developer is applying for permitsfor a biomass plant, he must first educate the appropriate regulatorsconcerning biomass technology. This has the practical effectof sending the permitting process back to square one for everynew biomass plant, where each aspect of the plant must be documentedand/or proven, over and over again. This approach may also beseen as unnecessarily burdensome, given the potentially beneficialenvironmental aspects of biomass power compared to some conventionalplants. It is hoped that once regulators are educated as to thebenefits of biomass power, some of this repetition could certainlybe eliminated (placing biomass on at least an equal footing withconventional power sources), and perhaps even some informal streamliningcould take place. An example presented to the survey team indicatedthat the permitting process for a new plant took three years andcost $3 million. Streamlining the permitting process would bea logical step for organizations hoping to encourage the use ofbiomass power. 3.4 Power Purchase Agreements and Externality Considerations Competitive bidding practices pit IPP generation options againsteach other and utility-financed options. This practice is graduallyreplacing the avoided-cost power contract. On a simple firstcost basis, gas combustion turbines tend to have a clear advantage. However, some jurisdictions are beginning to value externalitiessuch as environmental and economic impacts in the competitivebid process. These factors tend to level the playing field forbiomass power and other alternatives. In bids where these factorshave been given significant weight, biomass power projects haveproven to be competitive. While the trend is toward givingthese considerations more weight, the process and methods arestill controversial and far from being widely used. One approachfavored by several states has been the use of set-asides of blocksof power for acquisition of renewables. This approach lets renewablescompete among themselves and avoids the use of a complex systemof cost adders in the bid process. In February 1993 the administration proposed a broad-basedenergy tax covering fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and hydroelectricpower. 'Non-conventional' fuels, including biomass,were excluded. The Administration stated the objectives of thetax were to increase energy efficiency, improve the environment,enhance national security, and strengthen domestic economic performance. The tax was to be indexed to the energy content of the fuelsand was proposed at 25.7¢/MMBtu. Although it is unlikelythat the conference committee bill will include the Btu tax inthis form, it is expected that the trend toward valuing externalitiesin tax measures will be an approach given serious considerationby legislators. 3.5 Public Perception It appears that as a whole, the biomass power industry suffersfrom a public relations problem. Much of the general public (andto some extent the regulatory community) views biomass combustionas an old (1930s) style combustion technology or, worse, as acover for waste incineration. Environmental and economic benefitsof the technology are not often taken into account. Public awarenessabout today's biomass power generation, on a national level, isessentially nonexistent. This lack of awareness and/or misconceptionabout biomass power often causes unfounded community concernsregarding the siting of biomass power facilities. Industry perceives a further complication of this problem by thegovernment's failure to take a firm stance with regard to developingbiomass as a national resource for its economic and environmentalbenefits in power generation. Industry lacks the independenceto evaluate and promote these benefits to the public. Thus, theburden of reaching the public on the need for biomass power fallsto DOE which, in conjunction with the USDA and EPA, must presenta united or at least coordinated front on the issues to be resolvedand benefits that can be achieved through promoting biopower.WT02-B17-168IA060-000326-B042-320http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/biopower/5088-3-1.html 205.168.79.27 19970115015106 text/html 3394HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 01:51:12 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 26 Sep 1996 19:36:57 GMTContent-length: 3220 Biomass Power An Old Resource For A New Technology Biomass Power An Old Resource For A New Technology What is Biomass Power? DOE/GO-10095-166, Published May 1995 Biomass is all around us. It can be found in trees, grasses, andocean plants. Biomass is produced from these growing, living plantsthrough photosynthesis—the process by which plant matter isformed using the energy of sunlight. The leaves, stems, bark,and wood ignite processes to generate electricity. If biomassis cultivated and harvested in a sustainable cycle that is repeated,there is no net contribution to global warming. Biomass energyis used to make electricity, liquid fuels, gaseous fuels, anda variety of useful chemicals, including those currently manufacturedfrom petroleum. Because the energy in biomass is less concentratedthan the energy in fossil fuels, new technologies are requiredto make this energy resource competitive with coal, oil, and naturalgas. Industry and agriculture need superior energy crops and cost-effectiveconversion technologies to expand the use of renewable biomass. When used as a fuel, biomass feedstocks (such as dried, chopped vegetation etc.) can be used in power plants the same way nonrenewable fossil fuels are used to generate electricity. This is called biomass power. Biomass is one of the oldest fuels known to human kind. But theprimitive campfire is a far cry from the technology that runsa modern biomass power station. In the last two decades, biomass power has become the second largestrenewable source of electricity after hydropower. Similar to hydropower,biomass plants provide baseload power to utilities. Biomass powerplants are fully dispatchable—they operate on demand wheneverelectricity is required. If biomass is cultivated and harvested properly, it is a renewableresource that can be used to generate electricity on demand, withno net contribution to global carbon dioxide. Biomass Power Today Biomass power has developed into a diverse industry. About 350biomass power plants with a combined rated capacity of 7000 megawatts(MW) feed electricity into the nation's power lines, while another650 enterprises generate electricity with biomass for their ownuse as cogenerators. The biomass power industry employs more than66,000 people nationwide in skilled jobs ranging from equipmentmanufacturing and plant operations to agricultural activities.Today's biomass power plants primarily use residues from the farmand wood-products industries.

Advanced Technologies Technologies under development today can increase by 50% or morethe amount of electricity produced from a given quantity of biomass.The key is to generate electricity using the combined-cycle gasturbine instead of a conventional steam turbine. Although thebest steam-turbine systems have efficiencies as high as 40%, combined-cyclegas turbines fueled by natural gas have efficiencies as high as55%. To take advantage of these higher efficiencies, biomass must beconverted into a gaseous form called biogas. The U.S. Departmentof Energy's (DOE's) Biomass Power Program has helped develop prototypegasifiers to produce biogas. And in conjunction with the Stateof Hawaii and industrial partners, the Program is supporting anindustrial-scale demonstration gasifier plant at a Hawaiian sugarmill. Establishing a more efficient way to generate electricitywith bagasse, the by-product of milling sugarcane, will help createU.S. jobs by tapping into worldwide power markets. Dedicated Fuel Supply Biomass power plants need a guaranteed, long-term fuel supplyto ensure operation. Whereas today's biomass industry uses residuesfrom crops and the wood-products industry as its primary fuelsupply, the ultimate solution is for power plants to have a dedicatedfuel supply of energy crops. Millions of acres of set-aside land could be used to grow energycrops for biomass power plants. Putting this acreage into productionwould bring income to rural areas of the country and eliminatethe need for federal subsidies required for the set-aside land.DOE estimates energy crops could generate as many as 120,000 newjobs in economically depressed rural areas of the country. Energycrops, such as fast-growing trees, protect the land against erosionwith little effect on food prices. One way to guarantee a biomass fuel supply is to develop long-termpartnerships between energy crop producers and the utility andindustrial interests that specify power plant requirements. TheBiomass Power Program encourages such partnerships through cooperativeresearch and demonstration projects. In one project, for example,an electric utility, an agricultural university, and an equipmentsupplier are evaluating alfalfa as a power plant feedstock. The alfalfa would be sold as animalfeed, while the stem sections would be gasified to produce electricityin high-efficiency gas turbines. Tomorrow's biomass power industry will consist of manyelectric power plants operating on reliable and renewablebiomass feedstocks. Such an industry would generate clean, reliablebaseload electric power without contributing to climate change.

S. Department of Energy Biomass Power Program In 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy formed the National Biomass Power Program to help establish a sustainable option for helping to meet the expected new electric generating capacity needed worldwide over the next 10 years. The Biomass Power Program includes such core activities as: working with the biomass power industry to overcome problems in using some forms of biomass in existing boilers; evaluating and developing advanced technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis; assessing the characteristics ofbiogas produced from various gasification technologies; developing clean-up technology for high temperature biogas; supporting small system demonstrations; analyzing biomass power systems; and sponsoring cost-shared feasibility studies with industry. The Biomass Power Program is also supporting integrated efforts such as the "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" initiative, which includes jointly funded commercial application projects such as the Hawaii Biomass Gasifier Project at the HC&S sugar processing plant in Maui (see Figure 1), and the Vermont Biomass Gasifier Project at Burlington Electric's 50 megawatt wood-fired McNeil Station (Figure 2). As part of the Energy Partnerships Initiative, DOE's Biomass Power Program is currently working in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and private industry to demonstrate and deploy cost-competitive renewable biomass power systems that spur rural economic development. A collaborative DOE/USDA competitive solicitiation entitled "Biomass Power for Rural Development", which was issued in December 1994, is aimed at demonstrating integrated use of energy crops for power production. The projects are 50/50 cost-shared cooperative agreements with industry, with projects continuing over a 5-year period. In order to leverage its efforts and increase its effectiveness, the Biomass Power Program is working cooperatively with a number of other DOE programs. One example is the Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) Program, a joint effort between industry, DOE's Office of Fossil Energy, and DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The ATS Program is aimed at developing higher efficiency gas-fired turbines for industrial and utility use. Another important collaborative effort is with the Feedstock Supply Development Program, managed by the Biofuels Systems Division under DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies, which is sponsoring research and development on short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous energy crops. The Biomass Power Program and industry are developing technologiesto expand the use of biomass that include methods of feedstockproduction and the equipment to convert feedstocks into electricpower or process heat. The Program supports the developmentof three technologies—gasification, pyrolysis, and direct combustion—from the laboratory bench scale to the prototype commercial scale. Gasification equipment produces biogas that is burned in high-efficiencyturbine-generators developed for the electric power industry.Pyrolysis processes produce oils from renewable biomass thatburn like petroleum to generate electricity. In direct combustiontechnology, power plants today burn bulk biomass directly to generateelectricity. Improving the direct combustion technology of theseplants increases efficiency and reduces emissions. In additionto developing these three technologies, the Biomass Power Programsupports joint ventures to plan and construct facilities thatdemonstrate the benefits of biomass power. Cost-shared contractswith industry, utilities, and agriculture are building the consortiaand networks necessary to integrate feedstock production, processing,and combustion to generate electricity. The Program is supportingjoint ventures to conduct 10 case studies of dedicated feedstocksupply systems. In the coming years, an $80 million project entitledBiomass Power for Rural Development will enable prototype commercialprojects to demonstrate integrated feedstock production and powergeneration systems.

Tomorrow's biomass power plants will befueled from dedicated feedstock supply systems that use energycrops destined for specific facilities. Tomorrow's Biomass Power Plants Will Be Fueled From Dedicated Feedstock Supply Systems That Use Energy Crops Destined For Specific Facilities. Energy crops are trees and grasses selected for high yields andresistance to drought and pests. Trees are harvested on 5- to15-year cycles. Most grasses can be harvested one or more timesduring the annual growing season and may be baled like hay. Someannual crops, including grasses, grains, and oilseeds, are alreadypart of the biomass energy market. Tomorrow's feedstocks willconsist of dedicated plantings of fast-growing woody crops suchas willow and poplar trees, and herbaceous crops such as tallgrasses and canes. The Department of Energy is developing hybridpoplar and other energy crops for these dedicated acres. Establishingsuch crop lands dedicated to supplying reliable, low-cost, renewablefuel will enable biomass power plants to make a substantial contributionto the nation's electric power supply.

INTRODUCTION During September 1992 through January 1993, a review team establishedby the Department of Energy conducted an assessment of the U.S.biomass power industry. The review team, led by Michael Reedof the Solar Thermal and Biomass Power Division, and consistingof representatives of the Antares Group, Inc., and Meridian Corporation,visited with more than 50 organizations representing all sectorsof the biomass power industry. These organizations included utilities,independent power producers (IPP), component manufacturers, engineeringand construction contractors, agricultural organizations, industrialusers, and regulatory organizations. 1.1 Assessment Objectives and Approach The "Biopower Tour" served many purposes. First, DOEsolicited industry input for the development of the Biomass PowerDivision's "Five Year Plan," which was issued in May1993. DOE believed there was a critical need to obtain industry'sinsight and working knowledge to develop the near- and long-termplans of the program. At the heart of this objective was thedesire to identify near-term initiatives that the program couldpursue to help accelerate the further development of biomass powerprojects. Second, the tour was conducted to identify key playersof the U.S. biomass power industry and gain a better understandingof its needs and goals. Third, the tour served to inform industryabout the mission and scope of the DOE's Biomass Power Program. Many of the organizations were unaware that a biomass power programexisted within DOE. As such, it was important to discuss withindustry the DOE mission, proposed DOE goals, and DOE willingnessto work with them in the future. As discussed in Section 2, the biomass power industry will probablynever be a vertically integrated special industry (fuel supply,equipment manufacture and installation, through project financingand operation) like other renewable energy industries in wind,photovoltaics, solar, and hydropower. As such, it was crucialto identify the key players in this industry, and work with themin identifying their needs. DOE consulted with industry associationsand consultants to identify organizations that had active biomasspower projects and equipment in operation. While the organizationscontacted cannot be considered all inclusive of the parties withpotential interest in biomass power, DOE obtained a good cross-sectionof the industry. The geographic distribution of companies contactedis shown in Exhibit 1-1. In conducting the assessment, DOE presented a standardpresentation as a frame of reference for the meetings, but allowedthe discussions to focus on the issues and opportunities of mostimportance to the industry representatives. The basic intentwas to be a good listener and to try to identify trends and consensusissues. 1.2 Overview of Assessment Findings Biomass power already supplies 6 GWe of power to the domesticgrid and is the primary baseload technology among the renewables. Biomass power facilities have brought new industrial jobs torural areas of the country and spawned several new regional businessesin biomass fuels procurement and delivery. The basic technologyfor producing power is proven for selected feedstocks in plantsizes ranging from 10 to 50 MWe. However, many plants that havebeen fueled by agricultural byproducts or low-grade wood fuelshave experienced operational problems. Fuel sources are currentlylimited to forest thinning materials, wood and agriculture industrybyproducts, or biomass in urban waste streams. The industry mustgenerally rely on short term contracts or the spot market forfuel purchases. The infrastructure for fuel production, collection,and transport is still in a nascent state. Despite rapid growth in the 1980s, the numbers of active biomasspower projects decreased in the 1990s. There are several reasonsfor the lack of current project activity. Power producers haveoften had to use a good deal of ingenuity in their ability toacquire sufficient fuel feedstocks at reasonable costs. Competitionfor a limited feedstock source can drive up the price of the fuelsubstantially and limits the number of projects within a geographicregion. In addition, use of feedstocks with characteristics thatdiffer substantially from the fuel for which a given boiler wasdesigned affects both unit performance and reliability. The competition from natural gas-fired generators has also dampenedthe market for biomass and many other fossil-fueled projects. End-use natural gas prices peaked in the 1980s and have generallydeclined since then. The magnitude of the change varies by end-usesector, with prices declining most for on-system industrial salesand for electric utilities. The price of power generated by naturalgas combustion turbines has also often been the basis for theprice for avoided costs on which most Independent Power Producers'(IPP) power contracts are based. While production and availabilityof natural gas is expected to be maintained if not expanded throughoutthe 1990s, prices have risen since 1991. Despite the current downturn in the market, members of the IPPindustry believe that if the environmental benefits of biomasspower are fully recognized through externalities and if naturalgas prices once again return to prices consistent with the historyof natural gas as a premium fuel, then the market will rebound. The utility industry, which until now has been a relatively smallplayer in the development of biomass projects, is poised to becomea significant interest through cofiring wood at existing coal-firedboilers. This approach will allow them to reap the significantenvironmental benefits associated with biomass. For the nearterm, the IPP industry will survive by continuing to improve operationsat current plants and exploiting niche markets for greenfieldpower plants. Although most project developers expressed interestin the international markets, where capacity growth projectionsare impressive, there was a practical appreciation of the difficultiesof developing projects based on new technology or new fuel sourcesfor that market. Although many differing views were expressed concerning what needsto be accomplished and what role DOE should take to bring abouta "green revolution" in power production, there wasconsensus on the major issues and opportunities: Information and Education: A high visibility informationdissemination campaign needs to be undertaken to correct the mostcommonly held misconceptions about modern biomass-fired powerfacilities and to provide the public and decision makers witha well-founded understanding of the environmental and economicbenefits of utilizing biomass resources for power generation. Environmental Assessment and Valuation: Biomass couldhave the high tech image of photovoltaic power systems, but itwill never be a zero-emissions-generating technology. Its environmentalcharacteristics (both positive and negative) must be accuratelycharacterized and fairly portrayed to the public. Environmentalcharacterizations should be performed by independent industrysources. The environmental benefits must be valued in decisionmaking with respect to power resource choices. Methods to properlyvalue external benefits are still in a developmental stage. EPACT 1992 Implementation: The incentives providedin Sections 1212 and 1914 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (renewableenergy production incentive and renewable electricity productiontax credit) could be important stimuli to biomass power projectdevelopment, particularly for encouraging consideration of investmentsin sustainable dedicated fuel supply systems. Latitude in qualifyingfacilities for the incentives is needed to ensure transitionaltypes of projects can be undertaken (i.e., cofiring). Developing Cofiring Opportunities: Cofiring biomasswith coal represents the best near-term opportunity to increaseuse of biomass fuels among utilities and quickly bring on linebiomass-fired generation capacity. The merits of this fuel switchoption will have to be demonstrated at utility generating stationsfor several types of boilers to encourage widespread acceptance. Expanding the Resource Base: One general area ofneed and opportunity will be projects and activities that expandthe current resource base available to power producers. Nearlyall of the industry representatives for IPPs and utilities expressedthe desire to be able to use a wider base of fuel resources economically. It was very clear from the meetings that the achieved survivalof a nascent biomass power industry would depend on expandingthe availability of diverse low-cost fuel sources. Develop Repowering Opportunities: Many of the generatingunits built by IPPs were constructed when available resourceswere cheaper and purchased-power agreements were generous. Assuch, combustion efficiency was not considered a major issue atthat time. As power purchase agreements expire and new contractsare negotiated, the ability of many of these facilities to continueto be productive will be in question. Repowering projects couldimprove the efficiency and availability of some of these plantsto extend their useful life until a new generation of conversionsystems becomes commercially available. Repowering aging utility-ownedcoal- and oil-fired plants to efficiently produce power from biomassis also a potential area for project development. Develop Products for International and Modular PrepackagedGeneration Markets: For international markets in areas wherepower is frequently needed in smaller increments and biomass resourcesare plentiful, small-scale packaged biomass generators will bevery attractive. On a larger scale, several companies have targetedthe existing agricultural processing industry as potential powerproducers. To open this market, new U.S. products will have tobe demonstrated to meet performance (including cost), maintainability,and reliability claims of the manufacturers. The power generation industry remains interested in the potentialfor biomass power, but sees fewer opportunities to develop profitablegreenfield projects under current market conditions. However,the experience gained in the 1980s is providing a solid base fordeveloping successful projects in the 1990s for niche markets. Cofiring and repowering projects are expected to provide thebest opportunities for continued near-term growth in the use ofbiomass fuels. As will be reported on the following pages, the current industryfaces many hurdles and obstacles. The problems identified bythe survey team, and the potential role that the DOE Biomass PowerProgram can fill to alleviate these problems, will be outlined. However, it must be remembered that input was received from numerousorganizations representing a diverse range of opinion. As such,this report should be viewed as DOE's analysis of the collectivediscussions held with industry.WT02-B17-175IA060-000329-B017-380http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/biopower/acknowledgements.html 205.168.79.27 19970115034300 text/html 1625HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 03:43:01 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 26 Sep 1996 19:36:57 GMTContent-length: 1451 Biomass Power Industry BIOMASS POWER INDUSTRY ASSESSMENT OF KEY PLAYERS AND APPROACHES FOR DOE AND INDUSTRY INTERACTION FINAL REPORT July 1, 1993 Department of EnergyOffice of Solar Energy ConversionSolar Thermal & Biomass Power Division DOE/CH10093-257 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Department of Energy, and the Biomass Power Program in particular,would like to express its sincere appreciation to the numerousindustry representatives visited during the Biomass Power Assessmenttour.

The IPPs, utilities,and engineering and construction (E&C) firms that implementthe technology are unlikely to dedicate all of their resourcesto a single fuel or technology, although they will often committo a small group of technologies that are competitive in the powermarket. Despite the significant differences that the fuel characteristicsof biomass impose on combustion and conversion technology, boilerand gasifier manufacturers will offer products that span the fuelmarket rather than focus on a dedicated fuel capability. As aresult, biomass power will be a subset of the power industry withconstituents in each of its major segments. On the fuel side,the agricultural interests are likely to present a similar picturewith only a few growers dedicating their total resources to asingle crop. The constituents for biomass power are likely tobe organizations who see a profitable future for this generationresource and who have technology that is adaptable to the resourceor project development experience that could give them a competitiveadvantage. In some cases, individual players may make an exclusivecommitment to the biomass option, but they will probably be theexception rather than the rule. 2.2 Components of the Industry The components of the biomass power industry are depicted in Exhibit 2-1 and include: Regulated Electric Utilities Independent Power Producers (IPPs) Utility/Industrial Component Manufacturers Engineering and Construction (E&C) Contractors Agricultural Organizations Industrial Users/Producers Regulatory Organizations Feedstock/Fuel Brokers Organizations in each of the above groups are likely to play akey role in the success or failure of biomass power both domesticallyand abroad. Shown as a second tier player in the diagram arethe investment institutions/organizations that will be calledupon to finance power projects. The importance of these organizationsto the acceptance and development of biomass as a power resourceis such that they can be considered on a par with the first tierplayers in the decision making for power projects. Included inthat category of interests are the insurance firms that provideefficacy insurance for projects. Without such insurance manyprojects would be too risky for investors to underwrite. Theinterests of these groups in the technology are discussed in thesections that follow, concluding with an evaluation of the role they are likely to play in the development of the resource and implementationof improved technology in future biomass power stations in theU.S. and abroad. 2.2.1 Electric Utilities A handful of utilities have built biomass power stations. Theseare mostly smaller utilities such as municipalities, and the stationsare more often multi-fueled facilities rather than dedicated units. The utilities are important constituents of the industry becausethey represent mainstream users of the technology for bulk powerproduction at a utility scale. In addition, many utilities haveexperimented or continue to experiment with co-firing wood, municipalsolid waste, and coal. Their primary interests in the U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE) Biomass R&D program will be the improvementof the current technologies or the demonstration of the next generationof technology. Regulated utilities are required to provide customerswith safe, reliable, and economic service while earning an agreedupon return on investment. For biomass power, one of the issuesis the impact on the cost of delivery of economical power froma resource that is often not located near electric load centers. Since wheeling of power through systems at reasonably high efficienciesis an increasingly available option to generators, the concernis more one of access to transmission systems with available capacity. Utilities are more likely to support a biopower demonstrationif either can be accomplished through a relatively low capitalretrofit of existing facilities, providing efficiency and reliabilityimprovements. A major concern for such retrofits will be theeffect on current permits for the facility. A review of currentpermits triggered by a possible demonstration of new technologywould be a significant risk for the plant owners. The utilities are not a homogeneous group, and the subgroups withinthe industry have different needs and resources. The major subgroupsare: Investor Owned Utilities (IOU) Municipal Utilities Rural Electric Cooperatives Federal Power Authorities Among these groups, the most active players in biomass projectsare the municipal utilities. Few of the large investor-ownedutilities (IOUs) yet own biomass-fired facilities, but many arepower purchasers from the IPPs. This may change as the scaleof biomass power projects increases. None of the rural cooperativegenerators or the Federal Power Authorities have built biomasspower stations. The capacity growth needs of the smaller IOUs,the rural electric cooperatives, and the municipal utilities arewell suited to the size of current biomass power facilities. However, when larger plants based on dedicated fuel supply systems(DFSS) and advanced conversion cycles are ready for demonstrationat full scale, the larger IOUs are likely to be the power purchasersand/or project developers. Another possible DOE Biomass Program constituent is the coal-firedutilities for whom biomass co-firing might represent an attractiveClean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) compliance option. The TennesseeValley Authority (TVA) has inaugurated a program of assessmentand evaluation for these purposes in cooperation with DOE andthe Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). In addition, aset of utilities for which biomass co-firing appears to have meritwas identified in a recent report prepared by Scott Piscitelloand Christian Demeter of Antares for National Renewable EnergyLaboratory (NREL) entitled 'Biomass Co-firing Analysis Summary.' In summary, the utilities and their research, development, testing,and evaluation arm, EPRI, are an important constituent of theprogram. The utilities' interest in the program is likely tobe in near-term technical improvements to the technology. Theyoffer the potential for joint venture (cost-shared) retrofit demonstrations. They are also the ultimate customer for biomass power technology. Whether they build and operate their own plants or purchase powerfrom the IPPs, they will be key decision makers with regard totechnology acceptance and implementation. In some ways, theymay be considered to have less at stake than other constituentssince their investment is limited to the facilities they operate. Many of these facilities could be converted to other fuels ifeconomics and other factors indicate it would be prudent to doso. 2.2.2 Independent Power Producers A second key constituent for the biomass power industry is theIPPs. The IPPs are similar to the electric utility in that theywill serve as project developers for the industry. Also, thereare IPPs who already own and operate biomass-fired power plants. Along with cogenerators, the IPPs represent the major portionof today's biomass generation capacity. Included in this categoryare JWP Energy Products, Thermo Electron, HYDRA-CO, and Wheelabrator. The independent power project developer segmentis the most diversified in terms of the organizations involved,ranging from the specialists-companies created solely to developfor this market-to the many subsidiary companies of the utilities,E&C contractors, and equipment vendors vying for a piece ofthe market. Many of the subsidiaries operate with a large degreeof independence under the parent organization and are subjectto the same market factors and interests driving the specialistsin the industry. Under Title IV of CAAA, independently owned generating plantswith capacities of 25 MW or more will be held to the same sulfurdioxide (SO2) emission limits as electric utility plants. However,emission allowances will not be given to the IPPs (as is the casewith the utilities) and will have to be purchased on the openmarket or at emission allowance auctions. Therefore, IPPs' interestin the virtually sulfur-free biomass resource should increaseas the regulation's deadline nears (January 1, 2000). IPPs are well suited to respond to the utilities' current dispositiontowards smaller capacity additions that require modest capitaloutlays. The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA),which mandates electric utilities to buy power from independentproducers using renewable sources or cogeneration, sets an upperlimit of 80 MW on the producer's capacity. This size fits thecapacity addition range needed by many utilities. This rangealso matches the capacities of installed biomass power facilities. Thus, there often is a match between the size of plants thatwill be constructed by IPPs operating under PURPA, the capacityadditions which the utilities desire, and the size associatedwith current biomass resources. The competitive bid process beingutilized in many states for resource acquisitions is beginningto affect this market to some degree, increasing the size of manyrecent IPP projects. Scale-up of biomass technology will be moreimportant as this trend continues. Biomass can also be used to cogenerate electricity with processheat (steam). This creates opportunities for IPPs to work withindustrial participants (such as the pulp and paper industry orthe wood products industry) who can supply the biomass resourceand also offer a host for the process heat. An interesting marketfor biomass-based cogeneration may be industrial participantswho currently operate natural gas/gas turbine technology. Forexample, the Boise Cascade pulp and paper plant in Fort Francis,Ontario currently operates an 86-MW natural gas-fired combinedcycle unit. Biomass gasifiers could be installed at such locationsand coupled to the existing combustion turbines. Underlying the success of the IPP industry is the advantage ofoperating under less regulatory burden than the electric utilities. Therefore, the IPP is less constrained in their generating technologyoptions and have a greater ability to take risks and earn healthyrates of return. In contrast to regulated utilities, the IPPsare dependent upon the capital investment markets for projectfinancing. More recently, these investors are requiring greaterfinancial exposure of the developers and other participants inthe projects to ensure their interests in protecting the investment. This tends to result in a greater degree of conservatism in site,resource, and technology choices for new projects. This is exemplifiedby the current emphasis on natural gas combustion turbine projects. For the IPPs to be successful, they will need to work with utilitiesto identify locations for projects that can tap into existingtransmission and distribution capabilities and that are near areasof increasing electric power demand. 2.2.3 Utility and Industrial Power Component Manufacturers The traditional suppliers of utility power generation hardwareare large, well-financed, heavy equipment manufacturers. Nearlyall have international operations and compete in a global market. All of these companies also have product lines and services aimedat the industrial power market. In the industrial market, thereare smaller specialty companies who also serve the market. Someof these firms, such as JWP Energy Products, may dedicate theirproduct line to biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW); however,these firms are the exception. Nevertheless, the equipment vendorsare important biomass program constituents because they are themost likely participants in hardware R&D, with a stake inthe advancement of the state of the art. Both bubbling and circulating fluidized bed boilers are representativeof state-of-the-art utility boilers capable of handling a widevariety of biomass fuels. Among the larger vendors, there are sufficient resources to support,through cost-sharing, the DOE R&D program if the corporatecommitment exists. Those companies that have invested in thecoal gasification option may be inclined to make a serious commitmentto the biomass gasification alternative if they see a strong potentialmarket and view the biomass conversion option as a hedge on theirinvestment in developing coal conversion equipment. For thisreason, the companies involved in coal gasification should beviewed as potential partners in the biomass power program. Asimilar argument can be made for the manufacturers of hot gascleanup equipment. In contrast, the gas turbine manufacturers are less likely tocommit resources to develop a new turbine tailored to biomassderived fuels. Manufacturers of turbo-machinery designed forthe low-Btu gases supplied by coal will likely already have aproduct for the biomass gasification process. However, the fuelof choice for the foreseeable future is natural gas, and motivationto invest in alternative fueled turbine development is nil. 2.2.4 Engineering and Construction Contractors Often power equipment manufacturers, such as General Electric,Westinghouse, and ABB Combustion Engineering, take on the roleof E&C contractor. In other situations, companies are dedicatedto E&C and are not involved with component manufacturing (e.g.,Black & Veatch, Stone & Webster). In either circumstance,electric utilities and IPPs rely on E&C contractors for largetasks that may be beyond the responsibilities they wish to bear. For this reason, the E&C firms must be kept abreast of, andinvolved with, the Biomass Power Program. The most importantof these firms' capabilities is turnkey services, in which theyare responsible for coordination of feasibility, design, procurement,construction, start-up, and operation. Some of these firms evenassist in financing. Often the contractor can supply some orall of these individual services in addition to the coordination. Due to the similarities between biomass power technologies andmore traditional technologies (e.g., biomass IGCC/coal IGCC similarities),E&C contractors can easily make the transition to the biomasspower industry. In fact, several manufacturers, including Babcock& Wilcox and Foster Wheeler, have already provided turnkeyservices at biomass-fired facilities, generally for the pulp andpaper and sugar processing industries. 2.2.5 Industrial Users and Cogenerators The wood products industry and pulp and paper mills have usedbiomass fuels on a broad scale for process heat and self generation. PURPA brought in a new set of players building biomass-firedcogeneration systems supplying industry with process steam andelectricity, and also feeding power back to the grid as a qualifyingfacility. However, the primary objective of the mills is to disposeof the unused byproducts; heat and power generation are generallysecondary benefits. With the trend in the industry toward wasteminimization and alternative uses for unused byproducts of highervalue than fuels, the availability of these sources will tendto decrease in the future. For the cogeneration project developers,the number of attractive sites with hosts for process steam havedwindled. Currently the wood products industry is the primary supply sourcefor biomass fuels for power projects. That role is expected tocontinue throughout the 1990s. The importance of this group tothe development of biomass power is probably its knowledge oflarge scale feedstock production, transportation, processing andhandling systems, and its holdings or rights to large areas ofpotential feedstock production, which might give it a competitiveadvantage in entering the production phase of the business. Nearlyall of the major businesses involved in the wood and paper productsindustry have had power generation experience including Georgia-Pacific,Boise-Cascade, and Weyerhaeuser. 2.2.6 Biomass Fuels and Fuel Feedstocks The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has ongoing programsthat are looking at specialty crops for biomass fuel production;for example, rapid growth poplars and switch grass, and has signeda Memorandum of Understanding with DOE to pursue these programsjointly. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a current projectfocused on the development of a biomass fuels model that can projectresource availability based on plant type, soil characteristics,water availability, climate, and other characteristics. However,from a less technical viewpoint, what also needs to be investigatedis to what extent current agricultural subsidies and allowanceswill enhance or slow the transition by the agricultural sectorto biomass fuel crops. It may be appropriate to look in detailat the economics of biomass fuels production to insure the resourceavailability at a cost-competitive price. The analysis shouldconsider the environmental costs as well as the national/regionaleconomic benefit of relying on a domestically produced fuel. These economic benefits would include an increase in jobs, reductionin energy imports, and an increase in federal, state, and localtax revenues. 2.2.7 Regulatory Agencies The decisions of the regulatory agencies affect nearly all aspectsof power production and can be pivotal in the development of thebiomass power industry. A favorable view toward the environmentaland economic benefits of biomass power could lead to changes inthe competitive bidding process and integrated resource planning(IRP) being instituted in most states in the U.S. and potentiallyin foreign jurisdictions as well that might give biomass a competitiveadvantage. Equally, an unfavorable ruling on biomass environmentalimpacts could hurt biomass projects across the board-permitting,competitive bidding, cost of construction and operation, and generationefficiency. Generally, regulatory agencies will not championtechnology or resources, but they certainly have the power toinfluence resource choices by penalizing the perceived negativeimpacts of specific resource and technology choices. From thisstandpoint, DOE cannot afford to ignore the information needsand technical concerns of the regulatory bodies. In effect thismay be an important way in which the Biomass Power Program canassist industry toward near-term implementation of biomass projects. The degree of objectivity shown by DOE in presenting its laband field test findings with respect to biomass power technologywill have a profound affect on their acceptance by the regulators. A number of regulatory agencies at the national (EPA) and local(e.g. South Coast Air Quality Management District, CA) level haveR&D resources for evaluation of environmental characteristicsof new energy technologies and could be contributing partnersin the Biomass Power Program. A number of the PUCs nationwidehave been or are in the process of commissioning analytical studiesof the use of environmental adders (externalities) in the resourceselection process and other important refinements to the IRP process.WT02-B17-177IA060-000328-B013-201http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/golden/rel1096ces1.html 205.168.79.27 19970115021531 text/html 3541HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 02:15:31 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 16:51:33 GMTContent-length: 3367 News Release October 22, 1996 NEWS MEDIA CONTACT: Christopher Powers, (303) 275-4742 DOE TO CONTINUE ASSISTING COMMUNITIESON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY Following a 7-month test run, the U.S. Department of Energy will continue an initiative that helps communities marry their economic development goals with environmental health and good energy practices, Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin announced today. "We are finding that communities are intensely interested in achieving economic progress without sacrificing environmental quality," said Ervin, who heads DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. "Local officials understand that their economic and environmental health don't have to be at war any longer. We now have the experience and the Ervin launched a pilot project March 1 to help communities explore "sustainable development" -- a development strategy that strives to end conflicts between economic and environmental progress. Called the Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development, the project offers a "tool kit" of manuals, workbooks and data bases on the World Wide Web, and a small team of specialists who provide technical assistance from DOE's Denver Regional Support Office. Ervin reported monthly visits to the Web site have grown from about 3,000 in March to 76,000 in August. The Center of Excellence also has received more than 800 inquiries from communities by phone and e-mail since March 1. The technical assistance team has distributed information to hundreds of community officials and has participated in sustainable development consultations in Atlanta, Albuquerque, Baltimore, San Diego, Seattle, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Iowa, Arkansas and Florida. "Communities clearly are interested in sustainable technologies," Ervin said. "We will continue serving this need with the Center of Excellence for as long as the demand continues." According to Ervin, upcoming projects by the Center include: A national teleconference organized by Renew America in the spring to reach 150 communities with information about energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies One-day workshops in cities that have won federal Empowerment Zone grants to revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods A cooperative agreement with the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Association of Counties to help communities practice sustainable development and learn about DOE's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs Continued expansion of the information and technical assistance tools available to communities on the Center's Web site Communities can reach the Center at www.sustainable.doe.gov or 1-800-357-7732.

The U.S. Department of Energy has established the Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development, a pilot program that will help communities carry out that pledge. The center will offer information and technical advice to help communities become more energy efficient and environmentally sound. The center will provide communities a "tool kit" of workbooks, computer programs and data for guidance on sustainable development projects ranging from "green" buildings to neighborhoods that waste less energy. Communities can review case studies of successful community projects and research technical and financial programs that can provide further assistance. Experienced personnel will be on hand to consult with local officials. "By offering assistance at the local level, we hope to help communities adopt practices that range from pedestrian walkways to environmentally friendly sources of energy," said Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary. "Communities with the foresight to adopt sustainable development strategies will find they save taxpayer money, improve the profits and productivity of local businesses and make the community much more liveable." The center grew out of DOE's work with Midwest communities devastated by the 1993 floods. DOE helped the communities rebuild using sustainable development strategies, which integrate economic development and environmental quality goals. This assistance will be offered nationwide during a six-month demonstration period. Two of the towns that benefited from the DOE program after the floods, Pattonsburg, Mo. and Valmeyer, Ill., were honored yesterday by the President's Council on Sustainable Development. With federal assistance, Pattonsburg is replacing flood-devastated buildings with energy-efficient designs, building better water-quality systems, and creating a new power supply using renewable energy. Valmeyer also is embracing energy-efficient designs for buildings. The center is an outgrowth of DOE's involvement with the President's Council on Sustainable Development, created in June 1993. The Council has presented its final report to the President. DOE's Denver Regional Support Office will manage the program.

Thresher National Renewable Energy Laboratory - Golden, Colorado Susan M. Hock National Renewable Energy Laboratory - Golden, Colorado Ronald R. Loose Wind/Hydro/Ocean Technology Division - U.S. Department of Energy - Washington, DC Peter R. Goldman Wind/Hydro/Ocean Technology Division - U.S. Department of Energy - Washington, DC ABSTRACT Wind technology has been developing rapidly over the last decade. The experience gained in the wind farms of California is being used to design and develop advanced systems with improved performance, higher reliability, and lower costs. During the past several years, substantial gains have been made in wind turbine designs, lowering costs to an average of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale applications at 13 mile-per-hour (mph) average annual wind speeds. Further technology development is expected to allow the cost of wind-generated electricity to drop below $0.04 per kilowatt-hour by 2000. As a result, wind is expected to be one of the least expensive forms of new electric generation in the next century. With global efforts already underway to curb energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide, the current availability of this low-cost technology means that the use of wind systems will likely increase worldwide throughout the 1990s for both utility-scale applications and remote, small-village applications. This paper will present the technology developments for both utility-scale wind turbines and remote,small-village wind turbines that are currently available or in development. The authors describe future technology improvements and likely wind turbine configurations in 2000. Technology innovations are being adapted for remote and stand-alone power applications with smaller wind turbines. Hybrid power systems using smaller 1- to 50-kilowatt (kW) wind turbines are being developed for non-grid-connected electrical generation applications. These village power systems typically use wind energy, photovoltaics (PV), battery storage, and conventional diesel generators to supply power for remote small-village communities. In remote locations, transportation costs can make fuel-powered generating systems extremely expensive. Smaller wind turbines are also being explored for application as distributed generation sources on utility grids to supply power during periods of peak demand, avoiding costly upgrades in distribution equipment. New turbine designs now account for turbulence-induced loads, unsteady aerodynamic stall effects, and complex fatigue loads, making use of new technology developments such as advanced airfoils tailored for wind turbine applications. These new airfoils increase the energy capture and improve the operating efficiency of turbine rotors by increasing the power for a given rotor thrust, and reducing the sensitivity of the airfoils to roughness which naturally accumulates during operation. Technology has been developed which uses power electronics to allow variable rotor speed operation to improve efficiency. Aerodynamic control devices, such as ailerons and flaps, are being explored to aerodynamically modulate power or stop the rotor in high-speed conditions. These technology trends and future turbine configurations are being explored through research and development activities sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Wind Energy Program. UTILITY SCALE-SYSTEMS In the United States, utility-scale wind turbines are the primary focus of new technology development. By 1996, U.S. manufacturers will have introduced seven new turbines (with capacities ranging from 250 to 500 kW) for the utility market. Five of the turbines are being developed by members of the U.S. wind industry with direct funding support from DOE. Cannon Energy Corporation and Kenetech Windpower are each developing a utility-scale wind turbine independently. Two of the utility-scale wind turbines sponsored by DOE are commercially available: the Advanced Wind Turbines AWT-26 and Zond Systems Z-40. New World Power Technology Company, New World Grid Power, and Flowind Corporation are expected to introduce their turbine designs within the next two years. Advanced Wind Turbines AWT-26 The 275-kW AWT-26 is a downwind, stall-regulated, free-yaw machine incorporating an innovative two-bladed teetered rotor. The AWT-26 is based upon the ESI-80, a turbine developed in the United States during the mid-1980s which had many promising features, but never reached commercial maturity. The designers of the AWT-26 have taken advantage of the substantial operating history of its predecessor, retained components that were reliable, and improved the remainder. The larger 26-meter (m) rotor incorporates aerodynamically efficient, wood-composite blades using National Renewable Energy Laboratory(NREL) designed airfoils. The new blades improve the turbine's energy capture from 20% to 70%, depending on wind speed and the degree of blade soiling from dirt and insects. The AWT-26 also features a redesigned high-speed shaft brake and new aerodynamic tip vanes. The tip vanes serve two important functions on this turbine: as a fail-safe (emergency) brake and as an active brake for normal shut-down operations. Mounted on a hinge at the tip of each blade, the vanes are held closed by electromagnets. The vanes are activated by control system command, which releases the electromagnets. A redundant caliper disk brake can also stop the machine under normal or emergency conditions. The AWT-26 has been selected for a commercial 25-megawatt (MW) power plant to be installed in late 1995 in Washington state by a consortium of public utilities called CARES (Conservation and Renewable Energy Systems) as a project under the Bonneville Power Administration's Resource Supply Expansion Program (RSEP). The RSEP program was a competitive solicitation to add wind generation capacity to the Bonneville network. New World Power Technology Company North Wind 250 The 250-kW North Wind 250 is a two-bladed, teetered, upwind machine that has been scaled up from the company's North Wind 100 turbine. The new turbine features an integrated drive train, aileron controls, and an innovative rotor that is fabricated as a single unit. The "flow-through" rotor eliminates the blade root joints, which are expensive, complicated, and subject to high stress during turbine operation. The unique, flow-through, teetered-rotor design eliminates structural discontinuities at the blade/hub interface by fabricating the rotor as one continuous structural element. Fatigue tests were conducted on the full-scale rotor joint at NREL to qualify this element of the rotor for field testing and to provide information needed to improve its structural design. The hub incorporates teeter dampers and an active teeter brake. The rotor is made of a hybrid composite material. The hub saddle captures the blade center section in a wrap-around elastomeric blanket. The new rotor also substitutes aileron control for the full-span pitch control system used in the earlier North Wind model. Ailerons, which work like flaps on an airplane wing, are the most important development featured in the North Wind 250. When deflected in the downwind direction, they reduce lift and power output. When power modulation is needed, the ailerons can be deflected through small angles to either increase or decrease power. Upwind deflections increase lift, causing the power to increase. Wind tunnel tests at Wichita State University have confirmed the ability of ailerons to control power and prevent the rotor from over-speeding. Zond Systems Z-40 The 500-kW Z-40 wind turbine is being developed by Zond Systems, Inc., with support from NREL. Zond is building two versions of its prototype turbine, a three-bladed, upwind, rigid hub machine with active yaw drive. One turbine prototype employs a full-span pitch control system and sits atop a tube tower. The other turbine uses aileron controls to provide aerodynamic braking and peak power modulation and sits atop a low-cost, free-standing open truss tower. Zond plans to compare the two turbine control strategies during prototype testing. Both designs capitalize on the company's extensive experienceoperating wind power plants using similarly designed turbines. Each prototype incorporates NREL-designed airfoils and an integrated gearbox design that minimizes the number of parts and simplifies load paths. Based on blade structural and fatigue testing at NREL, design changes were made that will improve the final design of the blades. Flowind EHD Unlike the other turbines discussed in this paper, Flowind's 300-kW EHD (Extended Height/Diameter ratio) is a Darrius (eggbeater-shaped) vertical-axis wind turbine. Its three blades spin about an axis perpendicular to the ground, capturing energy from winds blowing from all directions. The drive train and generator are located under the rotor near the ground for easy maintenance and inspection. The EHD series will use tall, high-performance 17- to 21-m rotors incorporating advanced airfoils designed specifically for the series. Flowind's prototype turbine rotor, which has a height-to-diameter ratio of 2.78, is taller and thinner than the 19-m rotor on Flowind's existing vertical-axis turbines. The shape allows the larger rotor to be placed upon existing turbine bases, if desired. This design also makes it easier to bend the turbine blades into the desired shape and makes better (and more profitable) use of available sites in a wind power plant. The EHD's low-cost blades are manufactured using a new, automated pultrusion technique, in which fiber-resin blades are pulled through a die. The blades incorporate natural laminar flow airfoils developed at Sandia National Laboratories to keep air flowing smoothly over the blades and increase energy capture. The rotor should effectively double the annual energy output of Flowind's current vertical-axis turbines which use aluminum blades and are about half as tall. New World Grid Power 500-XST New World Grid Power will develop the 500-XST (eXperimental Synchronous Turbine) based on the company's experience operating European turbines of this size. The 500-kW, upwind, three-bladed 500-XST will include active yaw control, a full-span pitch control rotor and a free-standing tubular tower. One of its most innovative features is a unique integrated drive train system which uses variable-speed operation. Therefore, it can provide a unity power factor without requiring capacitors for reactive power control. REMOTE AND VILLAGE SYSTEMS Technology innovations are being adapted for remote and stand-alone power applications with smaller wind turbines. Hybrid power systems using smaller 1- to 50-kW wind turbines are being developed for non-grid connected electrical generation applications. These village power systems typically use wind energy, solar, photovoltaics (PV), battery storage, and a conventional diesel generator to supply power for remote, small-village communities. In areas without electric utility service and with good wind resources, a single wind turbine can provide electricity at lower cost than diesel generation for individual homes, schools, clinics, water pumping, or small industries. Larger "mini-grid" village power systems incorporating multiple wind turbines and other generation sources are often more economical than transmission line extension for communities in remote, but windy regions. Smaller wind turbines are also being explored for application as distributed generation sources on utility grids to supply power during periods of peak demand, avoiding costly upgrades in distribution equipment. Hybrid systems comprising wind turbines, PV, batteries, and diesel generators have been used successfully to meet direct-current electric loads in remote international telecommunications markets. These systems are now an emerging technology for generating alternating-current electric power for remote communities. Assisting the U.S. industry in developing and demonstrating hybrid systems, NREL has embarked on a program of collaborative technology development and technical assistance in the area of hybrid systems for village-power applications (Flowers et al. 1994). Atlantic Orient Corporation AOC 15/50 The 50-kW AOC 15/50 is an improved and simplified version of the Enertech 44/60 wind turbine developed in the United States in the early 1980s. The downwind, stall-regulated, three-bladed turbine features passive yaw control, wood epoxy composite blades incorporating NREL-designed airfoils, aerodynamic tip brakes, an electrodynamic brake, and an integrated drive train. Blade-fatigue testing was conducted at NREL. This turbine is well-suited for remote, stand-alone applications, village power systems, and small wind power plants. The AOC 15/50's integrated drive train eliminates many critical bolted joints found in conventional turbine designs and creates an efficient load path from the rotor to the tower top.A cast-steel, tower-top plate further improves the efficiency of the load path. The new drive train design weighs less than conventional drive trains and eliminates maintenance-prone couplings between the gearbox and the generator. Other design features include tip brakes and an optional yaw damper. The optional yaw damper, a passive hydraulic system that limits yaw rates (and gyroscopic loads), is available for turbulent wind sites. Bergey Windpower Company BWC Excel Bergey Windpower Company (BWC) turbines use passive controls, fiberglass blades, direct-drive permanent-magnet alternators, and integrated structures to provide mechanically simple turbines between 0.85 and 10 kW. The Bergey BWC Excel is a 10-kW, three-bladed, direct drive, upwind wind turbine with passive blade-pitch control. To achieve overspeed protection, the rotor yaws out of the wind. The rotor diameter is 7 m. The BWC Excel wind turbine is designed to supply most of the electricity for an average all-electric home in areas with an average wind speed of 12 mph. In remotelocations, it can charge batteries for stand-alone applications or pump water electrically without the need for batteries. More than 1400 BWC wind turbines have been installed in a total of more than 60 countries. BWC, under subcontract to NREL, is developing a 15-kW high-frequency link, full-digital-control inverter to provide high reliability at low cost for its stand-alone AC systems. In 1992, a Bergey system was installed in Xcalak, Mexico, with funding and technical support from NREL and Sandia National Laboratories in cooperation with the Instituto de Investigaciones Electricas (a Mexican utility research organization). The system includes six Bergey 10-kW wind turbines, an 11.7-kW PV array, an inverter, and a battery bank. The hybrid system is operated without use of any backup diesel generation. Integrated Power Corporation Integrated Power Corporation (IPC), a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, has installed PV/wind hybrid systems in Mexico and Indonesia. IPC, in collaboration with a Mexican utility and a rural-development organization, has installed PV/wind hybrid systems in two Mexican villages. The two systems (one with 45kWh/day capacity and the other at 125 kWh/day) were installed to meet commercial and residential loads and accommodate load growth. Anemometers were recently installed at the sites so that the system performance data can be analyzed collaboratively among IPC, NREL, and the appropriate Mexican agencies. IPC has also installed PV/wind hybrid systems in two neighboring villages on an island near Bali, Indonesia. These systems were each sized for 15-kW peak power and energy delivery of 100 kWh/day.The two systems have been operated successfully in parallel, demonstrating capability to meet load growth with modular additions to existing systems. These installations have remote monitoring and control capability through a direct link to a low earth-orbit satellite that permits uploading and downloading system status and performance data, and remote diagnostics and control. New World Power Corporation New World Power Corporation (NWPC) is using its experience in wind, solar, and hybrid power systems, primarily in remote telecommunications and small, isolated power applications, to develop the balance-of-system components required to reliably integrate renewables into remote mini-grids. NWPC is in its second year of a 5-year program to develop and commercialize renewable-based, packaged hybrid-power systems with peak power capacities of 50 and 100 kW. They are using a novel rotary converter which eliminates the need for electronic inverters in large sizes. NWPC has installed its system in southern California for Southern California Edison Company. Additional systems are currently being installed in Alaska, Argentina, and Brazil. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS The DOE Wind Energy Program is supporting a robust applied research program through NREL's National Wind Technology Center. These applied research activities also involve Sandia National Laboratories, universities, and industry subcontractors. The highlights from these technology development and research activities are covered in the following paragraphs. Airfoils The development of special-purpose airfoils for horizontal-axis wind turbines began in 1984 as a joint effort between NREL, formerly the Solar Energy Research Laboratory, and Airfoils, Incorporated. Prior to that time, turbine blade designers used airfoils developed for aircraft wings. Since 1984, seven airfoil families have been developed. NREL airfoil families are used on replacement blades and wind turbines developed by Atlantic Orient Corporation, Advanced Wind Turbines, and Zond Systems. Annual energy improvements from the NREL airfoil families are projected to be 23% to 30% for stall-regulated turbines, 8% to 20% for variable-pitch turbines, and 8% to 10% for variable-speed turbines (Tangler 1994). The energy improvement for stall-regulated turbines has been verified in field tests. Structural Testing NREL's structural test facility, in operation since 1990, provides blade designers with information useful in blade development. Wind turbine blade designs have complex geometries which make blade design difficult. As well, wind turbine blades comprise composites which have superior structural properties but require sophisticated analysis methods. In addition, the manufacturing methods allow more variability than with metals, and require careful quality control. Structural testing is therefore useful to help designers validate design assumptions, and make corrections, if necessary, in the prototype phase rather than discovering design problems after installation. The structural test facility is used primarily for structural testing of full-scale wind turbine blades for NREL's subcontractors and wind industry partners. Testing that has recently been performed includes fatigue testing, ultimate strength static testing, and several non-destructive techniques such as photoelastic stress analysis. Fatigue tests use a closed-loop servo-hydraulic system to apply cyclic loads to blades up to 20-m long. Under repeated loading, fatigue failures help wind turbine blade designers evaluate design assumptions, manufacturing techniques, and complex failure modes under normal and extreme operating loads. Blades tested at the structural test facility include the Kenetech Windpower 56/100 and 33-M/VS, the AOC 15/50, the New World North Wind 250 (Musial et al. 1994), and the Zond Z-40. Power electronics New technology has been developed which uses power electronics to allow variable-rotor-speed operation to improve efficiency, control structural loads, and improve power quality. Today variable-speed operation is estimated to increase energy capture by up to 15%, which is about the same level as the cost increase (Lucas et al. 1989). However, it is thought that variable-rotor-speed operation can reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity by reducing structural loads (allowing a lightweight, low-cost configuration), and improving power quality. Aerodynamic control devices Aerodynamic control devices provide two benefits: they are used for overspeed control and power modulation. Significant damage to the turbine can occur as a result of high wind or loss of generator load unless control of the rotor is maintained. In addition, natural wind-speed variations, insect-impact accumulations, or minor blade damage can result in off-optimum rotor rotation speeds and less-than-desired power output. Incorporated into turbine blades, aerodynamic control devices (also called trailing-edge control devices) can adjust the rotor aerodynamic driving forces and thus optimize energy capture, control loads, and control rotor speed. These aerodynamic controls are often compared to the ailerons used on aircraft. Various trailing-edge control devices have been incorporated in wind turbines that are in development or commercially available. NREL isworking with subcontractors and wind industry representatives to further study improved trailing-edge control devices. These trailing-edge control devices are thought to offer some cost and control advantages over pitch control and tip controls which are typically used on existing designs, although these advantages are yet to be proven. National Wind Technology Center Hybrid Power Test Facility A wind hybrid test facility is planned for NREL's National Wind Technology Center that will allow researchers to study hybrid power systems, developed by the U. S. industry, that combine wind turbines, photovoltaic arrays, backup generators, and storage systems (Thresher et al. 1994). The key function for the hybrid test facility will be to test small wind and hybrid power systems that are nearly market ready and provide a system development user's facility for U.S. industry. Hybrid System Modeling NREL is currently developing computer simulation codes to allow modeling of the full range of hybrid power technologies being considered for village power in the 1990s. Building on existing wind/diesel models, a new advanced hybrid systems simulation model is being developed which will accommodate a wider array of technologies and system architectures now being considered for hybrid village power systems. Renewable-Hybrid Configurations In 1994, DOE initiated a 5-year, cost-shared research collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate a range of wind/diesel system configurations. The goal of this collaboration is to develop systems powered entirely from renewable sources (e.g., wind power, solar power, and use of vegetable oils in place of diesel fuel) that would be reliable and cost competitive. The experimental study will focus on performance and stability for various system configurations and will identify necessary controls. This research will be performed in a wind/diesel test facility at the U.S. Department of Agriculture research laboratory at Bushland, Texas. Future Technological Improvements The advancement of wind turbine technology is leading to next-generation wind turbines which promise significant improvements in performance, reliability, and cost. In general, each of these competing turbine designs will probably incorporate many of the following advanced features. Advanced airfoils. For 2000, structurally tailored blades made of soft, flexible materials may be possible. Such blades would change shape in response to wind conditions, increasing energy capture and reducing loads as wind speed controls blade shape. Aerodynamic controls. Ailerons, spoiler flaps, and double-split-flaps (deployed from both sides of a blade's trailing edge) are being examined for future use as effective rotor-speed brakes. Advanced generators. Using low-speed, direct-drive generators could eliminate the need for the gearbox, thereby reducing turbine weight and costs. This generator is likely to be used in combination with variable-speed operation to take advantage of the benefits of power electronics. Advanced control systems. Advanced, expert control systems capable of controlling a single wind turbine, an array of turbines, or an entire power plant should be commonplace in the future. Smart systems can detect wind-speed changes and adjust individual turbines throughout a power plant. Advanced Wind Turbine Configurations Two likely configurations for advanced HAWT designs were first suggested in a configuration study by Swift, Hock, and Thresher (1992). The first configuration represents a low-risk design path incorporating the more conventional three-bladed rotor. Innovations include a larger rotor diameter using advanced airfoils and trailing-edge flaps for overspeed control. This design is rated at 800 kW, which is twice the size of current machines. The second machine incorporates higher-risk design options, including a 50-m-diameter, two-bladed, teetered downwind rotor. The stall-controlled rotor also has actively controlled ailerons for power clipping in response to gusts. The use of a variable-speed generator will allow increased energy capture over a broad range of wind speeds. While this design philosophy is perceived as high risk because of its innovations, it offers high potential for reduced weight and therefore cost. Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) Configuration For 2000, the hypothesized VAWT will almost certainly retain one aspect of its current strength: simplicity. The key to future success with this configuration, however, will be cost-effective manufacturing techniques (primarily for blade production) that will produce significantly less expensive blades, based on cost per unit length (Dodd 1990). VAWT blades are not geometrically complex (e.g., no twist or taper), thus making manufacturing processes such as extrusion and pultrusion viable candidates to reduce costs. In addition, the inherent advantage of the VAWT configuration, having all drive train and generator parts at ground level, creates opportunities for using components with high weight or large physical size. Of recent interest in this regard is the direct- or linear-drive generator, which eliminates the need for a gearbox and provides the advantages of variable-speed operation at a very competitive price. SUMMARY Significant progress has been made in wind energy technology over the last decade. Today's advanced systems offer improved performance, higher reliability, and lower costs. Turbine designs now make use of new technical developments such as advanced airfoils, information from structural blade testing, variable rotor speed operation, and aerodynamic controls. These developments have been incorporated into wind turbines that are, or will soon be, commercially available at a cost of energy at, or below $0.05/kWh. Further cost reductions are expected as the technology evolves and moves toward larger scales, and mass production. Technology innovations are being adapted for remote and stand-alone power applications with smaller wind turbines. Village power systems using wind energy, photovoltaics, battery storage, and a conventional diesel generator are successfully providing power in remote locations. These systems can compete economically due to the high cost of either utility grid extension or the cost of delivered fuel and maintenance for a diesel unit alone. REFERENCES Dodd, H. M.; (1990).

The spreadsheet allows input ofutility data (energy and water cost and consumption data for themost recent twelve months) and facility data (the number and kindof water consuming/moving devices and their water consumptionand/or flow rates). It then calculates annual direct water, directenergy, and indirect energy savings, as well as total cost andpayback periods for a number of conservation methods, including: 1.6 gal/flush toilets and water conserving urinals; Automatic faucets; Faucet aerators; Low flow showerheads; Efficient dishwashers; Efficient washing machines; Boiler blowdown optimization; and Landscape irrigation optimization. Most of the assumptions that WATERGY uses for energy/water calculationscan be grouped into the following categories: the heating values of fuels; the efficiencies of energy and water consuming devicesor processes (e.g., number of kilowatt hours consumed per gallonfor electric hot water heaters, or number of kilowatt hours consumedper 1,000 gallons of treated waste water); time-of-use for fixtures (e.g., number of minutes peruse of infra-red sensor faucets); and percentage of hot wateruse in machines or fixtures (e.g., percentage of water usage thatis hot water for a typical faucet). WATERGY also makes simple assumptions about capital and laborcosts of equipment and fixture replacements. All assumptionsWATERGY applies can be modified by the user.

This project will provide a near-term demonstration integrating gasification and hot-gas cleanup (HGCU) components with gas turbines for power generation. The project is a 50/50 cost-shared effort that will significantly buy-down the perceived private sector risk associated with the deployment of biomass gasification power systems, while producing power at cost-competitive rates. The objective of the Hawaii project is to scale-up the pilot 10-ton/day Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) Renugas® pressurized air/oxygen gasifier to an engineering development unit that can handle 50 to 100 tons/day of bagasse (sugar cane residue) and wood as fuel. FY 1996 Products Fabrication of the integrated gasifier and turbine assembly will be completed in FY 1996. The integrated turbine system should be operational in the third quarter of 1997. Payoffs Demonstration of this U.S. technology will provide significant market opportunities for advanced-cycle, high-efficiency biomass power generation systems, with applications in both domestic and international markets. Since this demonstration is at an existing sugar mill, it will also provide access to the international sugar mill refurbishment market. Verification of the performance of the gasifier, gas turbines and HGCU systems will facilitate the expansion of markets for these component-based units. This project also leverages investments made by DOE's Fossil Energy (FE) Program through their coal gasification research and development activities. Westinghouse's involvement with the biomass gasification/HGCU work allows them to build upon their extensive experience gained through FE's coal gasification program. Status The scale-up will be completed in several phases. Phase 1, which is now under way, consists of the design, construction, and preliminary operation of the gasifier to generate hot, unprocessed gas which will be flared. The gasifier is being designed to operate with either air oxygen at pressures up to 300 psia, at typical operating temperatures of 850° to 900°C. In Phase 2, during 1995, the gasifier will be operated at a feed rate of 50 tons/day at a maximum pressure of 150 psia, and a slip-stream HGCU unit will be installed to provide a long-term evaluation of its performance. At the same time, the necessary design and environmental permitting will be completed for the succeeding full-scale HGCU and gas turbine operation. The turbine may utilize some supplementary fuel to obtain an output that would permit commercial operation after the demonstration period is completed. Following the end of Phase 1 in mid-1996, a full-scale HGCU unit and gas turbine will be added to the system to generate 3-5 MW of electricity. In this phase (Phase 2), the gasifier feed rate will be 100 tons/day; and the system will operate at pressures up to 300 psia. In Phase 3, the system will be operated in an oxygen-blown mode to produce a clean syngas for methanol synthesis, in addition to producing electricity. Partners Participants in the project are Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Orlando, FL; IGT in Chicago, IL; the Pacific International center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) in Maui, HI; the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) in Maui, HI; the Hawaii Commercial and Sugar Company (HC&S) in Maui, HI; and the Ralph M. Parsons Company, the architectural and engineering firm for the project, which is also in Maui, HI. The gasifier is installed at the HC&S sugar mill at Paia, Maui, Hawaii. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NRL) is providing project oversight in addition to systems analysis. Cost Share Industry and the State of Hawaii have contributed $4.2 million to the first phase, with DOE contributing $6.0 million. In the second phase, negotiations are underway for both the State of Hawaii and industry to cost share approximately 50/50 with DOE. Related Programs The Biomass Gasifier Facility is an integral part of the overall Biomass Power Program strategy, which is managed under DOE's Office of Utility Technologies. The core Biomass Power Program mainly operates in the technology validation and assessment area and support the initial development and deployment of the HGCU tecnology through a contract with Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Westinghouse is the prime contractor on the above contract with IGT, Gilbert Commonwealth, and PICHTR as lower-tier contractors. The current program encompasses the design, construction, and evaluation of high-temperature ceramic filter technology for the cleanup of hot-gas streams from biomass gasification prior to its use in gas turbines. The Biofuels Systems Program, under DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies, is developing liquid fuels from biomass with a strong emphasis on the use of biotechnology to produce ethanol from lignocellulosics. As such, the technology development and validation to be accomplished under this program directly benefits the Biofuels Program as well. Vulnerabilities and Issues The major vulnerability is international competition, since advanced biomass power technology offers a substantial worldwide market potential (it could increase, by a factor of 5, the electric power output of sugar industries and pulp and paper facilities worldwide). Currently, there are several commercialization activities underway in North America, Brazil, and Scandinavia. Two prominent international development (the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility Gasifier Project in Brazil, and the Varnarmo Bioflo project in Sweden) indicate that European biomass gasification technologies are also close to commercial demonstration, which could provide direct international competition for this developing market. It is cricial that U.S. technologies not lose out to foreign competition in this vast area of market opportunity. As such, further development, demonstration and deployment of this technology could be jeopardized should DOE funding for these Biomass Power projects be reduced.

In addition,ten partners have agreed to establish Centers and are currentlymaking arrangements to set them up. These Resource Center hostsare knowledgeable of the Federal facilities located within theirregion and are capable of assisting Federal customers in takingadvantage of appropriate energy efficiency and utility programs,rate offerings, and services. They are also knowledgeable aboutlegislative and other requirements affecting Federal customersand are aware of other agency-sponsored programs and resourcesin addition to FEMP's. Since there are no restrictions onthe types of organizations that can participate, future ResourceCenter partners may include State energy offices, energy servicecompanies, and other Federal agencies. By leveraging the partners'resources to help make FEMP's own resources more accessible,FEMP's ability to assist Federal agencies achieve their mandatedenergy efficiency and water conservation goals is greatly enhanced. In addition, training courses in facility energy management developedby FEMP have found enthusiastic new audiences when conducted atResource Centers using their staff support. FEMP is continuing to identify qualified partners willing to establishnew Resource Centers. However, these facilities need to be visitedby Federal energy managers if they are to provide their valuableservices as intended. Federal energy managers and their staffare strongly encouraged to take advantage of this valuable opportunitymade possible by FEMP and its partners by stopping in to visitone of these centers. All it takes is a phone call to the nearestCenter to test the most recent versions of FEMP software tools,obtain training information, identify cost-saving arrangements,and pick up technical information that provides the latest ideasfor using energy and water more efficiently.

The signing ceremony formallysealing this partnership took place on September 4, 1996 at theGeneral Services Administration's Energy and EnvironmentalManagement (TEEM 96) Conference in Monterey. The Departmentof Energy's Federal Energy Management Program is the leadfor DOE and will facilitate this partnership between: Monterey Peninsula Water Management District; The United States Army; The City of Monterey; The United States Navy; The United States Coast Guard; and California Department of Water Resources. This unique partnership for the Monterey peninsula will facilitateFederal sector implementation of cost-effective water conservationprojects and help the Monterey peninsula area meet the water conservationgoals set by the California State Water Resources Control Board. Order WR 95-10 of July 1995 directed the Monterey Peninsula'smajor water supplier, California American Water Company, to reduceits use of Carmel Valley water resources by 20 percent in 1997and each subsequent year. The Federal partner agencies have already been involved in manywater conservation projects. Current water conservation activitiesinclude the installation of nearly 300 ultra-low flush toiletsat Navy facilities, with another 200 installations obligated forfiscal year 1997. The Navy also provides low-flow showerheadsfor its housing facilities and is currently launching the useof a water conservation kit, which includes sink aerators forthe kitchen and bath. The Navy plans to distribute 2,500 of thesekits. The Presidio of Monterey has retrofitted four large barrackswith water-restricting devices, installed low-flow plumbing fixturesin one of its eight academic buildings, and uses xeriscaping techniquesto limit water use in landscaping. This partnership will enable the participating facilities to expandthese activities and work towards further conservation of wateron the Monterey peninsula. The initial focus will be on installinglow-flow plumbing fixtures while the partnership explores otherwater conserving options. Based on estimates of savings fromexpanding installations of ultra-low flush toilets alone, theMonterey Peninsula Water Management District could save between100 and 130 acre-feet per year. This represents a 15 to 20 percentwater use reduction for these facilities. As part of the agreement, the parties will also collaborate todevelop information, educational materials, and technology transferpapers describing the technologies and practices at each siteto promote these models for other Federal agencies engaging inwater conservation activities. The Federal Energy Management Programis currently examining the potential to use performance contractingauthority in a first-of-its-kind ESPC to finance water conservationactivities on the penisula.

Although the publica-tiondoes not provide information on building and installing your ownsystem, it should help you discuss solar water heating systemsintelligently with a solar equipment dealer. Solar water heaters, sometimes called solar domestic hot watersystems, may be a good investment for you and your family. Solarwater heaters are cost competitive in many applications whenyou account for the total energy costs over the life of the system.Although the initial cost of solar water heaters is higher thanthat of conventional water heaters, the fuel (sunshine) is free.Plus, they are environmentally friendly. To take advantage ofthese heaters, you must have an unshaded, south-facing location(a roof, for example) on your property. These systems use the sun to heat either water or a heat-transferfluid, such as a water-glycol antifreeze mixture, in collectorsgenerally mounted on a roof. The heated water is then stored ina tank similar to a conventional gas or electric water tank. Somesystems use an electric pump to circulate the fluid through thecollectors. Solar Water Heating Solar water heaters can operate in any climate. Performance variesdepending, in part, on how much solar energy is available atthe site, but also on how cold the water coming into the systemis. The colder the water, the more efficiently the system operates.In almost all climates, you will need a conventional backup system.In fact, many building codes require you to have a conventionalwater heater as the backup. First Things First Before investing in any solar energy system, it is more costeffective to invest in making your home more energy efficient.Taking steps to use less hot water and to lower the temperatureof the hot water you use reduces the size and cost of your solarwater heater. Good first steps are installing low-flow showerheads or flow restrictorsin shower heads and faucets, insulating your current water heater,and insulating any hot water pipes that pass through unheatedareas. If you have no dishwasher, or your dishwasher is equippedwith its own automatic water heater, lower the thermostat onyour water heater to 120¡F (49¡C). For more informationon ways to use less energy for water heating, contact The EnergyEfficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (ERECÑseeSource List at the end of this publication). You'll also want to make sure your site has enough available sunshineto meet your needs efficiently and economically. Your local solarequipment dealer can perform a solar site analysis for you orshow you how to do your own. You can also contact EREC for moreinformation. Remember: Local zoning laws or covenants may restrict where youcan place your collectors. Check with your city, county, and homeownersassociation to find out about any restrictions. Solar Water Heater Basics Solar water heaters are made up of collectors, storage tanks,and, depending on the system, electric pumps. There are basically three types of collectors: flatplate, evacuated-tube,and concentrating. A flatplate collector, themost common type, is an insulated, weather-proofed box containinga dark absorber plate under one or more transparent or translucentcovers. Evacuated-tube collectors are made up of rows of parallel,transparent glass tubes. Each tube consists of a glass outer tubeand an inner tube, or absorber, covered with a selective coatingthat absorbs solar energy well but inhibits radiative heat loss.The air is withdrawn (ÒevacuatedÓ) from the spacebetween the tubes to form a vacuum, which eliminates conductiveand convective heat loss. Concentrating collectors for residential applications areusually parabolic troughs that use mirrored surfaces to concentratethe sun's energy on an absorber tube (called a receiver) containinga heat-transfer fluid. For more information on solar collectors,contact EREC. Most commercially available solar water heaters require a well-insulatedstorage tank. Many systems use converted electric water heatertanks or plumb the solar storage tank in series with the conventionalwater heater. In this arrangement, the solar water heater preheatswater before it enters the conventional water heater. Some solar water heaters use pumps to recirculate warm water fromstorage tanks through collectors and exposed piping. This is generallyto protect the pipes from freezing when outside temperatures dropto freezing or below. Types of Solar Water Heaters Solar water heaters can be either active or passive. An activesystem uses an electric pump to circulate the heat-transfer fluid;a passive system has no pump. The amount of hot water a solarwater heater produces depends on the type and size of the system,the amount of sun available at the site, proper installation,and the tilt angle and orientation of the collectors. Solar water heaters are also characterized as open loop (alsocalled "direct") or closed loop (also called "indirect").An open-loop system circulates household (potable) water throughthe collector. A closed-loop system uses a heat-transfer fluid(water or diluted antifreeze, for example) to collect heat anda heat exchanger to transfer the heat to household water. Active Systems Active systems use electric pumps, valves, and controllers tocirculate water or other heat-transfer fluids through the collectors.They are usually more expensive than passive systems but arealso more efficient. Active systems are usually easier to retrofitthan passive systems because their storage tanks do not needto be installed above or close to the collectors. But becausethey use electricity, they will not function in a power outage.Active systems range in price from about $2,000 to $4,000 installed. Open-Loop Active Systems Open-loop active systems use pumps to circulate household waterthrough the collectors. This design is efficient and lowers operatingcosts but is not appropriate if your water is hard or acidic becausescale and corrosion quickly disable the system. These open-loop systems are popular in nonfreezing climates suchas Hawaii. They should never be installed in climates that experiencefreezing temperatures for sustained periods. You can installthem in mild but occasionally freezing climates, but you mustconsider freeze protection. Recirculation systems are a specific type of open-loop systemthat provide freeze protection. They use the system pump to circulatewarm water from storage tanks through collectors and exposed pipingwhen temperatures approach freezing. Consider recirculation systemsonly where mild freezes occur once or twice a year at most. Activatingthe freeze protection more frequently wastes electricity and storedheat. Of course, when the power is out, the pump will not work and thesystem will freeze. To guard against this, a freeze valve canbe installed to provide additional protection in the event thepump doesnÕt operate. In freezing weather, the valve dribbleswarmer water through the collector to prevent freezing. Considerrecirculation systems only where mild freezes occur onceor twice a year at most. Activating the freeze protection morefrequently wastes electricity and stored heat. Of course, when the power is out, the pump will not work and thesystem will freeze. To guard against this, a freeze valve canbe installed to provide additional protection in the event thepump doesn't operate. In freezing weather, the valve dribbleswarmer water through the collector to prevent freezing. Closed-Loop Active Systems These systems pump heat-transfer fluids (usually a glycol-waterantifreeze mixture) through collectors. Heat exchangers transferthe heat from the fluid to the household water stored in thetanks. Double-walled heat exchangers prevent contamination of householdwater. Some codes require double walls when the heat-transferfluid is anything other than household water. Closed-loop glycol systems are popular in areas subject to extendedfreezing temperatures because they offer good freeze protection.However, glycol antifreeze systems are a bit more expensive tobuy and install, and the glycol must be checked each year andchanged every 3 to 10 years, depending on glycol quality and systemtemperatures. Drainback systems use water as the heat-transfer fluid in thecollector loop. A pump circulates the water through the collectors.The water drains by gravity to the storage tank and heat exchanger;there are no valves to fail. When the pumps are off,the collectorsare empty, which assures freeze protection and also allows thesystem to turn off if the water in the storage tank becomes toohot. Pumps in Active Systems The pumps in solar water heaters have low power requirements,and some companies now include direct current (DC) pumps poweredby small solar-electric (photovoltaic, or PV) panels. PV panelsconvert sunlight into DC electricity. Such systems cost nothingto operate and continue to function during power outages. Passive Systems Passive systems move household water or a heat-transfer fluidthrough the system without pumps. Passive systems have no electriccomponents to break. This makes them generally more reliable,easier to maintain, and possibly longer lasting than active systems. Passive systems can be less expensive than active systems, butthey can also be less efficient. Installed costs for passive systemsrange from about $1,000 to $3,000, depending on whether it isa simple batch heater or a sophisticated thermosiphon system. Batch Heaters Batch heaters (also known as "bread box" or integralcollector storage systems) are simple passive systems consistingof one or more storage tanks placed in an insulated box thathas a glazed side facing the sun. Batch heaters are inexpensiveand have few componentsÑin other words, less maintenanceand fewer failures. A batch heater is mounted on the ground oron the roof (make sure your roof structure is strong enough tosupport it). Some batch heaters use ÒselectiveÓsurfaces on the tank(s). These surfaces absorb sun well but inhibitradiative loss. In climates where freezing occurs, batch heaters must either beprotected from freezing or drained for the winter. In well-designedsystems, the most vulnerable components for freezing are the pipes,if located in uninsulated areas, that lead to the solar waterheater. If these pipes are well insulated, the warmth from thetank will prevent freezing. Certified systems clearly state thetemperature level that can cause damage. In addition, you caninstall heat tape (electrical plug-in tape to wrap around thepipes to keep them from freezing), insulate exposed pipes, orboth. Remember, heat tape requires electricity, so the combinationof freezing weather and a power outage can lead to burst pipes.If you live in an area where freezing is infrequent, you can useplastic pipe that does not crack or burst when it freezes. Keepin mind, though, that some of these pipes canÕt withstandunlimited freeze/thaw cycles before they crack. Thermosiphon Systems A thermosiphon system relies on warm water rising, a phenomenonknown as natural convection, to circulate water through the collectorsand to the tank. In this type of installation, the tank must beabove the collector. As water in the collector heats, it becomeslighter and rises naturally into the tank above. Meanwhile, coolerwater in the tank flows down pipes to the bottom of the collector,causing circulation throughout the system. The storage tank isattached to the top of the collector so that thermosiphoning canoccur. These systems are reliable and relatively inexpensive butrequire careful planning in new construction because the watertanks are heavy. They can be freeze-proofed by circulating anantifreeze solution through a heat exchanger in a closed loopto heat the household water. Sizing Your System Just as you have to choose a 30-, 40-, or 50-gallon (114-, 151-,or 189-liter) conventional water heater, you need to determinethe right size solar water heater to install. Sizing a solar waterheater involves determining the total collector area and thestorage volume required to provide 100% of your householdÕshot water during the summer. Solar-equipment experts use worksheetsor special computer programs to assist you in determining howlarge a system you need. Solar storage tanks are usually 50-, 60-, 80-, or 120-gallon (189-,227-, 303-, or 454-liter) capacity. A small (50 to 60 gallon)system is sufficient for 1 to 3 people, a medium (80-gallon) systemis adequate for a 3- or 4-person household, and a large (120-gallon)system is appropriate for 4 to 6 people. A rule of thumb for sizing collectors: allow about 20 square feet(about 2 square meters) of collector area for each of the firsttwo family members and 8 square feet (0.7 square meter) for eachadditional family member if you live in the Sun Belt. Allow 12to 14 additional square feet (1.1 to 1.3 square meters) per personif you live in the northern United States. A ratio of at least 1.5 gallons (5.7 liters) of storage capacityto 1 square foot (0.1 square meter) of collector area preventsthe system from overheating when the demand for hot water is low.In very warm, sunny climates, experts suggest that the ratio shouldbe at least 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of storage to 1 square foot(0.1 square meter) of collector area. For example, a family offour in a northern climate would need between 64 and 68 squarefeet (5.9 and 6.3 square meters) of collector area and a 96- to102-gallon (363- to 386-liter) storage tank. (This assumes 20square feet of collector area for the first person, 20 for thesecond person, 12 to 14 for the third person, and 12 to 14 forthe fourth person. This equals 64 to 68 square feet, multipliedby 1.5 gallons of storage capacity, which equals 96 to 102 gallonsof storage.) Because you might not be able to find a 96-gallontank, you may want to get a 120-gallon tank to be sure to meetyour hot water needs. Benefits of Solar Water Heaters There are many benefits to owning a solar water heater, and numberone is economics. Solar water heater economics compare quitefavorably with those of electric water heaters, while the economicsarenÕt quite so attractive when compared with those ofgas water heaters. Heating water with the sun also means long-termbenefits, such as being cushioned from future fuel shortagesand price increases, and environmental benefits. Economic Benefits Many home builders choose electric water heaters because theyare easy to install and relatively inexpensive to purchase. However,research shows that an average household with an electric waterheater spends about 25% of its home energy costs on heating water. It makes economic sense to think beyond the initial purchase priceand consider lifetime energy costs, or how much you will spendon energy to use the appliance over its lifetime. The FloridaSolar Energy Center (FSECÑsee Source List) studied thepotential savings to Florida homeowners of common water-heatingsystems compared with electric water heaters. It found that solarwater heaters offered the largest potential savings, with solarwater-heater owners saving as much as 50% to 85% annually on theirutility bills over the cost of electric water heating. The FSEC analysis illustrates that the initial installed costof the solar water heater ($1,500 to $3,000) is higher than thatof a gas water heater ($350 to $450) or an electric water heater($150 to $350). The costs vary from region to region, so checklocally for costs in your area. Depending on the price of fuelsources, the solar water heater can be more economical over thelifetime of the system than heating water with electricity, fueloil, propane, or even natural gas because the fuel (sunshine)is free. However, at the current low prices of natural gas, solar waterheaters cannot compete with natural gas water heaters in mostparts of the country except in new home construction. Althoughyou will still save energy costs with a solar water heater becauseyou wonÕt be buying natural gas, it wonÕt be economicalon a dollar-for-dollar basis. Paybacks vary widely, but you can expect a simple payback of 4to 8 years on a well-designed and properly installed solar waterheater. (Simple payback is the length of time required to recoveryour investment through reduced or avoided energy costs.) Youcan expect shorter paybacks in areas with higher energy costs.After the payback period, you accrue the savings over the lifeof the system, which ranges from 15 to 40 years, depending onthe system and how well it is maintained. You can determine the simple payback of a solar water heater byfirst determining the net cost of the system. Net costs includethe total installed cost less any tax incentives or utility rebates.(See the box for more information.) After you calculate the netcost of the system, calculate the annual fuel savings and dividethe net investment by this number to determine the simple payback. An example: Your total utility bill averages $160 per month andyour water heating costs are average (25% of your total utilitycosts) at $40 per month. If you purchase a solar water heaterfor $2,000 that provides an average of 60% of your hot water eachyear, that system will save you $24 per month ($40 x 0.60 = $24)or $288 per year (12 x $24 = $288). This system has a simple paybackof less than 7 years ($2,000 Ö $288 = 6.9). For the remainderof the life of the solar water heater, 60% of your hot water willbe free, saving you $288 each year. You will need to account forsome operation and maintenance costs, which are estimated at $25to $30 a year. This is primarily to have the system checked every3 years. If you are building a new home or refinancing your present hometo do a major renovation, the economics are even more attractive.The cost of including the price of a solar water heater in a new30-year mortgage is usually between $13 and $20 per month. Theportion of the federal income tax deduction for mortgage interestattributable to the solar system reduces that amount by about$3 to $5 per month. If your fuel savings are more than $15 permonth, the investment in the solar water heater is profitableimmediately. Tax Incentives and Rebates Some local or state governments offer tax incentives to encourageresidents to invest in solar energy technologies. Check withyour state or local energy office or Department of Revenue forinformation. Some electric utilities offer rebates to customerswho install solar energy equipment because these installationshelp utilities reduce peak loads. Peak loads are periods whenthe utility must generate extra power to meet a high demand. Heatingwater in the evening is one example. Long-Term Benefits Solar water heaters offer long-term benefits that go beyond simpleeconomics. In addition to having free hot water after the systemhas paid for itself in reduced utility bills, you and your familywill be cushioned from future fuel shortages and price increases.You will also be doing your part to reduce this country's dependenceon foreign oil. The National Remodelers Association reports thatadding a solar water heater to an existing home raises the resalevalue of the home by the entire cost of the system. You may beable to recoup your entire investment when you sell your home. Environmental Benefits Solar water heaters do not pollute. By investing in one, you willbe avoiding carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide,and the other air pollution and wastes created when your utilitygenerates power or you burn fuel to heat your household water.When a solar water heater replaces an electric water heater, theelectricity displaced over 20 years represents more than 50 tonsof avoided carbon dioxide emissions alone. Carbon dioxide trapsheat in the upper atmosphere, thus contributing to the Ògreenhouseeffect.Ó Be a Smart Consumer Take the same care in choosing a solar water heater that you wouldin the purchase of any major appliance. Your best protectionis to consider only certified and labeled systems. One such labelis put on by the Solar Rating & Certification Corporation(SRCC), a nonprofit, independent third-party organization formedby the solar industry, state energy officials, and consumer advocatesto certify and rate solar water heaters. A national standard (OG-300) addresses a variety of concerns,including safety and health, durability and reliability, installation,performance, and operation and maintenance. To meet this standard,a system is rigorously tested. A certified solar water heatercarries the SRCC OG-300 label, and the system performance is listedin a published directory. A similar program has been establishedfor Florida by FSEC. Both SRCC and FSEC provide collector testingand rating programs. Find out if the manufacturer offers a warranty, and, if so, whatthe warranty covers and for how long. If the dealer you are buyingthe equipment from goes out of business, can you get support andparts from the manufacturer, or from a local plumbing contractor? Make sure that the workers who are actually installing the systemare qualified to do the work. Ask the installation contractorfor references and check them. When the job is finished, havethe contractor walk you through the system so you are familiarwith the installation. And be sure that an ownerÕs manualwith maintenance instructions is included as part of the package. A Bright Future A solar water heater is a long-term investment that will saveyou money and energy for many years. Like other renewable energysystems, solar water heaters minimize the environmental effectsof enjoying a comfortable, modern lifestyle. In addition, theyprovide insurance against energy price increases, help reduceour dependence on foreign oil, and are investments in everyoneÕsfuture. You might also consider other solar energy systems for your home.Systems similar to the solar water heater are used for space heatingand swimming pool heating.

This version, designated as BLCC4.4-97, has been updated with both the DOE and OMB discount ratesfor FY 1997, and includes projected energy price escalation ratesfrom the DOE/EIA Annual Energy Outlook 1996. BLCC provides comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis capabilitiesfor capital investment projects that are intended primarily toreduce operating-related expenditures (especially energy and watercosts) in future years. Mutually-exclusive project alternatives(e.g., HVAC systems or insulation levels) can be compared to determinewhich has the lowest life-cycle cost. Savings-to-investment ratioand other comparative measures of economic performance can alsobe calculated, as well as projected energy savings and reductionsin green-house gas emissions. A number of changes have been made to BLCC 4.4-97 compared tolast year's version. These changes are described in thesoftware's supporting documentation. One change is to highlightthe importance of using local utility rate information when itcan be obtained with a high level of confidence. When it is notavailable, the energy price escalation rates are available forproject cost estimating. Another change involves improvementsin the ability to interface more closely with the NIST ERATESprogram. ERATES allows users to set up block-rate, time-of-use-rate,and demand-rate schedules for local electricity prices and project-specificelectricity usage files for use in calculating annual electricitycosts. There have also been a number of changes in the militaryconstruction (MILCON) mode of analysis requested by the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers to correspond to changes in the Defense DepartmentTri-Service's life-cycle cost calculation requirements.

The contract represents a quantum leap inmaking both alternative financing and renewable energy technologyavailable to Federal facilities for the purpose of saving energyand cutting Federal utility costs. The award to Industrial Solar Technology (IST) Corporation ofGolden, Colorado will allow IST to supply solar energy and relatedefficiency technologies to meet the needs of any and all Federalfacilities in the United States. The contracting method that isused is the FEMP Energy Saver Performance Contract, or Super ESPC.It provides for IST to add work onto the contract as individualfacilities identify their own needs and sign up for energy savings. This is the first of a new class of contracts which applies theindefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracting provisionsof the Federal Acquisition Regulations to the energy savings performancecontracting (ESPC) approach. This new approach allows any Federalfacility to "order energy savings" from the specificsolar and related efficiency technologies covered by the IST contract. IST was selected based on its unique capabilities and performancecontracting experience to provide energy and cost savings throughinstallation of large aperture, line-focusing, parabolic troughsolar collectors and associated energy conservation technologies.This is the same technology that IST has been installing in Federaland non-Federal facilities since the 1980s. It is a great wayfor institutional facilities with large hot water loads such asprisons, hospitals, barracks, and kitchens to expand the use ofrenewable energy while meeting their mission-related energy needs. Perhaps the best feature of the contract is that, like all otherESPCs, it requires no money up front by the agency to start savingon utility costs. The payment to the contractor will come fromthe utility cost savings that the facility will see over the yearsthat IST will be delivering savings. Another benefit for Federalsites wishing to use the contract is that FEMP, through the GoldenField Office, has done the initial contracting and agencies canquickly and simply use the contract without having to initiatetheir own ESPC procurements. For Federal agencies it means no money up front, contracting alreadydone by FEMP, expanded renewable energy use, and quick energyand cost savings. No wonder these are called Super ESPCs! To get more information on this first Super ESPC call IndustrialSolar Technology Corporation at (303) 279-8108. For contractinginformation call Beth Peterman at (303) 275-4719 or Tom Reynoldsat (303) 275-4747 of the DOE Golden Field Office.

The receiver was designed by Rockwell International Corporation and built in conjunction with Bechtel Corporation as part of their respective cost-share participation in the Solar Two Consortium. During operation, the sun is focused on the receiver, which consists of pipes coated with a special energy-absorbing paint. Molten salt flowing through the pipes is heated to 1050 degrees Fahrenheit. This receiver is one of the engineering advances that is making solar-produced electricity increasingly cost competitive with traditional generating technologies.

It begins operation June 5, 996, and will produce electricity through January 1999, operated by a consortium of utilities and industrial partners headed by Southern California Edison Company. A power tower produces electricity from sunlight by focussing thousands of sun-tracking mirrors, called heliostats, on a single receiver sitting on top of a tower. The receiver captures the thermal energy of the sun and stores it in tanks of molten salt (to the right of the tower) at temperatures greater than 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. When electricity is needed, the energy in the molten salt is used to create steam, which drives a conventional electricity-generating turbine (to the left of the tower). Download 200dpi JPEG (472K) (Credit: U.S. Department of Energy, PIX#02183) Solar Two generates electricity using energy from the sun; it produces no emissions because it uses no fossil fuels. Power tower technology can produce utility-scale quantities of power, improve our environmental quality, and reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels. Download 200dpi JPEG (607K) (Credit: U.S. Department of Energy, PIX#02206) Most of Solar Two's heliostats are large, segmented glass mirrors mounted on frames that track the sun throughout the day, continuously directing solar energy onto the central receiver. Solar Two has more than 1900 heliostats, and taken together, they comprise the plant's largest single component. By collecting solar energy during daylight hours and storing it in hot molten salt, power tower technology gives utilities an alternative method for meeting peak loads. When demand for electricity is high--for example, during summer afternoons when air conditioning use is heaviest--the stored energy can be used to generate electricity and supply additional power to the utility grid. Download 200dpi JPEG (398K) (Credit: U.S. Department of Energy, PIX#02184) Solar Two's heliostats direct sunlight onto the receiver throughout the day. The heliostat field captures just a minuscule portion of the solar energy striking the earth, but even this small amount can generate enough electricity to power 10,000 homes. Solar Two is demonstrating the solar energy--free, abundant, and clean--can reliably and cost-effectively produce electricity on a utility scale. Download 200dpi JPEG (391K) (Credit: U.S. Department of Energy, PIX#02136) Solar Two represents a milestone in the development of solar energy technology. For the first time, solar energy can be captured and efficiently stored, allowing electricity to be generated when needed, not only when the sun shines. Except for siting requirements, power tower technology has minimal environmental impact as no fossil fuels are burned in the production of electricity.

Despite biomass being a very differentfuel in many respects, it is a logical choice for cofiring ina natural gas combined cycle system for several reasons. Thecombined cycle process configuration optimizes heat recovery fromeach stream for maximum power generation making it a very efficientcycle. Also, electricity generation from natural gas is expectedto increase significantly between 1995 and 2010. This growthin natural gas is expected to result in increased constructionof combined cycle systems due to continued interest by industryin gas turbine combined cycle technology. In addition to itspotential environmental benefits, biomass may, in select cases,offer fuel flexibility or a supplemental low-cost fuel for usein a gas turbine combined cycle system. When integrating biomassinto a natural gas system, it is important to design the systemto produce the most economical processing scheme. This is truefor all power generating applications including repowering orretrofitting of an existing plant, or construction of a new plant. It is also important to design a system that will be cost competitivefor both natural gas and biomass. The effects of system modificationsand changes in operating parameters on the overall system performanceshould be examined on a case by case basis. This includes a comparisonof design and off design performance for part load operation. A discussion and an evaluation of systems employing three biomasstechnology categories: biomass combustors, biomass boilers, andbiomass gasifiers is presented. Several conceptual power plantconfigurations were developed that integrate these technologieswith natural gas-fired gas turbines. Advantages, disadvantages,and applications for each biomass/natural gas combined cycle systemare also presented. INTRODUCTION This paper addresses several ways to utilize biomass in a cofiringscenario with a gas turbine combined cycle system that uses naturalgas as the primary fuel to generate power. This unique conceptof a biomass/natural gas combined cycle system has not been examinedextensively like the notion of cofiring biomass and coal in existingcoal boilers.1,2 Several conceptual power plant configurationshave been developed that integrate biomass technologies in theform of combustors, boilers, and gasifiers with natural gas-firedgas turbines. Despite biomass being a very different fuel in many respects,it is a logical choice for cofiring in a natural gas combinedcycle system for many reasons. Electricity generation from naturalgas is expected to increase by over 60% between 1993 and 2010.3The expected increase is in combustion turbines and combinedcycle plants. Natural gas is attractive because it is a cleanerburning fuel than coal or oil and currently has a relatively lowprice. Gas fired units have a lower initial capital cost anda shorter construction time than other electricity generatingsystems. Developmental trends have concentrated on increasedefficiency and power output from gas turbines which has addedto the increased interest in combined cycle plants. Before building new power plants, utilities are expected to optimizecurrent operating plants. Repowering is one way of improvingthe efficiency of an existing plant as well as extending the plant'slife. Combined cycle repowering has the advantage of using existingsites, steam turbines, instrumentation, and other plant equipmentthus reducing the cost of construction for a more efficient powergenerating facility. Retrofitting existing power plants is probablythe first step for utilizing biomass in an integrated gas turbinecombined cycle system. A detailed site specific analysis forany of the biomass/natural gas coprocessing schemes presentedin this paper should be performed to determine the economics ata given site because each electricity generating system has uniqueconsiderations. BIOMASS TECHNOLOGIES The biomass systems utilized in this study can be divided intothree technology categories: combustors, boilers, and gasifiers. The combustion of biomass is a proven technology with technologicalimprovements resulting in cleaner combustion and improved efficiencythrough operating enhancements such as staged combustion. Biomasscombustors are currently available from equipment vendors forthe combustion of liquids, sludges, and solids. Biomass applicationshave ranged from timber products including hog fuel, sawdust,bark, branches, and wood chips to agricultural wastes consistingof seeds, hulls, and stalks. Industry has concentrated on usingbiomass combustors for converting waste streams into a usableenergy source. Producing electricity through the use of biomassboilers is a well-proven technology. Both bubbling and circulatingfluidized bed boilers have been used for biomass fuel service. More than 170 fluidized bed boilers have burned alternate fuelssuch as municipal, commercial, agricultural, and industrial wasteresidues as of 1992.4 Biomass boilers have been used for manyenergy intensive processes in the pulp and paper industry andin the food processing industry. In these applications, biomassboilers are used to satisfy energy requirements by producing steamfrom waste products. Often part of the steam is used directlyin the process and the remainder is used to cogenerate electricity. Biomass gasification is a generally less developed technologythan biomass combustors or boilers. However, several types ofbiomass gasifiers have been developed over the years including:updraft, downdraft, bubbling fluid bed, circulating fluid bed,and entrained flow. Gasifier operating pressures have variedfrom atmospheric to 2.4 MPa (350 psia) with typical operatingtemperatures in the range of 760 °C to 982 °C (1400°F - 1800 °F). Work has begun to scale up several gasifiertypes worldwide. PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS Eleven process configurations were developed to integrate biomassfuel into a gas turbine combined cycle system. These diagrams,shown in Figures 2-10, represent a handful of the processing schemesthat could be developed for biomass/natural gas combined cyclesystems. The biomass systems employed can be divided into thethree technology categories discussed above: combustors, boilers,and gasifiers. The following subsections present the variousprocessing schemes for each category. Base Case The base case, shown in Figure 1, for evaluating each biomasscofiring scenarios is a natural gas-fired gas turbine combinedcycle system consisting of a gas turbine, a heat recovery steamgenerator (HRSG), and a steam turbine. A combined cycle was chosenas the base case because this process optimizes the heat recoveryof each stream for maximum power generation making it a very efficientand commonly used cycle. Combined cycles can reach net electricalefficiencies of 45 - 55% (LHV). It is also anticipated that continuedinterest in gas turbine combined cycle technology will resultin increased construction of these systems worldwide. All ofthe biomass/natural gas coprocessing schemes are a modificationof this base case design. In Figures 2-10 the base case combinedcycle system is shown with solid lines and the biomass systemsare depicted with dashed lines. Utilizing Biomass Combustion Two processing concepts were developed for utilizing a biomasscombustor with a natural gas combined cycle system. The firstschematic is depicted in Figure 2, in which air is utilized forbiomass combustion followed by an optional quench step, and acyclone for ash removal. The quench step is only required forhigh alkali containing biomass feedstocks. In this case the gasstream would be cooled to about 538 °C (1000 °F) byinjecting water directly into the stream. This promotes condensationof the alkali allowing them to be removed with the ash particlesin the downstream cyclone. Figure 3 shows a second combustor-basedschematic and differs from the first by utilizing the turbineexhaust gas as the oxygen source for combustion. The turbineexhaust gas is hot (ca. 538 °C or 1000 °F) and typicallycontains 13 - 15 vol% oxygen5 and therefore should be a good sourcefor combustion "air". This process configuration requiresa low alkali biomass feedstock because quenching the entire hotgas stream to the HRSG would result in a large decrease in thermalefficiency. Utilizing A Biomass Boiler Two process arrangements for integrating a biomass boiler witha gas turbine, HRSG, and steam turbine were developed. The onlydifference between the two boiler configurations is that the secondone uses process water to wash the contaminants from an herbaceousfeedstock. This would be useful for crops such as switchgrassor bagasse. Both arrangements are shown in Figure 4 with a boxaround the feed differences which are labeled as option 1 andoption 2. The boiler in this figure includes associated equipmentsuch as dust collectors, electrostatic precipitators, baghousefilters, or wet scrubbers to control emissions. In the layout,the boiler is integrated with the steam turbine of the combinedcycle system. Utilizing Low Pressure Biomass Gasification Figures 5-8 contain flow diagrams for utilizing low pressure gasificationwith a gas turbine combined cycle system. In Figures 5 and 6,the biomass derived synthesis gas is combusted and sent to a ductburner in the HRSG. These two figures have the following biomassprocessing steps in common: drying, low pressure gasification,hot gas clean up, and combustion. Drying is accomplished usingwaste heat from the HRSG flue gas. The hot gas clean-up portionof the process includes a cyclone which removes most of the ashand particulates, a tar cracker for converting heavy hydrocarbonsinto lighter ones, and a set of ceramic candle filters for additionalparticulate and alkali removal. It is important to remove heavyhydrocarbons and alkali species to very low levels to preventdeposition and corrosion on downstream equipment. The only differencebetween the arrangements in Figures 5 and 6 is the gasificationoxygen source: Figure 5 uses air while Figure 6 uses hot turbineexhaust gas. Depending on the size of the biomass system andif the gas turbine is at full load or part load, only a slipstreamof the turbine exhaust gas may be required for gasification. In that case part of the turbine exhaust gas may be bypassed aroundthe biomass system and sent directly to the HRSG. The schematicin Figure 5 shows two feedstock options just like the biomassboiler schematic (Figure 4) to show how the biomass washing stepwhich facilitates the use of an herbaceous feedstock can be utilizedwith gasification. The low pressure gasification concepts shown in Figures 7 and8 differ from those in Figures 5 and 6 in many ways because thebiomass derived synthesis gas is utilized as a turbine fuel insteadof directly in the HRSG. In order to accommodate this differentprocessing concept, the syngas must go through the following additionalsteps after hot gas clean-up: cooling, quenching, and compressing. The hot gas clean-up step in Figures 7 and 8, is the same asthat described above for Figures 5 and 6 except that it does notinclude a set of ceramic candle filters. Since the gas must becooled before compression, this piece of equipment is not necessary. Instead the gas is cooled by heat exchangers to a point abovealkali condensation followed by additional cooling and alkaliremoval with a conventional quench step. Any alkali that is notentrained in the ash coming out of the cyclone will be removedwith the waste water in the quench step. The heat exchange isused to recover some of the sensible heat in the gas stream aswell as to reduce the amount of quench water required. The heatexchange step can be used to raise the temperature of anotherstream elsewhere in the process, if required, or to produce steamthat is sent to the HRSG resulting in the generation of additionalelectricity or a combination of these two concepts may be employed. In Figure 7, the syngas is fed to a gas turbine in conjunctionwith or instead of natural gas whereas in Figure 8, the syngasand natural gas are each fed to separate gas turbines and thenthe exhaust gas from both turbines is combined and sent to theHRSG. Utilizing High Pressure Biomass Gasification Figures 9 and 10 contain high pressure gasification processingschemes that are similar to the low pressure configurations illustratedin Figures 7 and 8. In all of these diagrams (Figures 7-10) theconcept that is employed involves using the biomass derived synthesisgas as a turbine fuel. However, for the high pressure gasificationconfigurations (Figures 9 and 10) the synthesis gas exiting thehot gas clean-up section can be fed directly to the gas turbinecombustor without any of the additional processing steps whichare required for the low pressure schematics. The hot gas clean-upfor the high pressure configurations consists of a cyclone toremove most of the particulates and ash, a tar cracker for convertingheavy hydrocarbons into lighter ones, and a set of ceramic candlefilters for additional particulate and alkali removal. OPPORTUNITIES FOR USE Many applications exist for utilizing the biomass/natural gascoprocessing schemes laid out above. For example, any of theconfigurations shown in Figures 2-10 can be used in repoweringan existing coal boiler, in increasing the output from an existingpower plant, or in the construction of a new power plant. Additionalapplications which are not necessarily subsets of these threeoptions are described below. The biomass boiler concepts illustrated in option 1 and 2 of Figure4 can be used to retrofit an existing biomass boiler with a gasturbine system. The gasification concepts in Figures 8 and 10as well as Figure 4 are applicable for utilizing natural gas asa peaking fuel. In these cases, the configurations will allowthe natural gas to be used during either a planned or an unplannedpeak in electricity demand. This is useful for electric utilitiesbecause they need some flexible power generating options for handlingdaily load variations. Using natural gas as a peaking fuel isadvantageous for the gasification concepts in Figures 8 and 10because the capital intensive biomass gasification system canbe designed for average rather than maximum load thus reducingthe total capital cost. Biomass may be used as a peaking fuel for planned peaks in anyof the biomass/natural gas coprocessing schematics shown in Figures2-10. However, only the configurations utilizing biomass in acombustor or in a boiler (Figures 2-4) will be able to use biomassas a peaking fuel during an unplanned increase in load. Thesetechnologies allow the equipment to be started up and broughton-line more quickly than a biomass gasifier system. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES There are both advantages and disadvantages to integrating a biomasssystem with a natural gas combined cycle system. In some cases,an advantage to one power production facility may be a disadvantageto, or simply have no effect on, another facility. Ultimately,each individual operating plant (existing or new) would have toevaluate the biomass/natural gas combined cycle scenarios accordingto the needs and capabilities of the facility as well as the expectedfuel supply and cost structure in the area. The following subsectionsoutline some of the advantages and disadvantages to consider whenexamining the eleven biomass/natural gas power production coprocessingconfigurations. Utilizing Boiler Feed Water for Washing Biomass When utilizing boiler feed water (BFW) for washing herbaceousbiomass as shown in option 2 of Figure 4 and option 2 of Figure5, the resulting wash water contains valuable nutrients such asnitrogen (N), and potassium (K). These are two of the major nutrientsused in producing fertilizers for plant growth in the U.S.6 Irrigatingcrops with process wash water may be advantageous to the farmerbecause this would reduce or perhaps eliminate fertilizer costs.These costs include the purchase and application of the fertilizer. Depending on the region where the crop is grown and the typeof crop grown, different amounts of fertilizer are necessary toobtain the required nutrients that are essential for plant growth. Utilizing Turbine Exhaust Gas Figures 3 and 6 containing biomass combustion and low pressuregasification, respectively, utilize hot turbine exhaust gas asthe biomass combustion or gasification oxygen source. This exhaustgas is typically around 538 °C (1000 °F) requiring hightemperature valves for controlling the flow of the exhaust gasto the combustor or gasifier unit and for bypassing flow aroundthe biomass system directly to the HRSG. Problems may arise inobtaining, controlling, and maintaining suitable high temperaturevalves at a reasonable cost for this type of high temperatureapplication. Because of the high turbine exhaust gas temperature,process schemes using this gas (Figures 3 and 6) should minimizethe piping distance between the gas turbine and the biomass system(combustor or gasifier). If the layout of an existing naturalgas combined cycle plant poses space constraint problems, thenintegration of the biomass system between the gas turbine andthe HRSG could create design problems as well as additional equipmentcosts. Problems that could arise would be associated with thermalexpansion and piping stresses while extra costs would includeadditional piping and insulation as a minimum. At such high temperatureseven a 4" diameter pipe will require several inches of insulationto keep the gas hot. A comparison of Figures 3 and 6 with Figures 2 and 5 shows severalpositive aspects to using the turbine exhaust gas as the oxygensource for combustion or gasification. First, using the exhaustgas eliminates the need for any additional equipment that is requiredwhen using atmospheric air for a biomass gasifier or combustorsystem. The equipment required for an air system includes a blowerand a minimum of one heat exchanger. Some electricity is requiredto operate the blower resulting in a reduction in the overallelectrical output from the plant. Furthermore, in order to warmthe air another stream in the process must be cooled simultaneouslyresulting in a decrease in the overall system efficiency. Becausethe turbine exhaust gas is very hot (typically 538 °C) noadditional heating is required in the schematics of Figures 3or 6 and this could result in a higher overall system efficiencywhen compared to using air as in the concepts shown in Figures2 and 5. However, because of the additional equipment betweenthe gas turbine and the HRSG, these systems will experience anefficiency loss of the gas turbine due to the higher pressurerequired at the gas turbine outlet. Therefore, the overall systemperformance must be examined in detail to determine the net effectof using air versus exhaust gas as the oxygen source for combustionor gasification. The turbine exhaust gas must have a sufficient amount of oxygento burn the biomass, otherwise a backup air system would be required. However, this will not be a problem as long as the system isdesigned so that the oxygen in the turbine exhaust gas meets therequired lbs of O2/lb of biomass fed to the combustor or gasifier. Special consideration should be taken in evaluating the oxygenrequirements when operating at the maximum biomass feed rate andin evaluating the oxygen availability when operating the gas turbineat a reduced rate. With a fully integrated system as shown inFigures 3 and 6, the biomass portion can not operate without thegas turbine unless there is a backup air system whereas in theother schematics (Figures 2 and 5), the system can operate atpart load utilizing only the biomass portion of the system whenthe gas turbine is down. Feedstocks Figure 2 involving a biomass combustor as well as all of the biomassgasification configurations (Figures 5-10) have more feedstockflexibility than the remaining three configurations shown in Figures3 and 4 with respect to utilizing biomass containing high amountsof alkali. A quench step can be inserted before ash removal inthe biomass combustor system of Figure 2 whereas for the schematicin Figure 3, quenching the entire hot gas stream to the HRSG wouldresult in a large decrease in thermal efficiency. All of thebiomass gasifier systems have the ability to remove alkalis whichare present in the synthesis gas. The high pressure biomass gasifiersystems in Figures 9 and 10 and the low pressure gasifier systemsin Figures 7 and 8 contain a hot gas clean up step to remove alkalis. Some alkali species will be entrained in the ash coming out ofa cyclone and the remainder will be removed using a set of ceramiccandle filters. In the low pressure gasification systems shownin Figures 7 and 8, some alkalis are removed with the ash in acyclone and the remainder is removed in the quench step. In most cases, utilizing a biomass combustor or boiler as in Figures2-4, does not require drying of the biomass eliminating the additionalcosts associated with the dryer system. However, the reducedefficiency of the combustor or boiler must be taken into accountwhen performing the economics of the overall system. Many combustorsor boilers can handle high moisture feedstocks with moisture contentsup to 65 wt%.7 Whereas for a gasification system the biomassmust typically be dried to 10 - 15 wt% moisture for a direct gasifierand 20 - 25 wt% for an indirect gasifier. For any gasifier system,drying the biomass will result in a higher overall thermal efficiencyand in more stable operation of the system. Biomass is not an easy solid to feed because of its low density,fibrous nature, and other properties. Biomass feeder systemsare typically made up of lockhoppers and/or screw feeders. Difficultieswith feeding biomass will depend on the type of biomass feedstockas well as the operating pressure of the system. It is anticipatedthat there will be less difficulties with feeding biomass to alow pressure system like a biomass combustor (Figures 2 and 3),a biomass boiler (Figure 4), or a low pressure gasifier (Figures5-8). When the feedstock is batch fed through pressurizationand depressurization of a series of lockhoppers, the operatingcosts of feeding biomass to a high pressure system (Figures 9and 10) in terms of dollars and efficiency may also be considerablyhigher due the increased inert gas requirement. Retrofitting Existing Systems The following discussion applies to Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6 whichutilize the combustion gas from a biomass combustor or gasifierdirectly with a HRSG. When retrofitting an existing natural gascombined cycle system, if the gas from the biomass combustor orgasifier system is not as clean as the exhaust gas from the gasturbine then the HRSG will require additional equipment modificationssuch as the addition of an induced draft (ID) fan or soot blowerto prevent particulates from building up on the tube walls. Otherwise,the HRSG will experience a reduction in the heat transfer coefficientas well as a loss in heat transfer surface area which will ultimatelylead to less power generation from the steam turbine. Higherparticulate loads will also result in more frequent down-timefor cleaning of the heat exchange surfaces in various parts ofthe HRSG. An excessive amount of particulates could also causeemission problems. However, for the biomass combustion illustrationsshown in Figures 2 and 3 this can be solved by putting a baghousefilter on the stack before the flue gas is emitted to the atmosphere. Since flue gas is used to dry the biomass in the low pressuregasification schemes (Figures 5 and 6), the baghouse filter onthe gas stream exiting the dryer should be designed to collectany particulates that carry over from the HRSG. In a combined cycle configuration, increasing the gas velocityto a HRSG will result in higher pressure drops throughout thegas side of the HRSG which in turn causes an increase in the backpressure to the gas turbine. Adding the biomass system shownin the process configuration of Figures 2-3 (biomass combustion),Figure 4 (biomass boilers), or Figures 5-10 (biomass gasification)would result in an increase in gas flow to the existing HRSG whichmay be above the design point. Since pressure drop is proportionalto the gas velocity squared, a small increase in the gas velocitywill have a large effect on the HRSG pressure drop and the resultantincrease in the gas turbine outlet pressure will cause a decreasein the gas turbine efficiency. Depending on the operating parametersof the overall system, there is probably an operating point wherea trade-off between higher turbine outlet pressure and lower turbineefficiency results in a higher thermal efficiency of the overallbiomass/combined cycle system. For the two different operating configurations in Figure 4, aminimal amount of additional equipment and piping modificationswould be required to retrofit an existing biomass boiler systemthus resulting in a minimal additional cost for increased powerproduction. As a minimum, it would be necessary to add a gasturbine. It may also be necessary to upgrade or make modificationsto the HRSG and steam turbine. Since a gas turbine does not requirea lot of space, it would also be adaptable to space constraintproblems of an existing biomass boiler plant. Gas Clean Up In general, all of the biomass systems require some type of gasclean-up which is not required for a natural gas combustion system. This includes clean-up for contaminants such as particulates,ash, char, tar, and alkalis which are not found in a natural gassystem. These contaminants can cause corrosion, erosion, anddeposition problems in downstream equipment resulting in reducedperformance and high maintenance costs. Since tars are not producedin biomass combustor or boiler systems, tar removal is not requiredfor the systems shown in Figures 2-4. However, depending on thefeedstock and the type of gasifier utilized, tars of varying quantityand quality can be produced from a gasifier system. Therefore,each gasifier configuration shown in Figures 5-10 requires tarremoval in the gas clean-up process whether the synthesis gasis used as gas turbine fuel or used directly in the HRSG. However,the biomass combustor and boiler systems (Figures 2-4) have thedisadvantage of having the potential for more environmental problemsassociated with incomplete combustion of the biomass comparedto the gasification systems (Figures 5-10). Startup and Turndown The biomass combustor and boiler systems (Figures 2-4) can bestarted up rapidly compared to the low or high pressure biomassgasification systems. This is important when operating a powerplant which experiences frequent changes in load especially unplannedload variations. For fluctuating operations, it is also importantto determine the turndown capability of the biomass system. Becausebiomass gasifiers have not been operated at large scales, it isnot clear what the turndown capability of these systems will be. System Complexity The biomass combustor and gas clean up equipment in Figures 2and 3 are very simplistic compared to a biomass boiler or gasificationsystem. For any operating facility, as larger and/or more piecesof equipment are added to a system more space and/or land is required. The gasification configurations, especially those in Figures8 and 10), require a large amount of equipment which will notonly require more plant space but could result in higher capitaland operating costs. Because gasification is not as well developedas biomass combustors or boilers, there is also an increased riskassociated with the commercialization of the low or high pressuregasification technology (Figures 5-10). Low versus High Pressure Gasification In Figures 7-10 the synthesis gas derived from biomass gasificationis used directly in a gas turbine. When comparing low pressuregasification (Figures 7 and 8) with high pressure gasification(Figures 9 and 10), the low pressure systems require additionalcooling and compression. This results in additional capital andoperating costs. However, when utilizing a low pressure indirectgasifier these additional costs could be offset by reduced gasifiercosts. In general, indirect gasifier systems are estimated tobe less expensive than direct gasifier systems. Because of theindirect heating, the gasifier is sized to accommodate a smallergas flow thus resulting in a lower equipment cost that a directheated gasifier. CONCLUSIONS Examining the integration of biomass with a gas turbine combinedcycle system was chosen because this process optimizes the heatrecovery of each stream for maximum power generation making ita very efficient cycle. It is also anticipated that the low costof natural gas, the fact that it is a cleaner burning fuel thancoal or oil, and the incremental increases in efficiency and poweroutput from gas turbines will generate continued interest in gasturbine combined cycle technology resulting in increased constructionof these systems. The biomass systems examined were divided intothe following three technology categories: biomass combustors,biomass boilers, and biomass gasifiers. Eleven process configurationswere developed for cofiring biomass and natural gas in a gas turbinecombined cycle system. Many opportunities exist for using thesebiomass/natural gas systems such as repowering an existing coalboiler, retrofitting an existing power plant, or constructinga new power plant. Many advantages and disadvantages can be foundwhen comparing the various biomass/natural gas coprocessing schemes. However, the advantages and disadvantages need to be examinedon an individual plant basis. When integrating a biomass/naturalgas system, it is important to integrate all energy streams toproduce the most economical processing scheme. It is also importantto design a system that will be cost competitive for both naturalgas and biomass. The effect of operating parameters such as increasedturbine outlet pressure and part load operation on the overallsystem performance should be examined on a case by case basis. For retrofit plants, a comparison must be made between the increasein power generation versus the additional capital and operatingcosts incurred. Biomass cofiring projects such as the biomass/naturalgas systems laid out in this paper will be the best opportunityfor near-term growth in the area of biomass utilization. Implementingbiomass gasification in this way will bring about technology acceptancewhich will lead the way to larger scale biomass plants. Overall,the processing of biomass to electricity will depend on the costof the fuel, market conditions, the conversion technology used,and the income generated by the power produced. Work involving more detailed design, performance, and economicanalysis of the most promising systems has begun using GateCyclesoftware by Enter Software, Inc. These detailed evaluations willpay particular attention to the effects of operating parameterssuch as part load performance and increased turbine outlet pressureson the cost of electricity production.

Winds are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the earth's surface, and rotation of the earth. Wind flow patterns are modified by the earth's terrain, bodies of water, and vegetative cover. This wind flow, or motion energy, when "harvested" by the wind turbines, or modern-day windmills, can be used to generate electricity. WHEN WAS WIND ENERGY FIRST USED?Since earliest recorded history, wind power has been used to move ships, grind grain and pump water. There is evidence that wind energy was used to propel boats along the Nile River as early as 5000 B.C. Within several centuries before Christ, simple windmills were used in China to pump water.In the United States, millions of windmills were erected as the American West was developed during the late 19th century. Most of them were used to pump water for farms and ranches. By 1900, small electric wind systems were developed to generate direct current, but most of these units fell into disuse as inexpensive grid power was extended to rural areas during the 1930s. By 1910, wind turbine generators were producing electricity in many European countries. HOW IS THE ENERGY IN THE WIND CAPTURED?Wind turbines, like aircraft propeller blades, turn in the moving air and power an electric generator which supplies an electric current. Modern wind turbines fall into two basic groups; the horizontal-axis variety, like the traditional farm windmills used for pumping water; and the vertical-axis design, like the eggbeater-style Darrieus model, named after its French inventor. Modern wind technology takes advantage of advances in materials, engineering, electronics, and aerodynamics. Wind turbines are often grouped together into a single wind power plant, also known as a wind farm, and generate bulk electrical power. Electricity from these turbines is fed into the local utility grid and distribute to customers just as it is with conventional power plants. HOW BIG ARE WIND TURBINES?Wind turbines are available in a variety of sizes, and therefore power ratings. The largest machine, such as the one built in Hawaii, has propellers that span the more than the length of a football field and stands 20 building stories high, and produces enough electricity to power 1400 homes. A small home-sized wind machine has rotors between 8 and 25 feet in diameter and stands upwards of 30 feet and can supply the power needs of an all-electric home or small business. WHAT ARE WIND TURBINES MADE OF?All electric-generating wind turbines, no matter what size, are comprised of a few basic components: the rotor (or blade, is the part that actually rotates in the wind), the electrical generator, a speed control system, and a tower. Some wind machines have fail-safe shutdown systems so that if part of the machine fails, the shutdown systems turn the blades out of the wind or puts on brakes. ARE THERE GOOD WIND RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES?Wind energy is very abundant many parts of the United States. Wind resources are characterized by wind-power density classes, ranging from class 1 (the lowest) to class 7 (the highest). Good wind resources (class 3 and above) which have an average annual wind speed of at least 13 miles per hour, are found along the east coast, the Appalachian Mountain chain, the Great Plains, the Pacific Northwest, and some other locations. North Dakota, alone, has enough energy from class 4 and higher winds to supply 36% of the electricity of the lower 48 states. Of course, it would be impractical to move electricity everywhere from North Dakota. Wind speed is a critical feature of wind resources, because the energy in wind is proportional to the cube of the wind speed. In other words, a stronger wind means a lot more power. WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF WIND-GENERATED ELECTRICITY?Numerous public opinion surveys have consistently shown that the public prefers wind and other renewable energy forms over conventional sources of generation. Wind energy is a free, renewable resource, so no matter how much is used today, there will still be the same supply in the future. Wind energy is also a source of clean, non-polluting, electricity. Unlike conventional power plants, wind plants emit no air pollutants or greenhouse gases. In 1990, California's wind power plants offset the emission of more than 2.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, and 15 million pounds of other pollutants that would have otherwise been produced. It would take a forest of 90 million to 175 million trees to provide the same air quality. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO GREATER WIND POWER USAGE?Even though the cost of wind power has decreased dramatically in the past 10 years, the technology requires a higher initial investment than fossil-fueled generators. Roughly 80% of the cost is the machinery, with the balance being the site preparation and installation. If wind generating systems are compared with fossil-fueled systems on a "life-cycle" cost basis (counting fuel and operating expenses for the life of the generator), however, wind costs are much more competitive with other generating technologies because there is no fuel to purchase and minimal operating expenses. ARE THERE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS FACING WIND POWER?Although wind power plants have relatively little impact on the environment compared to other conventional power plants, there is some concern over the noise produced by the rotor blades, possible interference with television reception, and sometimes birds have been killed by flying into the rotors. Most of these problems have been resolved or greatly reduced through technological development or by properly siting wind plants. Avian mortality remains an issue to be resolved since it is unclear if birds are attracted to wind turbines. ARE THERE OTHER DRAWBACKS TO THE USE OF WIND ENERGY?The major challenge to using wind as a source of power is that it is intermittent and it does not always blow when electricity is needed. Wind cannot be stored (unless batteries are used); and not all winds can be harnessed to meet the timing of electricity demands. Further, good wind sites are often located in remote locations far from areas of electric power demand (such as cities). Finally, wind resource development may compete with other uses for the land and those alternative uses may be more highly valued than electricity generation. However, wind turbines can be located on land that is also used for grazing or even farming. IS WIND ENERGY GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY?Wind energy avoids the external or societal costs associated with conventional resources, namely, the trade deficit from importing foreign oil and other fuels, the health and environmental costs of pollution, and the cost of depleted resources. Wind energy is a domestic, reliable resource that provides more jobs per dollar invested than any other energy technology--more than five times that from coal or nuclear power. In 1994, wind turbine and component manufacturers contributed directly to the economies of 44 states, creating thousands of jobs for Americans. IS THE COST OF WIND POWER COMPETITIVE WITH CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANTS?New, utility-scale, wind projects are being built all around the United States today with energy costs ranging from 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour (at very windy sites in Texas) to 5 cents or more (in the Pacific Northwest). These costs are competitive with the direct operating costs of many conventional forms of electricity generation now--and prices are expected to drop even further over the next 10 years. Since wind is an intermittent electricity generator and does not provide power on an "as needed" basis, it has to compare favorably with the costs saved on fuel from fossil generators. CAN HOMEOWNERS SELL EXCESS ELECTRICITY TO THE UTILITY?Under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA), any qualifying individual can install a wind generator and the local electric utility must pay for any excess power produced. PURPA was specifically intended to create a market for clean, renewable, electric-generating technologies by guaranteeing a buyer for the excess power. Prior to PURPA, selling power to the utility was an option but was the discretion of the utility. With PURPA, small power producers meeting specific criteria are guaranteed purchase and interconnection. WIND INDUSTRY...TODAYThe wind energy industry has grown steadily over the last 10 years and American companies are now competing aggressively in energy markets across the nation and around the world. The industry, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, continues to expand and develop a full range of highly reliable, efficient wind turbines. These new-generation turbines, when installed, perform at 98 percent reliability in the field, representing remarkable progress since the technology was first introduced in the early 1980s. WIND POWER...TOMORROWWind power has an expansive future according to experts. Up to 5% of the new generating plant capacity in the next decade--and immense amount of electricity in practical terms--could be fueled by wind. Wind power now produces less than 1% of the nation's electricity. The Department of Energy forecasts a 600% increase in wind-energy use in the nation in the next 15 years. By the middle of the next century, the wind could be producing 10% of U.S. electricity--as much as hydroelectric dams to today.

The LANL announcement was for manufacture of a flexible HTS tape with current density of more than 1 million amperes per square centimeter at liquid nitrogen temperatures-a current density nearly 100 times greater than other flexible HTS conductors. This current density correlated with the ability to carry an impressive critical current of 200 amps across the one-centimeter-wide tape. Equally important, good current densities are maintained under fields of several Tesla. These results were obtained by Xin Di Wu and his colleagues by coating a specially treated nickel tape with YBCO, using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). LANL film deposition expertise was critical both in the PLD of superconducting thick films, as well as in the preparation of the nickel substrate, which was done by using two beams of ions to deposit and align a thin layer of cubic zirconia on the nickel. One of the ion beams removes material from a target block of yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia and deposits it onto the nickel. The second ion beam, focused on the metal at a specific angle, orients the crystal grains so they align properly as they grow. The effect of this second beam in causing alignment suggested the name of this technique-ion beam assisted deposition, or IBAD. When the superconductor is then deposited, YBCO crystals grow with essentially the same degree of in-plane alignment as in the zirconia buffer layer. The importance of this development, both to science and to superconductivity, was put in perspective by Dr. Edward Teller, Emeritus Director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, at a July 6, 1995, meeting in Albuquerque held to discuss the LANL breakthrough with industry. Dr. Teller's view was that, "Los Alamos has made a wonderful accomplishment-the ability to make a single crystal infinitely long." The YBCO alignment solves the problem that has plagued those attempting to make YBCO electrical wires-the grain boundary interference with current flow. Now, YBCO has again become a leading candidate for high-field, liquid-nitrogen-cooled use. RABiTS In parallel with the IBAD work at LANL, Amit Goyal and his colleagues at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have demonstrated excellent alignment in YBCO coatings on flexible metal strips, but by an entirely different method. The ORNL results were achieved by using industrially-scaleable techniques primarily involving rolling to create alignment that YBCO crystals copy when the strip is coated. The ORNL critical currents are less than 100,000 amperes per square centimeter, but show the same independence to high magnetic fields as the LANL IBAD results. Perhaps more important, the alignment in the substrate is somewhat better than reported from IBAD, raising the strong possibility that the ORNL process will ultimately give similar results. ORNL calls their process RABiTS, for Rolling Assisted Biaxial Textured Substrates. Both the LANL and ORNL developments were totally supported by DOE funds, so licenses are available to companies wanting to commercialize these processes. The Electric Power Research Institute and several dozen companies are strongly interested. IBAD Buffer Layers High critical currents in YBCO deposited on IBAD buffer layers were reported in 1992 by Paul Berdahl's group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) and Iijima in Japan (Iijima et. al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 60, 769 [1992]). The two groups were working independently. LBL reported 600,000 amperes per square centimeter in 1992 at the DOE annual program review, which remained a record for some time. The LBL work, which was also entirely supported by DOE, was dropped from the program due to the strong focus on bismuth powder-in-tube conductors that has been the program's principal emphasis since then. LBLreceived a patent this year for their innovative work and are discussing future industrial development with private companies. Los Alamos began to emphasize IBAD in 1994 and reported 800,000 amperes per square centimeter at that year's annual program review. Results continue to improve at LANL, as well as in Japan where the critical current measurements reported remain lower than LANL's. The excellent alignment in the zirconia buffer layer (which is later mirrored in the superconductor) results from the ion beam blasting away zirconia grains growing with the wrong orientation. But the beam doesn't affect grains which grow with the desired orientation, instead it passes harmlessly through channels in their crystal lattice. A key question is whether IBAD is too slow for large-scale manufacturing. The rate governing parameters are the thickness of the buffer layer and the deposition rate. So far the work has been at a research level and a potential manufacturer has not been found to begin process optimization. Buffer Layer Thickness IBAD rate is largely determined by the required thickness of the zirconia buffer layer. Presently, LANL uses a 5000 Angstrom buffer layer, but is investigating whether layers as thin as 100 Angstroms may be adequate as suggested by Bob Hammond of Stanford University. Xin Di Wu of LANL also has another strategy: "If good YBCO requires a 5000 Angstrom buffer layer, it may be possible to grow a minority of that layer by IBAD and the rest by a faster, less expensive technique." An important task in 1996 is to determine experimentally the minimum thickness of the IBAD layer needed for high-quality YBCO coatings.

"This is one of the most exciting and challenging projects ever undertaken by Southwire," said Roy Richards, Jr., chairman and CEO of the Carrollton, GA, company. "The efficient use of energy is critical to our country's future competitiveness, and we are confident we can make a major contribution toward that goal-confident enough, in fact, to invest our own money in the program." Southwire will work closely with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology. Under a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA), the government will provide $95,000, and Southwire will contribute at least $775,000 in the first stage of what could be a multi-stage project. "This agreement demonstrates DOE's role as broker of one of tomorrow's exciting energy technologies," said Christine A. Ervin, DOE's Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. "Through the marriage of two unique American strengths-U.S. private sector entrepreneurial spirit and the unique technological resources of DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory-our private sector partners can become world leaders in high-temperature superconducting wire and coil manufacture." Southwire's assignment is to design and fabricate a one-meter length of superconducting cable for testing and verification of the project's concept. ORNL will use its unique testing facilities to measure the performance of the cable and will provide cryogenic (low temperature) systems support to Southwire. "If the test cable works, then it should be possible to fabricate much longer lengths and thus commercialize what is now an experimental technology," said R. L. Hughey, project manager for Southwire. Electrical current will be carried by silver-clad tapes containing dozens of filaments of ceramic, high-temperature superconductor. Used as underground cable in dense urban areas and through areas where right-of-way space is at a premium, the cable will deliver at least twice as much current as conventional cable and deliver the energy more efficiently. Southwire is the nation's largest manufacturer of copper and aluminum rod, wire, and cable for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The company will handle the experimental fabrication of the cable, in which the silver-clad tape is wound around a pipe that carries liquid nitrogen and insulating material, which is wound around the superconducting tape. Southwire will also work with ORNL to design and build test equipment and perform electron microscopy to study the characteristics of materials used in the project.

The FLC recognized Roger Poeppel, Jim Emerson, Stanley Johnson, and Balu Balachandran for their outstanding effort in transferring technology developed in the laboratory to outside partners. The process efficiently removes the carbon dioxide formed during the preparation of high-temperature superconductors. Carbon dioxide released during heating of the constituent salts reacts with the superconductor to form nonsuperconducting impurities that lower the current-carrying ability of the final product. Compared to conventional methods, researchers can now make high-temperature superconductors in one-tenth the time and at forty percent the cost. The process also won a 1993 R&ampD 100 award from R&ampD Magazine as one of the 100 most significant technical products of the year. The FLC is made up of representatives from federal laboratories, industry, academia and state and local governments. The award will be presented to Argonne's winners at the FLC' s National Technology Transfer Meeting, May 6-9, 1996, in Seattle, WA.

Lockheed Martin Corporation and its partners (Southern California Edison, American Superconductor Corporation, and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)) tested the prototype for six weeks at a Southern California Edison substation, in a circuit where the normal operating current was 40 amperes. To test the prototype, the team intentionally created fault currents of about 3100 amperes by shorting a transformer to ground. The device responded within one-half cycle, limiting the first peak of the fault current by 52%. After the first peak, in steady state, the device limited the fault current by 42%. The prototype also demonstrated that it can intercept multiple fault currents; it successfully handled two 400-millisecond fault currents separated by 800 milliseconds. Eddie Leung of Lockheed Martin said, "The fault current limiter demonstrated a level of performance which has real value for utilities. The fastest electromechanical circuit breakers take 3 to 5 cycles to respond, and the force associated with fault currents tends to be proportional to the square of the current." "This demonstration is significant in that it shows that HTS wire and coil technology is advancing rapidly to meet the needs of the electric power industry," said Dr. Dean Peterson, Center Leader of the Superconductivity Technology Center at LANL. He added, "Development of high performance, low cost current limiters will yield improved reliability, efficiency, and cost improvements for the electric utility industry." Gary Dishaw of Southern California Edison (SCE) confirmed his company's interest: "SCE has been looking for a current limiter which would control surge currents but not interfere with normal power flow. Commercialization of superconducting fault current limiters will enable utilities to control surge currents, avoid costly upgrades, and protect expensive transmission and distribution equipment." Leung said a full-scale commercial FCL would require a 15-kilovolt, 11-kiloamp rating. Dean Peterson of LANL pointed out that the performance of the superconducting wire is already good enough to achieve that rating. Dr. Alonso Rodriguez, formerly an engineer with SCE and now a consultant to Lockheed Martin, said, "This device is simple, robust, and dependable. It detects a fault current and automatically inserts a superconducting coil in series with the supply line. The coil does not become resistive during the fault and therefore does not have to absorb any resistive heat. "The device will limit fault currents to a value which the circuit breakers can handle safely. Utilities will install it rather than splitting their buses or upgrading their breakers when the fault duty at a substation increases. "The fault current limiter will also improve power quality," Rodriguez explained. "By minimizing current spikes, it will provide a more consistent power source for customers with sensitive equipment. "Furthermore, the device could enable utilities to import and export more power. It will give them a stiffer, more robust system less susceptible to voltage and frequency disturbances. For that reason, it will enable utilities to operate existing transmission lines closer to their thermal limits." How will deregulation of the utility industry affect the future market for FCL's? Rodriguez said, "It depends on how deregulation plays out: it could tend to make the utility grids more interconnected or less interconnected. If it makes them more interconnected, deregulation will increase the fault current levels and create an even greater need for this device." Eddie Leung of Lockheed Martin pointed out that the DOE's Superconductivity Partnership Initiative had selected the FCL program for Phase II contract negotiations. The Phase II proposal described a two-year program with $7 million of total funding, including industry contributions.

The team members include: Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC), Waukesha Electric Systems (WES, formerly the transformer division of MagneTek), Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&ampE), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The team plans to begin testing a 1-MVA single phase demonstration unit in late 1996. The HTS transformer will provide lower operating losses and potentially lower total owning cost than today's equipment and will provide the nation's electric utilities and their customers with power transformers with reduced environmental hazards, enhanced fire safety, smaller size, and reduced noise and weight. Because electricity typically passes through four to five transformers between the generating station and the consumer, the energy savings impact of these advanced transformers can be multiplied several times when the technology becomes widespread. Success of the program depends on the availability of low-cost, high-temperature superconducting wires. IGC and ORNL have been developing several families of HTS wires for electric power applications. The overall project is being led by IGC. IGC is responsible for producing all of the superconducting tapes and for winding the coils, and is leading the cryogenic integration tasking for the 1-MVA demonstration transformer. IGC also leads technical and economic feasibility analyses for the 10-MVA and larger class of superconducting transformer. They will perform detailed design, fabrication, and testing of the 1-MVA conductor and coil and have the lead responsibility for cryomagnetic technology and manufacturing in partnership with WES. ORNL is a team leader for the project and has the majority of the responsibility for the development and testing of components during the second year of the project. ORNL will analyze fault tolerance of the proposed winding concepts and will measure and analyze alternating current losses as a function of normal and fault transfer operation. ORNL also will design the basic conductor winding systems and will design and test certain cryogenic components as well as assemble and perform the first cryogenic tests on the 1-MVA demonstration unit. WES has the technical lead responsibility for transformer design, technical and economic feasibility analyses, manufacturing, and testing. They will conduct technical and market analysis of 10-MVA and larger HTS transformers. They also will perform strategic analyses and experiments relative to voltage breakdown. WES will lead the construction of the 1-MVA demonstration unit and will perform detailed design and fabrication of core, bushings, insulation, and mechanical structure of the 1-MVA demonstration unit. They will perform systems-level testing at their facilities in Waukesha, Wisconsin. RG&ampE assists Waukesha Electric Systems in scoping, cost, and market analysis and conceptual design of the 10-MVA and larger HTS transformers. RG&ampE also applies experience gained in substation operation to assure that the next generation transformer will meet customer expectations for performance, total owning cost, reliability, and maintainability.

The closing date for applications is February 13, 1996. Applications are invited on the following HTS-related topics: HTS Wire and Coil Research Grant applications are sought for research on innovative processes and process quality management technologies for manufacturing HTS wire that will (1) lead to manufacturing costs comparable to that of low-temperature superconducting wire (presently around $30/KAmp-meter for Nb3Sn composite conductors), or (2) improve HTS wire performance in areas such as: uniformity of long wires, current-carrying ability (above 100 A/mm2), operating temperature ability, operating magnetic field ability, flexibility, and durability. Grant applications are also sought for the development of innovative HTS coil manufacturing processes and process quality management technologies in areas such as: durability, operating magnetic field ability, and efficient alternating current operation. HTS Electrical Device Research Grant applications are sought for research on HTS electrical devices, with presently achievable HTS performance, that can improve the efficiency and economics of electrical generation, delivery, or use. These may be innovative designs for familiar electrical devices such as generators and motors, or proposed new inventions that are enabled by HTS. Grant applications for device-associated coil protection measures are also sought. Cryogenic, Superconductor, and Superconducting Magnet Technology This subtopic addresses only those cryogenic, superconductor, and superconducting magnet development technologies that support dipoles, quadrupoles, and higher order multipole corrector magnets for use in accelerators, storage rings, and charged particle beam transport systems. Grant applications on new and significantly improved cryogenic devices and systems for helium service in the temperature range 2 to 20 K are sought, e.g., development of new or significantly improved heat exchangers and rotating machinery (turboexpanders, circulating pumps, and compressors). Improved instrumentation directly applicable to the testing of superconducting magnets, including the measurement of local strain, temperature, and magnetic field, is sought. New or improved materials and related processing techniques are sought for high critical-current, high critical-field conductors to produce low stabilizer (Cu, Al) to superconductor ratio, multifilamentary wire for use in very high-field magnets (B > 8 T). Examples of property improvements include higher critical-current densities, higher critical fields, reduced degradation of these properties as a function of applied strain, and process improvements which result in equivalent performance at reduced cost. Examples of materials of interest include: niobium-titanium, niobium-tantalum-titanium, the so-called "A-15" compounds (e.g., niobium-tin), and Chevrel phase superconductors. High-temperature superconductor based current leads for application to high-field accelerator magnets are sought. Current level at 5 KA or greater is required. Stability, low heat leak, and good quench performance are also required. For more information, contact the DOE SBIR program spokesperson, Ms. Kay Etzler at 301-903-5867, sbir-sttr@oer.doe.gov.

A typical flat-platecollector is an insulated metal box with a glass or plastic coverÑcalledthe glazingÑand a dark-colored absorber plate. The glazingcan be transparent or translucent. Translucent (transmitting lightonly), low-iron glass is a common glazing material for flat-platecollectors because low-iron glass transmits a high percentageof the total available solar energy. The glazing allows the lightto strike the absorber plate but reduces the amount of heat thatcan escape. The sides and bottom of the collector are usuallyinsulated, further minimizing heat loss. The absorber plate is usually black because dark colors absorbmore solar energy than light colors. Sunlight passes through theglazing and strikes the absorber plate, which heats up, changingsolar radiation into heat energy. The heat is transferred to theair or liquid passing through the collector. Absorber plates arecommonly covered with "selective coatings," which retainthe absorbed sunlight better and are more durable than ordinaryblack paint. Absorber plates are often made of metal- usually copper or aluminum--becausethey are both good heat conductors. Copper is more expensive,but is a better conductor and is less prone to corrosion thanaluminum. Flat-plate collectors fall into two basic categories: liquid andair. And both types can be either glazed or unglazed. Liquid Collectors In a liquid collector, solar energy heats a liquid as it flowsthrough tubes in or adjacent to the absorber plate. For this typeof collector, the flow tubes are attached to the absorber plateso the heat absorbed by the absorber plate is readily conductedto the liquid. The flow tubes can be routed in parallel, using inlet and outletheaders, or in a serpentine pattern. A serpentine pattern eliminatesthe possibility of header leaks and ensures uniform flow. A serpentinepattern is not appropriate, however, for systems that must drainfor freeze protection because the curved flow passages will notdrain completely. The simplest liquid systems use potable household water, whichis heated as it passes directly through the collector and thenflows to the house to be used for bathing, laundry, etc. Thisdesign is known as an "open-loop" (or "direct")system. In areas where freezing temperatures are common, however,liquid collectors must either drain the water when the temperaturedrops or use an antifreeze type of heat-transfer fluid. In systems with heat-transfer fluids, the transfer fluid absorbsheat from the collector and then passes through a heat exchanger.The heat exchanger, which generally is in the water storage tankinside the house, transfers heat to the water. Such designs arecalled "closed-loop" (or "indirect") systems.For information on solar water-heating systems, contact EREC. Glazed liquid collectors are used for heating household waterand sometimes for space heating. Unglazed liquid collectors arecommonly used to heat water for swimming pools. Because thesecollectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can useless expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. They alsodo not require freeze-proofing because swimming pools are generallyused only in warm weather. Air Collectors Air collectors are simple, flat-plate collectors used primarilyfor space heating. The absorber plates in air collectors can bemetal sheets, layers of screen, or non-metallic materials. Theair flows past the absorber by natural convection or when forcedby a fan. Because air conducts heat much less readily than liquiddoes, less heat is transferred between the air and the absorberthan in a liquid collector. In some solar air-heating systems, fins or corrugations on theabsorber are used to increase air turbulence and improve heattransfer. The disadvantage of this strategy is that it can alsoincrease the amount of power needed for fans and, thus, increasethe costs of operating the system. In colder climates, the airis routed between the absorber plate and the back insulation toreduce heat loss through the glazing. However, if the air willnot be heated more than 30¡F (17¡C) above the outdoortemperature, the air can flow on both sides of the absorber platewithout sacrificing efficiency. Air systems have the advantage of eliminating the freezing andboiling problems associated with liquid systems. Although leaksare harder to detect and plug in an air system, they are alsoless troublesome than leaks in a liquid system. Air systems canoften use less-expensive materials, such as plastic glazing, becausetheir operating temperatures are usually lower than those of liquidcollectors. Evacuated-Tube Collectors Evacuated-tube collectors heat water in residential applicationsthat require higher temperatures. In an evacuated-tube collector,sunlight enters through the outer glass tube, strikes the absorbertube, and changes to heat. The heat is transferred to the liquidflowing through the absorber tube. The collector consists of rowsof parallel transparent glass tubes, each of which contains anabsorber tube (in place of the absorber plate in a flat-platecollector) covered with a selective coating. Evacuated-tube collectorsare modular--tubes can be added or removed as hot-water needschange. When evacuated tubes are manufactured, air is evacuated from thespace between the two tubes, forming a vacuum. Conductive andconvective heat losses are eliminated because there is no airto conduct heat or to circulate and cause convective losses. Therecan still be some radiant heat loss (heat energy will move throughspace from a warmer to a cooler surface, even across a vacuum).However, this loss is small and of little consequence comparedwith the amount of heat transferred to the liquid in the absorbertube. Evacuated-tube collectors are available in a number of designs.Some use a third glass tube inside the absorber tube or otherconfigurations of heat-transfer fins and fluid tubes. One commerciallyavailable evacuated-tube collector stores 5 gallons (19 liters)of water in each tube, eliminating the need for a separate solarstorage tank. Reflectors placed behind the evacuated tubes canhelp to focus additional sunlight on the collector. These collectors are more efficient than flat-plate collectorsfor a couple of reasons. First, they perform well in both directand diffuse solar radiation. This characteristic, combined withthe fact that the vacuum minimizes heat losses to the outdoors,makes these collectors particularly useful in areas with cold,cloudy winters. Second, because of the circular shape of the evacuatedtube, sunlight is perpendicular to the absorber for most of theday. For comparison, in a flat-plate collector that is in a fixedposition, the sun is only perpendicular to the collector at noon.While evacuated-tube collectors achieve both higher temperaturesand higher efficiencies than flat-plate collectors, they are alsomore expensive. Concentrating Collectors Concentrating collectors use mirrored surfaces to concentratethe sun's energy on an absorber called a receiver. Concentratingcollectors also achieve high temperatures, but unlike evacuated-tubecollectors, they can do so only when direct sunlight is available.The mirrored surface focuses sunlight collected over a large areaonto a smaller absorber area to achieve high temperatures. Somedesigns concentrate solar energy onto a focal point, while othersconcentrate the sunÕs rays along a thin line called thefocal line. The receiver is located at the focal point or alongthe focal line. A heat-transfer fluid flows through the receiverand absorbs heat. These collectors reach much higher temperatures than flat-platecollectors. However, concentrators can only focus direct solarradiation, with the result being that their performance is pooron hazy or cloudy days. Concentrators are most practical in areasof high insolation (exposure to the sunÕs rays), such asthose close to the equator and in the desert southwest UnitedStates. Concentrators perform best when pointed directly at the sun. Todo this, these systems use tracking mechanisms to move the collectorsduring the day to keep them focused on the sun. Single-axis trackersmove east to west; dual-axis trackers move east and west and northand south (to follow the sun throughout the year). In additionto these mechanical trackers, there are passive trackers thatuse freon to supply the movement. While not widely used, theydo provide a low-maintenance alternative to mechanical systems. Concentrators are used mostly in commercial applications becausethey are expensive and because the trackers need frequent maintenance.Some residential solar energy systems use parabolic-trough concentratingsystems. These installations can provide hot water, space heating,and water purification. Most residential systems use single-axistrackers, which are less expensive and simpler than dual-axistrackers. Technological Improvements The efficiency of solar heating systems and collectors has improvedfrom the early 1970s and costs have dropped somewhat. The efficienciescan be attributed to the use of low-iron, tempered glass for glazing(low-iron glass allows the transmission of more solar energy thanconventional glass), improved insulation, and the developmentof durable selective coatings. Also, a new solar air collector, formerly used primarily for commercialbuildings, is now available for homes. Called a transpired collector,it eliminates the cost of the glazing, the metal box, and theinsulation. This collector is made of black, perforated metal.The sun heats the metal, and a fan pulls air through the holesin the metal, which heats the air. For residential installations,these collectors are available in 8-foot by 2.5-foot (2.4-meterby 0.8-meter) panels capable of heating 40 cubic feet per minute(0.002 cubic meters per second) of outside air. On a sunny winterday, the panel can produce temperatures up to 50¡F (28¡C)higher than the outdoor air temperature. Transpired air collectorsnot only heat air, but also improve indoor air quality by directlypreheating fresh outdoor air. These collectors have achieved very high efficiencies--more than70% in some commercial applications. Plus, because the collectorsrequire no glazing or insulation, they are inexpensive to manufacture.All these factors make transpired air collectors a very cost-effectivesource of solar heat. There are other prototype cooling systems operating today. Someuse heat from solar collectors for absorption cooling. Othersare being used to renew the desiccant material in desiccant coolingsystems. Desiccants, such as silica gel, naturally attract moisture.They are used to reduce humidity and the resulting cooling loadsin hot, humid climates. Collector Performance Ratings When you are shopping for solar collectors, you can compare theirperformance. Look for a Solar Rating & Certification Corporation(SRCC) or Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) sticker on the equipmentyou are considering to check their comparative performance ratings.For more information on SRCCÕs or FSECÕs performancestandards, contact EREC. A Bright Future Solar collectors can be used for nearly any process that requiresheat. As environmental laws become stricter and the price of conventionalpower increases, it is likely that solar collectors will be integratedinto many applications. Low-Tech Solar Collectors Several inexpensive, "low-tech" solar collectors withspecific functions are also available commercially. Batch heatersare simple, effective solar water heaters; solar box cookers areused for cooking and for purifying water; and solar stills produceinexpensive distilled water from virtually any water source. Batch heaters, also known as ÒbreadboxÓ or integratedcollector systems, use one or more black tanks filled with waterand placed in an insulated, glazed box. Some boxes include reflectorsto increase the solar radiation. Solar energy passes through theglazing and heats the water in the tanks. These devices are inexpensivesolar water heaters but must be drained or protected from freezingwhen temperatures drop below freezing. A batch heater is a simple solar water heater that uses one ormore black tanks filled with water and placed in an insulated,glazed box. Solar box cookers are inexpensive to buy and easy to build anduse. They consist of a roomy, insulated box lined with reflectivematerial, covered with glazing, and fitted with an external reflector.Black cooking pots serve as absorbers, heating up more quicklythan shiny aluminum or stainless steel cookware. Box cookers canalso be used to kill bacteria in water if the temperature canreach the boiling point. Solar stills provide inexpensive distilled water from even saltyor badly contaminated water. They work on the principle that waterin an open container will evaporate. A solar still uses solarenergy to speed up the evaporation process. The stills consistof an insulated, dark-colored container covered with glazing thatis tilted so the condensing fresh water can trickle into a collectiontrough. A small solar still, which is about the size of your kitchenstove, can produce two gallons of distilled water on a sunny day.

Additional applications are being sought to take advantageof the remarkable power superconductivity holds. The future of science lies in interesting young people in exploringthe yet unexplained. As teachers we must compete with the "television"generation and present interesting new concepts in the classroom.Superconductivity and cryogenics may not be commonly exploredin the middle school/junior high curriculum. This booklet presentsyou with some basic information to supplement the material presentedin the accompanying video tape. The activities are designed forgroups of one to four students. If small groups are difficultto organize in your situation, they can also be used for classpresentation. I hope that you find information that is useful in the classroomand the laboratory. Many of the questions proposed to the studentare open-ended and may result in a variety of answers. If theinformation provided challenges the student to ask why, then superconductivityand cryogenics can open a new generation to one of the wondersof science. Note: As with many materials used in science classes, usingliquid nitrogen has some inherent dangers. You should read thesection on handling and storing liquid nitrogen carefully andexperiment with it before distributing it to students. You mayalso want to consider its dangers before organizing groups. An excellent booklet "A Teacher's Guide to Superconductivityfor High School Students" was written by Robert W. Dull andH. Richard Kerchner. It provides a more in-depth look at superconductivityand has an excellent reference section and glossary.

Nitrogen makes up about 79% of the air we breathe.Liquid nitrogen is very common and easy to obtain, if you knowwhere to look. It is used by hospitals, doctors, universities,factories, welding shops, and cattle breeders. To obtain liquid nitrogen, look in the yellow pages under LiquidAir or Gas- Industrial, Medical, etc. You may also be able toobtain it from a hospital, dermatologist, welding shop, or clinic.Liquid nitrogen usually costs less than $1 per liter, even insmall quantities. A supplier may have a minimum charge of $10or so for a small quantity because of the loss due to boil-offwhen filling a small container. You may notice large trucks transporting liquid nitrogen on thehighways. Industries that use large amounts of liquid nitrogenmay have their own compressors, liquefiers, and dewars that holdseveral hundred liters of liquid nitrogen. A dewar is a speciallyinsulated container for storing very cold liquids. It is similarto a vacuum-insulated glass thermos bottle. Large dewars may keepliquid nitrogen for several months. Doctors offices' commonlystore liquid nitrogen in 10-20 liter dewars that hold liquid nitrogenfor up to a month before it boils away. You can use a common thermos bottle to store liquid nitrogenfor 24-48 hours but only with a vented or partially-sealedlid. Insulated plastic containers may crack due to thermalshock. They can even explode into many small projectiles of frozenplastic. When first observing liquid nitrogen, you may notice that it seemsto be boiling. Since our common experiences tell us that boilingliquids must be hot, we may assume that it is hot also. The firstobservation is indeed true, the liquid nitrogen is boiling. However,it is not hot, it is extremely cold. Its boiling point is 77 K(- 321°:F). Because liquid nitrogen is boiling and is extremelycold, we must use special precautions when handling and storingliquid nitrogen. Teacher's Guide to Handling and Storing Liquid Nitrogen This section contains background information about safety andstorage of liquid nitrogen. It contains more detailed informationthan the student section on safety. This is not intended as acomprehensive guide but will provide you with a reasonable amountof information about the dangers of liquid nitrogen. Transporting Liquid Nitrogen Safety Rule 1: Avoid transporting liquid nitrogen in the passengercompartment of the car, if possible. Rationale: There is no inherent danger in using the passengercompartment. However, if the liquid spills, several things couldhappen: 1. It could spill in the seat and freeze your skin through yourclothes. 2. It could freeze and crack the seat, carpet, and other partsof the car (especially plastic parts). 3. It could reach your feet and freeze your shoes and/or skin. 4. The "fog" from a large spill could obscure your vision. 5. If the driver attempts to upright a spilled container, an accidentcould result from inattention to driving. 6. The pure nitrogen gas in a closed passenger compartment couldresult in a serious oxygen deficiency, even asphyxiation. Solution: Transport the liquid in the trunk of your caraway from materials it could damage if spilled. Safety Rule 2: Use some method to keep the liquid nitrogenfrom spilling when transporting it. Rationale: See Rule #1 for damage that can be caused. Solution: Store the dewar or thermos in a box that cannotbe easily tipped over. Pack around the dewar or thermos with paperor other material to keep it from tipping over. Be sure to usesome material that will not be damaged if the liquid nitrogenshould spill or slosh out. Storing Liquid Nitrogen Safety Rule #1: Never store liquid nitrogen in a closed container. Rationale: When the liquid is boiling, it is giving offnitrogen gas and can develop extremely high pressures in a closedcontainer. The container will develop enough pressure to explode! Solution: Be sure the dewar or thermos bottle is properlyvented. You can vent an ordinary thermos by drilling a 3/16"to 1/4" hold in the lid and cap. A stopper made from polyurethanefoam can also be used as a temporary stopper. This foam is porousand will allow the gas to escape but will help prevent loss iftipped over. If the foam becomes saturated with liquid nitrogen,handle it with gloves until it has all drained or evaporated. Safety Rule #2: Never store liquid nitrogen in an open containerfor a long period of time. Rationale: Nitrogen has a lower boiling point than oxygen.If air can get into the container easily, the nitrogen can coolthe air and liquid oxygen could accumulate in the bottom of thecontainer. Before long you could be pouring oxygen from the container.Oxygen is a key component required for combustion, and pure oxygencan make a piece of wood burn explosively. Solution: Use a container with only a small opening toallow the nitrogen gas to escape or one with a gas-penetrablepolyurethane stopper. You may also use a rubber stopper with onehole in it. Safety Rule #3: Never use liquid nitrogen in a tightly-closedroom. Rationale: The liquid nitrogen could cause oxygen deprivationif used for a long period of time in a tightly-closed room. Aspill of 30 liters quickly expands (by a factor of 7/0) to 750cubic feet. Solution: Use only with adequate ventilation. Handling Liquid Nitrogen Safety Rule#1: Read and understand all safety rulesbefore using liquid nitrogen. Rationale: Frostbite will occur when liquid nitrogen contactsany part of the body. The longer the contact, the deeperthe damage due to frostbite. Safety Rule #2: Wear safety glasses or safety goggles at alltimes when using liquid nitrogen. Rationale: Liquid nitrogen could quickly damage the eyesand eyelids. Safety Rule #3: Wear appropriate clothing when using liquidnitrogen. Rationale: Liquid nitrogen and the very cold objects incontact with it must be kept from prolonged contact with the skin.If spilled, it can accumulate in the folds of clothes, shirt tails,shoes, and even some gloves. Solution: Wear a lab coat when using liquid nitrogen. Longpants can help control lap spills but standing up when using liquidnitrogen is an even better idea. Safety Rule#4: Avoid all skin contact with liquid nitrogen. Rationale: The liquid nitrogen and objects cooled in itcan cause frostbite. Solution: Never touch the liquid nitrogen or reach in itto retrieve objects. Gloves should be used when handling objectsthat have been removed from the liquid nitrogen. The gloves should: 1. Not absorb the liquid easily. 2. Be easy to remove quickly in case some liquid nitrogen is spilledinto the glove. 3. Never be immersed in the liquid nitrogen-use plastic tweezersor forceps to retrieve objects from the liquid. Steel forcepsare useful for handling heavier objects. Safety Rule #5: Use care not to drop or cause sudden shockto materials cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures. Rationale: Objects cooled to liquid nitrogen temperaturescan become brittle. They may shatter and send pieces of materialflying or stick to your skin if touched. Avoid common glass andplastic. Remember that if a material shatters like glass, it mayalso cut like glass. Solution: Allow any material removed from the liquid nitrogento warm to room temperature before handling. Safety Rule #6: Any material cooled in liquid nitrogen should be allowed to warm to room temperature before touching it. Rationale: Materials, especially metal, will stay verycold for a long time when removed from the liquid nitrogen. Ifyou touch the material with bare skin, you could easily get frostbite. Solution: Allow materials to warm to room temperature or use gloves, plastic tweezers, or plastic forceps when handlingthem. Safety Rule #7: Always have a plan for what the students can or should do should you leave the room.

When a magnet is placed on a superconductor which is in itssuperconducting state, it will . A. freeze to it B. fall off C. levitate above it D. break into many pieces Temperature Scales You may remember from one of your science classes that matterexists in three states-solid, liquid, and gas. A fourth state-plasma,has also been discovered and is being studied. With most materialsthe temperature determines the material's state. For example,if water is below 32°F., it is ice- a solid; above 212°:F. andit changes to steam-a gas; and of course at room temperature it'sa liquid. One thing we commonly do is heat water until it begins to boilwhich produces steam. Let's think of the opposite for a minute.How could we change steam to liquid? Cool it, of course. Air conditionersoften drip water out the bottom-water that has been condensed(changed from a gas to a liquid) by the cold coils of the airconditioner. To do an experiment we can capture some of the steamin a closed container (being careful not to burn ourselves) andwait for it to cool to room temperature. Or we could put the containerin contact with some ice cubes or into refrigerator to speed theprocess. If we put the water in the freezer, it would change to ice. Oneimportant thing to remember here is that at room temperature,the water will not burn or freeze us. However, if the water isvery hot (steam) or very cold (ice) it can damage our skin. Weare going to work with liquid nitrogen which is extremely cold.Even though it may look like water, it can damage our skin severelyin a short period of time. Before we experiment with liquid nitrogen and some very cold items,let's see how we represent these temperatures. Unfortunately,extremely cold temperatures cannot be measured with a common thermometerbecause it could easily freeze and even break! Instead, thesevery cold temperatures are measured with electronic devices. The gases in the air we breathe-oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide,etc. must be made very cold in order for them to change from gasesto liquids. If only the Fahrenheit scale of temperature was available,scientists would have to use large negative numbers to talk aboutthese temperatures. They would use -460°F. to represent absolutezero-the coldest temperature we can imagine. Absolute zero isthe temperature where atoms lose all of their energy. Instead of Fahrenheit, scientists use the Kelvin scale. 0° Kelvinis absolute zero and water freezes at 273°:K. The room you aresitting in may be about 300°K. The drawing on the following pagecompares the three standard temperature scales-Fahrenheit, Celsius,and Kelvin. No one has ever been able to cool a material to absolute zeroto see what happens. However, liquid nitrogen (77°K.) and liquidhelium (4.2°K.) have several common uses in medicine and science. About Liquid Nitrogen You are going to be using liquid nitrogen in your study of cryogenicsand superconductivity. Nitrogen makes up about 79% of the airwe breath. If ordinary air is cooled to 77° Kelvin, the nitrogenwill turn to a liquid. Liquid nitrogen is used by hospitals, doctors, welding shops,and many other industries. It is even used to do minor surgeryon the skin. It can be very dangerous if not handled properly. Be sure youunderstand all safety rules before using liquid nitrogen. When you see liquid nitrogen, it is actually boiling the sameway water boils. It just boils at a very cold temperature. Justlike boiling water, it can quickly damage the skin. However, itfreezes the skin instead of burning it. Safety Safety Rule #1: Read and understand all safety rulesbefore using liquid nitrogen. Safety Rule #2: Wear safety glasses or safety goggles at alltimes when using liquid nitrogen. Reason: Liquid nitrogen could quickly and permanently damagethe eyes and eyelids. Safety Rule #3: Wear appropriate clothing when using liquidnitrogen. Reason: Liquid nitrogen and the very cold objects it producesmust be kept from prolonged contact with the skin. If spilled,it can accumulate in the folds of clothes, shirt tails, shoes,and even some gloves. Solution: Wear a lab coat when using liquid nitrogen. Standwhen doing experiments. Safety Rule #4: Avoid all skin contact with liquid nitrogen. Reason: The liquid nitrogen and objects cooled in it cancause frostbite. Solution: Never touch the liquid nitrogen or reach in itto retrieve objects. Gloves should be used when handling objectsthat have been removed from the liquid nitrogen. The gloves should: 1. Not absorb the liquid easily. 2. Be easy to remove quickly in case some liquid nitrogen is spilledinto the glove. 3. Never be immersed in the liquid nitrogen-use plastic tweezersor plastic forceps to retrieve objects from the liquid. Steelforceps are useful for handling heavier objects. Safety Rule #5: Use care not to drop objects still cold fromthe liquid nitrogen. Reason: Objects cooled to liquid nitrogen temperaturescan become brittle. They may shatter and send pieces of materialflying. Safety Rule #6: Any material cooled in liquid nitrogen should be allowed to warm to room temperature before handling. Reason: Materials, especially metal, will stay very coldfor a long time when removed from the liquid nitrogen. If youtouch the material with bare skin, they could stick to your skinor freeze your skin. Solution: Allow materials to warm to room temperature oruse gloves, plastic tweezers, or plastic forceps when handlingthem. Safety Rule Summary 1. Read and understand all safety rules before using liquid nitrogen. 2. Wear safety glasses or safety goggles at all times when using liquid nitrogen. 3. Wear appropriate clothing when using liquid nitrogen. 4. Avoid all skin contact with liquid nitrogen. 5. Use care not to drop objects still cold from the liquid nitrogen. 6. Any material cooled in liquid nitrogen should be allowed towarm to room temperature before handling. Activity 1: Cryogenics and Common Materials Cryogenics is a branch of science that explores production andeffects of very cold materials. We know that many plastics andrubber will crack and break at very cold temperatures. The firstfew activities we will do are designed to help you see what happenswhen common materials are cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature,77° K. Materials needed: Liquid nitrogen Balloons Rubber bands A small flower (if available) Coil of solder Plastic (NOT metal) tweezers Gloves Safety glasses Styrofoam cup **SAFETY** You are going to be using liquid nitrogen and handling somevery cold materials. read and understand all safety procedurescarefully and get your teachers permission before beginning. Procedure 1 1. Carefully fill the Styrofoam cup with liquid nitrogen. 2. Place one of the rubber bands in the liquid nitrogen. Noticethat the nitrogen will boil rapidly for a few seconds until therubber band has cooled completely. When the rubber band is cold,the rapid boiling will slow down. 3. Using the plastic tweezers, remove the rubber band and immediatelytry to bend or stretch it. If you allow the rubber band to warmfor more than a few seconds, the experiment will not work properly. 4. Insert a small flower in the liquid nitrogen and try squeezingit when removed (be sure to use gloves). 5. Answer the questions on Worksheet #1. Many materials, including rubber and most plastics, become verybrittle when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. You can easilybreak them while they are still cold. You may want to try similarexperiments with other materials. If you use a material that canabsorb the liquid nitrogen, handle it in such a way that the liquidcan drain onto a safe surface, not on you or your clothes. Procedure 2 1. This experiment works best in a flat container about 3"by 5" and about an inch deep. It can also be done in a Styrofoamcup if performed carefully. 2. Inflate a common balloon until it is about 6"-8"in diameter (smaller if using a cup). 3. Start by immersing one side of the balloon into the liquid.The balloon should start to shrink. Leave the balloon in the liquidlong enough that the balloon shrinks up completely. 4. Once the balloon has totally shrunk, remove it from the liquidand lay it on the table. As it warms, it should reinflate to normalsize. Sometimes the balloon may crack, split or pop. 5. Try the same procedure with a helium filled balloon. 6. Answer the questions on Worksheet #1. Procedure 3 1. Get a piece of solder and roll it into a coil about 2"in diameter. Test the coil to see how soft it is and tends tostay any shape into which it is bent. 2. Carefully fill a Styrofoam cup with liquid nitrogen. 3. Bend one end of the solder up so that you have about 2"to hold to. 4. Immerse the solder in the liquid and wait for the rapid boilingof the liquid to slow down. 5. Remove the solder and quickly test it again. It should actlike a spring and tend to return to its original shape when stretchedor compressed. 6. Answer the questions on Worksheet #1. Worksheet #1 Procedure 1 1. What happened to the cold rubber band when you tried to bendor stretch it? 2. What happened to the flower? Procedure 2 3. Why do you think the balloon deflated? 4. Where did the air inside the balloon go? 5. When the balloon was deflated you may have noticed some liquidinside the balloon. What do you think the liquid was? 6. What happened to the helium-filled balloon? Why? Procedure 3 7. Describe how the solder changed when cooled. Activity 2: Resistance, Levitation, and Superconductivity Procedure 1 Watch the videotape about superconductivity and answer the questionson Worksheet # 2. Procedure 2: Resistance Measurements This procedure is to familiarize you with how to use an ohm meterand what happens to some materials when they are cooled. Materials needed: Volt-ohm meter (multimeter) Common carbon resistors (3 or 4) Bottom portion of regular Styrofoam cup Liquid nitrogen Safety glasses Coil of copper wire (choke) 1. Turn the volt-ohm meter on and set it to read ohms (ask your teacher if you need help). 2. Connect the probes to the correct terminals. 3. Connect one probe to one end of the carbon resistor. 4. Connect the other probe to the other end of the resistor. 5. Read the resistance and write it down (you may need assistanceif you have an analog, not digital, ohm meter). 6. Read the resistances of the other resistors in a similar mannerand write them down. 7. Read the resistance of the coil of wire in a similar manner and write it down. 8. Carefully fill the Styrofoam cup with about 1" of liquid nitrogen. 9. Connect the ends of the coil to the probes on the ohm meter. 10. Note and record the resistance of the coil on Worksheet #2. 11. Slowly lower the coil into the liquid; the liquid will boil vigorously. 12. When the vigorous boil stops, note and record the ohm meter reading on Worksheet #2. 13. Measure and record the resistances for the carbon resistorsin the liquid nitrogen on Worksheet #2. Procedure 3: Current flow in a wire (OPTIONAL) This procedure demonstrates two things that happen when currentflows through a wire: (1) a magnetic field is created and (2)resistance causes heat. It's also valuable to understand thatif current flowing through a wire can produce heat, it can alsocreate a fire if a wire's capacity is exceeded. Materials needed: 2 C batteries and holder 3 volt light bulb with holder Connecting wires Compass 9-volt battery Tester that comes with some 9-volt batteries 1. Connect the wires, battery, and light bulb so that the bulbglows. 2. With the bulb glowing, slowly move the compass toward the wire. 3. Note what happens to the hand on the compass. 4. Disconnect one wire and lay the wire parallel and directlyparallel to the compass needle . 5. Connect and disconnect the wire and note what happens. 6. Try switching the connections on the battery and see what happensto the compass needle. 7. Use the 9-volt tester to test the 9-volt battery and feel theflat wires on the back of the tester. 8. Record the results on Worksheet #2. Procedure 4: Levitation The videotape and Procedure 3 demonstrated that current flowingthrough a wire produces a magnetic field. We are now going toshow that a superconducting material is capable of repelling amagnetic field. The reduced supercurrent in a superconductor createsan internal magnetic field exactly opposite of the field of asmall magnet placed close to it. You already know that if you place the North end of a magnet closeto the North end of another magnet, they will repel. The samething happens in a superconducting material. If the magnet isplaced on the superconductor, it will levitate above the material.This phenomenon is being explored as a way to produce bearingsfor motors that have almost no drag (resistance to moving). Materials needed: Superconducting disk or ring Small neodymium-iron-boron (or other strong) magnet Liquid nitrogen Styrofoam cup bottom Non-magnetic tweezers NOTE: A disk or ring of superconducting material may beused for this activity, either should work. 1. Place the superconducting disk in the bottom of the Styrofoamcup. 2. Place a small, strong magnet on the disk. 3. Gently pour some liquid nitrogen around the disk or ring. 4. When the disk gets cold and begins to look wet, the magnetshould raise itself above the disk and stay there. 5. Try slipping a thin sheet of paper between the disk and themagnet to see if the magnet is levitating. 6. If the magnet is strong enough and the disk is cooled to liquidnitrogen, the magnet should levitate. 7. After the magnet begins to levitate, gently remove it fromabove the disk with tweezers. 8. Allow the disk to return to room temperature. 9. Cool the disk without the magnet on it. 10. Place the magnet onto the superconducting disk and answerthe questions on Worksheet #2. Procedure 5: Superconductor switch (OPTIONAL) This procedure is designed to show how resistance is greatly reducedwhen a coil of superconducting material is cooled to liquid nitrogentemperature. Materials needed: 2 C batteries with holder 3 volt light bulb with holder Superconducting coil with attached leads (see Appendix A for source) Wires to connect these together Liquid nitrogen Styrofoam cup 1. Connect superconductor, light bulb, and battery. 2. When the superconductor is at room temperature, the resistanceshould be high enough to prevent the bulb from lighting. 3. Fill the cup with about 1- 2 inches of liquid nitrogen. 4. Place the coil in the liquid nitrogen and observe that thelight bulb will glow brightly when the resistance drops in thesuperconductor. 5. Remove the coil and the bulb should begin to dim as it warmsto room temperature. NOTE: This demonstration requires low-resistance contactson the superconducting coil. If the switch fails to operate, itmay be due to poor contact between the coil and its leads. Worksheet #2 Procedure 1 1. What is the most common use of superconductors today? 2.

Superconductivity is capturing the imagination of the world. Transmission lines that carry power without resistance, medicaldiagnostic tools that eliminate the need for surgery, "levitating"trains that speed along the tracks—these are not visions of thefuture, but examples of what superconductors are doing today. Superconductors conduct electricity without losing energy toelectrical resistance, as most conductors do. Certain materialsbecome superconductors when they are cooled to very lowtemperatures. Low-temperature superconductors exhibitsuperconductivity at temperatures near 0 Kelvin (K) (or -273o Celsius [C]). Recently discovered high-temperaturesuperconductors (HTS) can function at temperatures as high as 140 K (-133oC). This is an exciting discovery because these high-temperature superconductors can be cooled more economically andefficiently than can low-temperature superconductors. Superconductors also repel surrounding magnetic fields. Thisphenomenon is demonstrated when we levitate a magnet above acooled superconductor, and it is the force at work in Japan'sfamous Maglev train. Superconductors help us use energy more efficiently and reducethe cost of electricity production, storage, transmission, anduse, and the costs of transportation and medical equipment. Some current uses,and some that hold the most promise for the near future, arethese: Transmission cables that carry current without energylosses will increase the capacity of the transmissionsystem, saving money, space, and energy. Prototypetransmission cables are currently being developed by teamsled by Pirelli Cable Company and Southwire Company. Motors made with superconducting wire will be smaller andmore efficient. A 400-horsepower motor is being developed byan SPI team led by Reliance Electric Company. Generators will use superconducting wire in place of ironmagnets, making them smallerand lighter. New generators also may get more power fromless fuel. An SPI team led by General Electric is developinga 100-megavolt-ampere generator. Fault-current limiters help utilities deliver reliablepower to their customers. HTS fault-current limiters detect abnormally high currentin the utility grid (caused by lightning strikes or downedutility poles, for example). They then reduce the faultcurrent so the system equipment can handle it. An SPI teamled by Lockheed Martin recently produced a successful HTSfault-current limiter that will soon be ready to market. Energy storage in both flywheels and superconducting magnetic energy storage systems will ensure the quality andreliability of the power transmitted to utility customers.In addition, energy storage provides utilities with costsavings by allowing them to store energy when the demand forelectricity is low and generating the power is cheap.This stored energy is then dispensed when demand is high andpower production is more expensive. Cellular phone base stations will use HTS filters. Somepeople predict that this will be one of the most significantearly markets for HTS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines enhance medicaldiagnostics by imaging internal organs—often eliminatingthe need for invasive surgeries. MRIs, which currently are made with low-temperature superconductors, will be smaller and less expensive when made with HTS. Maglev trains seem to float on air as a result of usingsuperconducting magnets. These trains have been underdevelopment in Japan for two decades; the newest prototypemay exceed 547 kilometers (340 miles) per hour. These are only a few of the many possible uses forsuperconductors. Research and development of HTS may still yieldmany more uses for materials that can carry electricity withoutresistance. And as today's new technologies move into themarketplace, they will have a great effect on the way we generate, deliver, and use electricity, and on the medical and transportationtechnologies of tomorrow.

Light affects our health, safety, morale,comfort, and productivity. Lighting also directly affects our economy. As a nation, we spendabout one-quarter of our electricity budget on lighting, or morethan $37 billion annually. Yet much of this expense is unnecessary.Technologies developed during the past 10 years can help us cutlighting costs 30% to 60% while enhancing lighting quality andreducing environmental impacts. This publication is an introduction to lighting technology anddiscusses how you can save energy while maintaining good lightquality and quantity. Specifically, you will learn about: Lighting principles and definitions Types of lighting and how each works Energy-efficient lighting options, including daylighting,for new or retrofit applications. Lighting Principles and Terms To choose the best lighting options, you should understand basiclighting terms. This section explains terminology used in theindustry, which will help you better understand the potentiallyconfusing language you could hear in a lighting store. Illumination A lumen is a measurement of light output from a lamp, often calleda tube or a bulb. All lamps are rated in lumens. For example,a 100-watt incandescent lamp produces about 1750 lumens. The distribution of light on a horizontal surface is called itsillumination. Illumination is measured in footcandles. A footcandleof illumination is a lumen of light distributed over a 1-square-foot(0.09-square-meter) area. The amount of illumination required varies according to the difficultyof a visual task. Ideal illumination is the minimum footcandlesnecessary to allow you to perform a task comfortably and proficientlywithout eyestrain. The Illuminating Engineering Society saysthat illumination of 30 to 50 footcandles is adequate for mosthome and office work. Difficult and lengthy visual tasks--likesewing for extended periods of time--require 200 to 500 footcandles.Where no seeing tasks (i.e., tasks whose speed and accuracy ofcompletion are affected by quality and quantity of light) areperformed, lighting systems need to provide only security, safety,or visual comfortÑrequiring from 5 to 20 footcandles ofillumination. Another lighting term you will hear is efficacy. This is the ratioof light output from a lamp to the electric power it consumesand is measured in lumens per watt (LPW). Lighting Uses Experts divide lighting uses into three categories: ambient, task,and accent lighting. Ambient lighting provides security and safety,as well as general illumination for performing daily activities.The goal of task lighting is to provide enough illumination sothat tasks can be completed accurately but not provide so muchlight that entire areas are illuminated. Accent lighting illuminateswalls so they blend more closely with naturally bright areas likeceilings and windows. Light Quality Light quality describes how well people in a lighted space cansee to do visual tasks and how visually comfortable they feelin that space. Light quality is important to energy efficiencybecause spaces with higher quality lighting need less illumination.High-quality lighting is fairly uniform in brightness and hasno glare. For example, direct intense sunlight streaming through the windowsof a room with chocolate brown carpets and dark wall panelingwill likely give too much contrast in brightness. The pupils ofyour eyes will constantly adjust to the differing brightnesses.Making this area visually comfortable would involve using lotsof artificial lighting with a high illumination level. On the other hand, in a pale-colored room bathed in soft light,you can hardly tell where the light is coming from because noone area of the room appears much brighter than another. The walls,ceiling, floor, and work surfaces are relatively the same lighthue. People can perform tasks faster and with fewer mistakes withthis type of high-quality lighting. Also, lighting such a roomrequires far less artificial lighting than the previous example. Glare Eliminating glare (i.e., excessive brightness from a direct lightsource) is essential to achieving good lighting quality. Typesof glare include direct glare, reflected glare, and veiling reflections. Direct glare results from strong light from windows or brightlamps shining directly into your eyes. Reflected glare is causedby strong light from windows or lamps that is reflected off ashiny surface into your eyes. Veiling reflection is a specialtype of reflected glare that can obscure contrasts and reducetask clarity. Veiling reflections occur when light is reflectedinto your eyes from a work surface, such as a printed page ora computer screen. Light Color and Color Rendering Lamps are assigned a color temperature (according to the Kelvintemperature scale) based on their "coolness" or "warmness."The human eye perceives colors as cool if they are at the blue-greenend of the color spectrum, and warm if they are at the red endof the spectrum. Cool light is preferred for visual tasks because it produces highercontrast than warm light. Contrast is the brightness differencebetween different parts of the visual field, which is the expanseof space you can see at a given instant without moving your eyes.Warm light is preferred for living spaces because it is more flatteringto skin tones and clothing. Keep in mind, though, that artificial light sources vary widelyin their color rendering indexes (CRI). The CRI is a measurementof a light source's ability to render colors the same as sunlightdoes. For example, incandescent lamps are rated at a CRI of 100Ñnearlyequal to sunlightÑwhile some high-pressure sodium lampshave a CRI of 22, which means they render colors very poorly. However, a light's color-rendering ability is not related to whetherit is a cool or warm color. For example, blue light from the northernsky, white light at noon, and red light from a sunset all haveperfect color rendering (a CRI of 100) because our eyes are designedto read the colors of objects illuminated by sunlight. Types of Lighting There are four basic types of lighting: incandescent, fluorescent,high-intensity discharge, and low-pressure sodium. Incandescent lighting is the most common type of lighting usedin residences. Fluorescent lighting is used primarily in commercialindoor lighting systems, while high-intensity discharge lightingis used only for outdoor lighting applications. Low-pressure sodiumlighting is used where color rendering is not important, suchas highway and security lighting. These lighting types vary widelyin their construction, efficiency, color characteristics, andlamp life. Incandescent Incandescent lamps are the least expensive to buy but the mostexpensive to operate. Incandescent light is produced by a tinycoil of tungsten wire that glows when it is heated by an electricalcurrent. Incandescent lamps have the shortest lives of the common lightingtypes. They are also relatively inefficient compared with otherlighting types. However, significant energy and cost savings arepossible if you select the right incandescent lamp for the rightjob. The three most common types of incandescent lights are standardincandescent, tungsten halogen, and reflector lamps. Standard incandescent Known as the "A-type light bulb," these lamps are themost common yet the most inefficient light source available.Larger wattage bulbs have a higher efficacy than smaller wattagebulbs. Note that a larger wattage lamp or bulb may not be themost energy- or cost-effective option, depending on how much lightis needed. "Long- life" bulbs, with thicker filaments,are a variation of these A-type bulbs. Although long-life bulbslast longer than their regular counterparts, they are less energyefficient. Tungsten halogen This newer type of incandescent lighting achieves better energyefficiency than do standard A-type bulbs. It has a gas fillingand an inner coating that reflect heat. Together, the fillingand coating recycle heat to keep the filament hot with less electricity.These lamps are considerably more expensive than standard incandescentsand are primarily used in commercial applications: theater, store,and outdoor lighting systems. Reflector lamps Reflector lamps (Type R) are designed to spread light over specificareas. They are used mainly indoors for stage/theater and storeapplications, as well as floodlighting, spotlighting, and downlighting. Parabolic aluminized reflectors (Type PAR) are used for outdoorfloodlighting. The ellipsoidal reflector (Type ER) focuses thelight beam about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in front of its enclosureand is designed to project light down from recessed fixtures.Ellipsoidal reflectors are twice as energy efficient as parabolicreflectors for recessed fixtures. Fluorescent The light produced by a fluorescent tube is caused by an electriccurrent conducted through mercury and inert gases. Fluorescentlighting is used mainly indoorsÑboth for ambient and tasklightingÑand is about 3 to 4 times as efficient as incandescentlighting. Fluorescent lamps last about 10 times longer than incandescents.But, to gain the most efficiency, you should install fluorescentsin places where they will be on for several hours at a time. Fluorescent lights need ballasts (i.e., devices that control theelectricity used by the unit) for starting and circuit protection.Ballasts consume energy. You can increase the energy savings forexisting fluorescent lighting by relamping (e.g., replacing anexisting lamp with one of a lower wattage), replacing ballasts,and replacing fixtures with more efficient models. Tube fluorescent These lamps are the next most popular lamps after A-type incandescentlamps. The two most common types are 40-watt, 4-foot (1.2-meter)lamps and 75-watt, 8-foot (2.4-meter) lamps. Tubular fluorescentfixtures and lamps are preferred for ambient lighting in largeindoor areas because their low brightness creates less directglare than do incandescent bulbs. Compact fluorescent Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are the most significant lightingadvance developed for homes in recent years. They combine theefficiency of fluorescent lighting with the convenience and popularityof incandescent fixtures. CFLs can replace incandescents thatare roughly 3 to 4 times their wattage, saving up to 75% of theinitial lighting energy. Although CFLs cost from 10 to 20 timesmore than comparable incandescent bulbs, they last 10 to 15 timesas long. This energy savings and superior longevity make CFLs one of the best energy efficiency investments available. When introduced in the early- to mid-1980s, CFLs were bulky, heavy,and too big for many incandescent fixtures. However, newer modelswith lighter electronic ballasts are only slightly larger thanthe incandescent lamps they replace. CFLs come in integral and modular designs. Integral CFLs havea ballast and a lamp in a single disposable unit. Modular designsfeature a separate ballast that serves about five lamp replacementsbefore it wears out. High-Intensity Discharge High-intensity discharge (HID) lamps provide the highest efficacyand longest service life of any lighting type. They are commonlyused for outdoor lighting and in large indoor arenas. HID lamps use an electric arc to produce intense light. They alsorequire ballasts, and they take a few seconds to produce lightwhen first turned on because the ballast needs time to establishthe electric arc. The three most common types of HID lamps are mercury vapor, metalhalide, and high-pressure sodium. HID lamps and fixtures can save75% to 90% of lighting energy when they replace incandescentlamps and fixtures. Significant energy savings are also possibleby replacing old mercury vapor lamps with newer metal halide orhigh-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury vapor-the oldest type of HID lightingÑis used primarilyfor street lighting. Mercury vapor lamps provide about 50 lumensper watt. They cast a very cool blue/green white light. Most indoormercury vapor lighting in arenas and gymnasiums has been replacedby metal halide lighting, which has better color rendering andefficiency. Metal halide lamps are similar in construction and appearanceto mercury vapor lamps. The addition of metal halide gases tomercury gas within the lamp results in higher light output, morelumens per watt, and better color rendition than from mercurygas alone. Metal halide lamps are used to light large indoor areassuch as gymnasiums and sports arenas, and for outdoor areas suchas car lots or anywhere that color rendition is important. High-pressure sodium lighting is becoming the most common typeof outdoor lighting. It provides 90 to 150 lumens per wattÑanefficiency exceeded only by low-pressure sodium lighting. High-pressuresodium lamps are also reliable and have long service lives. Theircolor is a warm white, and their color rendition ranges from poorto fairly good depending on design and intended use. Low-Pressure Sodium Low-pressure sodium lamps work somewhat like fluorescent lamps.They are the most efficient artificial lighting, have the longestservice life, and maintain their light output better than anyother lamp type. Low-pressure sodium lighting is used where coloris not important because it renders all colors as tones of yellowor gray. Typical applications include highway and security lighting. Energy Efficiency with Lighting Lighting accounts for 20% to 25% of all electricity consumed inthe United States. An average household dedicates 5% to 10% ofits energy budget to lighting, while commercial establishmentsconsume 20% to 30% of their total energy just for lighting. In a typical residential or commercial lighting installation,50% or more of the energy is wasted by obsolete equipment, inadequatemaintenance, or inefficient use. Saving lighting energy requires either reducing electricity consumedby the light source or reducing the length of time the light sourceis on. This can be accomplished by: Lowering wattage, which involves replacing lamps or entirefixtures Reducing the light source's on-time, which means improvinglighting controls and educating users to turn off unneeded lights Using daylighting, which reduces energy consumption by replacingelectric lights with natural light Performing simple maintenance, which preserves illuminationand light quality and allows lower initial illumination levels. Replacing Lamps and Fixtures Relamping means substituting one lamp for another to save energy.You can decide to make illumination higher or lower when relamping.But be sure that the new lampÕs lumen output fits the tasksperformed in the space and conforms to the fixtureÕs specifications. When relamping an entire store or office, first test the new lampsin a small area to ensure adequate illumination, occupant satisfaction,and compatibility of the new lamp and the old fixture. Matching replacement lamps to existing fixtures and ballasts canbe tricky, especially with older fixtures. Buying new fixturesmade for new lamps produces superior energy savings, reliability,and longevity compared with relamping. Relamping incandescent fixtures Much has been learned about fixture design since the energy crisesof the 1970s. Many indoor fixtures trap a significant portionof light inside the fixture, while many outdoor fixtures tendto disperse much of their light beyond the intended area, whichcauses light pollution. New incandescent fixtures are designed to push all their lightout into the room. Others use smaller tungsten halogen lamps.Advances in indoor fixture design include brighter reflectorsand better reflecting geometry. Many incandescent lamps are mismatched to their tasks. Some haveexcessive wattagesÑcreating unnecessarily high illumination.This can be corrected by using lamps with smaller wattage. Some existing incandescent lamps may not be the best type of lampfor their application. A-type light bulbs can often be replacedwith improved lamp designs, such as reflectors or tungsten halogenlamps. And, for energy savings of 60% to 75%, many incandescentlamps can be replaced by CFLs. When used in recessed fixtures, standard A-type lamps and reflectorlamps waste energyÑtheir light gets trapped. To save energy,you could replace a 150-watt standard reflector with a 75-wattellipsoidal reflector (ER). Remember, though, that ER lamps areless efficient at delivering light from shallow fixtures, so usereflectors or parabolic reflectors for these purposes. You can also replace standard A-type lamps with CFLs in spaceswhere lights are needed for long periods of time. A standard18-watt CFL replaces a 75-watt A-type lamp. CFLs are also packagedin the same glass reflector lamps as incandescent lamps. Use CFLspackaged as ellipsoidal reflectors (type-ER) in recessed fixtures.Use reflector (R) or parabolic reflector (PAR) CFLs for floodand spotlighting. New CFL fixtures have built-in electronic ballastsand polished metal reflectors. Relamping fluorescent fixtures Although fluorescent lamps are generally energy efficient, thereare new, even more efficient lamps that use better electrodesand coatings than do older fluorescent lamps. They produce aboutthe same lumen output with substantially lower wattage. Common 40-watt and 75-watt lamps can be replaced with energy-savinglamps of 34 watts and 60 watts, respectively. Energy-saving lampsfor less-common fluorescent fixtures are also available. If you need to replace the ballasts in your fluorescent fixtures,consider using one of the improved varieties. These fluorescentballasts, called improved electromagnetic ballasts and electronicballasts, raise the efficiency of the fixture 12% to 30%. The new electromagnetic ballasts reduce ballast losses, fixturetemperature, and system wattage. Because they operate at coolertemperatures, they last longer than standard electromagnetic ballasts. Electronic ballasts operate at a very high frequency that eliminatesflickering and noise. They are even more efficient than improvedelectromagnetic ballasts. Some electronic ballasts even allowyou to operate the fluorescent lamp on a dimmer switch, whichusually is not recommended with most fluorescents. Improving Lighting Controls Lighting controls are devices for turning lights on and off orfor dimming them. The simplest type is a standard snap switch.Other controls are photocells, timers, occupancy sensors, anddimmers. Snap switches, located in numerous convenient areas, makeit easier for people in large, shared spaces to turn off lightsin unused areas. Photocells turn lights on and off in response to natural lightlevels. Photo-cells switch outdoor lights on at dusk and off atdawn, for example. Advanced designs gradually raise and lowerfluorescent light levels with changing daylight levels. Mechanical or electronic time clocks automatically turn onand off indoor or outdoor lights for security, safety, and taskssuch as janitorial work. Crank timers, which are spring-driven and similar to old oventimers, limit lights to short durations where the need for lightis brief. Occupancy sensors activate lights when a person is in thearea and then turn off the lights after the person has left. Theyare popular for areas used infrequently, such as warehouses. Theyalso offer security advantages over continuous lighting: whenlights suddenly come on, they startle intruders and alert residentsand neighbors to motion in the area. Dimmers reduce the wattage and output of incandescent andfluorescent lamps. Dimmers also increase the service life of incandescentlamps significantly. However, dimming incandescent lamps reducestheir lumen output more than their wattage. This makes incandescentlamps less efficient as they are dimmed. Dimming fluorescentsrequires special dimming ballasts and lamp holders, but does notreduce their efficiency. Fluorescent Lamp Disposal All fluorescent lights contain small amounts of mercury, and somecompact fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts contain smallamounts of short-lived radioactive material. Because of thesehazardous materials, you should not toss burned-out lamps intothe trash. Find out if there is a recycling program for them inyour communityÑthey are becoming more commonÑ ordispose of them with other household hazardous wastes such asbatteries, solvents, and paints at your communityÕs designateddrop-off point or during a designated day when you can put suchmaterials with your curbside trash pickup. Daylighting Daylighting means using daylight for indoor lighting. Modern buildingsdesigned for daylighting typically use 40% to 60% less electricityfor lighting needs than do conventional buildings. Sunlight and daylight are free and readily accessible. However,using sunlight without causing glare and without overheatinga building can be difficult. Glare can be avoided by using windowsills, walls, louvers, reflective blinds, and other devices toreflect light deep into the building. Be careful to locate windowsand skylights away from the sunÕs direct rays to avoidoverheating. For example, placing skylights on the north slopeof your roof rather than on the southern exposure may reduce heattransfer. In addition, look for windows with new selective glazingsthat transmit the most visible light while excluding the mostsolar heat. For more information on daylighting and windows, contact the EnergyEfficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC--see SourceList). Lighting Maintenance Maintenance is vital to lighting efficiency. Light levels decreaseover time because of aging lamps and dirt on fixtures, lamps,and room surfaces. Together, these factors can reduce total illuminationby 50% or more, while lights continue drawing full power. Thefollowing basic maintenance suggestions can help prevent this. Clean fixtures, lamps, and lenses every 6 to 24 months bywiping off the dust. However, never clean an incandescent bulbwhile it is turned on. The water's cooling effect will shatterthe hot bulb. Replace lenses if they appear yellow. Clean or repaint small rooms every year and larger rooms every2 to 3 years. Dirt collects on surfaces, which reduces the amountof light they reflect. Consider group relamping. Common lamps, especially incandescentand fluorescent lamps, lose 20% to 30% of their light outputover their service life. Many lighting experts recommend replacingall the lamps in a lighting system at once. This saves labor,keeps illumination high, and avoids stressing any ballasts withdying lamps. Optimizing Energy Efficiency and Lighting Quality When making changes designed to increase the energy efficiencyof lighting, it often pays to redesign the building's entire lightingsystem. This can improve lighting quality, make visual tasks easier,and save 50% or more on energy costs. Often, you can reduce light levels without reducing light qualityby following these procedures. Redesign visual tasks. For example, use a better printer withdarker printing. Reduce light levels where there are no visual tasks. Providethe minimum light necessary for safety, security, and aesthetics. Reduce light levels for visual tasks where those levels arecurrently excessive. . If you want to cut energy consumption from lighting while enhancinglight quality, consider the following. Establish ambient illumination at minimum acceptable levels. Provide task lighting at the optimal level depending on thedifficulty of visual tasks. For example, sewing requires morelight than cooking. Increase the efficiency of lamps, ballasts, and fixtures. Improve light quality by reducing glare and brightness contrast. Use daylighting where possible and practical. Better Light, Less Cost Using just a few of these ideas will help lower your electricitycosts from lighting and make your home or workplace more comfortableand efficient.

Americans spend more than $115 billion each year on fuel and electricity for their homes. On the average, heating and cooling (space conditioning) account for about 45% of the energy a home uses. Water heating consumes about 14%, and appliances and other sources consume about 41%. Though energy use varies among homes, there are many ways to lower your energy bills. Being more energy efficient can be as simple and inexpensive as buying and installing caulk and weatherstripping or as complicated and expensive as building a state-of-the-art,energy-efficienthouse. However, whatever you do to reduce energy costs will usually require the purchase of goods or services. Investments in products or systems designed to save energy can providea return through future savings from lower energy bills. They also reduce the impact of rising fuel prices and usually help improve the environment. However, poor choices of such products or systems can be disappointing and aggravating. Whether you are buying a new heating system or "tightening up your home," be sure to investigate the options before investing. Knowing Your Needs An energy audit is one of the best ways to determine the most cost-effective measures for reducing energy bills. Energy audits can locate areas where energy is wasted and can determine the efficiency of your heating and cooling systems. Energy audits vary in complexity. You can perform a simple audit yourself by examining your home for obvious leaks or ensuring that appliances work efficiently. More information about do-it-yourself audits can be obtained from The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC) (see the Source List). More thorough audits can be conducted by "house doctors," who usually work in teams using special equipment such as blower doors, infrared cameras, furnace efficiency instruments, and surface thermometers. This equipment allows them to find inefficiencies that a visual inspection could not detect. House doctors also analyze previous energy bills and implement some energy efficiency measures at the time of the audit. This type of energy audit, however, may be relatively expensive. Some utilities offer energy audits for free or for a nominal charge. The extent of these audits varies. Auditors from utilities may or may not use special equipment such as blower doors and infrared cameras, and they may or may not check the performance of your heating system. Determining Your Priorities Results from the energy audit can direct you to the changes that would be most appropriate to improve the energy efficiency, or "tightness," of your home. Before you purchase an energy-related product or system, though, you should answer some important questions. What are your budgetary limits? Which areas are causing your greatest energy losses? How long can you wait for the investment to pay for itself in energy savings? How much time and money are you willing to spend on maintenance and repair? Are you investing solely to save on energy bills or are other factors also important? Many options that improve energy efficiency are available. Although installing caulk, weatherstripping, and insulation may not be as exciting or impressive as a ground-source heat pump, such energy efficiency measures are very often cost effective. Indeed, if you decide to install a heating or cooling system, you should first ensure that your home is properly weatherized. Using energy efficiently reduces demands for heating, cooling, and electricity, thereby allowing a smaller, less expensive system to be used. Because of the high percentage of your energy bill that goes toward conditioning the air in your home, detecting heat losses and gains is a great place to start when deciding what measures may improve the energy efficiency of your home. Leaky windows and doors, open fireplace dampers, poorly insulated attics and walls, and cracks and holes in the walls and ceiling are all areas where heat can escape in the winter and enter in the summer. Heat can also escape through light fixtures and switches, electrical outlets, and leaky ducts. Appliances and equipment can also have a tremendous effect on your energy costs. Hot water heaters, stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers,and clothes dryers can contribute to excessively high energy bills when they operate inefficiently. Poorly sized and inefficient heating and cooling systems can lead to high costs for space conditioning. When you decide to implement energy efficiency measures, you can determine the most appropriate product or system by investigating the options. The energy efficiency projects addressed here are divided into two categories--weatherization projects and energy-efficient appliances. Weatherization Projects Weatherization projects insulate and tighten the shell of the home. Such projects include, but are not restricted to, caulking and weatherstripping, improving or replacing windows, and installinginsulation. Caulking and Weatherstripping Caulking and weatherstripping are the easiest and least expensive weatherization measures and can save more than 10% on energy bills. They are usually do-it-yourself projects. Choose your supplies carefully and follow instructions closely. High-quality materials and proper installation ensure that you receive maximum performance from your investment. Caulking and weatherstripping are most often applied to doors and windows, which account for about 33% of a home's total heat loss. Because windows outnumber doors, energy efficiency features of windows are particularly important to lowering energy costs. Installing Insulation Insulation is probably the most important consideration in improving the energy efficiency of a home. The type and amount of insulation you choose will directly affect energy costs. Factors to weigh in making a decision about insulation material include insulative value, cost, flammability, toxicity, durability, and availability. When purchasing insulation, check the product label to make sure the material meets specifications of either the federal government or the American Society for Testing and Materials. The label should indicate the insulation material, R-value, quantity, and the name and address of the manufacturer or distributor. It should also state how much area the insulation can cover, where the insulation can be installed, what the fire resistance of the material is, and what safety precautions should be taken for installation and use. For more information about insulation, see the EREC fact sheet "Insulation." If you choose to install the insulation yourself, wear proper clothing and learn how to properly install the insulation to avoid fire hazards and moisture problems. You should also determine if a vapor retarder or other moisture control measure is needed. You may also choose to hire a contractor. The Insulation Contractors of America (see the Source List) can help you find a certified contractor in your area. You can also check the Yellow Pages. Improving or Replacing Windows Single-pane windows are the most inefficient ones, but it is possible to increase their efficiency. You can install storm windows to add insulating value and reduce air leaks. The simplest type of storm window--a plastic film taped to the inside of the window frame--is usually available in prepackaged kits. It can be installed and removed easily, but it also may damage easily and reduce visibility. Another type, which uses rigid or semirigid plastic sheets (e.g., plexiglass,acrylic, polycarbonate, fiber-reinforced polyester) can be fastened directly to the frame or mounted in channels around the frame. Storm windows made of glass can be attached to the frame with clips or screws. Storm window units should have weatherstripping at all joints, be made of strong, durable materials, and have interlocking or overlapping joints. If your windows need to be replaced, there are many new types of energy-efficient glazing and frames on the market that suit different purposes. Glazing materials are made of glass or plastic; frames are available in aluminum, wood, vinyl, fiberglass, or combinations of these materials. Each type of glazing material and frame has advantages and disadvantages. Glass is durable and allows a high percentage of solar energy to enter buildings. Plastics can be stronger, lighter, cheaper, and easier to cut than glass, but not as durable and more susceptible to the effects of weather. When comparing the different types of materials, note whether the glazing is most suitable for blocking or allowing solar gain. (If you live in a hot climate, you will probably want to block out solar gain). You can compare the energy efficiency of similar models by checking written information available from the retailer or manufacturer. Manufacturers usually represent the energy efficiency of a window as the R-value, or the measure of resistance to heat flow. R-values range from about 0.9 to about 3.0. If the R-value is high, less heat will be lost. Manufacturers may also use the U-value, the measure of heat flow, to indicate a window's energy efficiency. U-values are the reciprocal of R-values. U-values range from about 1.1 to about 0.3. If the U-value is low, less heat will be lost. When you are comparing glazing, it may be helpful to determine if the U-or R-value is indicated for the entire window or just for the center-of-glass. A window with a high R-value based on the center-of- glass may not be as efficient as one with a lower R-value that is based on the entire window. For a more detailed discussion of windows, see the EREC fact sheet "Energy Efficient Windows." Energy-Efficient Appliances The energy efficiency of similar appliances can vary significantly. It is usually more cost effective to purchase appliances with high efficiencies. Determining and comparing the energy efficiency of different models is usually easy, because federal regulations require many types of appliances to display EnergyGuide labels. A label or energy-use information in the product literature is required for furnaces, refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,freezers, waterheaters, washing machines, dishwashers, room and central air conditioners, heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. EnergyGuide labels indicate either the annual estimated cost of operating the system or a standardized energy efficiency ratio. Specific information about these appliances is presented in Table 1. You can also maximize the efficiency of appliances you already own through regular maintenance and tune-ups and system upgrades. Examples of some things that you can do are: Check air filters in heating and cooling systems monthly during the seasons they are in use and clean and replace them as necessary. Clean air vents, baseboards, and radiators regularly and keep them unrestricted by furniture, carpets, or drapes. Release trapped air from hot water radiators once or twice a season by opening the valve until nothing but water comes out. Follow prescribed maintenance (e.g., maintaining certain water levels in steam heat systems). Install an insulating jacket on your hot water heater, insulate hot water pipes, and lower the water heater temperature. Clean refrigerator coils yearly and maintain internal temperatures between 36 degrees F (2.2 degrees C) and 38 degrees F (33 degrees C) for the refrigerator compartment and between 0 degrees F (17.8 degrees C) and 5 degrees F (15.0 degrees C) for the freezer compartment. Move the refrigerator if it is currently located near the stove or dishwasher. Regularly defrost refrigerators that do not have a completely automatic defrost capability to eliminate ice build-up on interior coils. Clean dryer filters after each use or as necessary. More complicated jobs, such as furnace tune-ups, will need to be performed periodically by a trained technician. Companies that sell oil and gas usually have trained technicians who can tune-up your furnace or boiler. Sometimes independent companies provide this service as well. For professional service for other home appliances, you should contact the business where the appliance was purchased. If You Need a Contractor You may find that many improvements involving energy efficiency require a contractor for installation. While finding a quality contractor at the best price can be a little confusing, these suggestions may help along the way. Try to limit your choices to local contractors. They are usually less expensive. Check the Yellow Pages for the type of contractor you need. Inquiring about contractors through friends and relatives can help you narrow the field. Obtain at least three bids before signing a contract. The greater the selection, the greater the chances of finding the right contractor for the job. All terms in the bids should be similar and all details should be in writing. Depending on the job, you should have the contractors visit the site before bidding on a project. Make sure that the contractors are licensed and have liability insurance. Find out the contractors' previous experience and ask for references. How many jobs have they completed? Have they had any formal training in installing the specified product or system? You should also check their record with the Better Business Bureau. Include in the contract the dates that you expect services to begin and end. This protects you from contractors who begin a job very late or leave a job and return at a much later date. You may also want to specify payment for starting a project late. (You can lose money when contractors are late because the savings that the project would have incurred had it been installed are lost.) Never fully pay contractors before they start the work. Pay the contractor in increments (e.g., at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the job). Find out if the contractor will allow you to buy the materials. Sometimes the materials are less expensive when you purchase them yourself. Note whether you need permits and whether permits are included in the contract. Some contractors require you to purchase and obtain these yourself. Obtaining permits can take many hours. If the contractor is obtaining the permits and is being paid at an hourly rate, find out if he or she is charging by the hour to obtain the permits. Beware of contractors who bid much lower than others for the same job. You should thoroughly read and understand the contract before signing it. Make sure that a cancellation form is attached as required by consumer protection laws. This allows you to cancel a contract worth over $25 before midnight of the third business day after the transaction. Making Good Investments Most consumers are looking for the greatest return for the least investment. This does not necessarily mean, though, that you should buy the least expensive product or system on the market. In fact, spending a little more money initially for an energy-efficient product or system (as opposed to spending less and sacrificing energy efficiency) is often more economical in the long run because your investment will pay for itself in energy savings. Generally, there are two ways to analyze the costs of energy efficiency investments: simple payback period, which is the amount of time required for the investment to pay for itself in energy savings; and full life-cycle cost, which is the total of all costs and benefits associated with an investment during its estimated lifetime. You can obtain an estimate of the simple payback period by dividing the total cost of the product by the yearly energy savings. For example, an energy-efficient dryer that costs $500 and saves $100 per year in energy costs has a simple payback period of 5 years. Computing life-cycle costs is more difficult. Life-cycle costing is a method of economic evaluation in which all values are expressed as present dollars. This evaluation method sums the discounted investment costs (less salvage value); operation and maintenance (nonfuel) and repair costs; replacement costs; and energy costs of an appliance or building system. For definitions of these terms and the formula for performing life-cycle cost analyses, see the "Life-Cycle Costing Manual for the Federal Energy Management Program," NBS Handbook 135, Revised 1987. This manual is available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. Before making your decision, examine your budget, the expected payback periods, and estimated lives of different alternatives. Products or systems with payback periods that approach or exceed their projected life are usually not worthwhile. Compare the life-cycle costs of similar products or systems. These include installation (if any), operation, and maintenance costs. Although most of the federal tax incentives of the early 1980s have been discontinued, your state or local government may offer economic incentives or financial assistance to implement energy efficiency measures. Also, check with your local utility to see what incentives are available. If you are buying a new home, you may want to investigate the possibility of obtaining an energy-efficient mortgage (EEM). EEMs allow home buyers to qualify for a larger mortgage by allowing a higher debt-to-income ratio than lenders normally use to calculate loan potential. EEMs allow the significant monthly energy savings of an energy-efficient house to be put toward a higher monthly mortgage payment. Home buyers upgrading an existing home to qualify as an energy-efficient home may add the cost of energy measures to the mortgage. By adding this cost into the mortgage, the home buyer may profit from the tax benefits and longer term interest rates. You can find out if EEMs are an option for you by asking your lender. Four federal lending programs-Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and Veteran's Administration (VA)-offer EEMs. Therefore, EEMs are available nationwide. Unfortunately, most lenders and home buyers are either unaware of EEMs or choose not to use them. Currently, 23 states have at least one lender who facilitates EEMs. FHA is establishing an EEM pilot program for existing homes in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Vermont, and Virginia. {Table 1.

They can also be major sources of heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer. In 1990 alone, the energy used to offset unwanted heat losses and gains through windows in residential and commercial buildings cost the United States $20 billion (one-fourth of all the energy used for space heating and cooling). However, when properly selected and installed, windows can help minimize a home's heating, cooling, and lighting costs. This publication describes one option—energy-efficient windows—available for reducing a home's heating and cooling energy requirements. Controlling Air Leaks When air leaks around windows, energy is wasted. Energy is also transferred through the centers, edges, and frames of windows. Eliminating or reducing these paths of heat flow can greatly improve the energy efficiency of windows and, ultimately, of homes. Several options are available to reduce air leaks around windows; the least expensive options are caulking and weatherstripping, followed by replacing window frames. Caulking and Weatherstripping Caulks are airtight compounds (usually latex or silicone) that fill cracks and holes. Before applying new caulk, old caulk or paint residue remaining around a window should be removed using a putty knife, stiff brush, or special solvent. After old caulk is removed, new caulk can then be applied to all joints in the window frame and the joint between the frame and the wall. The best time to apply caulk is during dry weather when the outdoor temperature is above 45° Fahrenheit (7.2° Celsius). Low humidity is important during application to prevent cracks from swelling with moisture. Warm temperatures are also necessary so the caulk will set properly and adhere to the surface. Weatherstripping is a narrow piece of metal, vinyl, rubber, felt, or foam that seals the contact area between the fixed and movable sections of a window joint. It should be applied between the sash and the frame, but should not interfere with the operation of the window. For more information on caulking and weatherstripping, contact the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC). Replacing Window Frames The type and quality of the window frame usually affect a window's air infiltration and heat loss characteristics. Many window frames are available—all with varying degrees of energy efficiency. Some of the more common window frames are fixed-pane, casement, double- and single-hung, horizontal sliding, hopper, and awning. When properly installed, fixed-pane windows are airtight and inexpensive and can be custom designed for a wide variety of applications. But, because they cannot be opened, fixed-pane windows are unsuitable in places where ventilation is required. Casement, awning, and hopper windows with compression seals are moderately airtight and provide good ventilation when opened. Casement windows open sideways with hand cranks. Awning windows are similar to casement windows except that their hinges are located at the tops of the windows instead of at the sides. Hopper windows are inverted versions of awning windows with their hinges located at the bottom. Windows with compression seals allow about half as much air leakage as double-hung and horizontal sliding windows with sliding seals. Double-hung windows have top and bottom sashes (the sliding sections of the window) and can be opened by pulling up the lower sashes or pulling down the upper sash. Although they are among the most popular type of window, double-hung windows can be inefficient because they are often leaky. Single-hung windows are somewhat better because only one sash moves. Horizontal sliding windows are like double-hung windows except that the sashes are located on the left and right edges rather than on the tops and bottoms. Horizontal sliding windows open on the side and are especially suitable for spaces that require a long, narrow view. These windows, however, usually provide minimal ventilation and, like double-hung windows, can be quite leaky. Reducing Heat Loss and Condensation Manufacturers usually represent the energy efficiency of windows in terms of their U-values (conductance of heat) or their R-values (resistance to heat flow). If a window's R-value is high, it will lose less heat than one with a lower R-value. Conversely, if a window's U-value is low, it will lose less heat than one with a higher U-value. In other words, U-values are the reciprocals of R-values (U-value = 1/R-value). Most window manufacturers use R-values in rating their windows. Usually, window R-values range from 0.9 to 3.0 (U-values range from 1.1 to 0.3), but some highly energy-efficient exceptions also exist. When comparing different windows, you should ensure that all U-or R-values listed by manufacturers: (1) are based on current standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), (2) are calculated for the entire window, including the frame, and not just for the center of the glass, and (3) represent the same size and style of window. The following five factors affect the R-value of a window. The type of glazing material (e.g., glass, plastic, treated glass) The number of layers of glass The size of the air space between the layers of glass The thermal resistance or conductance of the frame and spacer materials The "tightness" of the installation (i.e., air leaks—:see previous discussion). Types of Glazing Materials Traditionally, clear glass has been the primary material available for window panes in homes. However, in recent years, the market for glazing—or cutting and fitting window panes into frames—has changed significantly. Now several types of special glazings are available that can help control heat loss and condensation. Low-emissivity (low-e) glass has a special surface coating to reduce heat transfer back through the window. These coatings reflect from 40% to 70% of the heat that is normally transmitted through clear glass, while allowing the full amount of light to pass through. Heat-absorbing glass contains special tints that allow it to absorb as much as 45% of the incoming solar energy, reducing heat gain. Some of the absorbed heat, however, passes through the window by conduction and reradiation. Reflective glass has been coated with a reflective film and is useful in controlling solar heat gain during the summer. It also reduces the passage of light all year long, and, like heat-absorbing glass, it reduces solar transmittance. Plastic glazing materials—acrylic, polycarbonate, polyester, polyvinyl fluoride, and polyethylene—are also widely available. Plastics can be stronger, lighter, cheaper, and easier to cut than glass. Some plastics also have higher solar transmittance than glass. However, plastics tend to be less durable and more susceptible to the effects of weather than is glass. Storm windows can increase the efficiency of single-pane windows, the least energy-efficient type of glazing. The simplest type of storm window is a plastic film taped to the inside of the window frame. These films are usually available in prepackaged kits. Although plastic films are easily installed and removed, they are easily damaged and may reduce visibility. Rigid or semirigid plastic sheets such as plexiglass, acrylic, polycarbonate, or fiber-reinforced polyester can be fastened directly to the window frame or mounted in channels around the frame—usually on the outside of the building. These more durable materials are also available in kits. For more information about advanced types of glazing materials, contact EREC. Layers of Glass and Air Spaces Standard single-pane glass has very little insulating value (approximately R-1). It provides only a thin barrier to the outside and can account for considerable heat loss and gain. Traditionally, the approach to improve a window's energy efficiency has been to increase the number of glass panes in the unit, because multiple layers of glass increase the window's ability to resist heat flow. Double- or triple-pane windows have insulating air- or gas-filled spaces between each pane. Each layer of glass and the air spaces resist heat flow. The width of the air spaces between the panes is important, because air spaces that are too wide (more than 5/8 inch or 1.6 centimeters) or too narrow (less than 1/2 inch or 1.3 centimeters) have lower R-values (i.e., they allow too much heat transfer). Advanced, multi-pane windows are now manufactured with inert gases (argon or krypton) in the spaces between the panes because these gases transfer less heat than does air. Multi-pane windows are considerably more expensive than single-pane windows and limit framing options because of their increased weight. Frame and Spacer Materials Window frames are available in a variety of materials including aluminum, wood, vinyl, and fiberglass. Frames may be primarily composed of one material, or they may be a combination of different materials such as wood clad with vinyl or aluminum-clad wood. Each frame material has its advantages and disadvantages. Though ideal for strength and customized window design, aluminum frames conduct heat and therefore lose heat faster and are prone to condensation. Through anodizing or coating, the corrosion and electro-galvanic deterioration of aluminum frames can be avoided. Additionally, the thermal resistance of aluminum frames can be significantly improved by placing continuous insulating plastic strips between the interior and exterior of the frame. Wood frames have higher R-values, are not affected by temperature extremes, and do not generally promote condensation. Wood frames do require considerable maintenance in the form of periodic painting or staining. If not properly protected, wood frames can swell, which leads to rot, warping, and sticking. Vinyl window frames, which are made primarily from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), offer many advantages. Available in a wide range of styles and shapes, vinyl frames have moderate to high R-values, are easily customized, are competitively priced, and require very low maintenance. While vinyl frames do not possess the inherent strength of metal or wood, larger-sized windows are often strengthened with aluminum or steel reinforcing bars. Fiberglass frames are relatively new and are not yet widely available. With some of the highest R-values, fiberglass frames are excellent for insulating and will not warp, shrink, swell, rot, or corrode. Unprotected fiberglass does not hold up to the weather and therefore is always painted. Some fiberglass frames are hollow; while others are filled with fiberglass insulation. Spacers are used to separate multiple panes of glass within the windows. Although metal (usually aluminum) spacers are commonly installed to separate glass in multi-pane windows, they conduct heat. During cold weather, the thermal resistance around the edge of a window is lower than that in the center; thus, heat can escape, and condensation can occur along the edges. To alleviate these problems, one manufacturer has developed a multi-pane window using a 1/8-inch-wide (0.32 centimeters-wide) PVC foam separator placed along the edges of the frame. Like other multi-pane windows, these use metal spacers for support, but because the foam separator is secured on top of the spacer between the panes, heat loss and condensation are reduced. Several window manufacturers now sandwich foam separators, nylon spacers, and insulation materials such as poly-styrene and rockwool between the glass inside their windows. Additional Options for Reducing Heat Loss and Gain through Windows Movable insulation, such as insulating shades, shutters, and drapes, can be applied on the inside of windows to reduce heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer. Shading devices, such as awnings, exterior shutters, or screens, can be used to reduce unwanted heat gain in the summer. In most cases, these window treatments are more cost-effective than energy-efficient window replacements and should be considered first. Additional information on window treatments is available from EREC. Conclusion Reducing heat loss or gain in homes often includes either improving existing windows or replacing them. Low-cost options available for improvement are caulking, weatherstripping, retrofit window films, and window treatments. Replacing windows will involve the purchase of new materials, which should adhere to certain energy efficiency standards. Different combinations of frame style, frame material, and glazing can yield very different results when weighing energy efficiency and cost. For example, a fixed-pane window is the most air-tight and the least expensive; a window with a wood frame is likely to have less conductive heat loss than one with an aluminum frame; double-pane, low-e window units are just as efficient as triple-pane untreated windows, but cost and weigh less. No one window is suitable for every application. Many types of windows and window films are available that serve different purposes. Moreover, you may discover that you need two types of windows for your home because of the directions that your windows face and your local climate. To make wise purchases, first examine your heating and cooling needs and prioritize desired features such as daylighting, solar heating, shading, ventilation, and aesthetic value.

Each of these areas can produce important near term results thatwill spur the continued development of the biomass resource andgeneration capacity in the 1990s. These opportunities receivedstrong consideration in the development of the DOE Five-Year Plan. 4.1 Co-firing Biomass and Coal in Utility Boilers Co-firing alternative fuels, such as biomass and coal (or other fossil fuels), has beenconducted on an experimental basis by utilities without much fanfarethroughout the U.S. Experiencevaried with boiler configuration. In pulverized coal boilers,cofiring has been limited to a few percent of heat input. Incoal stokers, the percentage co-firing has been increased intothe 25% to 50% range, while fluidized bed boilers have been firedwith mixtures that span the full range. Co-firing, as a strategyelement of the Biomass Power Program, provides one of the bestopportunities to quickly bring the utilities into the fold ofbiomass resource users. IPPs that build or own coal-fired stationsmay also be interested. From the utility point of view, co-firingis attractive for several reasons. Co-firing of inexpensive byproductfuels solves two problems. It helps mitigate a waste wood disposalproblem that is becoming increasingly burdensome for industrialcustomers, municipalities, and citizens. As landfill restrictionsare tightened and operating costs spiral upward, the diversionof waste wood from landfills to the power generator as a low/no-costfuel resource can provide direct consumer benefits. Not onlyis landfill space preserved, but consumer waste disposal costsand customer power rates may be lowered. If the byproduct fuelscan be procured at a near zero cost, it may provide the only opportunityto revitalize some smaller capacity coal units that are no longereconomical to dispatch as base or intermediate load plants. Co-firingis also a low-risk, low-capital cost option. This makes it amuch easier sell to both utility management and the Public UtilitiesCommission. Other cogent factors favoring co-firing from the utilityperspective include: Direct environmental benefits of bothreduced air emissions (lower SOx, NOx, and CO2 emissions) andreduced solid waste streams. Thus, biomass provides power whiledemonstrating corporate commitment to a cleaner environment. Possible economic benefits accruing to SO2 allowances and avoidanceof potential carbon taxes. Fewer permitting problems by introducingthis 'new' fuel on a partial basis at existing permittedfacilities. Fuel flexibility providing negotiating advantagesin fuel procurement for coal and biomass. From the DOE perspectiveseveral factors make this strategy attractive: This strategyelement is also a low risk to DOE on both the investment and technicalends. Co-firing offers the best near-term opportunity to bringthe traditional utility companies into the biomass power arenaproviding them with fuel procurement, permitting, and operationalexperience. Environmental regulators and the public are affordedthe opportunity to evaluate the use of biomass fuels in a permittingsetting that is far less threatening. Co-firing is a technologychoice that can deliver its share of the power generation capacitygoal set for the biomass power program in SOLAR 2000. Co-firing can provide the lower risk transition step to DFSS development. Onlytwo utilities have cofired coal and biomass on a continuous basis. These are Tacoma Public Utilities and Northern States Power. Burlington's McNeil plant was designed to operate solely on woodfuel but was later converted to cofire natural gas (at low summerrates) and biomass to improve plant economics and dispatchability. Inthe Southeast and mid-Atlantic region, several utilities haveexperimented with co-firing biomass and coal in existing utilityboilers. Santee Cooper has successfully fired a 5% mix of biomassand coal on a temporary basis. Others, including Delmarva andCarolina Power and Light, have run wood/coal co-firing tests. TVA is undertaking a year long study of retrofit options for itscoal-fired power stations as well as resource assessments. Earlyresults indicate that there are units that could be adapted forpulverized wood firing with minimal impacts on boiler operation. The Southern Company is in the midst of a similar assessmentand is already co-firing wood and paper processing byproducts ona limited basis at several facilities in the system. In fact,the Southern Company affiliated utilities have expressed a desireto implement pilot plant conversions at several smaller stationsin the system. In the Northeast, Niagara Mohawk is investigatingopportunities to cofire a number of alternative fuels in its coal-firedfacilities primarily to take advantage of very low cost byproductfuels to improve the dispatchability of existing coal-fired stationson an economic basis. NYSEG is already co-firing wood chips ona limited basis (less than 1%) and has expressed similar reasonsfor its interest in co-firing. It is important to note that utilitiesdid not feel that SO2 reductions alone will have a significantenough benefit to make co-firing a good investment. It is clearthat other factors will have be present to make a co-firing retrofitworthwhile. In some discussions, previous attempts to cofiremore difficult biomass fuels, such as peat, or cofire by directlymixing minimally processed biomass on the coal pile, led to operationalproblems that has left some plant operators skeptical. A co-firinginitiative on the part of DOE will have to consider these concernsin addition to the other concerns typically raised for use ofbiomass fuels. Several strategy elements and issues are evolvingfrom these and other similar assessments in the region. For interestedutilities, the unknowns and concerns that need to be addressedinclude: Potential boiler operation impacts: efficiency losses,increased slagging potential, boiler capacity derating, fuel feedcontrol and boiler response, downtime for retrofits, combustioninstability, and unknown levels of emissions (NOx, VOCs, CO, SOx,PM10). Fuel delivery, handling and stocking concerns: fueldeliveries (access and congestion), on-site fuel storage arearequired for low density fuel, fuel pile emissions, fire hazardsand decomposition, separate on-site fuel processing equipmentneeds, fuel feed and boiler interconnections, fuel processingand handling safety, system flexibility for coal/biomass interchangeand systems reliability. Fuel procurement: availability,price and its impact on plant dispatchability, fuel contract administration,fuel quality assurance and variability. Impacts on environmentalcontrols: ESP, baghouse or scrubber performance impacts and theirconsequences for permit compliance or review. Impacts on plantstaffing. In addition, plant managers will want to know if thepositive benefits of co-firing outweigh the possible problems ofplant and operational modifications to accommodate the use ofthe fuel. To convince system and plant managers to pursue co-firingprojects, joint venture activities must address the issues inthree ways. First and foremost, there is a desire to see thatretrofits can be made with minimal impacts on plant capacity,operations, and dispatchability. Second, the benefits of co-firingmust translate into meaningful incentives. This could include: achieving NOx or SOx compliance through co-firing withoutfurther modifications increased run-time (capacity factor)due to reduced operating costs and/or environmental dispatch incentives,such as carbon dioxide caps on generation reductions in loadingsof local municipal landfills from industrial sources due to diversionto co-firing facilities Third, the fuel procurement systems mustbe demonstrated to assure plant managers that a sufficient long-termsource of known quality fuel will be available to the plant. Thetypes of projects that are required include generic design studiesfor each of the major boiler configurations, demonstration projectsdesigned to address all aspects of the retrofit and cofiring operations. Specific joint venture hardware tests might include: evaluationof preprocessing equipment capability to meet desired fuel specificationsthat minimize boiler modifications (fuel dryers, and mills); evaluations of alternative boiler retrofit options to optimizecombustion stability, completeness, and minimize regulated emissions; evaluations of boiler and fuel feed equipment configurationsthat permit a high degree of flexibility with respect to fuelmix and boiler response to load changes; on the institutionalside, initiatives that address possible evaluation of changesin dispatch rules and system operations and accounting that provideincentives based on the demonstrated benefits of cofiring. 4.2 Expanded Resource Availability One general area of need andopportunity will be projects and activities that expand the currentresource base available to power producers. As can be seen inByproducts such as agricultural residues represent the upperend of the current supply curve in California. The possibilitiesraised span the potential market from wood and paper byproductstreams to energy crops as a supplemental source. Nearly allthe IPP and utility representatives expressed the desire to beable to use a wider base of fuel resources economically. It wasvery clear from the meetings that the continued survival of thenascent biomass power industry would depend on the expansion ofavailability of diverse, low-cost fuel sources. Each potentialresource has a specific set of issues to be addressed althoughenvironmental, collection and permitting issues pervade them all. Many of the potential feedstock sources are byproducts of industrialor agricultural operations. It will be more efficient for theBiomass Power Program to work jointly with DOE Industrial EnergyR&D Programs and USDA Product Development Programs to developthese resources. Efficient collection of agricultural residues. Orchard prunings, and wheat and rice straw are a few of the sourcesthat the IPPs and utilities expressed interest in utilizing asa fuel source. However, these residues can be costly to collectand their availability is seasonal. The further tightening ofopen field burning restrictions could prove to be a strong motivatingfactor for these efforts. Estimates of the farmer's cost to collectand bail wheat materials range from $17 to $30 per ton. Furthermore,the resource is low density, on the order of 1 to 3 tons per acreper year. The desirable solution appears to be the developmentof collection processes that are integrated with harvesting. By densifying and collecting the material as a part of the harvestingprocess, these fuels could be affordably collected. Collectionmust then be augmented by an efficient delivery system to transportfuels to the plant. Increasing the availability of residuesfrom improved forest management practices. In Californiaand the Pacific Northwest, concerns for habitat protection continueto be strongly supported. However, the economic downturn coupledwith recent experiences with forest fires and the desire to useforest resources to benefit economic growth have spurred effortsto institute forest management practices that consider the benefitsof removing salvageable materials that would otherwise be tinderfor forest fires. The industry that must operate in this regiongenerally feels that the level of emotion that pervades the forumon the use of forest lands is hamstringing productive and environmentallysound uses of the resource. The initiative that the industryis seeking here is to involve DOE and the Forest Service in effortsthat would gain acceptance for good management practices thatprovide for the health of forests while permitting economic useof the available resources. Opportunities to demonstrate thesepractices are being developed by the owners of Biomass One ineastern Oregon at a 5-MWe site. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)has indicated its willingness to offer a renewable generationrate for such projects and the Bonneville Power Administration(BPA) could also be a player in this process. The situation inVermont is similar, but the driving force for access to forestresources has been towards management programs designed to cullthe low-value species that predominate in Vermont woods to allowhigh-value species to make a comeback. Burlington Electric considersits fuel harvest management approach to be a model for the industry. Burlington suggested that one area where federal support couldbe of direct assistance would be in providing resources to thestate forestry and agriculture programs to underwrite the costsof surveying forest resources, developing harvest management plans,and providing manpower for inspection to assure compliance withauthorized harvest plans. This would directly reduce costs bornsolely by the utility that increase fuel procurement costs. Tapping treated mill byproduct materials. In additionto untreated wood byproducts, the industry would like to accessother mill byproduct streams such as pulping process byproductsor treated wood byproducts (fiberboard, plywood). The abilityto economically process these byproducts into transportable fuelforms and burn them without environmental permitting repercussionsis the primary issue. JWP Energy Products, Inc., is concludinga project in Virginia that burns paper mill sludges at a rateof 32 DTPD. Wheelabrator expressed interest in processes thatwould pelletize pulp and paper sludges for fuel. These fuelsare potentially of most value to the mills for cogeneration. Tapping low-value paper byproduct streams. Treatedpaper products such as newsprint, colored or finished paper andchemically impregnated cardboard byproducts are difficult to recycleinto new paper products. Rather than landfill these materials,recycling them as fuels would be desirable. One of the industrycontacts pointed out that the recycling of low-value paper sourcesto produce paper often generates more mill sludge than paper. For these materials, fuel uses may be the higher value use withthe least environmental impact. JWP Energy Products, Inc., isparticularly interested in developing a multi-fueled energy projectin northern Idaho to demonstrate low emissions from today's fluidizedbed combustion technology. Tapping urban wood materialsfrom the solid waste stream. Several efforts are being pursuedthat tap into the urban wood materials supply, thus divertingit from the solid waste stream. Burlington is accepting yardand tree trimmings at the McNeil station. Wheelabrator is inthe process of building a 39-MWe energy facility in Polk County,Florida, that will burn a combination of yard and tree trimmings,used tires, and landfill gas. Thermo Energy has three operatingfacilities and is completing a fourth that use urban wood as afuel source. Use of urban wood has been extensively evaluatedby New York State and others as an important source of fuel forpower production. Use of urban wood directly reduces landfillloading and provides low-cost fuel for power production. Theprimary issue has been concern with air emissions from the useof treated wood products. The NYSERDA work generally indicatesthat with the exception of CCA-treated wood, the exposure risksof combusting most treated wood are very slight or insignificantand meet state guidelines. NYSEG is particularly interested inspecialized used wood streams and is evaluating fuels such asrailroad ties and telephone poles. Forced recycling goals forCalifornia and other jurisdictions may make these fuel sourcesmore accessible. Early development of dedicated feedstocksupply system (DFSS) projects to supplement other fuel sources. Possible use of DFSS as a source of fuel is being consideredfor projects in Alabama, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin, New York,the Tennessee Valley, and California. EPRI is very supportiveof this approach for two reasons: long term supply assurance anddisassociation of biomass from the potential environmental problemsof misusing forest resources, and limitations of byproduct orwaste fuels. Two things appear to be necessary for the DFSS conceptto be accepted as economic for current industry projects-assurancesthat the EPACT 92 production tax credits can be used by the projectand the ability to serve several markets with the biomass products(eg. white wood going to paper production, bark and lesser gradesof wood harvested going to fuel uses). In New York, NYSEG, NiagaraMohawk, and SUNY (Syracuse) are pursuing a trial DFSS projectbased on hybrid willow clones. The fuel produced would be testco-fired in utility coal-fired boilers. In Virginia, poplarsgrown on existing farm acreage are being considered as a potentialfuel supplement option for obtaining a secure long-term fuel supplyrequired by lenders for a wood-fired IPP project. In California,the DFSS option is being given consideration as a supplementalfuel source to provide an alternative to current sources thatare in high demand by competing uses. Ag West Resources has proposeda DFSS project to support the Thermo Energy project at Woodland,California. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)is working with the University of California-Davis to identifythe four most productive DFSS species for the Sacramento valley. With passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)pending, California is very concerned about the decline in stateagriculture with the opening of markets to products produced inMexico. In the Tennessee Valley, DFSS projects offer the abilityto expand the use of biomass fuel sources needed to implementTVA's coal- and wood-cofiring strategy without recourse to harvestsfrom environmentally sensitive resources. Another interestingconcept put forth is the dual purpose use of energy crops as erosioncontrol and ground water filtering systems. This increases thevalue of the DFSS as a dual-purpose system. In the San JoaquinValley, 600,000 eucalyptus and casuarina trees (some poplars alsotested) have been planted to control erosion and absorb seleniumsalts from irrigation runoff.1 4.3 Repowering Existing SteamTurbine Stations Many of the generating units built by IPPswere constructed when available biomass resources were inexpensiveand purchased power agreements were generous. As such, combustionefficiency was not considered a major issue at that time. Aspower purchase agreements expire and new contracts are negotiated,the ability of many of these facilities to continue to be economicallyproductive will be in question. In addition to tougher powercontracts, stricter environmental regulations and a tighter woodsupply situation are threatening the economic health of the industry. In California, IPP and QF biomass power stations now accountfor approximately 4% of total generation for PG&E. Repoweringprojects can improve the efficiency and availability of some ofthese plants to extend their useful life until a new generationof conversion systems becomes commercially available. This isalso true for two other classes of power facilities: wood-firedunits operated by the pulp and paper industry, and aging coal-firedplants operated by the utilities or industry. The pulp and paperindustry would benefit from a greater degree of self sufficiencywhile the utilities could upgrade and extend the life of olderunits. Options include: Gasification of agricultural biomassfuels to fire boilers previously plagued by slagging problems. Low-temperature gasification can produce a fuel gas that willbe free of slagging materials and can be fired in existing boilersat relatively high efficiency and with increased plant availability. There are a number of plants that have plentiful resources ofagricultural byproducts but cannot keep the boiler in operationdue to severe slagging problems. Gasification could provide thesolution to reintroduce the agricultural byproduct fuels intothe operation. Gasification combined cycle retrofits to increaseefficiency and reduce operating costs. Repowering existing boilerswith a gasification combined cycle offers the potential to salvageprojects where fuel costs have made biomass operations uneconomic.Green Mountain Power, with assistancefrom EPRI, is giving this option consideration. Burlington Electric'sMcNeil Station is currently dispatched on an economic basis ata low capacity factor and is a possible candidate for repowering. Approximately 40% of generated power is currently produced usinggas available during the summer at very low cost. Gasificationcombined cycle would reduce fuel operating costs by as much as25%. Paper and wood products industries such as Weyerhaeuserhave expressed interest in the gasification combined cycle withthe intent of being even more self sufficient in terms of self-producingpower for plant operations. 4.4 Modular Scale Prepackaged GeneratingSystems and Custom Built Agripower Systems for International Markets Forinternational markets in areas where power is frequently neededin smaller increments and biomass resources are plentiful, smallscale packaged biomass generators will be very attractive. Severalcompanies are evaluating the market and the technology that wouldbest serve the market. One company, Energeo, is committed todevelopment of those markets with the intent to offer a line ofprepackaged indirect-fired gas turbine generators sized from 200kW up to several Megawatts. PGI is also developing a product (direct-fired small gas turbines)well suited to this market. The opportunity exists for smallscale, modular biomass systems to compete in the internationalmarketplace with diesel-powered generators. By using an inexpensiveindigenous resource, biomass power systems reduce dependence onhigh-cost, imported fossil fuels. Other companies have indicatedinterest in offering prepackaged systems for biomass fuels basedon more conventional conversion equipment. On a larger scale,Agrilectric, JWP Electric, and other companies have targeted theexisting agricultural processing industry as potential power producers. The sector that has attracted the most initial interest is thesugar industry, which typically uses its byproducts to produceprocess heat. By converting to higher efficiency cogenerationequipment at these facilities, the industry and local economystand to benefit by the additional income generated by power sales. Both JWP and Agrilectric offer products that are suited to thecombustion of agricultural fuels. Industries actively pursuinginternational markets are aware of the programs sponsored by USAIDand Winrock and in several instances are already benefiting fromthese 'technical assistance missions' to developingnations. The industry generally felt that these programs werehelpful and should not be duplicated by DOE. One element theseprograms do not address is the need to demonstrate performance,maintainability, and reliability claims of the manufacturers. The need to see, first hand, a system operating on local feedstocksfor an extended period of time (up to one year) and to realizethe projected cost savings for replacing aging diesel equipment,is commonly expressed by the purchasing agents of the governmentsof developing nations. An opportunity exists for DOE to pursuejoint venture projects in strategic locations worldwide that makeit easy for representatives of developing nations to see U.S.-builtsystems in operation. A second issue that is clearly of concernto U.S. firms is the protection of the company's technology rights. Reverse engineering of the patented portions of U.S. equipmentis commonplace. Once a product is available from in-country orregional sources, there is little market left for the U.S. productunless the company licenses the technology to in-country manufacturingconcerns and competes with local manufacturing labor. 4.5 DevelopingMarkets for Biomass Power Byproducts Potential productive usesof biomass ash include: liming agents and nutrients for agriculture,landfill caps, sewage sludge stabilization, and structural fill. The issues for application of biomass ash are regulatory. Inthe state of Washington, wood ash is classified as a hazardouswaste based on pH>12. This restricts both the handling andapplication of the ash for agricultural uses. A far more difficultproblem has arisen in California where rice straw ash has beendeclared hazardous due to its high silica content. One projecthas been stockpiling the ash on site with the potential of becominga hazardous waste clean-up site unless appropriate disposal arrangementsare made. For urban wood materials, the presence of heavy metalsand other contaminants from chemical treatment pose a problemfor ash disposal. The approach recommended by industry to overcomesome of these regional restrictions is to develop environmentalconsensus standards for biomass ash based on the real risks posedfor transport, application, and use. Coproduction of chemicalsand power make it possible to operate plants at full capacityto generate two product streams. For gasification, methanol productionis a logical coproduct. Methanol can be used as a turbine fuel,a transportation fuel, or a chemical feedstock for other processes. Development of coproduction facilities was discussed only asa future option. 4.6 Capturing Legislative and Regulatory Incentives The cofiring and niche opportunities described above may beenhanced considerably by legislative and regulatory incentivesthat encourage the use of renewable resources and resources thathave positive environmental attributes unlike conventional fuels. The picture for the biomass power industry is still somewhatunclear, however. For example, industry is generally aware ofthe nature of the incentives provided under the recently-passedEnergy Policy Act of 1992, but is unsure of the direction of implementation. Thus, the influence of these factors can be potentially positivefor development of biopower projects, but may also lead to a 'waitand see' approach that would postpone projects until a cleardirection for implementation is assured. In addition, a numberof state organizations and utilities have instituted programsthat provide incentives for renewable technologies, and the CleanAir Act Amendments also may provide for improved opportunities. EnergyPolicy Act of 1992 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 includes severalincentives for renewable energy power production, including arenewable power production incentive (section 1212), a tax creditfor renewable energy electricity production (Section 1914), andjoint venture funds for renewable projects (Section 1201). Therenewable energy production incentive provides for a payment fromDOE of 1.5 cents per kWh produced. The coverage for this incentive,however, is limited to plants with ownership by a governmentalentity (such as a state, political subdivision of a state, oran instrumentality of a state) or a nonprofit electrical cooperative. The tax credit is to be part of the General Business Credit,and applies only to qualified closed-loop biomass (and wind) plants,and is set at a maximum of 1.5 cents per kWh. A closed-loopbiomass plant is defined as utilizing crops specifically grownfor fuel for an electricity plant. The amount of the credit isreduced if the average power purchase rates for biomass powerfacilities exceed 8 cents per kWh or if there is federal or othergovernment cost sharing (grants, subsidies, etc.). Both incentives(sections 1212 and 1914) cover the first 10 years of the plant'soperation and are indexed for inflation. A 1.5 cent per kWh productionincentive is equivalent to a $.90 - $1.25 /MMBTU subsidy for thebiomass fuel at a plant with heat rates ranging from 16,000 to12,000 Btu/kWh. This incentive could make a difference for marginalprojects. The industry could easily see the benefits for projectdevelopment but seemed skeptical about being able to realize thepotential benefits. Issues raised by the industry include: The law specifies that the credit applies to 'new facilities'built after 1992. Many of the real opportunities are repoweringor cofiring retrofit projects, which are, by definition, upgradesto existing facilities. As such, the law bypasses some of themost realistic near-term opportunities available for biopowerdevelopment. Early DFSS projects are likely to serve two marketssimultaneously: fiber and fuel. Extension of the definition ofDFSS to cover these projects will increase the chances that DFSSwill be considered by plant developers. The renewable energy jointventures program seems particularly attractive to utilities orproject developers who are considering use of DFSS as a supplementalfuel supply. There is also interest in the use of joint venturefunds for both cofiring and gasification demonstrations. ExternalityValuation and Regulations Many jurisdictions of the U.S. aregiving consideration to the recognition of externalities in theutility resource planning process. The impetus for this considerationcomes from many sources, including implementation of the CleanAir Act Amendments of 1990, state and local legislation/regulations,and a number of other sources. In addition, this recognitioncomes in many forms, but there is no consensus concerning methodologyor the degree to which externalities should impact decision making. In its broadest sense, any credit or debit based on social orenvironmental interests that is used to alter decisions that wouldnormally be based on a purely economic and technical risk assessmentserves as an externality. An immediate example is the proposedBTU tax, which provides a favorable treatment for biomass fuelsfor power generation by exempting them from the tax. The biomassIPP industry generally favors the use of externalities becausethey believe that they will tend to favor renewable energy projectsand, more specifically, biomass fuels. The utilities, on theother hand, generally favor the traditional economic assessmentapproach with qualitative consideration given to other factors. While some utilities are adamantly opposed to the quantitativeuse of externalities, others have developed and used them in theirresource planning process. Some examples include: Vermonthas issued an executive order for 20% CO2 reduction for energyuses and has instituted a renewable power purchase program. Puget Power provides a 10% credit for renewable regenerationsources in bidding. Idaho offers 6.5 cents per kWh for renewablegenerators less than 10 Mwe. The CAAA have instituted allowancetrading for SO2 emissions. The low sulfur content of biomassfuels permits utilities to earn allowances when they substitutebiomass for coal fuels. The California Assembly directed thestate PUC to set aside 50% of future generating capacity for renewables. New York established a program to procure 300 MW of new renewablecapacity by January 1, 1994, if it could be procured at an acceptableprice premium. Iowa established a statewide renewable capacityprocurement of 105 MW at a contract rate of approximately 6 centsper kWh. Wisconsin's PSC approved an investment/purchaseincentive of 0.25 cents per kWh for biomass-generated electricityfor up to 20 years if projects are on-line by December 1998. Atthe level of current externality valuations, most in the industryfelt that the gap between biopower projects and gas turbine projectscould not be made up. There is, however, a good deal of concernabout the possible imposition of carbon taxes or carbon limits. Most of the industry seemed to feel that this could make thedifference as long as the 'no net CO2' principle forbiomass is accepted. Until the rules for valuing reduced CO2emissions are in place, the industry has suggested that a systematicapproach for 'banking' credits for reductions wouldprovide some initial incentive for companies considering biomasscofiring or repowering projects. These early reductions wouldbe credited to the utilities' CO2 accounts pending the impositionof caps and allowance trading. Without such a system there willbe some inertia against reducing what may become the baselineemissions under future regulation.WT02-B17-231IA060-000326-B033-23http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/femp/oct96_yellowstone.html 205.168.79.27 19970115005700 text/html 4865HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 00:57:01 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 17:18:42 GMTContent-length: 4691 The Greening of YellowStone Workshop U.S. Department of Energy Federal Energy Management Program FEMP Focus - October 1996 Greening Initiatives The Greening of YellowStone Workshop Great Ideas for the Next 125 Years for the Park and the Region Yellowstone National Park, which will celebrate its 125th anniversaryin 1997, supports local tourism economies of its gateway communitiesin Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Preservation of the environmentalquality of the Park is vitally important to the economic developmentof the surrounding region. The Greening of Yellowstone Workshopis intended to develop and foster environmentally-favorable practicesin Yellowstone National Park through the promotion of partnershipsamong local communities; State and Federal economic development,energy, and environmental agencies; private industry; and nationaland regional experts. The Workshop will encourage participantsto embrace a shared vision for sustainability of the Park'sfuture and to develop solutions that will help the region continueto balance the protection of Park resources and economic viabilitywhile maintaining visitor use and enjoyment. The workshop was held in West Yellowstone, Montana October 15-18,1996. Participants considered a wide range of sustainable strategiesand products, including a possible regional composting facility,alternate fuel vehicles, replacement of toxic solvents and cleaningproducts, and modification to a more environmentally-friendlyenergy infrastructure. Participants were divided into small topicgroups to accomplish Workshop goals. Topic groups addressed increasedrecreational demands on the Park and developed possible solutionsto ensure the long term economic and environmental health of thisregion. The topic groups were: Energy Infrastructure and Alternatives: This groupfocused on sustainable energy infrastructure in the park and regionand developed initiatives to reduce the amount of pollution producedthrough energy production and use. Approaches included: theuse of alternative fuels and lubricants such as those derivedfrom biomass; implementation of conservation measures; and theuse of "green" utility services, photovoltaics, andother sustainable sources or technologies. Attention was givento winter energy use in buildings and over-snow transportation. Building Materials and Design: This group concentratedon environmentally-friendly designs and on building materialsthat are indigenous, recycled, biodegradable, sustainable, andless toxic than conventional materials. Cleaner Products/Better Practices: This group focusedon the use of environmentally friendly products in park operations,homes, businesses, and local governments and on better agriculturalpractices to reduce impacts on the environment. Attention wasgiven to reducing the load at wastewater treatment facilitiesand addressing surface water runoff and groundwater impacts fromnon-point sources. These practices would also improve land andair quality. Discussions included economic advantages of cleaner,more efficient activities. Transportation Systems and Means: The transportationgroup considered alternative fuel vehicles such as buses fueledwith biodiesel or liquefied natural gas, vans powered with fuelcells, and vehicles operating on ethanol, biodiesel, or electricity. The group also discussed transportation infrastructure, includingalternative modes of transportation, traffic congestion, alternateparking pricing, traffic calming, and the promotion of rural highwayssystems for more efficient and less polluting travel. Waste Management, Recycling and Reuse: The WasteManagement group focused on composting, recycling, and other disposaltopics.

During the past twodecades, though, glazing technology has changed greatly. Research and development into types of glazing have created a new generation ofmaterials that offer improved window efficiency and performance for consumers.While this new generation of glazing materials quickly gains acceptance in themarketplace, the research and development of even more efficient technologiescontinues. Current Options that Increase a Window's Energy Efficiency Manufacturers usually represent the energy efficiency of windows in terms oftheir U-values (conductance of heat) or their R-values (resistance to heatflow). If a window's R-value is high, it will lose less heat than one with alower R-value. Conversely, if a window's U-value is low, it will lose less heat than one with a higher U-value. In other words, U-values are the reciprocals of R-values (U-value= 1/R-value). Usually, window R-values range from 0.9 to 3.0 (and U-values range from 1.1 to0.3), but some highly energy-efficient exceptions also exist. When comparingdifferent windows, you should ensure that all U- or R-values listed bymanufacturers: (1) are based on current standards set by the American Societyof Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), (2) arecalculated for the entire window, including the frame, and not just for thecenter of the glass, and (3) represent the same size and style of window. Today, several types of advanced glazing systems are available to help controlheat loss or gain. The advanced glazings include double- and triple-panewindows with such coatings as low-emissivity (low-e), spectrally selective,heat-absorbing (tinted), or reflective; gas-filled windows; and windowsincorporating combinations of these options. Low-e GlazingsLow-e glazings have special coatings that reduce heat transfer through windows.The coatings are thin, almost invisible metal oxide or semiconductor films thatare placed directly on one or more surfaces of glass or on plastic filmsbetween two or more panes. The coatings typically face air spaces withinwindows and reduce heat flow between the panes of glass. When applied inside a double-pane window, the low-e coating is placed on the outer surface of the inner pane of glass to reflect heat back into the living space during the heating season. This same coating will slightly reduce heat gain during the cooling season. Low-e films are applied in either soft or hard coats. Soft-coat low-efilms degrade when exposed to air and moisture, are easily damaged, and have alimited shelf life, so they are carefully applied by manufacturers in insulatedmultiple-pane windows. Hard low-e coatings, on the other hand, are more durable and can be used in add-on (retrofit) applications. But the energy performance of hard-coat low-efilms is slightly poorer than that of soft-coat films. Windows manufactured with low-efilms typically cost about 10% to 15% more than regular windows, but they reduce energy loss by as much as 30% to 50%. Although low-e films are usually applied during manufacturing, retrofit low-ewindow films are also widely available for do-it-yourselfers. These films areinexpensive compared to total window replacements, last 10 to 15 years withoutpeeling, save energy, reduce fabric fading, and increase comfort. Spectrally Selective CoatingsSpectrally selective (optical) coatings are considered to be the nextgeneration of low-e technologies. These coatings filter out from 40% to 70% of the heat normally transmitted through clear glass, while allowing the full amount of light to betransmitted. Spectrally selective coatings can be applied on various types oftinted glass to produce "customized" glazing systems capable of eitherincreasing or decreasing solar gains according to the aesthetic and climaticeffects desired. Computer simulations have shown that advanced glazings with spectrallyselective coatings can reduce the electric space cooling requirements of newhomes in hot climates by more than 40%. Because of the energy-saving potentialof spectrally selective glass, some utilities now offer rebates to encourageits use. Heat-Absorbing GlazingsAnother technology uses heat-absorbing glazings with tinted coatings to absorbsolar heat gain. Some heat, however, continues to pass through tinted windowsby conduction and reradiation. But inner layers of clear glass or spectrallyselective coatings can be applied with tinted glass to further reduce this heattransfer. Heat-absorbing glass reflects only a small percentage of light andtherefore does not have the mirror-like appearance of reflective glass. Gray- and bronze-tinted windows reduce the penetration of both light and heatinto buildings in equal amounts (i.e., not spectrally selective) and are themost common tint colors used. On the other hand, blue- and green-tinted windowsoffer greater penetration of visible light and slightly reduced heat transfercompared with other colors of tinted glass. When windows transmit less than 70%of visible light, plants inside could die or grow more slowly. In hot climatesblack-tinted glass should be avoided because it absorbs more light than heat. Reflective CoatingsLike black-tinted coatings, reflective coatings greatly reduce the transmissionof daylight through clear glass. Although they typically block more light thanheat, reflective coatings, when applied to tinted or clear glass, can also slowthe transmission of heat. Reflective glazings are commonly applied in hotclimates in which solar control is critical; however, the reduced coolingenergy demands they achieve can be offset by the resulting need for additionalelectrical lighting. Tomorrow's Options for More Efficient Windows "Superwindows" now coming on the market can attain high thermal resistance bycombining multiple low-e coatings; low-conductance gas fills; barriers betweenpanes, which reduce convective circulation of the gas fill; and insulatingframes and edge spacers. Also, optical properties such as solar transmittance can be customized forspecific climate zones. The heat from even a small amount of diffuse wintersunlight will convert these super-windows into net suppliers of energy. Thisfirst generation of superwindows now available have a center-of-glass R-valueof 8 or 9, but have an overall window R-value of only about 4 or 5 because ofedge and frame losses. Also under development are chromogenic (optical switching) glazings that willadapt to the frequent changes in the lighting and heating or coolingrequirements of buildings. These "smart windows" will be separated into eitherpassive or active glazing categories. Passive glazings will be capable of varying their light transmissioncharacteristics according to changes in sunlight (photochromic) and their heattransmittance characteristics according to ambient temperature swings(thermochromic). Active (electrochromic) windows will use a small electriccurrent to alter their transmission properties. Both types should be on themarket within 2 to 5 years. Conclusion No one type of glazing is suitable for every application. Many materials areavailable that serve different purposes. Moreover, consumers may discover thatthey need two types of glazing for a home because of the directions that thewindows face and the local climate. To make wise purchases, consumers shouldfirst examine their heating and cooling needs and prioritize desired featuressuch as daylighting, solar heating, shading, ventilation, and aestheticvalue.

The sun beating down on our homes causes indoor temperatures to rise to uncomfortable levels. Air conditioning provides some relief. But the initial costs of installing an air conditioner and the electricity costs to run it can be high. In addition, conventional air conditioners use refrigerants made of chlorine compounds,suspected contributors to the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. But there are alternatives to air conditioning. This publication provides some common sense suggestions and low-cost retrofit options to help you "keep your cool" -- and save electricity. Staying Cool An alternative way to maintain a cool house or reduce air-conditioning use is natural (or passive) cooling. Passive cooling uses nonmechanical methods to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. The most effective method to cool your home is to keep the heat from building up in the first place. The primary source of heat buildup (i.e., gain) is sunlight absorbed by your house through the roof, walls, and windows. Secondary sources are heat-generating appliances in the home and air leakage. Specific methods to prevent heat gain include reflecting heat (i.e., sunlight) away from your house, blocking the heat, removing built-up heat, and reducing or eliminating heat-generatingsources in your home. Reflecting Heat Away Dull, dark-colored home exteriors absorb 70% to 90% of the radiant energy from the sun that strikes the home s surfaces. Some of this absorbed energy is then transferred into your home by way of conduction, resulting in heat gain. In contrast, light-colored surfaces effectively reflect most of the heat away from your home. Roofs About a third of the unwanted heat that builds up in your home comes in through the roof. This is hard to control with traditional roofing materials. For example, unlike most light-colored surfaces, even white asphalt and fiberglass shingles absorb 70% of the solar radiation. One good solution is to apply a reflective coating to your existing roof. Two standard roofing coatings are available at your local hardware store or lumberyard. They have both waterproof and reflective properties and are marketed primarily for mobile homes and recreational vehicles. One coating is white latex that you can apply over many common roofing materials, such as asphalt and fiberglass shingles, tar paper, and metal. Most manufacturers offer a 5-year warranty. A second coating is asphalt based and contains glass fibers and aluminum particles. You can apply it to most metal and asphalt roofs. Because it has a tacky surface, it attracts dust, which reduces its reflectivity somewhat. Another way to reflect heat is to install a radiant barrier on the underside of your roof. A radiant barrier is simply a sheet of aluminum foil with a paper backing. When installed correctly, a radiant barrier can reduce heat gains through your ceiling by about 25%. Radiant-barrier materials cost between $0.13 per square foot ($1.44 per square meter) for a single-layer product with a kraft-paper backing and $0.30 per square foot ($3.33 per square meter) for a vented multilayer product with a fiber-reinforced backing. The latter product doubles as insulation. Walls Wall color is not as important as roof color, but it does affect heat gain somewhat. White exterior walls absorb less heat than dark walls. And light, bright walls increase the longevity of siding, particularly on the east, west,and south sides of the house. Windows Roughly 40% of the unwanted heat that builds up in your home comes in through windows. Reflective window coatings are one way to reflect heat away from your home. These coatings are plastic sheets treated with dyes or thin layers of metal. Besides keeping your house cooler, these reflective coatings cut glare and reduce fading of furniture, draperies, and carpeting. Two main types of coatings include sun-control films and combination films. Sun-control films are best for warmer climates because they can reflect as much as 80% of the incoming sunlight. Many of these films are tinted, however, and tend to reduce light transmission as much as they reduce heat, thereby darkening the room. Combination films allow some light into a room but they also let some heat in and prevent interior heat from escaping. These films are best for climates that have both hot and cold seasons. Investigate the different film options carefully to select the film that best meets your needs. Note: Do not place reflective coatings on south-facing windows if you want to take advantage of heat gain during the winter. The coatings are applied to the interior surface of the window. Although you can apply the films yourself, it is a good idea to have a professional install the coatings, particularly if you have several large windows. This will ensure a more durable installation and a more aesthetically pleasing look. Blocking the Heat Two excellent methods to block heat are insulation and shading. Insulation helps keep your home comfortable and saves money on mechanical cooling systems such as air conditioners and electric fans. Shading devices block the suns rays and absorb or reflect the solar heat. Insulation Weatherization measures--such as insulating, weatherstripping, and caulking--help seal and protect your house against the summer heat in addition to keeping out the winter cold. For more information on weatherizing your home, see the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC) fact sheet "Caulking and Weatherstripping" and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) fact Sheet" Insulation." The attic is a good place to start insulating because it is a major source of heat gain. Adequately insulating the attic protects the upper floors of a house. Recommended attic insulation levels depend on where you live and the type of heating system you use. For most climates, you want a minimum of R-30. In climates with extremely cold winters, you may want as much as R-49. Again, check the DOE fact sheet "Insulation" on how to determine the ideal level of insulation for your climate. Wall insulation is not as important for cooling as attic insulation because outdoor temperatures are not as hot as attic temperatures. Also, floor insulation has little or no effect on cooling. Although unintentional infiltration of outside air is not a major contributor to inside temperature, it is still a good idea to keep it out. Outside air can infiltrate your home around poorly sealed doors, windows, electrical outlets,and through openings in foundations and exterior walls. Thorough caulking and weatherstripping will control most of these air leaks. Shading Shading your home can reduce indoor temperatures by as much as 20 degrees F (11 degrees C). Effective shading can be provided by trees and other vegetation and exterior or interior shades. Landscaping Landscaping is a natural and beautiful way to shade your home and block the sun. A well-placed tree, bush, or vine can deliver effective shade and add to the aesthetic value of your property. When designing your landscaping, use plants native to your area that survive with minimal care. Trees that lose their leaves in the fall (i.e., deciduous) help cut cooling energy costs the most. When selectively placed around a house, they provide excellent protection from the summer sun and permit winter sunlight to reach and warm your house. The height, growth rate, branch spread, and shape are all factors to consider in choosing a tree. Vines are a quick way to provide shading and cooling. Grown on trellises, vines can shade windows or the whole side of a house. Ask your local nursery which vine is best suited to your climate and needs. Besides providing shade, trees and vines create a cool microclimate that dramatically reduces the temperature (by as much as 9 degrees F [5 degrees C]) in the surrounding area. During photosynthesis, large amounts of water vapor escape through the leaves, cooling the passing air. And the generally dark and coarse leaves absorb solar radiation. You might also consider low ground cover such as grass, small plants, and bushes. A grass-coveredlawn is usually 10 degrees F (6 degrees C) cooler than bare ground in the summer. If you are in an arid or semiarid climate, consider native ground covers that require little water. For more information on landscaping, see the EREC fact sheet "Landscaping for Energy Efficiency." Shading Devices Both exterior and interior shades control heat gain. Exterior shades are generally more effective than interior shades because they block sunlight before it enters windows. When deciding which devices to use and where to use them, consider whether you are willing to open and close them daily or just put them up for the hottest season. You also want to know how they will affect ventilation. Exterior shading devices include awnings, louvers, shutters, rolling shutters and shades, and solar screens. Awnings are very effective because they block direct sunlight. They are usually made of fabric or metal and are attached above the window and extend down and out. A properly installed awning can reduce heat gain up to 65% on southern windows and 77% on eastern windows. Alight-colored awning does double duty by also reflecting sunlight. Maintaining a gap between the top of the awning and the side of your house helps vent accumulated heat from under a solid-surface awning. If you live in a climate with cold winters, you will want to remove awnings for winter storage, or buy retractable ones, to take advantage of winter heat gain. The amount of drop (how far down the awning comes) depends on which side of your house the window is on. An east or west window needs a drop of 65% to 75% of the window height. A south-facingwindow only needs a drop of 45% to 60% for the same amount of shade. A pleasing angle to the eye for mounting an awning is 45 degrees. Make sure the awning does not project into the path of foot traffic unless it is at least 6 feet 8 inches (2 meters) from the ground. One disadvantage of awnings is that they can block views, particularly on the east and west sides. However, slatted awnings do allow limited viewing through the top parts of windows. Louvers are attractive because their adjustable slats control the level of sunlight entering your home and, depending on the design, can be adjusted from inside or outside your house. The slats can be vertical or horizontal. Louvers remain fixed and are attached to the exteriors of window frames. Shutters are movable wooden or metal coverings that, when closed, keep sunlight out. Shutters are either solid or slatted with fixed or adjustable slats. Besides reducing heat gain, they can provide privacy and security. Some shutters help insulate windows when it is cold outside. Rolling shutters have a series of horizontal slats that run down along a track. Rolling shades use a fabric. These are the most expensive shading options, but they work well and can provide security. Many exterior rolling shutters or shades can be conveniently controlled from the inside. One disadvantage is that when fully extended, they block all light. Solar screens resemble standard window screens except they keep direct sunlight from entering the window, cut glare, and block light without blocking the view or eliminating air flow. They also provide privacy by restricting the view of the interior from outside your house. Solar screens come in a variety of colors and screening materials to compliment any home. Although do-it-yourselfkits are available, these screens will not last as long as professionally built screens. Although interior shading is not as effective as exterior shading, it is worthwhile if none of the previously mentioned techniques are possible. There are several ways to block the sun's heat from inside your house. Draperies and curtains made of tightly woven, light-colored, opaque fabrics reflect more of the sun's rays than they let through. The tighter the curtain is against the wall around the window, the better it will prevent heat gain. Two layers of draperies improve the effectiveness of thedraperies insulation when it is either hot or cold outside. Venetian blinds, although not as effective as draperies, can be adjusted to let in some light and air while reflecting the sun's heat. Some newer blinds are coated with reflective finishes. To be effective, the reflective surfaces must face the outdoors. Some interior cellular (honeycombed) shades also come with reflective mylar coatings. But they block natural light and restrict air flow. Opaque roller shades are effective when fully drawn but also block light and restrict air flow. Removing Built-Up Heat Nothing feels better on a hot day than a cool breeze. Encouraging cool air to enter your house forces warm air out, keeping your house comfortably cool. However, this strategy only works when the inside temperature is higher than the outside temperature. Natural ventilation maintains indoor temperatures close to outdoor temperatures and helps remove heat from your home. But only ventilate during the coolest parts of the day or night, and seal off your house from the hot sun and air during the hottest parts of the day. The climate you live in determines the best ventilation strategy. In areas with cool nights and very hot days, let the night air in to cool your house. A well-insulated house will gain only 1 degree F (0.6 degree C) per hour if the outside temperature is 85 degrees to 90 degrees F (29 degrees to 32 degrees C). By the time the interior heats up, the outside air should be cooler and can be allowed indoors. In climates with daytime breezes, open windows on the side from where the breeze is coming and on the opposite side of the house. Keep interior doors open to encourage whole-house ventilation. If your location lacks consistent breezes, create them by opening windows at the lowest and highest points in your house. This natural "thermosiphoning," or "chimney," effect can be taken a step further by adding a clerestory or a vented skylight. In hot, humid climates where temperature swings between day and night are small, ventilate when humidity is not excessive. Ventilating your attic greatly reduces the amount of accumulated heat, which eventually works its way into the main part of your house. Ventilated attics are about 30 degrees F (16 degrees C) cooler than unventilated attics. Properly sized and placed louvers and roof vents help prevent moisture buildup and overheating in your attic. For more information on ventilation, see the EREC fact sheet "Fans and Ventilation." Reducing Heat-Generating Sources Often-overlooked sources of interior heat gain are lights and household appliances, such asovens, dishwashers, and dryers. Because most of the energy that incandescent lamps use is given off as heat, use them only when necessary. Take advantage of daylight to illuminate your house. And consider switching to compact fluorescent lamps. These use about 75% less energy than incandescent lamps, and emit 90% less heat for the same amount of light. For more information on lighting, see the EREC fact sheet "Energy-Efficient Lighting." Many household appliances generate a lot of heat. When possible, use them in the morning or late evening when you can better tolerate the extra heat. Consider cooking on an outside barbecue grill or use a microwave oven, which does not generate as much heat and uses less energy than a gas or electric range. Washers, dryers, dishwashers, and water heaters also generate large amounts of heat and humidity. To gain the most benefit, seal off your laundry room and water heater from the rest of the house. New, energy-efficient appliances generate less heat and use less energy. When it is time to purchase new appliances, make sure they are energy efficient. All refrigerators, dishwashers, and dryers display an EnergyGuide label indicating the annual estimated cost for operating the appliance or a standardized energy efficiency ratio. Compare appliances and buy the most efficient models for your needs. For more information, see the EREC fact sheet "A Guide to Making Energy-Smart Purchases." Saving Energy Using any or all of these strategies will help keep you cool. Even if you use air conditioning, many of these strategies, particularly reflecting heat and shading, will help reduce the energy costs of running an air conditioner. However, adopting all of these strategies may not be enough. Sometimes you need to supplement natural cooling with mechanical devices. Fans and evaporative coolers can supplement your cooling strategies and cost less to install and run than air conditioners. Ceiling fans make you feel cooler. Their effect is equivalent to lowering the air temperature by about 4 degrees F (2 degrees C). Evaporative coolers use about one-fourth the energy of conventional air conditioners. Many utility companies offer rebates and other cost incentives when you purchase or install energy-saving products, such as insulation and energy-efficient lighting and appliances. Contact your local utility company to see what it offers in the way of incentives. Source List There are hundreds of groups that can provide you with more information on natural cooling strategies.

Many times the homeowner's only regret isthat the sunspace is not larger. Although aesthetics often drive the decisionto add a sunspace or include one in a new home design, sunspaces can alsoprovide supplemental space heating and a healthy environment for plants andpeople. In fact, a well-designed sunspace can provide up to 60% of a home's winter heating requirements. This publication will address basic elements of sunspace design; designconsiderations for supplemental space heating, growing plants, and use as aliving space; design guidelines including siting, heat distribution, andglazing angles; and major components including glazing options, thermal mass,insulation, and climate controls. A list of sources for more information havealso been provided. Basic Elements In a basic design, sunlight passes through glass or other glazing and warms thesunspace. The glazing is either vertical (as typical windows are installed) orsloped at an angle. To moderate temperature swings, massive materials (e.g.,masonry or water) can be used to store the sun's thermal energy and absorb theheat. At night or during extended periods of cloudy weather, this "thermalmass" releases the heat it holds to warm the interior of the sunspace. Ceiling,wall, foundation, and window insulation in the sunspace minimize heat loss atnight and during cold weather. Climate control features include operablewindows, vents, and fans to keep the sunspace from overheating and to circulatethe warm air to other parts of the house. Energy Efficiency Comes First Design Considerations for Different Functions Sunspaces serve three main functions: they are a source of auxiliary heat, theyprovide space to grow plants, and they are enjoyable living areas. The designconsiderations for these functions are very different, and although it ispossible to build a sunspace that will serve all three functions, somecompromises will be necessary. If the primary function of the room is only to provide heat, you can maximizeheat gain by using sloped glazing, few plants, little thermal mass, andinsulated, unglazed end walls. If the winters are sunny in your area, carefullysized thermal mass will prevent extreme overheating during the day. Inpractice, sunspaces are rarely built to serve only as heaters, because thereare less expensive ways to provide solar heat. If the space will mainly be used as a greenhouse, remember that plants needfresh air, water, lots of light, and protection from extreme temperatures.Greenhouses consume energy through the growth processes of plants and theevaporation of water: one pound of evaporating water uses about 1000 Btu thatwould otherwise be available as heat. Plants require overhead glazing, whichcomplicates construction and maintenance, and glazed end walls, which are netheat losers. The bottom line is that a sunspace designed as an idealhorticultural environment is unlikely to have much energy left over forsupplementary space heating. Most people want to use their sunspaces as year-round living areas, sosunspaces should have minimum glare and only moderate humidity. Carefully sizedthermal mass will greatly improve comfort levels by stabilizing temperatureextremes. Thermal mass materials should be placed in direct sunlight and shouldnot be covered with rugs, furniture, or plants. Movable window insulation oradvanced glazings minimize nighttime heat losses and greatly improve comfort. Sunspace Design Guidelines Passive solar structures are conceptually simple, but sunspace designers andbuilders must pay close attention to detail to ensure maximum performance andreliability of the structures. Computer software is now available to help establish design and performancecriteria for specific passive solar projects like sunspaces. This softwaremakes it relatively easy to avoid making uninformed, potentially costly, anddisappointing decisions about a sunspace addition. Some sources for softwareare identified in the Source List at the end of this publication. Siting A sunspace must face south. Due solar south is ideal, but 30 degrees east or west ofdue south is acceptable. If your project is a retrofit, consider how the newaddition will look on the south side of your house. If the south side faces thestreet, the design must be well integrated into the home to avoid a "tacked-on"look. And, you will need to protect your family's privacy. If the south side ofyour house faces the backyard, privacy may be less of an issue. Because the sun is low in the sky in the winter, any obstacle over 10 feet (3meters) tall within 15 feet (4.6 meters) of the south glazing is likely toblock solar gain. If the sunspace will be shaded only in the early morning orlate afternoon, there is no major cause for concern. It is important, however,that the space receive direct sunlight between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Do notplant trees near the south glazing, and seriously consider removing existingtrees from the area. Contrary to prior opinion, even deciduous trees that losetheir leaves in the winter are capable of blocking the sun. In fact, a mature,well-formed deciduous tree will screen more than 40% of the winter sunlight passing throughits branch structure. If you have a choice, locate the sunspace so that the walls of the house serveas one or both end walls of the sunspace (to reduce heat loss) and the additionis adjacent to kitchens, dining areas, children's playrooms, and family livingareas occupied during the day and early evening. Heat Distribution Warm air can be blown through ductwork to other living areas. It can also movepassively from the sunspace into the house through doors, vents, or openwindows between the sunspace and the interior living space. Strategicallyplaced openings in the common wall can distribute the warmed air from thesunspace to the house by the "thermosiphoning" circulation of the air. In athermosiphon, warm air rises in the sunspace and passes into the adjoiningspace through an opening, and cool air from the adjoining space is drawn intothe sunspace to be heated. The minimum opening should be about 8 square feet (0.7 square meters) per 100square feet (9.3 square meters) of glazing area. If the design calls for twoopenings--one high in the sunspace and one low--the minimum area for eachopening is approximately 2.5 square feet (0.2 square meters) per 100 squarefeet (9.3 square meters) of glazing, with 8 vertical feet (2.4 meters) ofseparation. Again, these are rules of thumb that should be refined throughcomputer modeling or confirmed with local experts. An uninsulated masonry wallbetween the house and the sunspace will also transfer some heat into the livingspace by conduction. Glazing: Sloped or Vertical?Although sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter, many designers prefervertical glazing or a combination of vertical and sloped glazing. Slopedglazing loses more heat at night and can cause overheating in warmer weather.Vertical glazing allows maximum gain in winter, when the angle of the sun islow, and less heat gain as the sun rises toward its summer zenith. A well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer. Compared with sloped glazing, vertical glazing is less expensive, easier toinstall and insulate, and not as prone to leaking, fogging, breaking, and otherglazing failures. Vertical glazing is often more aesthetically compatible withthe design of existing homes. Sunspace Components Glazing Glazing is the clear or translucent material that allows sunlight to enter andwarm the space. Glass is the most common glazing material, and many sunspacebuilders choose glass for its durability, clarity, and appearance. However,plastic glazings can be cheaper, stronger, lighter, and easier to workwith--making them popular choices with the 20% of homeowners who build theirown sunspaces. Some plastics even transmit solar energy more effectively thanglass. On the down side, plastics scratch more easily, expand and contract morein response to temperature extremes (making them harder to seal), and generallyare less durable than glass. Deciding on which glazing to use is only the first step in the decision-makingprocess, however. Advances in glazing technology make it possible for designersto fine-tune performance by choosing glazings that meet the specific needs oftheir projects. Historically, manufacturers have used multiple layers of glass to improve theinsulating value of a window. In addition to making the unit more energyefficient, extra layers of glass also increased the weight and bulk--aswell as the price--of the unit. However, today's low-emissivity (low-e)coatings--thin, invisible metal or metallic oxide films--haverevolutionized the glazing industry. Low-e coatings are applied to the surface of glazings or to films suspended in theairspaces between the panes of glass. They reduce radiant heat loss and gainand dramatically improve a window's insulating value. For example, double-glazed,low-e windows are about as energy efficient as triple-glazed windows using regular glass, but they cost and weigh less. Note that there have been reports that windows with less than 70% visible light transmittance might support plant growth. When argon, sulphur hexafluoride, carbon dioxide, or other gas fills withhigher insulating values than air are included between glazings, the energyefficiency of windows is further improved. Although the extra layers of glazingand low-e coatings lower total light transmittance somewhat, the reduction is more thanoffset by the increased amount of heat remaining in the room. Other new window technologies include spectrally selective coatings (the next generation of low-e films) that reject heat while admitting light, electrochromic glazings that lighten and darken as small electric currents are applied and removed, and "superwindows" that combine a number of features (e.g., low-e coatings, gas fills, and insulating frames and spacers) into one unit. If you decide to use overhead glazing in the roof of your sunspace, invest inone of the glazing systems developed specifically for this purpose. Overheadglazing has a reputation for leaking, but excellent sealing systems are now onthe market. Invest in a good system--this is not a place to cut corners. Insome areas, building codes require that you use plastic glazing or tempered orlaminated glass in overhead and sloped glazing sections for safety reasons. Which glazing system is most appropriate for your project depends on yourbudget and the climatic conditions at your site. For more detailed informationon current and future glazing options, contact the Energy Efficiency andRenewable Energy Clearinghouse (see Source List). Thermal Mass Considerations Water is the most efficient thermal mass, because it holds the most heat perunit of volume. Anything that will not leak will work to hold the water, anddesigners and homeowners have used everything from plastic jugs to 55-gallon(208-liter) drums to specially designed (and often very attractive) containers. Masonry materials (brick, concrete, or stone) are also good choices for thermalmass. Although they store only about half as much heat as water, they can alsosupport the structure, form the floor of the space, and serve as the wallbetween the house and the sunspace. Masonry is most effective in 4- to 6-inch(10- to 15-centimeter) thicknesses. If walls are built with concrete blocks,the holes in the blocks must be filled with concrete. The surfaces of thermal mass materials should be dark colors of at least 70%absorptance. Black has about a 95% absorptance rate, deep blue has about 90%,and deep red approximately 86%. Nonstorage materials should be lighter colorsso they will reflect light to the thermal mass not located in the sun. Thermalstorage materials can be located in the floor and in the north, east, and westwalls of the sunspace. When masonry floors and walls are the only thermal storage materials in thespace, 3 square feet (0.3 square meters) of 4-inch-thick (10-centimeter-thick)masonry surface per square foot of south glazing is probably adequate. Whenwater in containers is the only heat storage medium used, the recommended ratiois 3 gallons (11.3 liters) per square foot (0.09 square meter) of glazing.These are only rules of thumb and should be confirmed by modeling your projecton a computer or checking with a design or building professional in your areawho is familiar with local design practices. Insulation To maximize comfort and efficiency, it is important that your sunspace be wellinsulated. The perimeter of the sunspace's foundation wall or slab should beinsulated down to the frost line (i.e., the depth at which frost penetrates thesoil) and underneath the slab if it is appropriate in your area. If you live ina very cold climate, insulate the east and west walls of the sunspace ratherthan glazing them. Always insulate the sections of exterior walls that are notglazed. Check with solar specialists in your area or the resources cited in theSource List for guidance on your particular project. Although overhead glazing can be beautiful, an insulated roof provides betterthermal performance. When the highest part of the structure is well insulated,heat loss in winter is reduced, and the summer sun will not strike the interiorwall and cause overheating. Instead, skylights can be used to provide someoverhead light for plants. And, if they are the type that open, skylights offera way to vent excess heat. Skylights are available with advanced glazings thatreduce radiant heat loss to the night sky. Window coverings, shades, and other forms of movable insulation help trap thewarm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather.When closed during extremely hot days, window coverings can help keep thesunspace from overheating. Thermally isolating the sunspace from the house at night is important. Largeglass panels, French doors, or sliding glass doors between the house and thesunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with anopen space. Climate Controls Overheating can kill plants and make the sunspace unlivable. To controloverheating, some designers place operable vents at the top of the sunspacewhere temperatures are the highest and at the bottom where temperatures are thelowest. For times when you are not home to open vents manually,thermostatically controlled motors can be installed to automatically open them. If passive (i.e., nonmechanical) circulation is not possible or practical, fanswith thermostatic controls can be used to circulate air to the rest of thehouse. Other types of climate controls include shades or movable windowinsulation that can be operated with electric timers or sensors. An Investment in Future Enjoyment Few home improvements offer the aesthetic appeal and practical paybacks that acarefully designed and constructed sunspace can. Although you may be tempted totackle the endeavor on your own, it is money well spent to consult with a solarengineer, architect, or contractor. They will provide feedback, as well as acomputer analysis of your design. Remember: It is much less expensive to makechanges on paper than to alter a sunspace once it is built. And after yoursunspace is finished, you can enjoy it for years to come.

History Early in the 20th century, Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnesobserved that mercury displayed no electricalresistance when cooled to very low temperatures. With this observation, the study of superconductivity was born. For the next several decades, superconductors remained a scientific curiositywith few practical applications. Then in the 1960s a practical superconducting metal wire made of niobium andtin was developed. That wire, later made of a niobium and titanium alloy,became the basis for the first applications of superconductors. The niobium and titanium alloy, still in use today, is among the materialscalled low-temperature superconductors. Low-temperaturesuperconductors must be cooled to below 20 Kelvin (K) (-253oCelsius [C]) in order to become superconducting. They are nowwidely used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, machines, andin the fields of high-energy physics and nuclear fusion.Additional commercial use has been limited largely by the highrefrigeration costs associated with liquid helium, which is needed to cool thematerials to such low temperatures. The hope for low-cost superconductivity was ignited by twosignificant discoveries in the 1980s. In 1986, two IBM scientistsin Zurich, Alex Müller and Georg Bednorz, discovered a new classof superconductors. Unlike the low-temperature superconductors,which were metallic or semimetallic, these new compounds wereceramic and were superconducting up to 35 K (-238oC). Müller andBednorz won a Nobel Prize for their discovery. Then in 1987, PaulChu at the University of Houston took the discovery one stepfurther and announced a compound that became superconducting at94 K (-179oC). This discovery was particularly significantbecause this compound could be cooledwith cheap and readily available liquid nitrogen. These newmaterials were dubbed high-temperature superconductors. Today's high-temperature superconductors are moving out of thelaboratory and into the marketplace. Bismuth-basedcompounds are being fashioned into superconducting wires andcoils, which are essential to electric power uses. Thallium- andyttrium-based compounds are being formed into the thin films used in electronicdevices. And, as superconductivity moves into the 21st century,products such as superconducting motors, generators, fault-current limiters, energy storage systems, and power cablespromise to change forever the way electricity is generated,delivered, and used.

If the soil is compacted, till it to an area at leastfive times the diameter of the root ball. Plant your new trees and shrubs on a cool or overcast day to reduce the stressof relocating. Dig a hole in the tilled soil. The hole diameter should be roughly twice the diameter of the root ball butthe same height as the root ball. If your soil is very heavy or sandy, mix quality compost or potting soil with the soil removed from the hole. Remove the plant from its container, gently freeing its roots. If the root ball is surrounded by burlap or wire, remove this before planting. Place the tree or shrub in the hole so that it sits at its original soil line. Firmly, but gently, fill the hole half full of the soil removed from the hole, and lightly tamp the area around theroot ball to remove air pockets. Water well, then fill the hole to the top with soil. Water again. Build a watering basin 3 inches to 4 inches (8 centimeters to 10 centimeters) high around the new plant, about twicethe diameter of the root ball. To retain root moisture and reduce weeds, cover the ground around the new plant with 4 inches (10 centimeters) ofmulch. Use well-aged organic materials such as old leaves and grass clippings, bark, and aged sawdust or woodchips. Keep the plant well watered for the first year, but be careful not to drown it! Watering deeply twice a week isusually sufficient.WT02-B17-250IA060-000326-B036-278http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/erec/factsheets/rnwenrgy.html 205.168.79.27 19970115011921 text/html 25737HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 01:19:26 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 30 May 1996 22:12:34 GMTContent-length: 25562 Learning about Renewable Energy Learning About Renewable Energy Can you imagine life without television, cars, or computers? What if you had to cook your dinner over a fire or fetch water from a river? It might be fun for a camping trip, but you probably would not want to do it every day. But that's how life was before scientists and inventors discovered ways to use energy to make our lives easier. Today, most of the energy we use comes from fossil fuels. Coal, oil, and natural gas are all fossil fuels. Over millions of years, the decay of plants, dinosaurs, and other animals was formed into fossil fuels. These fuels lie buried between layers of earth and rock. The only way to get them out is to drill or mine for them. While fossil fuels are still being created today by underground heat and pressure, they are being consumed more rapidly than they are created. For that reason, fossil fuels are considerednonrenewable; that is, they are not replaced as soon as we use them. So, we could run out of them sometime in the future. Or, we might someday use so much fossil fuel that we won't be able to drill or mine fast enough to keep up with the demand. Because our world depends so much on energy, we need to find sources of energy that will last a long time. What if there was a type of energy that never ran out? There is. It is called renewable energy. In addition, because there are so many people on the earth using fossil fuels, we create a lot of pollution. So, we should also use energy sources that produce as little pollution as possible. While all energy sources cause some pollution in their creation or their consumption, renewable energy systems generally are less polluting than fossil fuel systems. What is renewable energy? Renewable energy systems use resources that are constantly replaced and are usually less polluting. Examples of renewable energy systems include solar, wind, and geothermal energy (getting energy from the heat in the earth). We also get renewable energy from trees and plants, rivers, and even garbage. Solar energy We can use the energy in sunshine to warm and light our homes, heat our water, and provide electricity to power our lights, stoves, refrigerators, and other appliances. This energy comes from processes called solar heating, solar water heating, photovoltaic energy (converting sunlight directly into electricity), and solar thermal electric power (when the sun's energy is concentrated to heat water and produce steam, which is used to produce electricity). Solar heating Have you ever sat in a car that was closed up on a sunny day? Did you notice how hot it was in the car? This warmth is just one example of solar heating. We can use the sun to heat other things, including our homes. Today, more than 200,000 houses in the United States have been designed to use features that take advantage of the sun's energy. These homes often use passive solar designs, which do not normally requirepumps, fans, or other mechanical equipment to store and distribute the sun's energy. In contrast, active solar designs need additional mechanical components. A passive solar home or building naturally collects the sun's heat through large, south-facing windows, which are just one aspect of passive design. Once the heat is inside, we need to capture and absorb it. Think about a sunny spot on the floor of your house on a cold day. That "sun spot" is nice and warm, right? It is warm because it holds the sun's heat, and we call such things absorbers. In solar buildings, sunspaces are built onto the south side of the structure and act as large absorbers. The floors of sunspaces are usually made of tiles or bricks that absorb heat throughout the day, then release heat. When the air is colder than the floor, the tiles or bricks release the heat to the air. For more information on sunspaces, contact the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (see the list of Resources at the end of this publication). A challenge with solar heating is keeping the heat inside the house. One way to do this is to use special windows that reflect the heat back into the house. Another aspect of solar heating is that the house absorbs heat even during hot weather, when the last thing you need is more heat! So, passive solar homes need to be designed to let the heat in during cold months and block the sun in the hot months. How can you do this? You can use deciduous trees or bushes in front of the south-facing windows. These plants lose their leaves in the winter and allow most of the sun in, while in the summer, the leaves will block out a lot of the sunshine and heat. Or, you can design your house to have overhangs above the south-facing windows. This will block out the summersunshine when the sun is high in the sky but let it in when the sun is lower in the winter. Solar water heating The sun also can heat water for bathing and laundry. Most solar water-heating systems have two main parts: the solar collector and the storage tank. The collector heats the water, which then flows to the storage tank. The storage tank can be just a modified water heater, but ideally it should be a larger, well-insulated tank. The water stays in the storage tank until it is needed for something, say a shower or to run the dishwasher. A common collector is called a flat-plate collector, and is usually mounted on the roof. This collector is a rectangular box with a transparent cover that faces the sun. Small tubes run through the box, carrying the water or other fluid such as antifreeze to be heated. The tubes are mounted on a metal absorber plate, which is painted black to absorb the sun's heat. The back and sides of the box are insulated to hold in the heat. Heat builds up in the collector, and as the fluid passes through the tubes, it heats up. Like solar-designed buildings, solar water-heating systems can be either active or passive. The most common systems are active, which means they use pumps to move the heated fluid from the collector and into the storage tank. For more information about heating water with the sun, contact the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse. While a solar water-heating system can work well, it can't heat water when the sun isn't shining -- and we all know it can be cloudy for days at a time! For that reason, homes also have conventional backup systems that use fossil fuels. Photovoltaic energy The sun's energy can also be made directly into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells, sometimes called solar cells. PV cells make electricity without moving, making noise, or polluting. They are used in calculators and watches. They also provide power to satellites, electric lights, and small electrical appliances such as radios. PV cells are even being used to provide electricity for homes, villages, and businesses. Some electric utility companies are building PV systems into their power supply networks. Although the PV cells used in calculators and watches are tiny -- less than a half inch (1.2 centimeters) in diameter -- PV cells for larger power systems are about 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter. When more power is needed, PV cells can be wired together to form a module. A module of about 40 cells is often enough to power a small light bulb. For more power, PV modules are wired together into an array. PV arrays can produce enough power to meet the electrical needs of your house -- or for even larger uses. Today, PV systems are mostly used for water pumping, highway lighting, weather stations, and other electrical systems located away from power lines. For example, if you had a cabin on a mountain top, a PV system would allow you to read some of your favorite books before you went to sleep! Because PV systems can be expensive, they are not used in areas that have electricity nearby. But if someone needs electricity in a remote place, PV can be quite economical. Another aspect of PV power is "intermittency," which means that if the sun isn't shining, the system can't make electricity. Because PV systems only produce electricity when the sun is shining, these remote systems need batteries to store theelectricity. Solar thermal electric power Solar thermal systems can also change sunlight into electricity, but not in the same way as PV cells. In most cases, solar thermal systems concentrate (focus) sunlight to produce heat. This heat boils water to make steam. The steam rotates a turbine, which is made of several rows of blades mounted on a large shaft. The steam's pressure flows through the turbine, pushes against the blades, and causes the shaft to turn, much like you can make a pinwheel spin by blowing on it. The turbine is attached to a generator that makes electricity. Like electricity from PV systems, solar thermal power can be intermittent. To avoid this problem, many systems use backup systems that rely on natural gas to heat the water. Because solar thermal systems concentrate the sun's energy, they need to be located in areas of the world that receive a lot of intense sunshine. Wind power Did you know that wind is considered an indirect form of solar energy? This is because the wind is driven mainly by temperature differences on the surface of the earth that are caused by sunshine. For centuries, the wind has been used to sail ships, grind grain, and pump water. Now, people use the wind to generate electricity. The windmills built long ago had many blades, but today's wind turbines usually have just two or three blades that turn when the wind blows. But the blades on wind turbines are much longer than those you might see on a windmill. In fact, wind turbine blades can be up to 82 feet (25 meters) long! The blades drive a generator that produces electricity, much like steam turbines. The longer the blades and the faster the wind speed, the more electricity the turbine generates. Wind turbines are placed on towers because the wind blows harder and more steadily above the ground. To produce the most electricity, wind turbines need to be located in areas where the wind blows at a constant speed, which it does not do in all parts of the world. Wind speed is described by seven "classes." For example, Class 7 winds are extremely strong, while Class 2 winds are mild breezes. Generally, Class 4 winds and above are considered adequate for wind turbines to produce electricity. Large groups of wind turbines, called wind farms or wind plants, are connected to electric utility power lines and provide electricity to many people. New turbine designs now take advantage of less windy areas by using better blades, more electronic controls, and other improvements. Some new turbines can also operate efficiently over a wide range of wind speeds. An advantage of wind turbines over some forms of renewable energy is that they can produce electricity whenever the wind blows (at night and also during the day). In theory, wind systems can produce electricity 24 hours every day, unlike PV systems that can't make power at night. However, even in the windiest places, the wind does not blow all the time. So, while wind farms don't need batteries for backup storage ofelectricity, small wind systems do need backup batteries. And, we're still learning about local wind patterns and how they affect wind turbines and blades. Geothermal energy We can also get energy directly from the heat in the earth. This is known as geothermal energy, from "geo" for earth and "thermal" for heat. Geothermal energy starts with hot, molten rock (called magma) miles below the earth's surface that heats a section of the earth's crust. The heat rising from the magma warms underground pools of water known as geothermal reservoirs. Sometimes the water can even boil to produce steam. If there is an opening through the rock to the surface, the hot underground water may seep out to form hot springs, or it may boil to form geysers. One such geyser that you may have seen is Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park. For thousands of years, people have been using hot springs for bathing and for cooking food. With today's technology, we do not have to wait for the hot water to come to the earth's surface. Instead, we can drill wells deep below the surface of the earth to tap into geothermal reservoirs. This is called direct use of geothermal energy, and it provides a steady stream of hot water that is pumped to the earth's surface so its heat can be used. Geothermal energy also is used to produce electricity. Similar to solar thermal electricity, steam -- either pulled directly from the geothermal reservoir or from water heated to make steam -- is piped to the power plant. There, it rotates a turbine that generates electricity. One source of geothermal power is The Geysers geothermal field located in northern California. This power plant is the largest source of geothermal energy in the world and produces as much power as two large coal or nuclear power plants. While geothermal energy is a good source of power, we could run out of it by drawing so much energy out of the reservoirs that they are not able to replenish themselves at the rates we're using them. In addition, water from geothermal reservoirs often contains minerals that are corrosive and polluting. Biomass energy When you burn a log in your fireplace or in a campfire, you are using biomass energy. Because plants and trees depend on sunlight to grow, biomass energy is a form of stored solar energy. Although wood is the largest source of biomass energy, we also use corn, sugarcane wastes, and other farming by-products. There are three ways to use biomass. It can be burned to produce heat and electricity, changed to a gas-like fuel such as methane, or changed to a liquid fuel. Liquid fuels, also called biofuels, include two forms of alcohol: ethanol and methanol. Because biomass can be changed directly into a liquid fuel, it could someday supply much of our transportation fuel needs for cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, and trains. This is very important because nearly one-third of our nation's energy is now used for transportation. Diesel fuel can also be replaced by biodiesel made from vegetable oils! In the United States, this fuel is now being produced from soybean oil. However, any vegetable oil -- corn, cottonseed, peanut, sunflower, or canola -- could be used to produce biodiesel. Researchers are also developing algae that produce oils, which can be converted to biodiesel. The most commonly used biofuel in the United States is ethanol, which is produced from corn and other grains. A blend of gasoline and ethanol is already used in cities with high air pollution. However, ethanol made from corn is currently more expensive than gasoline on a gallon-for-gallon basis. And even if we took all the corn that could possibly be grown in the United States and used it to produce ethanol, it would not make enough ethanol to power all our cars. So, it is very important for scientists to find less expensive ways to produce ethanol from other biomass crops. Today, we have found new ways to produce ethanol from grasses, trees, bark, sawdust, paper, and farming wastes. These processes could greatly increase the use of biomass energy in the United States. Imagine a new type of farm where energy crops, such as fast-growing trees or grasses, might be grown and harvested for their energy content! Of course, like many resources, we need to manage our use of biomass or we might consume it faster than we produce it. Also, like any fuel, biomass creates some pollutants when it is burned or converted into energy. Hydropower The water in rivers and streams can be captured and turned into hydropower, also called hydroelectric power. The most common form of hydropower uses dams on rivers to create large reservoirs of water. Water released from the reservoirs flows through turbines, causing them to spin. The turbines are connected to generators that produce electricity. Hydroelectric power plants in the United States generate enough electricity to power whole towns, cities, and even entire regions of the country. Hydropower currently is one of the largest sources of renewable power, generating about 10 percent of the United States' electricity. Hydropower is also inexpensive, and like many other renewable energy sources, it does not produce air pollution. However, the drawback to hydropower is that damming a river can change the ecology of the region. For example, the water below the dam is often colder than what would normally flow down the river, so fish sometimes die. The water level of the river below the dam can be higher or lower than its natural state, which affects the plants that growalong the riverbanks. Energy from trash What you may throw out in your garbage today just might become fuel for someone else. That's right, whether you call it trash or garbage, this municipal solid waste has the potential to be a large energy source. In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the United States generated 207 million tons (188 million metric tons) of trash. Out of all that trash, however, only 32 million tons (29 million metric tons) were converted to energy. Garbage is also an inexpensive energy resource. Unlike most other energy resources, someone will collect garbage, deliver it to the power plant, and pay to get rid of it. This helps cover the cost of turning the garbage into energy. Garbage is also a unique resource because we all contribute to it. Municipal solid waste can be burned in large power plants to generate electric power. Municipal waste-to-energy plants currently generate about 2500 megawatts of electricity -- the equivalent of several large coal plants. There is also a way to use the energy trapped in landfill garbage. When food scraps and other wastes decay, a gas called methane is produced. Methane is the main ingredient in natural gas. We can drill wells into landfills to release this gas. Pipes from each well carry the methane gas to a central point where it is cleaned. The gas can then be burned to produce steam in a boiler, or it can be used to power generators to produce electricity. However, as with burning any type of fuel, municipal solid wastes can produce air pollution when they are burned and turned into energy. Renewable energy in your future One day, all your home's energy may come from the sun or the wind. You may not think twice about filling your car's gas tank with biofuel. And your garbage might contribute to your city's energy supply. As scientists push the limits of renewable energy technologies and improve the efficiencies and costs of today's systems, we will soon be to the point when we may no longer rely mostly on fossil fuel energy.

Platt U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC, USA C.A. Matzdorf Energetics, Incorporated, Columbia, MD, USA ABSTRACT The status and plans for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI) are discussed.The four active Phase I SPI projects, a 125 hp high-temperaturesuperconducting (HTS) motor, 100 MVA HTS generator, 2.4 kV HTSfault current limiter, and 115 kV HTS transmission cable, andtwo additional systems projects, a 30 MVA HTS transformer andone meter (Southwire) cable, are reviewed. The 2.4 kV fault currentlimiter prototype was successfully tested in September, 1995 ata utility host site. The 125 hp motor is currently undergoinginitial rotor spinning tests. The 100 MVA generator prototypecoil will be completed and tested in the next few weeks. The 115kV transmission cable project is on schedule and will be completedin 1998. The 30 MVA transformer is on schedule to design, construct,and test a one MVA prototype by May 1997. The Southwire cableproject recently successfully tested a one meter HTS cable whichcarried 600 amperes. The U.S. DOE anticipates funding Phase IISPI projects based on the results of Phase I in fiscal year 1996. INTRODUCTION The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began a high-temperature superconductivity(HTS) program in 1988 in response to potential benefits that couldbe gained through the development of the newly discovered HTSmaterials. In line with the objectives of DOE, the SuperconductivityProgram for Electric Systems to date has focussed on electricpower applications and the wire and devices necessary to buildthose applications. Through late 1993 the program concentratedtechnology activities on the development of HTS wire. With the rapid progress in making suitable HTS wire, DOE initiatedPhase I of the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI)in the fall of 1993. The SPI is a systems technology program designedto accelerate the development of HTS electric power systems. TheSPI strongly encourages the formation of vertically integratedteams comprised of partners who usually do not interact in thedevelopment cycle. This close collaboration among system integrators,wire and device manufacturers, end-users (typically electric utilities)has led to rapid, efficient incorporation of HTS components intoa variety of electric power systems. The DOE HTS program supports a balanced technology developmenteffort. Wire and device technologies are developed through 35collaborative projects between U.S. national laboratories andindustry, and systems technologies are supported through the SPIand other vertically integrated project teams. The original three Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI)projects are nearing a successful Phase I conclusion. The 125hp motor and 100 MVA generator manufacturers hope to showcasethe potential benefits and associated impact upon the U.S. utilityindustry with successful testing scheduled for the first quarterof 1996. The 2.4 kJ fault current limiter prototype was successfullytested at a Southern California Edison substation on September25, 1995. A fourth Phase I project to develop an HTS transmissioncable began in early 1995. Two additional systems development projects began in 1995. A 30MVA HTS transformer project was formally announced in August andto date the project has established the technical feasibilityand economic benefits of HTS power transformers in 10 MVA andlarger sizes. A new HTS transmission cable project was announcedon October 31, 1995, led by Southwire Corporation. The projectteam recently demonstrated a one meter HTS power cable that carried600 amperes. Progress made in wire and coil technology and systems engineeringduring the Phase I projects is helping the program reach its ultimategoal: assisting industry in developing the technology necessaryto make superconducting electric power products available to themarketplace, in the process providing super energy efficient,cost-effective HTS electric power equipment that will help keepelectricity costs low and United States industry competitive.Progress and plans for each project are detailed below. 125 hp Motor Project Reliance Electric Company, SPI team leader for the 125 hp, 4-pole,1800 RPM motor prototype, estimates that they will achieve a 60%size reduction and 50% decrease in losses with their commercialHTS motor compared to a conventional motor of the same rating.The prototype will be scaled up and offered commercially in motorsizes of 1000 hp or larger to replace less efficient motors nowused in electric utility companies to power fans, pumps, and othermanufacturing equipment. Rich Schiferl of Reliance Electric explainedthat "utilization of off the shelf parts has been instrumentalin the success of the program by keeping costs low and avoidingunnecessary design and development of new parts." He alsostated that similar engineering practices will be used in futuredevelopments such as a >1000 hp pre-production HTS motor. Reliance Electric and team members American Superconductor Corporation(ASC), Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Sandia NationalLaboratory (SNL), and Centerior Energy Corporation report prototypeassembly progressing on schedule. To date, armature and rotorfabrication is complete. First rotating tests were completed usinga coil subset from ASC. ASC delivered the full coil set in December1995 (~60,000 Amp-turns, ~0.8 Tesla max.). Final testing of themotor is underway. 100 MVA Generator Project The 100 MVA HTS generator project team, led by General ElectricCompany (GE), plans to deliver a commercial product that is morethan 50% smaller and operates with half of the efficiency lossesof a conventional generator of the same rating. GE hopes commercializationwill lead to extensive retrofits to existing generators alongwith new generator sales in the international market. Team membersinclude Intermagnetics General Corporation, Niagara Mohawk PowerCorporation, New York State Energy and Research and DevelopmentAuthority, the New York State Institute on Superconductivity,and Argonne, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The Phase I goal of the generator team is to build and test a100 MVA generator coil subset and design a 100 MVA HTS generator.The team has completed the preliminary generator design and continuesto study power system interaction. They have also fabricated 200-meterlengths of Bi-2223 wire for prototype racetrack coils (changedfrom the original saddle coil due to design constraints) and areoptimizing coil fabrication procedures on smaller test coils.GE is presently winding and testing the prototype coil. Mindfulof ultimate component performance goals of Jc»45,000 A/cm2and uniformly reproducible 3,000 meter wire production, the teamalso maintains significant attention towards Tl-1223 PIT and thickfilm conductor development for improved coil material. 2.4 kV Fault Current Limiter Project Lockheed Martin leads the 2.4 kJ fault current limiter (FCL) projectteam whose Phase I SPI plan is to build and test a 2.4 kV faultcurrent limiter on a utility substation. FCLs, a technology notcurrent used extensively by utilities, have the potential to significantlyreduce capital and operating costs. FCLs protect utility transmissionand distribution systems from extensive damage caused by abnormalcurrent pulses, sometimes reaching 100 times the capacity of thesystem, by limiting the maximum load that reaches circuit breakers,transformers, and switches. Other members on the FCL team includeAmerican Superconductor Corporation, Southern California EdisonCorporation (SCE), and Los Alamos National Laboratory. This new technology gives electric utilities the opportunity tocut costs significantly by deferring the installation of highercapacity transmission lines, circuit breakers and transformers,and increasing system utilization by allowing the installationof less expensive, lower rated circuit breakers. Final testing of the 2.4 kV FCL was recently successfully completedat a SCE substation. Results will be announced in a press conferenceat a later date. The FCL team completed the test on schedule despitea decision to meet DOE's challenge to increase the Phase I prototypetarget rating from 240 V to 2.4 kV. A "low voltage"(12 V) benchtop unit was successfully demonstrated in late 1994,paving the way for completion of the final design for a 2.4 kV,2000 A unit that was assembled in July and tested in September,1995. The prototype uses a 3 mH, 2.4 kV coil supplied by ASC. 115 kV Underground Transmission Cable Project EPRI leads a fourth Phase I SPI project team that plans to developa prototype 30 meter, 115 kV, underground HTS transmission cable,and design a 3-phase, 100 meter cable system. Partners includePirelli Cable Corporation, ASC, and Los Alamos and Oak Ridge NationalLaboratories. The four year Phase I project began in early 1995. ASC has delivered six kilometers of HTS wire to Pirelli to date.Pirelli is now testing the wire for mechanical and electricalperformance. All ASC wire has met or exceeded specifications.Pirelli is developing a qualification procedure for HTS wire.They are also modifying one of their cable stranding machinesto accommodate HTS wire. The team is on schedule to successfullycomplete activities in 1998. 30 MVA Transformer Project Waukesha Electric Systems leads the 30 MVA transformer projectteam whose objectives are to design, construct, and test a oneMVA HTS transformer prototype by May, 1997 and establish the technicaland economic feasibility of HTS power transformers in 10 MVA andlarger sizes. HTS transformers will be smaller, more efficient,less of a fire hazard, and potentially quieter than conventionalunits. Additional team members include Intermagnetics GeneralCorporation, Rochester Gas and Electric, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,and Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. In 1996, the team plans to establish key transfer design parameters,continue to develop HTS wire and windings, and begin constructionof the nominal 1 MVA single-phase HTS transformer. Southwire HTS Transmission Cable Project Southwire Company announced a new HTS transmission cable projectand team on October 31, 1995. The team plans to demonstrate thefeasibility of HTS cable by building a one meter prototype bymid-1996 and continuing to develop long-length commercial cableafter successfully testing the one meter prototype. The cableis attractive for the same reasons mentioned in the EPRI cableproject. The team recently announced that a preliminary one metercable carried 600 amperes. They plan to continue developing HTSwire and improving the cabling process by retrofitting one oftheir industrial cabling machines. Additional team members includeIntermagnetics General Corporation and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Phase II Solicitations With the conclusion of three SPI Phase I projects on the horizon,the Department of Energy (DOE) released restricted Phase II solicitationsfrom DOE's Golden Field Office on March 28, 1995 to the originalthree SPI Phase I teams. The U.S. DOE expects to fund additionalPhase I and Phase II projects to maintain a strong portfolio ofprojects that will capitalize on continuing improvements in HTSwire, component, and systems properties. SUMMARY The SPI has been uniquely successful in rapidly developing electricpower technologies through the vertically integrated team approach.These teams will continue to develop systems using the most advancedideas from the national laboratories, state-of-the-art componentsfrom wire manufacturers, and up-to-date requirements and needsof end-users. With continued strong progress, these systems willevolve into commercial systems that will be available to the marketplaceearly in the next century.

Because they are in a hurry toregain their hot water supply, they are often unable to take the time to shop for the most energy-efficient unit fortheir specific needs. This is unfortunate because the cost of purchasing and operating a water heater can vary greatly,depending on the type, brand, and model selected and on the quality of the installation. To avoid this scenario, you might want to do some research now before you are faced with an emergency purchase.Familiarize yourself today with the options that will allow you to make an informed decision when the need to buy a newwater heater arises. Types of Water Heaters Available Within the last few years, a variety of water heaters have become available to consumers. The following types of waterheaters are now on the market: conventional storage, demand, heat pump, tankless coil, indirect, and solar. It is alsopossible to purchase water heaters that can be connected to your home's space-heating system. Storage Water Heaters A variety of fuel options are available for conventional storage water heaters electricity, natural gas, oil, andpropane. Ranging in size from 20 to 80 gallons (75.7 to 302.8 liters), storage water heaters remain the most popular typefor residential heating needs in the United States. A storage heater operates by releasing hot water from the top of thetank when the hot water tap is turned on. To replace that hot water, cold water enters the bottom of the tank, ensuringthat the tank is always full. Because the water is constantly heated in the tank, energy can be wasted even when no faucet is on. This is calledstandby heat loss. Newer, more energy-efficient storage models can significantly reduce the amount of standby heat loss,making them much less expensive to operate. To determine the most energy-efficient model, consult the EnergyGuide labelrequired on storage water heaters. EnergyGuide labels indicate either the annual estimated cost of operating the systemor energy efficiency ratings. Demand Water Heaters It is possible to completely eliminate standby heat losses from the tank and reduce energy consumption 20% to 30% withdemand (or instantaneous) water heaters, which do not have storage tanks. Cold water travels through a pipe into theunit, and either a gas burner or an electric element heats the water only when needed. With these systems, you never runout of hot water. But there is one potential drawback with demand water heaters -- limited flow rate. Typically, demand heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2 to 4 gallons (7.6 to 15.2 liters) per minute. This flow ratemight suffice if your household does not use hot water at more than one location at the same time (e.g., showering anddoing laundry simultaneously). To meet hot water demand when multiple faucets are being used, demand heaters can beinstalled in parallel sequence. Although gas-fired demand heaters tend to have higher flow rates than electric ones, theycan waste energy even when no water is being heated if their pilot lights stay on. However, the amount of energy consumedby a pilot light is quite small. Heat Pump Water Heaters Heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly. Toheat water for homes, heat pump water heaters work like refrigerators in reverse. Heat pump water heaters can be purchased as integral units with built-in water storage tanks or as add-ons that can beretrofitted to an existing water heater tank. These systems have a high initial cost. They also require installation inlocations that remain in the 40 degree to 90 degree F (4.4 degrees to 32.2 degrees C) range year-round and contain atleast 1000 cubic feet (28.3 cubic meters) of air space around the water heaters. To operate most efficiently, they shouldbe placed in areas having excess heat, such as furnace rooms. They will not work well in a cold space. Tankless Coil and Indirect Water Heaters A home's space-heating system can also be used to heat water. Two types of water heaters that use this system aretankless coil and indirect. No separate storage tank is needed in the tankless coil water heater because water is heateddirectly inside the boiler in a hydronic (i.e., hot water) heating system. The water flows through a heat exchanger inthe boiler whenever a hot water faucet is turned on. During colder months, the tankless coil works well because theheating system is used regularly. However, the system is less efficient during warmer months and in warmer climates whenthe boiler is used less frequently. A separate storage tank is required with an indirect water heater. Like the tankless coil, the indirect water heatercirculates water through a heat exchanger in the boiler. But this heated water then flows to an insulated storage tank.Because the boiler does not need to operate frequently, this system is more efficient than the tankless coil. In fact,when an indirect water heater is used with a highly efficient boiler, the combination may provide one of the leastexpensive methods of water heating. Solar Water Heaters Through specially designed systems, energy from the sun can be used to heat water for your home. Depending on climate andwater use, a properly designed, installed, and maintained solar water heater can meet from half to nearly all of a home'shot water demand. Two features, a collector and a storage tank, characterize most solar water heaters. Beyond these common features, solarwater-heating systems can vary significantly in design. The various system designs can be classified as passive or activeand as direct (also called open loop) or indirect (also called closed loop). Passive systems operate without pumps and controls and can be more reliable, more durable, easier to maintain, longerlasting, and less expensive to operate than active systems. Active solar water heaters incorporate pumps and controls tomove heat-transfer fluids from the collectors to the storage tanks. Both active and passive solar water-heating systems often require conventional water heaters as backups, or the solarsystems function as preheaters for the conventional units. A direct solar water-heating system circulates household water through collectors and is not appropriate in climates inwhich freezing temperatures occur. An indirect system should not experience problems with freezing because the fluid inthe collectors is usually a form of antifreeze. If you are considering purchasing a solar water-heating system, you may want to compare products from differentmanufacturers. The Solar Rating & Certification Corporation (SRCC -- see Source List at the end of this publication)provides a benchmark for comparing the performance of some solar water heating systems. The SRCC publishes performance ratings of both solar water-heating systems and individual solar collectors. Thesepublished ratings are the results of independent, third-party laboratory testing of these products. All systems andcollectors that have been certified by the SRCC will bear the SRCC label. Keep in mind, though, that simply having an SRCC label does not imply that the product has a superior performance.Carefully compare SRCC label information on different brands and models to ensure that you are fully aware of projectedperformance. The Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC -- see Source List) also provides information on solar manufacturers andcontractors. It also maintains solar equipment testing facilities and publishes performance ratings for solar waterheating systems. Just choosing a solar water heater with good ratings is not enough, though. Proper design, sizing, installation, andmaintenance are also critical to ensure efficient system performance. Although the purchase and installation prices of solar water heaters are usually higher than those of conventional types,operating costs are much lower. For more information about solar water-heating systems, contact the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse(EREC -- see Source List). Criteria for Selection As with any purchase, balance the pros and cons of the different water heaters in light of your particular needs. Thereare numerous factors to consider when choosing a new water heater. This publication has already described differentsystem configurations. Some other considerations are capacity, efficiency, and cost. Determining Capacity Although some consumers base their purchases on the size of the storage tank, the peak hour demand capacity, referred toas the first-hour rating (FHR) on the EnergyGuide label, is actually the more important figure. The FHR is a measure ofhow much hot water the heater will deliver during a busy hour, and it is required by law to appear on the unit'sEnergyGuide label. Therefore, before you shop, estimate your household's peak hour demand and look for a unit with an FHRin that range. Gas water heaters have higher FHRs than electric water heaters of the same storage capacity. Therefore, it may bepossible to meet your water-heating needs with a gas unit that has a smaller storage tank than an electric unit with thesame FHR. More efficient gas water heaters use various nonconventional arrangements for combustion air intake andexhaust. These features, however, can increase installation costs. Rating Efficiency Once you have decided what type of water heater best suits your needs, determine which water heater in that category isthe most fuel efficient. The best indicator of a heater's efficiency is its Energy Factor (EF), which is based onrecovery efficiency (i.e., how efficiently the heat from the energy source is transferred to the water), standby losses(i.e., the percentage of heat lost per hour from the stored water compared to the heat content of the water), and cyclinglosses. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater. Electric resistance water heaters have an EF between 0.7 and0.95; gas heaters have an EF between 0.5 and 0.6, with some high-efficiency models around 0.8; oil heaters range from 0.7to 0.85; and heat pump water heaters range from 1.5 to 2.0. Product literature from manufacturers usually gives theappliance s EF rating. If it does not, you can obtain it by contacting an appliance manufacturer association (see SourceList). Some other energy efficiency features to look for are tanks with at least 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of foam insulationand energy efficiency ratings shown on the EnergyGuide labels. Comparing Costs Another factor uppermost in many consumers' minds is cost, which encompasses purchase price and lifetime maintenance andoperation expenses. When choosing among different models, it is wise to analyze the life-cycle cost -- the total of all costs and benefitsassociated with a purchase during its estimated lifetime. More information on conducting life-cycle cost analyses isavailable from EREC. Units with longer warranties usually have higher price tags, though. Often, the least expensive water heater to purchaseis the most expensive to operate. Source List The following organizations and publications provide more information on hot water energy efficiency.

The opportunity to develop electric power applicationsthat use high-temperature superconductors provides the UnitedStates with a chance to establish a new technologically advancedindustry that will create high-paying jobs. These advanced productswill also help industry gain an edge in the highly competitive,multi-billion-dollar-a-year, international market for electricpower equipment. Largely due to government and private industrypartnerships, only 7 years after the discovery of high-temperaturesuperconductivity, electric power applications based uponhigh-temperature superconductivity are now being designed andtested. These applications offer many benefits to the nationalelectric system: increased energy efficiency (reduced losses), reduced equipment size, reduced emissions, increased stability and reliability, deferred expansion, and flexible electricity dispatch and load management. All of these benefits have a common outcome: lower electricitycosts and improved environmental quality. In light of the benefitsoffered by high-temperature superconductive electric power applications,the United States Department of Energy (DOE) sponsors researchand development (R&D) through its Superconductivity Programfor Electric Power Systems. This program will help develop thetechnology needed for U.S. industry to commercialize high-temperaturesuperconductive electric power applications. Through this R&D,DOE envisions that by 2010 the U.S. electric power systems equipmentindustry will regain a major share of the global market by offeringsuperconducting products that outperform the competition. In theUnited States, the electric power system will gain efficiencyand flexibility through increased use of high-temperature superconductivedevices. In turn, this will boost U.S. productivity and efficiency,especially within industries that are large users of electricity. Industrial Competitiveness DOE's role in assisting U.S. economiccompetitiveness is described in the 1994 strategic plan, Fuelinga Competitive Economy. The Superconductivity Program for ElectricPower Systems supports industrial competitiveness and DOE's firstpriority, according to the plan-helping the President achievehis vision of an investment-driven economy capable of creatinghigh-wage jobs that increase the incomes of the American people. The international market for electric products such as generators,motors, and transmission cables is worth several billion dollarsa year; advanced products employing superconductivity can capturethis market due to improved efficiency and performance. DOE'ssuperconductivity program is assisting U.S. industry in exploitingthis market, thereby capturing economic benefits in this countryand energy benefits world-wide. To achieve this vision, the programis supporting four consortia of private companies, each committedto commercializing a different product in the SuperconductivityPartnership Initiative. In parallel with this product-orientedthrust, the program assists individual companies through technologypartnerships that are bringing the key manufacturing technology--making electric wires from high-temperature superconductors--tomaturation. Superconductivity Partnership Initiative DOE establishedthe Superconductivity Partnership Initiative in 1993 to recognizethe progress made by wire-development partners, and to assistcompanies committed to developing wire-using products. A competitivesolicitation was offered that asked respondents to consider anew approach to bringing technology to the marketplace. The respondentswere encouraged to form multidisciplinary teams that include theproduct user, to engineer applications while the under-pinningtechnology is being improved, and to pursue several applicationssimultaneously. Technology Partnerships U.S. companies that have formed technologypartnerships with DOE laboratories since the program started in1988 have become international leaders in the manufacture of longlengths of high-temperature superconducting wire. These partnershipshave built upon two major U.S. strengths: private company entrepreneurshipand the resources- people and facilities-of DOE national laboratories.This combination has given small U.S. companies the ability tochallenge major corporations in Europe and Japan for the leadin wire manufacture. These small companies are also key membersof the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative consortia. Inthe first 7 years of the program, 87 agreements were formed for joint projects betweencompanies and national laboratories. At the end of 1994, 35 wereactive. Industry has shared approximately 40% of these projects'costs. Commercial Products With direct program assistance, industry hasalready introduced a variety of commercial products. Two companies,Seattle Specialty Ceramics and Superconductive Components, Incorporated,sell high-temperature superconducting powders. Neocera, Incorporated,sells a device that deposits multilayer films of high-temperaturesuperconductors. American Superconductor Corporation and IntermagneticsGeneral Corporation sell experimental samples of high-temperaturesuperconducting wire and coils--components necessary for manufacturingmotors and generators. And a variety of companies sell electricpower leads made from high-temperature superconductors. By theend of 1995, industry will design, build, and test prototype electricpower devices, including a 125-horsepower (hp) motor, a 100-megavolt-ampere(MVA) generator coil, and a fault-current limiter--a device thatprotects an electric utility's transmission and distribution systemfrom abnormal current pulses. These devices, if successfully developedand tested, will lead to large-scale commercial products suchas 1000-hp motors, 100-MVA and larger generators, under-groundtransmission cables, and fault-current limiters, all of whichpromise healthy domestic markets and much larger global markets. Program Approach The underlying requirement for most high-valuecommercial applications of high-temperature superconductive electricpower devices is a flexible, mechanically rugged, high-temperaturesuperconducting wire. This wire must be capable of carrying alarge current in the presence of a magnetic field and be availableat an acceptable price. Presently, fabrication technology cannotprovide high-temperature superconducting wire for all the electricpower devices being considered for development. Prototype devicecomponents need to be designed, developed, and tested for commercializationto occur. In light of these parallel needs, technology and productdevelopment occur concurrently: progress in underlying technologyallows more advanced prototypes to be built and tested. Feedbackfrom applications testing allows engineers to make additionalimprovements to the underlying technology. Recognizing these R&Dneeds, DOE has organized the Superconductivity Program for ElectricPower Systems around two types of activities: technology development through R&D with individual companies,and product development by several companies formed into consortia. Technology development activities focus on two areas: wire developmentand electric power applications development. Wire developmentactivities are devoted to understanding how processing affectsthe wire and improving wire fabrication processes. Work also focuseson increasing the amount of current, described as the criticalcurrent density (Jc ), that can flow through a wire. Electric power applications development activities focus on makinglong-length wire, coils, and other components and improving andunderstanding the systems, such as cryogenic refrigerators, thatsupport high-temperature superconductive devices. These activitiesbuild upon work in the wire development area and, at the sametime, feed back crucial information. Product development activities,represented by the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative, focuson three teams that have been funded to develop high-temperaturesuperconductive prototypes. The first team is developing a fault-currentlimiter; the second team, a 100-MVA generator coil; and the thirdteam, a 125-hp motor. Each team is led by a private industry systemsmanufacturer. These manufacturers have agreed to introduce high-temperaturesuper-conductive devices to the marketplace upon the successfuldevelopment and testing of prototypes. Technology Status Materials used to produce high-temperature superconductingwire are inherently difficult to process into usable forms forelectric power applications. This situation is the opposite ofthat for typical metallic electrical conductors, such as copper.And this fact presents processing obstacles that must be overcometo manufacture devices that can actually be used in electric powersystem applications. Powder-in-Tube Method High-temperature superconducting wire consideredfor use in electric power applications is currently made by thepowder-in-tube method. In this method, high-temperature superconductingpre-cursors are loaded into a tube made of silver and processedby a variety of standard, low-cost metallurgical manufacturingtechniques such as drawing, rolling, and heat-treating to reachthe final high-temperature superconducting wire form. To achievethe desired superconducting state, many variables must be balancedunder manufacturing conditions. Important processing variablesinclude heat-treatment temperatures, the duration of heat treatment,the number of times a wire is rolled, and whether the wire isheat-treated before or after it is wound into a coil. Optimizingthese variables is difficult and expensive. Therefore, a largepart of the program to date has been devoted to fabricating shorthigh-temperature superconducting wires with exceptional currentcarrying capabilities. As optimal processing conditions evolvefor short-length wire, the manufacture of long-length wire canbe improved by transferring short wire processing knowledge tolong wire processing. This transfer of knowledge is central tomany of the collaborative agreements between the national laboratoriesand private industry. In this case, the national laboratorieswork on improving short-length wire, then transfer their resultsto industry where improvements can be made to their long-length,commercial wire making processes. The program continually monitorswire development progress, assessing wire characteristics to ensurethat future wire will possess the properties necessary for usein electric power devices. Critical current density, Jc , thecurrent per cross-sectional area of the superconductor "core";is the common electrical parameter used to rate the performanceof high-temperature superconducting wire. Most electric powerapplications require Jc in the range of 104 to 106 amperes persquare centimeter (A/cm2)at operating conditions. CommercialBi-2223 (see the table for compound descriptions) powder-in-tubewire manufactured today that is longer than 20 meters can carryup to 20,000 A/cm2 at 77 K and in no magnetic field. In general,the smaller the magnetic field in which a high-temperature superconductingwire must function, the more current the wire can carry. However,most electric power applications require magnetic fields of 2to 5 tesla (T) when operating efficiently. At 2 to 5 T, Bi-2223powder-in-tube wires must be used at temperatures below 35 K,because of limitations in the superconducting properties of Bi-2223.Below 35 K and in fields up to 2 T, Bi-2223 powder-in-tube wireshave a Jc that is useful for prototype electric power devices.Additional improvements in Jc need to be made for commercial Bi-2223powder-in-tube wire to be used in large-scale commercial devicessuch as motors and generators. Another compound, Tl-1223, possesses the necessary properties for wire designedto be used in 2- to 5-T fields above 35 K. The development ofwires made from Tl-1223 is a few years behind the developmentof Bi-2223 wires, and today the best performing short Tl-1223powder-in-tube wires have a Jc of 15,000 A/cm2 at 77 K and 0T. Because Tl-1223 is more difficult to process in powder-in-tubewires than Bi-2223, the national laboratories are exploring alternativeapproaches to Tl-1223 wire manufacture. Low-cost, commercial wiremanufacturing processes such as electrodeposition and coextrusionshow promise, but still need significant development before theyare practical for production of high-temperature superconductingwire. Cost Of course, much work remains to be done, particularly onreducing cost. Regardless of performance gains, high-temperaturesuperconducting wires will not become commercially competitiveuntil the cost of wire is reduced. Currently, the cost of high-temperaturesuperconducting wire, in dollars per kiloamperemeter, is predominantlydriven by high manufacturing costs and high material costs. Privateindustry, with program assistance, will continue to explore novelmethods to reduce manufacturing expenses and lower the materialcosts of wire. Some of these techniques are discussed later inmore detail. For the successful development of applications usinghigh-temperature superconducting wire, the cost of the wire alongwith total equipment costs and performance needs to be competitivewith existing technologies. Coordination Key to the development of commercial high-temperaturesuperconducting products is the search for better superconductingmaterials. To leverage government activities, the SuperconductivityProgram for Electric Power Systems coordinates with DOE's BasicEnergy Sciences group, which explores basic materials, mechanisms,and physical phenomena; and searches for new compounds with highercritical temperatures and better mechanical properties. Thesediscoveries are then carried over to the Superconductivity Programfor Electric Power Systems for improvements in wire and applicationsdevelopment. Conclusion At present, short wires possess excellent properties,but the real need for applications is long-length wire--00 to1000 meters or longer. Private industry can now manufacture 100-to 1000-meter wires on a small scale, but the need is for therepeated manufacture of uniform, long-length wire that is stable,flexible, multifilamentary, capable of carrying large currentsin magnetic fields, and cost competitive. To address this need,technology development is proceeding on two fronts: raising currentdensity in short-length wire and transferring process and materialimprovements to long wire lengths, and increasing critical currentand wire length in commercial manufacturing processes in whichuniformity is the key. Progress in both areas is necessary sothat high-temperature super-conducting wires will soon be usedin place of conventional wires in electric power devices. Accomplishments Technology Development Wire Improvement To ensure continuous improvements to high-temperaturesuperconducting wire, R&D needs to continue on the first stepof wire manufacture--the synthesis of high-temperature superconductingpowders that yield optimum electrical and physical propertiesafter the wire is processed. In addition, researchers need toincrease their understanding of the relationships between powderproperties before wire manufacture and the final electrical andphysical properties of the wire. Any improvements must be amenableto cost-effective manufacturing. Knowledge in this area is increasedby exploring novel approaches to the synthesis of high-temperaturesuperconducting powders and characterizing the properties of thepowders. Materials Synthesis and Properties For example, in 1993,Argonne National Laboratory developed a novel, two-powder processfor synthesizing Bi-2223. This new process allows more precisecontrol of the final powder makeup, which directly influencesthe current-carrying properties of the resulting wire. Criticalcurrent densities in short lengths of the wire made from thesepowders have been measured up to 50,000 A/cm2 at 77 K and 0 T.This process incorporates a novel synthesis route, vacuum calcination,for which Argonne received a 1993 R&D 100 Award. In futureprojects, researchers will apply this technique to industrialwire development processes to enhance the properties of long-lengthwire. Oak Ridge National Laboratory also contributed to the progressof the program's powder processing activities by licensing anaerosol spray manufacturing technique to Superconductive Components,Incorporated. This process produces powders with well controlledproperties. It results in a narrow distribution of particle sizes,fine grain size within individual particles, and excellent chemicalhomogeneity. Superconductive Components is now selling these powdersproduced at their facility using the process developed by OakRidge. In 1994, researchers also made significant progress indeveloping powder for other compounds, especially Tl-1223. Tl-1223is more difficult to process than Bi-2223 in the powder-in-tubewire process. The control of Tl-1223 powder characteristics iscrucial for producing wire with the properties necessary for usein electric power applications. Los Alamos National Laboratoryand Sandia National Laboratories made advances in the controlof Tl-1223 powder characteristics leading to Tl-1223 powder-in-tubewires with a Jc approaching 15,000 A/cm2. The National RenewableEnergy Laboratory, in collaboration with the State Universityof New York at Buffalo, fabricated Tl-1223 powder-in-tube wirewith a Jc near 10,000 A/cm2 using "electrodeposited";precursor powders. Critical Currents and Microstructures One crucial limitingfactor for eventual applications of high-temperature superconductingwire is the amount of current the wire can carry. Current in high-temperaturesuperconductors is influenced by many factors: operating temperature, operating field, and superconductor microstructure. Operating temperature and field are external factors--they canbe controlled independently of the high-temperature superconductingwire--and are directly related to the amount of current a givenwire can carry. In general, the lower the operating temperature,the more current a wire can carry. Operating fields have a similareffect. The smaller the field, the more current a wire can carry.Unfortunately, many electric power applications must operate inhigh fields--up to 5 T. In addition, the applications will runmore cost effectively at higher temperatures, which require lesscooling, less insulation, and lower cost cryogen. So, for commercialdevices to be cost effective, wire designed for electric powerapplications must be able to operate in high fields at temperaturesthat are at least 20 K or more. The superconductor microstructureis an internal factor and is heavily influenced by the materialsused to make the wire, the processing techniques, and the finalwire form. The microstructure also offers great potential forimprovement. Critical current densities in wires are still 10to 100 times less than in oriented thin films made from high-temperaturesuperconductors. Thin films are generally used for electronicsapplications and possess the best high-temperature superconductorproperties known. The properties that thin films possess are targetsfor wire developers. The challenge for researchers is to figureout how current flows through superconducting wires and how tomaximize the current that can be produced in a wire by a givenprocess. In 1993, a breakthrough in the understanding of the superconductormicrostructure of Tl-1223 was made when researchers at Oak RidgeNational Laboratory and General Electric Company identified apossible microstructural origin of high critical current densitiesin Tl-1223 thick film deposits produced by General Electric Company.These films possess the best current carrying capabilities--Jcup to 325,000 A/cm2 at 77 K and 0 T--of any non-thin film typemanufacturing process. This discovery is extremely important forthe development of Tl-1223 long-length wires because researchersnow have insight on why these thick films carry more current thanhigh-temperature superconductors produced by other processes,including powder-in-tube wire. No other potentially low cost manufacturingmethod is known that produces such high critical currents. Thechallenge for researchers now is to translate the laboratory processto a cost-effective, large-scale manufacturing process that canproduce wires with these excellent properties. Fabrication Process In conjunction withunderstanding the microstructure of superconducting wire, fabricationprocesses that can produce the desired microstructure need tobe further developed and refined. Various manufacturing techniquesexist to produce wire, and the powder-in-tube approach is theone most commonly used. But this process has limitations. So,while incremental improvements to the powder-in-tube method arebeing made, new techniques need to be explored. Techniques to Increase Wire Strength and Flexibility. Allpractical methods for manufacturing high-temperature super-conductingwire use silver as a sheath material. Silver is used because itis compatible with the superconducting ceramics, it is highlyductile, it is permeable to oxygen, and it can conduct electricity.Silver may even play a role in aligning the grains of Bi-2223during formation processes. Unfortunately, silver is expensiveand mechanically weak. The expense of silver is not in itselfenough to prohibit its use as a sheath material in cost-effectivewires, but because it has low strength, engineers must use largeamounts of it during wire processing to protect the ceramic core.The large amount of silver needed can quickly become a cost issue.In addition, the thick sheath limits the amount of superconductingpowder in the wire. Specifically, in commercially manufacturedsamples, only 25% of the total powder-in-tube wire is powder.This limits the total current that wire can carry. Despite these limitations, there are many opportunities for improvement.In 1994, the program supported research that could lead to newand improved sheath materials. One technique investigated is dispersionstrengthening of the silver sheath. This could lead to a strongersheath material with the same beneficial characteristics as puresilver. Increased strength would allow engineers to make wireswith thinner sheaths, directly increasing the overall currentdensity, Joverall , without making improvements to the microstructureof the superconducting core. Thinner sheaths could also lead tolower costs because they require smaller amounts of silver. Anotherapproach being investigated is the development of new, high-strength,low-cost silver alloys that are compatible with the superconductingcore. These alloys will not directly lower the materials' costof high-temperature superconducting wire because silver is stillused in large quantities, but the alloys will allow more efficient,lower cost manufacturing of wire with superior strength propertiescompared to wires with pure silver sheaths. Wire Forming Techniques. While supporting incremental improvementsin the powder-in-tube method through improvements in processing,the program also supported research in other wire forming techniques.These techniques have their own drawbacks, yet they offer solutionsto difficult problems that are present in powder-in-tube processing. In 1994, advances in Tl-1223 processing were made at the NationalRenewable Energy Laboratory. Researchers were able to produceelectrodeposited, thick-film deposits of Tl-1223 on silver foilthat yielded critical current densities of 32,000 A/cm22 at 77K and 0 T. This is significant because electrodeposition processingoffers a viable alternative to powder-in-tube processing. In anotherproject, researchers at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories,in collaboration with Nuclear Metals Corporation and AT&T,investigated a wire manufacturing method called "hydrostaticextrusion." This technique is amenable to large-scale manufacturingand could drastically reduce the amount of silver needed in thewire sheath compared to the powder-in-tube wire. The techniqueis promising, but much work is still needed to prove its finalusefulness. Wire Characterization.Increased understanding of the makeupof the superconducting Bi-2223 core is crucial to progress inraising critical current densities. Recently, researchers at BrookhavenNational Laboratory showed that the primary limiting factor forcritical current density in Bi-2223 powder-in-tube wire is thepresence of a large fraction of poor and non-superconducting grainboundaries compared to "clean" or superconducting grainboundaries. Understanding the relationship between fabricationprocesses and the final wire is often just as important as findinga viable solution. From here, researchers can investigate processingmethods that can lead to improved grain boundaries. Electric Power Applications Research in high-temperature super-conductiveelectric power applications supports U.S. industry's effort toproduce components such as long-length, high-current, high-temperaturesuperconducting wire, and coils and cables made from high-temperaturesuperconducting wire, and systems such as motors and generatorsthat use high-temperature superconducting components. In 1994,significant progress was made in all these areas. Component Development Component development is advancingthe state of the art in the following areas: long-length, high-current, high-temperature superconductingwire manufacture, coil development, cable development, and coil and cable testing. Components must have excellent current and magnetic field performanceto be incorporated into electric power devices. Presently, componentperformance is not at the level needed for full-scale commercialdevices. In addition, the cost of long-length, high-temperaturesuperconducting wire needs to be reduced by 10 to 100 times tobe competitive with other technologies. Program activities incomponent development include lowering the cost of wire whilesimultaneously improving electrical properties. Long-Length Wire. The most significant need in the programis for cost-effective, long-length, high-temperature superconductingwire that is suitable for electric power applications. The programsupports collaborative work designed to transfer the manufacturingprocesses developed for high-temperature superconducting wirefrom the national laboratories to private industry. Without significantimprovements in manufacturing technology, long lengths of wirewith the necessary properties will not be developed. During 1994,the program helped shape many important accomplishments in thisarea. American Superconductor Corporation, in collaboration withArgonne, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories and theUniversity of Wisconsin, manufactured 1160 meters of Bi-2223/silver-sheathedwire with a Jc of 12,700 A/cm2 at 77 K and 0 T. The company alsomanufactured 100-meter lengths of wire with a Jc of 21,300 A/cm2 at 77 K and 0 T. In addition, Intermagnetics General Corporation,with assistance from Argonne National Laboratory, manufactured850-meter Bi-2223/silver wire with a Jc of 10,500 A/cm2 at 77K and 0 T. Coils. Coils that generate and toler-ate 2- to 5-T magneticfields are necessary components for commercial electric powersystems such as motors, generators, and certain types of energystorage devices. Coils made from super-conducting wire that maintaincurrent performance under high magnetic fields need to be designed,built, and tested. Research in the program supports the designand testing of such coils and investigates such important issuesas coil-winding techniques, joining of wire, coil support, andcoil performance under the sudden loss of superconductivity--alsocalled quenching. World-record progress in coil development wasmade in 1994. Intermagnetics General Corporation developed a high-performancecoil that generated 2.6 T at 4.2 K, 1.8 T at 27 K, and 0.3 T at77 K. The coil was built with assistance from collaborators atArgonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. This is the firstcoil that can operate successfully under these field strengths.The properties of this coil are closely approaching the valuesnecessary for electric power applications. Cables. High-temperaturesuperconducting wire is available today to manufacture undergroundtransmission cable prototypes. However, the wire cost must bereduced and the system performance verified before the cableswill be attractive in the marketplace. Systems Development Systems development research focuseson designing and testing prototype electric power applications,such as motors, that use high-temperature superconductivity. Thesesystems usually consist of components made from high-temperaturesuperconducting wire, with other supporting hardware such as cryogenics,a support stand, and a utility interface. In 1993, Reliance ElectricCompany, a program collaborator, announced that a motor builtwith high-temperature superconducting coils generated 5 hp-- thehighest achieved in the world to date. This project is supportedby EPRI, and the wire and coils were developed in part throughR&D conducted by the national laboratories and American SuperconductorCorporation. In coming years, Reliance Electric will develop a125-hp motor prototype under the Superconductivity PartnershipInitiative using the 5-hp motor as a model. Product Development Superconductivity Partnership Initiative DOE awarded three SuperconductivityPartnership Initiative projects in 1993 based on a competitivesolicitation. DOE provides financial assistance to the participatingcompanies that formed partnerships with a systems integrator,a component manufacturer, and an end user. Each project beganin early 1994. A fourth award will be made in early 1995 for atransmission cable project. Descriptions of each one follow. Project 1: Fault-Current Limiter. Team members, led by researchersat Martin Marietta Corporation, will design, build, and test aprototype current limiter with a high-temperature superconductingcoil by the end of fiscal year (FY) 1995. The current limiteris designed to protect electric utility transmission and distributionsystems from abnormal power surges due to uncontrollable forcessuch as lightning strikes and storms. Project 2: 125-hpMotor. By the end of FY 1995, team members, led by Reliance ElectricCompany, will design, build, and test a 125-hp prototype motorthat uses a rotor made from high-temperature superconducting wire.The motor will be smaller and more efficient than conventionaliron-core induction motors. If the prototype is successful, motorslarger than 1000 hp using the same technology will be commercialized. Project 3: 100-MVA Generator Coil. By the end of FY 1995, team members,led by General Electric Company, will design, build, and testa prototype 100-MVA generator rotor coil manufactured with high-temperaturesuperconducting wire. They will also design the complete generatorand model its inter-actions with a utility grid. If the prototypeis successful, a full-scale generator containing a high-temperaturesuper-conducting coil will be developed and commercialized. Superconductinggenerators may increase machine efficiency beyond 99%, producingenergy savings, reduced pollution, and lower life-cycle coststhan conventional generators. Project 4: 115-kilovolt (kV),30-meter Transmission Cable. The team, led by Pirelli Cable Corporationand overseen by EPRI's Underground Transmission Task Force, willmanufacture and test, by conventional industry accepted techniques,a 30-meter prototype 115-kV high-temperature super-conductingpower cable by 1997. In addition, the team will design a three-phase,100-meter cable system that can be used in commercial projects. The transmission cable will be able to carry more than two timesthe current of conventional power cables, and will allow increasedcapacity in areas where new rights-of-way are restricted. Program Management Federal R&D priorities in high-temperature superconductivityare established in response to private-sector needs. Field workconducted by the national laboratories to meet these needs isapproved by the DOE program manager. Industrial involvement andcost sharing are prerequisites for R&D projects undertakenby DOE. Collaborations between national laboratories and industryare approved by the DOE Operations Office that is associated withthe collaborating laboratory. Competitive solicitations for cost-sharedprojects require definitive descriptions of the work proposed,costs, schedules, and plans for commercialization. Projects underthe Superconductivity Partnership Initiative are managed directlyby DOE's field office in Golden, Colorado. Technical support forthe Initiative is provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratoryin consultation with the DOE program manager. The DOE programmanager critically reviews progress and plans for the future,adjusting the scope and funding of projects as necessary. Program Evaluation To help guide the DOE program manager in makingplanning decisions, an annual peer review is held near the endof each fiscal year in Washington, D.C. At the review, nationallaboratories present their latest results, research planned forthe upcoming fiscal year, and technology transfer efforts. Theprojects are rated by a panel of experts in superconductivitywho are chosen from industry, academia, and federal agencies.Each reviewer provides a critical analysis of the individual presentationsand the overall program. The program manager uses this feedbackto support continuing efforts or make changes when necessary. Recently, private industry projects were included in the reviewprocess. Industrial representatives delivered presentations thatcovered the collaborative efforts they were involved with in theprogram. Industry's involvement in the peer review process isdesigned to foster additional openness and cooperation betweenindustry and DOE, and it will be expanded in the future. Outcome Electricity accounts for 36% of the total energy used in the UnitedStates. Electricity is our principal and most flexible means ofintegrating coal, hydropower, nuclear, and most renew-able resourcesinto a usable energy system. Historically, the demand for electricitydepends on the nation's economic growth rate, as well as theadoption rate of efficient technologies and conservation measures.In the next 20 years, consumer demand for electricity will increaseby 50%, and electricity use will increase to 40% of the totalenergy consumed by the country.1 The electric utility industry faces several challenges in meetingthese steadily increasing consumer demands. The siting of newpower plants is more difficult now, and stringent environmentalregulations such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 mustbe met. Transmission corridors are reaching capacity, and newrights-of-way are rarely approved by regulators as oppositiongroups cite severe environmental impacts of such approvals. Since1991, the electric utility industry has spent about $2 billionannually on demand-side management programs designed to modifyload growth.2 In addition, utilities must meet increasing demandsfor large quantities of electricity with high power quality, drivenin part by the increasing use of electronic equipment. The U.S.electric utility market can be divided into four functional areas:generation, transmission, distribution, and customer service.Generation is the process through which primary energy sourcesare converted into electricity. Transmission and distributionmake up the electric delivery system. Customer service focuseson power quality, reliability, and load management on the customerside of the meter. High-temperature superconducting electric powerdesigned to fosttechnologies will have a broad impact on all four functional electricutility areas and will help the utility industry meet each ofthe challenges described above. Superconducting generators willbe more efficient and up to 50% smaller than conventional generators,and can help lessen the need for new power plants and reduce theamount of emissions by reducing the amount of fossil fuel used.Superconducting transmission cables can carry up to twice thecurrent of conventional transmission lines, allowing utilitiesto double their transmission capacity while taking up the sameamount of space. Superconducting motors will be more efficientand smaller than conventional motors, lowering the amount of energyneeded from generation and transmission sources while accomplishingthe same work. Superconducting current limiters will allow utilitiesto more efficiently utilize their existing trainsmission and distributionnetwork increasing its reliability and capability to carry power.Other high-temperature superconductor applications not yet implemented,such as magnetic energy storage, may also contribute to the efficiencyand reliability of the electric utility system. In addition tobolstering energy efficiency and providing stability to an ever-changingutility system, the Superconductivity Program for Electric PowerSystems is performing another great service. It is investing inR&D that is leading to products the United States can sellon the world market. This, in turn, will provide new jobs at home;at the same time, it will provide a new avenue on which the UnitedStates can enter the high-tech, global marketplace. 1. 1993 Energy Outlook, Energy Information Administration. 2.

The simplest query isa single keyword, such as: 	lightbulb Searching for common words (like "computer" or "html") may take a lot oftime. Please be considerate of other users. Particularly for large Brokers, it is often helpful to use more powerfulqueries. Harvest supports many different index/search engines, withvarying capabilities. At present, our most powerful (and commonly used)search engine is Glimpse,which supports: case-insensitive and case-sensitive queries; the ability to match parts of words, whole words, or multiple wordphrases (like "resource discovery"); Boolean (AND/OR) combinations of keywords; approximate matches (e.g., allowing spelling errors); structured queries (which allow you to constrain matches to certainfields); the ability to show matched lines or entire matching records (e.g.,for citations); the ability to specify limits on the number of matches returned; and a limited form of regular expressions (e.g., allowing "wild card"expressions that match all words ending in a particular suffix). The different types of queries (and how to use them) are discussed below.Note that you use the same syntax regardless of what index/search engine isrunning in a particular Broker, but that not all engines support all of theabove features. In particular, some of the Brokers use WAIS, whichsometimes searches faster than Glimpse but supports only Boolean keywordqueries and the ability to specify result set limits. The different options -case-sensitivity,approximate matching,the ability to show matched lines vs. entire matching records,and the ability to specify match count limits -can all be specified with buttons and menus in the Broker query forms. A structured query has the form: 	tag-name : value where tag-name is a Content Summary attribute name, and valueis the search value within the attribute. If you click on a ContentSummary, you will see what attributes are available for a particularBroker. A list of common attributes is shown here. Keyword searches and structured queries can be combined using Boolean operators (AND and OR) to form complex queries. Lacking parentheses, logical operation precedence is based left to right.For multiple word phrases or regular expressions, you need to enclose thestring in double quotes, e.g., 	"internet resource discovery"or	"discov.*" Examples Simple keyword search query: 	Arizona This query will return all objects in the Broker containing the word Arizona. Boolean query: 	Arizona AND desert This query will return all objects in the Broker that contain both wordsanywhere in the object in any order. Phrase query: 	"Arizona desert" This query will return all objects in the Broker that contain Arizona desert as a phrase. Notice that you need to putdouble quotes around the phrase. Boolean queries with phrases: 	"Arizona desert" AND windsurfing Simple Structured query: 	Title : windsurfing This query will return all objects in the Broker where the Titleattribute contains the value windsurfing. Complex query: 	"Arizona desert" AND (Title : windsurfing) This query will return all objects in the Broker that contain the phrase Arizona desert and where the Title attribute of the same object contains the value windsurfing. Query options selected by menus or buttons These checkboxes allow some control of the query specification. Case insensitive: By selecting this checkbox the query will become case insensitive (lowercase and upper case letters differ). Otherwise, the query will be casesenstive. The default is case insensitive. Keywords match on word boundaries: By selecting this checkbox, keywords will match on word boundaries.Otherwise, a keyword will match part of a word (or phrase). For example,"network" will matching "networking", "sensitive" will match "insensitive",and "Arizona desert" will match "Arizona desertness". The default is tomatch keywords on word boundaries. Number of errors allowed: Glimpse allows the search to contain a number of errors. An error iseither a deletion, insertion, or substitution of a single character.The Best Match option will find the match(es) with the least number oferrors. The default is 0 (zero) errors.Note: The previous three options do not apply to attribute names.Attribute names are always case insensitive and allow no errors. Result set presentation These checkboxes allow some control of presentation of the query return. Display matched lines (from content summaries): By selecting this checkbox, the result set presentation will contain thelines of the Content Summary that matched the query. Otherwise, thematched lines will not be displayed. The default is to display the matchedlines. Display object descriptions (if available): Some objects have short, one-line descriptions associated with them. Byselecting this checkbox, the descriptions will be presented. Otherwise,the object descriptions will not be displayed. The default is to displayobject descriptions. Verbose display: This checkbox allows you to set whether results are displayed listingthe filename, host, path, and Content Summary each on separate lines, orjust with two lines listing the filename (without a label) and theContent Summary (with a label). The default is verbose. Regular Expressions Some types of regular expressions are supported by Glimpse.A regular expression search can be much slower that other searches.The following is a partial list of possible patterns.(For more details see theGlimpse manual pages.) ^joe will match "joe" at the beginning of a line. joe$ will match "joe" at the end of a line. [a-ho-z] matches any character between a and h or between o and z. . matches any single character except newline. c* matches zero or more occurrences of the character "c" .* matches any number of wild cards \* matches the character "*" (\ escapes any of the abovespecial characters). Regular expressions are currently limited to approximately 30 characters,not including meta characters. Regular expressions will generally notcross word boundaries (because only words are stored in the index). So,for example, "lin.*ing" will find "linking" or "flinching," but not "linearprogramming."

Planting trees, shrubs, vines,grasses, and hedges could be the answer. In fact, landscaping may be your best long-term investment for reducingheating and cooling costs, while also bringing other improvements to your community. A well-designed landscape will: Cut your summer and winter energy costs dramatically. Protect your home from winter wind and summer sun. Reduce consumption of water, pesticides, and fuel for landscaping and lawn maintenance. Help control noise and air pollution. This publication covers landscaping tips to save money year-round; ways that landscaping helps the environment;important climate, site, and design considerations; landscape planning; and tree and shrub selection. You can getadditional information on regionally appropriate species from your local nursery and landscaping experts. Landscaping Saves Money Year-Round Carefully positioned trees can save up to 25% of a household s energy consumption for heating and cooling. Computermodels devised by the U.S. Department of Energy predict that the proper placement of only three trees will save anaverage household between $100 and $250 in energy costs annually. On average, a well-designed landscape provides enough energy savings to return your initial investment in less than 8years. An 8-foot (2.4-meter) deciduous (leaf-shedding) tree, for example, costs about as much as an awning for onelarge window and can ultimately save your household hundreds of dollars in reduced cooling costs, yet still admit somewinter sunshine to reduce heating and lighting costs. Landscaping can save you money in summer or winter. Summer You may have noticed the coolness of parks and wooded areas compared to the temperature of nearby city streets. Shadingand evapotranspiration (the process by which a plant actively moves and releases water vapor) from trees can reducesurrounding air temperatures as much as 9 degrees F (5 degrees C). Because cool air settles near the ground, airtemperatures directly under trees can be as much as 25 degrees F (14 degrees C) cooler than air temperatures abovenearby blacktop. Studies by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory found summer daytime air temperatures to be 3 degrees F to6 degrees F (2 degrees C to 3 degrees C) cooler in tree- shaded neighborhoods than in treeless areas. A well-planned landscape can reduce an unshaded home's summer air-conditioning costs by 15% to 50%. One Pennsylvaniastudy reported air-conditioning savings of as much as 75% for small mobile homes. Winter You may be familiar with wind chill. If the outside temperature is 10 degrees F (-12 degrees C) and the wind speed is20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour), the wind chill is -24 degrees F (-31 degrees C). Trees, fences, orgeographical features can be used as windbreaks to shield your house from the wind. A study in South Dakota found that windbreaks to the north, west, and east of houses cut fuel consumption by an averageof 40%. Houses with windbreaks placed only on the windward side (the side from which the wind is coming) averaged 25%less fuel consumption than similar but unprotected homes. If you live in a windy climate, your well-planned landscapecan reduce your winter heating bills by approximately one-third. Landscaping for a Cleaner Environment Widespread tree planting and climate-appropriate landscaping offer substantial environmental benefits. Trees andvegetation control erosion, protect water supplies, provide food, create habitat for wildlife, and clean the air byabsorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) estimates that urban America has 100 million potential tree spaces (i.e.,spaces where trees could be planted). NAS further estimates that filling these spaces with trees and lightening thecolor of dark, urban surfaces would result in annual energy savings of 50 billion kilowatt-hours -- 25% of the 200billion kilowatt-hours consumed every year by air conditioners in the United States. This would reduce electric powerplant emissions of carbon dioxide by 35 million tons (32 million metric tons) annually and save users ofutility-supplied electricity $3.5 billion each year (assuming an average of $0.07 per kilowatt-hour). Also, some species of trees, bushes, and grasses require less water than others. Some species are naturally moreresistant to pests, so they require less pesticides. Another alternative to pesticides is integrated pestmanagement, an emerging field that uses least-toxic pest control strategies. One example is to introduce certaininsects such as praying mantises or ladybugs to feed on -- and limit populations of -- landscape-consuming pests. Certain grasses, such as buffalo grass and fescue, only grow to a certain height -- roughly 6 inches (15 centimeters)and are water thrifty. By using these species, you can eliminate the fuel, water, and time consumption associated withlawn mowing, watering, and trimming. Also, recent studies have found that gasoline-powered mowers, edge trimmers, andleaf blowers contribute to air pollution. Climate, Site, and Design Considerations Climate The United States can be divided into four approximate climatic regions: temperate, hot-arid, hot-humid, and cool. Theenergy-conserving landscape strategies you use should depend on which region you live in. These landscaping strategiesare listed by region and in order of importance below. Temperate Maximize warming effects of the sun in the winter. Maximize shade during the summer. Deflect winter winds away from buildings. Funnel summer breezes toward the home. Hot-Arid Provide shade to cool roofs, walls, and windows. Allow summer winds to access naturally cooled homes. Block or deflect winds away from air-conditioned homes. Hot-Humid Channel summer breezes toward the home. Maximize summer shade with trees that still allow penetration of low-angle winter sun. Avoid locating planting beds close to the home if they require frequent watering. Cool Use dense windbreaks to protect the home from cold winter winds. Allow the winter sun to reach south-facing windows. Shade south and west windows and walls from the direct summer sun, if summer overheating is a problem. Microclimate The climate immediately surrounding your home is called its microclimate. If your home is located on a sunny southernslope, it may have a warm microclimate, even if you live in a cool region. Or, even though you live in a hot-humidregion, your home may be situated in a comfortable microclimate because of abundant shade and dry breezes. Nearbybodies of water may increase your site's humidity or decrease its air temperature. Your home s microclimate may be more sunny, shady, windy, calm, rainy, snowy, moist, or dry than average localconditions. These factors all help determine what plants may or may not grow in your microclimate. Siting and Design A well-oriented and well-designed home admits low-angle winter sun, rejects overhead summer sun, and minimizes thecooling effect of winter winds. If you are building a home, pay attention to its orientation. In the northern hemisphere, it is usually best to align the home's long axis in an east-west direction. The home'slongest wall with the most window area should face south or southeast. The home's north-facing and west-facing wallsshould have fewer windows because these walls generally face winter's prevailing winds. North-facing windows receivelittle direct sunlight. You may be able to design and orient your new house to maximize your homesite's natural advantages and mitigate itsdisadvantages. Notice your homesite's exposure to sun, wind, and water. Also note the location and proximity of nearbybuildings, fences, water bodies, trees, and pavement -- and their possible climatic effects. Buildings provide shadeand windbreak. Fences and walls block or channel the wind. Water bodies moderate temperature but increase humidity andproduce glare. Trees provide shade, windbreaks, or wind channels. Pavement reflects or absorbs heat, depending onwhether its color is light or dark. If your home is already built, inventory its comfort and energy problems, then use the following landscaping ideas tohelp minimize these problems. Shading Solar heat passing through windows and being absorbed through the roof is the major reason for air-conditioner use.Shading is the most cost-effective way to reduce solar heat gain and cut air-conditioning costs. Using shadeeffectively requires you to know the size, shape, and location of the moving shadow that your shading device casts.Remember that homes in cool regions may never overheat and may not require shading. Trees can be selected with appropriate sizes, densities, and shapes for almost any shading application. To block solarheat in the summer but let much of it in during the winter, use deciduous trees. To provide continuous shade or toblock heavy winds, use evergreen trees or shrubs. Deciduous trees with high, spreading crowns (i.e., leaves and branches) can be planted to the south of your home toprovide maximum summertime roof shading. Trees with crowns lower to the ground are more appropriate to the west, whereshade is needed from lower afternoon sun angles. Trees should not be planted on the southern sides of solar- heatedhomes in cold climates because the branches of these deciduous trees will block some winter sun. A 6-foot to 8-foot (1.8-meter to 2.4-meter) deciduous tree planted near your home will begin shading windows the firstyear. Depending on the species and the home, the tree will shade the roof in 5 to 10 years. If you have an airconditioner, be aware that shading the unit can increase its efficiency by as much as 10%. Trees, shrubs, and groundcover plants can also shade the ground and pavement around the home. This reduces heatradiation and cools the air before it reaches your home's walls and windows. Use a large bush or row of shrubs to shadea patio or driveway. Plant a hedge to shade a sidewalk. Build a trellis for climbing vines to shade a patio area. Vines can shade walls during their first growing season. A lattice or trellis with climbing vines, or a planter boxwith trailing vines, shades the home's perimeter while admitting cooling breezes to the shaded area. Shrubs planted close to the house will fill in rapidly and begin shading walls and windows within a few years. However,avoid allowing dense foliage to grow immediately next to a home where wetness or continual humidity are problems.Well-landscaped homes in wet areas allow winds to flow around the home, keeping the home and its surrounding soilreasonably dry. Wind Protection Properly selected and placed landscaping can provide excellent wind protection, which will reduce heating costsconsiderably. Furthermore, these benefits will increase as the trees and shrubs mature. The best windbreaks block windclose to the ground by using trees and shrubs that have low crowns. Evergreen trees and shrubs planted to the north and northwest of the home are the most common type of windbreak. Trees,bushes, and shrubs are often planted together to block or impede wind from ground level to the treetops. Or, evergreentrees combined with a wall, fence, or earth berm (natural or man-made walls or raised areas of soil) can deflect orlift the wind over the home. Be careful not to plant evergreens too close to your home's south side if you are countingon warmth from the winter sun. A windbreak will reduce wind speed for a distance of as much as 30 times the windbreak's height. But for maximumprotection, plant your windbreak at a distance from your home of two to five times the mature height of the trees. If snow tends to drift in your area, plant low shrubs on the windward side of your windbreak. The shrubs will trap snowbefore it blows next to your home. In addition to more distant windbreaks, planting shrubs, bushes, and vines next to your house creates dead air spacesthat insulate your home in both winter and summer. Plant so there will be at least 1 foot (30 centimeters) of spacebetween full-grown plants and your home's wall. Summer winds especially at night can have a cooling effect if used for home ventilation. However, if winds are hot andyour home is air conditioned all summer, you may want to keep summer winds from circulating near your home. Planning Your Landscape Before you start landscaping, you must first develop a plan. The components of your plan could include deciduous treesand plants, coniferous trees and plants, earth berms, walls, fences, sheds, and garages. This section will help youcreate a landscape plan before you plant around your existing home or before you begin construction on a new house. Use paper and different-colored pencils to begin designing your landscape. First, sketch a simple, scaled drawing ofyour yard. Locate its buildings, walks, driveways, and utilities (e.g., sewer, electric, and telephone lines). Note thelocation of all paved surfaces -- streets, driveways, patios, or sidewalks -- near your home. Then identify potentialuses for different areas of your yard: vegetable gardens, flower beds, patios, and play areas. Draw arrows to show sun angles and prevailing winds for both summer and winter. As you sketch, circle the areas of youryard needing shade or wind protection. Indicate with arrows how you want views to be preserved or screened. Mark routes of noise pollution you wish to block.Also, highlight areas where landscaping height or width may be restricted, such as under utility lines or alongsidewalks. Notice yard areas that suffer from poor drainage and standing water. Some trees and shrubs will not grow well in poorlydrained areas; others will. Note existing trees and shrubs. Plan for their replacement if they are old or sick and ifthey provide valued shade or windbreak. Perhaps you want more defined property boundaries or less traffic noise. Consider a "living fence" of dense trees,bushes, or shrubs. Depending on its location and application, this hedge can be customized to be tall, short, wide,narrow, open, or dense. Privet is a species of shrub that grows in most parts of the United States and can serve as aliving fence. Areas of lawn not used as picnic or play areas can be converted to planting beds or xeriscaped areas.Xeriscaping is a landscaping technique that uses vegetation that is drought resistant and is able to survive onrainfall and groundwater once established. Converting a traditional lawn to alternative, water-conserving grasses orother forms of xeriscaping saves energy and reduces water consumption. Perhaps you live in an urban area where yards are small and neighbors close. Your neighbor's yard may be the best placefor trees to shade your south-facing windows. Your yard may be the best location for their windbreak. Bringing yourneighbors into your plans could benefit everyone involved. The more you identify your goals and familiarize yourself with your yard's features -- current and proposed -- thebetter your chances for success with your landscaping projects. Selecting and Planting Trees and Shrubs Trees and shrubs come in all shapes and sizes. How you select your trees and shrubs and how youplant them will directly affect your home's comfort and energy efficiency. Trees and shrubs have a life span of many years and can become more attractive and functional with age. But poorplanning of landscape improvements often creates trouble. Ensure proper plant placement and minimal maintenancebefore you plant! Shape Characteristics Tree shapes are very diverse think of the difference in shape between an oak and a spruce. The "Shading" section under"Climate, Site, and Design Considerations" above discusses how to use varying tree and shrub characteristics to maximumadvantage when landscaping. The density of a tree's leaves or needles is important to consider. Dense evergreens, like spruces, make great wind-breaks for winter winds. If you are just looking to impede summer winds, choose a tree or shrub with more open branchesand leaves. Such trees are also good for filtering morning sun from the east, while denser trees are better forblocking harsh afternoon summer sun. Growth Should you plant slow-growing or fast-growing tree species? Although a slow-growing tree may require many years ofgrowth before it shades your roof, it will generally live longer than a fast-growing tree. Also, because slow-growingtrees often have deeper roots and stronger branches, they are less prone to breakage by windstorms or heavy snow loads.And they can be more drought resistant than fast-growing trees. Consider growth rate, strength, and brittleness when locating trees near walkways or structures. Ask whether the maturetree s root system is likely to damage sidewalks, foundations, or sewer lines. The smaller your yard, the moreimportant it is to select a tree with manageable roots. Selecting, Final Planning, and Purchasing Landscape professionals can help you choose and locate new trees, shrubs, or ground cover. Share your drawings andtentative ideas with your local nursery or landscape contractor. As long as you have defined intended uses and spacesin which planting is actually possible, a competent nursery or landscape specialist will be able to help you makedecisions. When planting trees, shrubs, hedges, or bushes, find out how large the mature specimen will grow. In all cases,determine spacing by the mature sizes. For those plants close to your house, plan for at least 1 foot (30centimeters) of extra clearance between the full-grown shrub and the wall of the home. This will prevent heavy pruningor damage to home siding in the future. After considering the placement of your trees and consulting landscaping and nursery professionals, go back to yourdrawings or plans and add the new information on species, shape, and mature-size spacing. This provides a final,prepurchase review to make sure that all elements will work well together -- in the short and long term. When you are ready to purchase your trees and shrubs, avoid buying damaged specimens. Thoroughly inspect the bark,limbs, and roots to make sure the plant was handled carefully during growing, digging, and shipping. Reject plant stockwith signs of insects or disease (cocoons, egg masses, cankers, or lesions). After you purchase the plants, be sure to keep tiny root hairs damp and shaded at all times. The plants will notsurvive if these root hairs are allowed to dry before planting. Contact your county extension agents, public libraries, local nurseries, landscape architects, landscape contractors,and state and local energy offices for additional information on regionally appropriate plants and their maintenancerequirements.

Keep outside units free from leaves or debris that may clog vents. Close off unoccupied rooms and shut their heat or air-conditioning vents; or turn off room air conditioners. (This does not apply if you have a heat pump system, since shutting vents could harm a heat pump). Use kitchen, bath and other ventilating fans wisely. In just one hour, these fans can blow away a house full of warmed or cooled air. Turn them off just as soon as they have done their job.

Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the heating system can be increased. If you plan to buy a new furnace, select an energy-efficient unit. Your contractor has energy factsheets for each model; ask for them and compare energy usage. Consider the advantages of a clock thermostat for your heating system. The clock thermostat will turn the heat down for you automatically when you depart or go to bed and turn it up again when you return or awaken.

This saves the energy needed to heat the water, is recommended for the appliance, and aids in getting rid of grease. Grease solidifies in cold water and is then easier to grind up and wash away. Install an aerator in your kitchen sink faucet. By reducing the amount of water in the flow, you use less hot water and save the energy that would have been required to heat it.

You can save on your fuel costs for every degree you reduce the average temperature in your home. Keep windows near your thermostat tightly closed. Unnecessary drafts will keep your furnace working after the rest of the room has reached a comfortable temperature. Check the duct work for air leaks about once a year if you have a forced-air heating system. To do this, feel around the duct joints for escaping air when the fan is on.

Combustion air needed by the fire will be provided through the open window, and the amount of heated air drawn from the rest of the house will be reduced. If you have a simple open masonry fireplace, consider installing a glass screen, a convective grate, a combination convective grate with glass screen, a radiant grate, or a fireplace insert. Some of these devices will cut down on the loss of warm air through the fireplace chimney.

Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the system can be increased. If you need central air conditioning, select a unit with the lowest suitable capacity and highest efficiency. A larger unit than you need not only costs more to buy and run, but probably won't remove enough moisture from the air. Plant trees and shrubs to shade air-conditioning units. You can increase efficiency by up to 10 percent. Install an attic ventilation fan to cool the house when it's cool outside, even if you have central air conditioning.

The average car uses 17 percent less gasoline at 55 mph than at 65 mph. If highway speed limits were observed across the country, approximately 4 million gallons of gasoline would be saved each day. Avoid stop-and-go traffic. Check the traffic well ahead of you to avoid wasteful accelerations and decelerations. Take your foot off the accelerator as soon as you see a red light or slowed traffic ahead. Accelerate smoothly and moderately. Reach your desired speed, and then keep just enough pressure on the accelerator to maintain steady speed. On the highway, cruise control can help you do this.

Follow the instructions on the box. Oversudsing makes your machine work harder and use more energy. Presoak or use a soak cycle when washing heavily soiled garments. You'll avoid two washings and save energy. Keep the lint screen in the dryer clean. Remove lint after each load. Lint impedes the flow of air in the dryer, which makes your clothes take longer to dry and requires the machine to use more energy. Keep the outside exhaust of your clothes dryer clean. Check it regularly. A clogged exhaust lengthens the drying time and increases the amount of energy used.

These new lights can fit into many incandescent lamp sockets and provide the same quality of light. With efficiencies of 50-60 lumens per watt, the compact fluorescent lamps are 3-4 times more efficient than conventional bulbs and last 10 times as long. For example, an 18-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces the same amount of light as a 75-watt incandescent lamp. Although the initial cost is higher, the savings in electricity costs could pay for the compact fluorescent bulb in about a year.

The goal of Energy Awareness Month is to promote a greater public understanding and awareness of energy sources, how they can be used wisely and effectively, and the importance of energy to the economic prosperity and future of the United States. Energy Fuels Our Future is the theme of the 1995 observance. Sustainable development -- meeting the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs -- directs the Nation's energy policy. America's progress depends on our ability to use energy resources in ways that help the economy grow, protect the environment, and keep our Nation secure. Technological progress enables us to expand our resources, improve efficiency, and reduce the environmental impacts of producing, transporting, and consuming energy. Basic technologies, such as the electric motor, the internal combustion engine, and incandescent lighting, have had a profound effect on the way we live and work today. Emerging technologies, like fuel cells, photovoltaics, aerogels, and radiowave lighting, may have an equally profound effect on the way Americans live in the next century. Each day, Americans depend on the benefits of energy, usually without considering the role that energy plays in our quality of life. Every aspect of our lives and those of our children and future generations is affected by the energy choices and decisions we make today. This could mean choosing an energy-efficient appliance for a home or business; comparing the energy requirements of various models when replacing personal or company-owned vehicles; having a local utility do an energy audit on your home; using mass transportation; investing in energy-efficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; or simply turning off lights and equipment when not needed. The Department of Energy encourages organizations to become involved in this year's observance by sponsoring or participating in activities to promote energy awareness. With everyone's help, our fellow citizens, coworkers, and communities will focus on the importance of energy in today's world and our responsibility to ensure that tomorrow's energy needs are met.

Keep outside units free from leaves or debris that may clog vents. Close off unoccupied rooms and shut their heat or air-conditioning vents; or turn off room air conditioners. (This does not apply if you have a heat pump system, since shutting vents could harm a heat pump). Use kitchen, bath and other ventilating fans wisely. In just one hour, these fans can blow away a house full of warmed or cooled air. Turn them off just as soon as they have done their job. October 3 Tip of the Day Tuesday, October 3 Tips on buying and maintaining heating systems: Keep your heating equipment well-tuned with periodic maintenance by a professional serviceman. Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the heating system can be increased. If you plan to buy a new furnace, select an energy-efficient unit. Your contractor has energy factsheets for each model; ask for them and compare energy usage. Consider the advantages of a clock thermostat for your heating system. The clock thermostat will turn the heat down for you automatically when you depart or go to bed and turn it up again when you return or awaken. Wednesday, October 4 Tips on using your fireplace efficiently: When you use your fireplace, close all doors and warm air ducts entering the room containing the fireplace, and open a window near the fireplace about 1/2 to 1 inch. Combustion air needed by the fire will be provided through the open window, and the amount of heated air drawn from the rest of the house will be reduced. If you have a simple open masonry fireplace, consider installing a glass screen, a convective grate, a combination convective grate with glass screen, a radiant grate, or a fireplace insert. Some of these devices will cut down on the loss of warm air through the fireplace chimney. Thursday, October 5 Tips for efficient furnace usage: When the heat is on, lower your thermostat to about 65 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 60 degrees F at night. You can save on your fuel costs for every degree you reduce the average temperature in your home. Keep windows near your thermostat tightly closed. Unnecessary drafts will keep your furnace working after the rest of the room has reached a comfortable temperature. Check the duct work for air leaks about once a year if you have a forced-air heating system. To do this, feel around the duct joints for escaping air when the fan is on. Friday, October 6 Tips on using your air conditioning system: Keep your cooling system well-tuned with periodic maintenance by a professional serviceman. Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the system can be increased. If you need central air conditioning, select a unit with the lowest suitable capacity and highest efficiency. A larger unit than you need not only costs more to buy and run, but probably won't remove enough moisture from the air. Plant trees and shrubs to shade air-conditioning units. You can increase efficiency by up to 10 percent. Install an attic ventilation fan to cool the house when it's cool outside, even if you have central air conditioning. Monday, October 9 Tips for using your kitchen sink: Use cold water rather than hot to operate your food disposer. This saves the energy needed to heat the water, is recommended for the appliance, and aids in getting rid of grease. Grease solidifies in cold water and is then easier to grind up and wash away. Install an aerator in your kitchen sink faucet. By reducing the amount of water in the flow, you use less hot water and save the energy that would have been required to heat it. Tuesday, October 10 Efficient energy tips for your dishwasher: When using your dishwasher, let your dishes air dry. If you don't have an automatic air-dry switch, turn off the control knob after the final rinse. Prop the door open a little and the dishes will dry faster. Don't use the "rinse hold" on your machine for just a few dishes. It uses 3 to 7 gallons of hot water each time you use it. Be sure that your dishwasher is full, but not overloaded, when you turn it on. Wednesday, October 11 Refrigerator/Freezer energy savers: Don't keep your refrigerator or freezer too cold. Recommended temperatures: 38 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit for the fresh food compartment of the refrigerator; 5 degrees F for the freezer section. Regularly defrost manual-defrost refrigerators and freezers. Frost buildup increases the amount of energy needed to keep the engine running. Never allow frost to build up more than one-quarter of an inch. Make sure your refrigerator door seals airtight. Test them by closing the door over a piece of paper or dollar bill so it is half in and half out of the refrigerator. If you can pull the paper out easily, the latch may need adjustment or the seal may need replacing. Thursday, October 12 Washer and Dryer Energy Tips: When using your washing machine, don't use too much detergent. Follow the instructions on the box. Oversudsing makes your machine work harder and use more energy. Presoak or use a soak cycle when washing heavily soiled garments. You'll avoid two washings and save energy. Keep the lint screen in the dryer clean. Remove lint after each load. Lint impedes the flow of air in the dryer, which makes your clothes take longer to dry and requires the machine to use more energy. Keep the outside exhaust of your clothes dryer clean. Check it regularly. A clogged exhaust lengthens the drying time and increases the amount of energy used. Friday, October 13 Energy saving tips for your shower: Take showers rather than baths, but limit your showering time and check the water flow if you want to save energy. It takes bout 30 gallons of water to fill the average tub. A shower with a flow of 3 gallons of water a minute uses only 15 gallons in 5 minutes. Consider installing a flow controller at the showerhead. These inexpensive, easy-to-install devices restrict the flow of water to an adequate 3 to 4 gallons per minute. Monday, October 16 Tips for maintaining efficient light fixtures: To reduce overall lighting in non-working spaces, remove one bulb out of three in multiple light fixtures and replace it with a burned-out bulb for safety. Replace other bulbs throughout the house with bulbs of the next lower wattage. Consider installing solid-state dimmers or high-low switches when replacing light switches. They make it easy to reduce lighting intensity in a room and thus save energy. Tuesday, October 17 Using fluorescent bulbs: Use compact fluorescent lights whenever your can; they give out more lumens per watt than incandescent lamps. These new lights can fit into many incandescent lamp sockets and provide the same quality of light. With efficiencies of 50-60 lumens per watt, the compact fluorescent lamps are 3-4 times more efficient than conventional bulbs and last 10 times as long. For example, an 18-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces the same amount of light as a 75-watt incandescent lamp. Although the initial cost is higher, the savings in electricity costs could pay for the compact fluorescent bulb in about a year. Wednesday, October 18 Tips for purchasing lighting appliances: Consider the advantages of purchasing lights with three-way switches. They make it easy to keep lighting levels low when intense light is not necessary. Use the high switch only for reading or other activities that require brighter light. Try 25-watt reflector flood bulbs in high-intensity portable lamps. They provide about the same amount of light but use less energy than the 40-watt bulbs that normally come with these lamps. Try 50-watt reflector floodlights in directional lamps. These floodlights provide about the same amount of light as the standard 100-watt bulbs, but at half the wattage. Thursday, October 19 About decorative gas lamps: Have them turned off, unless they are essential for safety. Just eight gas lamps burning year round use as much natural gas as it takes to heat an average-size home for a winter season. By turning off one gas lamp, you might save from $40 to $50 a year in natural gas costs. Friday, October 20 Outdoor lighting tips: Use outdoor lights only when they are needed. One way to make sure they're off during the daylight hours is to put them on a photocell unit or timer that will turn them off automatically. Consider installing solar-powered outdoor pathway lamps or high-efficiency sodium lamps for outdoor security lighting. They are available at many local hardware stores and building suppliers. Monday, October 23 Insulating Tips Insulate walls and roof to the highest specifications recommended for your area. Insulate floors too, especially those over crawl spaces, cold basements and garages. If the base of the house is exposed, as in the case of a mobile home, build a "skirt" around it. Tuesday, October 24 Window efficiency tips: Use double-pane insulating glass throughout the house. Consider windows with low-emissivity (low-E) coatings and gas fills when retrofit or replacement is necessary. They also improve comfort, cut condensation, and reduce the fading effect of ultraviolet light on home furnishings. Installing low-E coated double glass unit with gas fill, instead of standard double glazing, will improve the insulating value of the glass area by 40 to 50 percent. Wednesday, October 25 Tips on appliance placement: Place your refrigerator in the coolest part of the kitchen, well away from the range and oven. Install the water heater as close as possible to areas of major use to minimize heat loss through the pipes. Insulate the pipes. Thursday, October 26 When buying a home: Ask for a description of the insulation and data on the efficiency of space heating, air-conditioning, and water heating plants, or have an independent engineer advise you about the efficiency of the equipment. Ask to see the utility bills from the previous year, but remember to adjust them for current utility rates. You may want to compare the bills of houses under construction. Friday, October 27 Tips on upgrading or retrofitting an existing home: Consider the need for additional insulation or replacement of equipment. Even some new houses don't have insulation in the exterior walls; be sure to check. If improvements are necessary, you may want to seek an adjustment in the purchase price to cover all, or a reasonable share, of the costs. When making major upgrades to improve the energy efficiency of an existing home, ask your lender for information about "Energy Efficient Mortgages" or other special financial incentives. Monday, October 30 Commuting: Use public transportation whenever possible. One person commuting to work by mass transit instead of driving can save 200 gallons of gasoline in a year. Use the most fuel-efficient motorcycle, moped, or even a bicycle for short commutes. If you live close enough, try walking to work. Join a carpool or a vanpool. About one-third of all private automobile mileage is for commuting to work. If occupancy increased by just one person per car, more than 40 million gallons of gasoline would be saved each day. Tuesday, October 31 General Driving Tips: Observe posted speed limits. The average car uses 17 percent less gasoline at 55 mph than at 65 mph. If highway speed limits were observed across the country, approximately 4 million gallons of gasoline would be saved each day. Avoid stop-and-go traffic. Check the traffic well ahead of you to avoid wasteful accelerations and decelerations. Take your foot off the accelerator as soon as you see a red light or slowed traffic ahead. Accelerate smoothly and moderately. Reach your desired speed, and then keep just enough pressure on the accelerator to maintain steady speed. On the highway, cruise control can help you do this.

Federal Energy Management Program Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Benefits Efficiency and renewable energy technologies are critical to building a clean, strong economy. Benefits include: Affordable and comfortable housing for American families. Our programs will save $17 billion in residential energy costs by 2005. Higher profits and more available capital for American businesses. Our programs will save $12.5 billion in commercial energy costs by 2005. Pollution prevention and greater productivity for American industries. Our programs will save $5.8 billion in industrial energy costs by 2005. A lower foreign trade deficit and reduced dependence on foreign oil (under current trends, imports will rise to 65% by 2010). New entrepreneurial opportunities and jobs (a total of 310,000 jobs in the year 2000, and 1,745,000 jobs in the year 2010). An increased share of the $425 billion global market for energy and environmental technologies. Reduced federal energy costs. Our programs will save Federal taxpayers $400 million by 2000. DOE's efficiency and renewable energy programs: Embody a new approach to government -- voluntary partnerships, with shared investment -- a major alternative to tax subsidies and "command-and-control". Help the marketplace work better. Deliver one of the government's highest rates of return on the taxpayer dollar. Why Building Efficiency Matters Buildings use 36% of America's energy. The electricity required just to light the nation's buildings equals 75% of the energy produced by America's nuclear power plants. Energy use in buildings has an enormous impact on the economy. The nation's 95 million households and 4.5 million commercial buildings spend $195 billion each year for energy. The potential for savings is high. A 30% improvement in U.S. building efficiency would reduce energy bills by $75 billion in 15 years and eliminate the need for 80 new nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. Many buildings were built long ago and contain obsolete energy systems. 80% of our commercial buildings were built prior to 1979. When new buildings are constructed, energy decisions are long-lasting. The median lifetime for commercial buildings is between 80-100 years, far longer than most power plants. Better lighting and thermal systems produce measurable increases in worker productivity. In fact, because labor costs dwarf energy costs per square foot, productivity gains often are the prime motivator for businesses to improve energy efficiency. Building efficiency is critical to environmental quality. Primary energy use by U.S. buildings accounts for 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. DOE's Programs Will cut energy consumption in commercial buildings by 2 quads over the next 10 years. Save businesses $12.5 billion annually. Create up to 125,000 jobs in the commercial sector. Lower residential energy demand by 2 quads, saving families $17 billion by the year 2005. Create another 125,000 jobs in residential construction industries. Why Utility Energy Use Matters The utility sector is a big influence on the U.S. economy. Electric and gas utilities represent a national capital investment portfolio of $790 billion. Utilities are significant energy consumers, accounting for 55% of total U.S. energy consumption. Utilities provide roughly $260 billion each year in energy services to homes, businesses and industries. This is 5.2% of the gross national product, an average expenditure of $235 per month for each household in America. The production and consumption of energy by utilities has a significant impact on the environment. For example, carbon dioxide emissions attributed to primary energy use by utilities constitute 45% of the U.S. total. Renewable energy technologies will help utilities assure clean and ample energy supplies to meet America's growing demand, while making our economy less vulnerable to swings in fossil fuel prices. Because they are cleaner than conventional power plants, renewable energy systems can help utilities and industries meet environmental goals. Renewable energy systems are reliable, versatile and flexible. The need for renewable energy worldwide is creating dynamic business opportunities for the U.S. renewable energy industry. DOE's Programs Help develop new sources of clean energy, including energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Assist utilities in long-range planning. Will save $14.5 billion in utility energy by the year 2000. Help U.S. industries develop technologies to capture part of the $1 trillion global market for electric generation systems. Why Transportation Energy Matters Each day, Americans use 4 million more barrels of oil for transportation than we produce. We are importing more oil than ever before, and the trend is upward. The gap between what we use and what we produce is projected to rise to 9 million barrels per day by the year 2010. Oil imports contribute significantly to the nation's foreign trade deficit, and make our economy vulnerable to price swings and supply disruptions. Emissions from the nation's 190 million cars and trucks account for about half of all air pollution in the U.S. and more than 80% of air pollution in cities. The American Lung Association estimates that America spends $50 billion each year on health care as a direct result of air pollution. America's cars are more efficient than ever, but our rate of fuel use continues to grow. Since 1980, the miles-per-gallon rating of passenger cars has improved 39%, yet fuel consumption is up 14%. A key reason: we are driving 43% more miles. Only 13% of the energy used by today's vehicles actually propels them forward; much of the rest could be saved with better equipment technology. The development and use of alternative fuels would create new U.S. industries, while reducing oil imports, the trade deficit and air pollution. DOE's Programs Partner with industries to produce more efficient vehicle technologies. Work with industry, government and fleet managers to encourage the use of cleaner, alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. Will help government and automakers produce a care three times as efficient as today's models, without sacrificing performance or safety. Will produce annual energy savings of $47 million by 2000 and $676 million by 2010. Will create nearly 830,000 jobs by 2010. Why Industrial Energy Usage Matters U.S. industry accounts for 25% of the nation's gross national product (GNP) and about 75% of our exports. It provided jobs for 26 million workers in 1993. Technologies that improve the productivity of U.S. industries improve the entire economy. Industries consume 36 percent of the energy used in the U.S., at a cost of $100 billion each year. This level of energy use provides great opportunities for savings. One example: Industry spends $30 billion annually to operate 40 million electric motors spread throughout industrial and manufacturing operations. Electric motors consume 70% of all energy in a typical manufacturing facility. These costs can be cut in half with efficient motor systems. Industries spend $45 billion per year to meet emissions control regulations. Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can prevent pollution before it occurs, freeing industrial capital for more productive purposes. DOE's Programs Improve industrial productivity and competitiveness through energy efficiency. Help industries prevent pollution and reduce pollution control costs. Will save $5.8 billion for industry by 2005. Will create at least 57,000 jobs. Programs Targeted for Urban Centers and Municipalities The U.S. Department of Energy's (ODE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) is the Federal government's principal agency for assisting in the research, development, and commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Some of the EE programs targeted for cities include: Municipal Energy Management Program Improvements in municipal energy management allow communities to reallocate energy operating funds to meet other needs. DOE's Municipal Energy Management Program has funded more than 250 projects that demonstrate innovative energy technologies and energy management tools in cities and counties through the Urban Consortium Energy Task Force (USETF). These projects have helped municipalities identify and capitalize upon energy saving opportunities that have already saved tens of millions of dollars. UCETF helps DOE foster municipal energy management through networks with cities and urbanized counties, and through links with three national associations of local governments the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/county Management Association. Contact: Linda Graves (202) 586-1851 Clean Cities Clean Cities is a program designed to help local businesses and communities comply with environmental regulations, create jobs, and enhance the image of urban communities by expanding the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV's) in urban communities. Despite considerable improvements in the fuel efficiency of commercial and personal vehicles, as a nation we continue to consume more than 60% of the oil used in this country for transportation. Clean Cities helps to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil as well as the air pollution caused by gasoline-powered vehicles. Since the program began just over a year ago, thirty-four localities have received DOE's Clean Cities designation. By the end of 1996, these cities combined intend to have more than 60,000 AFV's in use and establish 700 refueling and maintenance facilities. Contact: Tommy Foltz (202) 586-4264 State Energy Conservation Program Local Government Projects The State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) provides formula grants and administrative support to State and their municipalities in the planning, development, and implementation of energy efficiency and energy resource acquisition programs. Over the last 15 years more than $175 million in grant awards were administered by the SECP to 58 local government projects in 26 states. Over $6 million was awarded directly by the SECP between 1990 and 1994. A good example is the Local Government Program in Texas which has been funded since 1986 to provide energy audits, educational programs, workshops, demonstrations, incentive programs, training and competitive grants. Contact: Your Sate Energy Office Partnering With States The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) is the federal government's principal agency for assisting in the research, development, and commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Some of the EE programs delivered in partnership with State governments include: State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) Provides grants and technical assistance to States and U.S. territories to development and implement Sate energy plans. SECP has flexibility comparable to a block grant program, allowing States to tailor activities to their needs. Each dollar provided by the federal government catalyzes and average of $19 and additional State and private spending. SECP is funded at $22.54 million in FY 95. Contact: Ernestine Gibson (202) 586-8294 Institutional Conservation Program (ICP) ICP provides cost-shared grants to States to conduct energy analyses and energy capital improvements in schools and hospitals. The traditional program requires a 50/50 match of State and federal money. An innovative program uses the federal funds to leverage private or bond-based project financing at a greater than 20:1 ratio. ICP is funded at $29 million in FY 95. Contact: Robert K. Volk, Jr. (202) 586-8034 Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) WAP is a formula grant program that disburses over $200 million annually to retrofit more than 100,000 homes of low-income citizens, particularly the elderly, those with disabilities and families with children. Contact: Jeanne Van Vlandren (202) 426-1698 Sustainable Technology Energy Partnership Program (STEP):Accelerating the Commercialization of New Technologies This pilot program is designed to open the national laboratories to small and medium-sized businesses. State Energy Offices (SEOs) act as agents for private sector companies in the State, helping the companies define research project concepts and submitting them to DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for funding consideration. EE expects to award about $9 million, funding up to half the cost of research projects selected, with businesses and the States providing the remainder. Contacts: George Burmeister (202 586-5018) Carol Tombarl (303) 275-3057 Why Should We Care About Sustainable Energy? Environment Problem: Today, the production and use of energy causes more environmental damage than any other human activity. If current trends continue, it will get worse. U.S. energy consumption is projected to rise 46% between 1990 and 2025. World energy consumption will rise 50% in the next 15 years. Opportunity: Energy Efficiency allows economic growth to continue with lower rates of growth in energy consumption. Renewable resources provide clean alternatives to traditional fuels. Public Health Problem: Energy use is a public health issue, even in developed nations like the United States. Some 54 million Americans live in counties that regularly violate air quality standards. Opportunity: Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are proven ways to prevent pollution by business, industries and cars. Economy Problem: Wasted energy is wasted money for U.S. businesses, taxpayer and families. Enormous amounts of capital are wasted today in the form of unnecessary energy expenses. Opportunity: Less energy waste would free money for new investments in business plant and equipment, higher profits for stockholders, reduced consumer prices, better wages and training for workers, more disposable income for homeowners types of spending that research shows produce more jobs than building new power plants. Federal Energy Management Program Problem: The Federal Government is the largest energy consumer in the nation, occupying 500,000 buildings at 8,000 major sites, and is the world's largest customer for a variety of products, spending $20 billion per year to purchase energy-related products alone. In 1993, the Federal Government spent nearly $9 billion on energy for its buildings, fleets and operations, which represents more than 2% of the total energy used in the United States and almost 1% of the total amount of Federal expenditures. Solution: The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the federal government to become more energy efficient. President Clinton strengthened this requirement in an Executive Order directing Federal agencies to reduce their energy consumption 30 percent by 2005. To implement the Executive Order, FEMP helps Federal energy managers identify and procure the best energy saving projects. It does this through effective partnerships among agencies, utilities, the private sector, and States. FEMP provides training, on-site audits, design assistance, and new technology applications. FEMP will demonstrate at Federal sites new or emerging technologies to save more energy and to conserve water. The program will transform public sector purchasing from "followers" to market-leaders for new technology, accelerate market entry of DOE and industry=sponsored research and development by 3-5 years, and reinforce other technology initiatives such as job creation in start-up industries. Benefits: Making Federal buildings and operations more resource efficient saves taxpayers $400 million annually and $1 billion a year by 2005, as well as helps bring new products to market, where they can benefit other customers. In addition, FEMP creates more than 16 new jobs at 40 per million dollars invested. If all the Federal agencies changed to modern, energy efficient lighting, the government could avoid more than a quarter of a billion dollars each year on lighting costs alone. In the past, Federal agencies lacked incentive and capital for energy improvements. Today, energy=service companies, local utilities and new Federal funding program are making money available for Federal energy efficiency projects. FEMP's efforts have already helped reduce federal energy consumption in FY 1992 by 10.5% from the Fy 1985 baseline, and have reduced Federal energy costs by more than half a billion dollars over the last two years. With a new way of doing business that includes partnerships and problem solving, those results can be significantly increased, in addition FEMP will produce cost savings of $900 million per year and reductions of nearly 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through Federal buying power of energy and water-efficient products. DOE Program: The FEMP program is currently funded at $23.4 million. FEMP's proposed FY 96 budget is $25.4 million.

Splitting these atoms to form lighter elements--a process called fission--causes a release of energy, which is used to boil water into steam. The steam then spins a turbine, which in turn spins a generator to produce electricity. Resource In 1994, the 109 operating nuclear power plants in the United States produced about 22% of the nation's electricity--only coal produces more electricity. Nuclear power plant performance is steadily improving. In early 1970s, nuclear power plants typically operated at only 50% of their total capacity. Today they operate at consistently more than 70% of their capacity. Although no nuclear power plants have been ordered since 1978, many plants that were under construction at that time have been completed and are now operating. This steadily increased electricity generation by nuclear power and provided electricity to meet increased U.S. power needs. Advantages Nuclear power--unlike fossil fuels--generates no air pollutants, (such as nitrous oxides or sulfur dioxide) or greenhouse gases, so it does not contribute to acid rain, smog, or climate change. The nuclear and coal power plants that entered service in the last 20 years have cut oil use for electricity production by 1 million barrels per day, helping reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil. Issues There are several barriers to the expanded use of nuclear power. Among the leading ones are: Delays in providing for nuclear waste management Economic competitiveness with other fuels Public concerns about safety, despite actual safety records Investment community concerns about financial risks. Waste management is one of the most difficult problems for nuclear power. The technology exists for the burial of wastes from nuclear power plants and studies are under way to test the suitability of a potential site for an underground repository. However, no site has been formally selected, and reaching a final decision requires much more work. Because of the lack of a permanent waste repository, nuclear plants have stockpiled spent fuel on site in large pools of water. These pools were only built large enough for temporary storage needs, so many are close to capacity, requiring operators to look for other storage options. DOE Projects and Initiatives The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is working with the nuclear industry in a cost- shared, cooperative program to develop standardized, certified designs for the next generation of nuclear power plants--advanced light-water reactors. These new, economic plants, incorporating improved safety features, will be available for electric utility orders about the turn of the century. DOE is also making major changes in the civilian reactor waste management program to get the program on schedule and avoid further delays. References 1.

Suggestions for involving the news media and generating publicity are described in this section. It�s a good idea to involve the news media in your planning from the very start. Discuss with them the types of coverage that might be available, and propose various story ideas and angles for coverage. The news media in your community might be interested in sponsoring or co-sponsoring some of the events as well. Media Relations It�s very important to have solid contacts in the news media. One person in your group should be designated as the media contact person. Don�t confuse the media with a number of spokespersons or contacts. One of your first jobs is to explain the purpose of your project to the media. Then, closer to the event dates, supply them with specific background facts (a media fact sheet) to generate coverage. But remember, the news media will make the final judgment on what is newsworthy and interesting! You can help them by determining what they want. Consider inviting some or all of the news media in your community to co-sponsor the event. This could ensure more publicity. But please note that this works best in a community where you have only one radio or TV station, or one newspaper. In a multimedia community, competition among the media could mean that co-sponsorship by one might mean no help or coverage by the others. Determine whether this potential problem is worth the additional coverage you would get Radio, TV, Cable To repeat: Make early contact with the electronic media in your community. Ways to cover your event will be numerous: News and discussion programs. Talk shows. Phone-in programs with energy representatives. Public service announcements (10, 30, and 60 second announcements that plug Energy Awareness Month and your event). Start by contacting the station manager and ask whom you should work with, which probably will be the news director. You will also be dealing with news reporters, program producers, community affairs directors, and talk show hosts. News Reporters Give them the quick news story -- what�s happening, when, where, why and how. They may want to interview one of the leaders to provide an actuality. Make sure you pick an articulate spokesperson for the interview. Program Producers Producers may see your energy event as a peg on which to hang a whole series of programs. Talk Show Hosts Talk shows provide an opportunity to present more background and details on your event because you have more time to talk about it. Remember that on radio you have to paint pictures for the listener. Use anecdotes to illustrate what you have to say. For television, bring along slides or other visual materials. Visuals for TV To attract TV coverage during your event, you will need good visuals, that is, photographs, exhibits, videotapes, and so forth. This requires thought and creativity. If you are really eager to get on TV, make a special effort to talk with the producer and determine angles for his program. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on short notice if they decide to cover an event. News Releases As soon as you have decided to hold an event, issue a news release outlining all of the activities. Include the pertinent facts: date, broad description of planned activities, comment on importance and purpose. You may want to quote the person responsible for the activities -- the event coordinator. Later, give the news media more facts as they become available. Add the human interest stories, mentioned previously, once you have managed to collect them. Two weeks before the event, issue a news release detailing all the planned activities. Make sure you specify exact times and places. Have someone available to answer media calls which will result from the release. This should be the contact person, and the name and number should be listed on the news release (home and work numbers). If an interesting event develops at the last minute, telephone the newspaper or broadcast station, making sure you have all of your facts in order first. Media Mailing List Send your news releases to the following: News editors of daily and weekly newspapers. News editors of radio stations. News editors of TV stations. News directors for cable news channels. Feature editors of daily and weekly newspapers. Consumer reporters. Radio and TV program producers. Picture editors of newspapers. Editors of city or regional magazines. Public Affairs directors for all media. Community or civic organization newspapers or newsletters (check deadlines). A word to the wise: Don�t send your releases to more than one person at each media outlet, unless you let all concerned know who is receiving what. Proclamations Mayors, city councils, boards of supervisors, boards of education and civic organizations are often willing to issue an official proclamation or pass a resolution in recognition of a special event. If you make it official in your community, tell the news media. Ask them to attend the signing ceremony, and distribute copies of the proclamation or resolution. Community Calendars Most newspapers, radio stations, TV stations and cable services have free listings for upcoming events in the local area. Other sources include a local telephone-recorded information or library service. Public service announcements (PSAs) on local radio, TV and cable facilities may be available for promoting your event. PSAs are run repeatedly and could effectively publicize your events. Contact the station manager. Check copy deadlines. Most media expect you to provide the exact text for the listings, so double-check it for accuracy before sending it in, making clear which publication or airdate(s) it is for. Posters and Pamphlets Posters can be expensive to produce, and it takes time to arrange for their display in enough places to make an impact. Think about a dual-purpose leaflet/poster that is more easily displayed on bulletin boards and in shop windows. Try to latch on to an existing distribution system, such as branch libraries, branches of financial institutions, voluntary organizations and/or your own member organizations. Be sure to allow enough time for the leaflet posters to get through the distribution system. Arrange a spot check to ensure the system is working. Distribution to Community Organizations Experience has shown that response to leaflet distribution to community organizations and neighborhood groups is often very poor. It�s probably a waste of time to send such publicity out blind. Personal contact to interest someone in the organization who will ensure distribution and to find the best timing is essential. Publicity After the Event You may be able to squeeze double publicity out of some events by having a follow-up release after the event is over. For example, if you run a contest, you can have a separate prize award presentation a week or so afterwards. It�s vital to the success of Energy Awareness Month to include some bold activities that attract the public, particularly to your exhibition, and attract the media to cover your events, thus bringing you free publicity. People enjoy it, too! Here are some "tried and true" ideas: Recruit a rock band, brass band or marchers. Make a lot of noise and get attention. As people flock to see and hear what�s going on, follow up with free leaflets, buttons, etc. Interest them in looking at the display. Recruit free dancers (like an exercise dance group) with recorded music. Arrange for large banners across main shopping areas. First, get permission from local authorities.Get a local TV or sports personality to visit some of the events or to open the event(s). Go for someone who is well known to the general public, rather than an energy expert. Arrange a photo opportunity for the local media. A local celebrity usually guarantees a picture in the local paper, whatever the event. You can also arrange for your own photographer to take pictures for the record. It helps to have more than one flash going off as picture-taking is an event itself and attracts attention. Arrange for a civic opening. This is more dignified razzmatazz, but it does the same job. It also gives added weight to your event when it is recognized in the official calendar of civic events. Book the date well in advance with the secretary to the mayor, council chair or other official. Nearer to the date, discuss all details including the exact timetable. As with any distinguished visitor, make sure there is someone to greet him/her, introduce them to others involved, and take them around the exhibit or event. Arrange for visits to the exhibition by other newsworthy people, such a local state legislator, your congressman, the governor, or someone representing the governor. Their press secretaries will usually help with publicity arrangements. If you get a national figure, then contact national media as well.

But if you anticipate the work that must be done, work out a timetable and follow the useful tips in this section, you will be able to get the job done without last minute panic. 1. Allow plenty of time to: Track down the right people who can help you (both volunteers and sponsors. Find the right location for events. Write, print and distribute publications. Spread the word and build an audience. Contact the news media. Meet with the planning committee 2. Remember that it takes proportionately longer to plan depending on the number of events you organize. 3. Use a timeline chart to plan what must be done each week leading up to the major events. 4. Have a round-up meeting. Several weeks before the date of the event, meet with everyone involved to go over all details and arrangements. This will ensure that everyone knows the plan, plus it allows time to organize that last minute bright idea. 5. Allow for an 11th hour panic period. Set a date three working days before your first event by which everything must be ready. If it isn�t, you still have breathing space to sort things out. You need meetings to make decisions and you need people to carry out those decisions. Here are some points to consider: Number of Meetings You�ll probably need one or two meetings at the beginning of your planning phase to discuss ideas and agree on the purpose and scope of your program. This should include the key people and major organizations to be involved. Detailed planning meetings will be needed with smaller groups of people. As plans progress, you will need fewer meetings and more action. But don�t forget to hold the round-up meeting several weeks before the first event. Effective Meetings Make sure that decisions are reached and recorded. Don�t be afraid to delegate and be sure that people know their responsibilities. Write and circulate action points as soon after the meetings as you can manage. Circulate contact list with names, addresses and telephone (and/or fax) numbers of everyone actively involved, as soon as possible. Don�t forget to circulate additions to it as the planning progresses. Actively solicit additions to this list. Between Meetings. For each job that needs to be done, it helps to have a leader who is diplomatic and who can prepare the agenda and keep an overall check on everything. It helps if this person is available during the daytime and can travel around easily. You�ll probably need to visit people whose help you will require to explain and personally discuss your plans. Confirm any arrangements you make with them in writing. Confirm bookings for rooms and speakers in writing after you have reached verbal agreement. You may have to contact the same organization about different events. It helps if there is just one contact person at each end, even if these two are not directly responsible for all of it. It is very easy for misunderstandings to arise or opportunities for useful cooperation to be overlooked if two different people from the same organization are involved and don�t know the full picture. If you get agreement from someone at the top of an organization for its participation, make sure that you are also in touch with the people who will actually implement that decision. Sharing the Workload. Define specific jobs and give one or two people joint responsibilities to: Contact group members and arrange a volunteers� schedule. Edit a special brochure for members about the events. Act as liaison with other organizations. Prepare the copy for a special information leaflet or supplement. Design questions for contests. Reserve rooms and speakers. Order displays and leaflets. Get entries about the events in all free local publications and the media. Promote attendance for events by visits to public meetings and regular meetings of other civic groups (such as veterans� organizations, senior citizens or women�s clubs). You may find not only future participants, but potential volunteers and/or sponsors. Team Captain Remember you will need bodies to do things on the days of the events (help manage meetings, move furniture, take messages, make coffee, keep leaflet supplies handy). Someone on the planning committee should have the job of getting this team together, making out a schedule and briefing volunteers. This is a good way to share the workload between more people than just the planning committee, who may be feeling fairly exhausted by the start of the event. Building an audience Encourage the members of your own organization not as involved and members of other organizations to come to any meetings to be held during Energy Awareness Month. You may need separate and special publicity about this. Allow time to prepare this and distribute it. It may even be worth phoning around to encourage people to come or arrange rides for them if they would like to come but find it difficult to get to the meetings. The following checklist will be helpful in planning your event: Set objectives and purpose. Establish overall theme. Determine audience to be reached. Decide subjects to be covered. Locate sponsors and co-sponsors. Prepare budget. Devise tentative agenda. Make oral requests to speakers. Send letters of request to speakers. Send confirming letters Request special equipment. Prepare final agenda. Determine location of event. Write and print program. Arrange for other rooms for speakers, refreshments or lunch breaks, restrooms, etc. Set registration procedure. Make provisions for chairs, tables, signs. Secure items for registration table (posters. brochures, etc.) Arrange for podium, microphones, room arrangement. Note telephone numbers at location. Determine staffing needs. Clean up facilities. Send thank-you letters to participants.

Aim for proper balance of time and resources. Although we refer to an Energy Awareness Month, your series of events might be only a weekend or even a day. A week is a long time to fill with effective events; it might take months to plan, recruit people and organizations, and enlist the help of the news media. On the other hand, exhibits and displays benefit from longer exposure than a day or two. Also, an entire week ensures that more people will join in the events that are planned. Before you decide on the time frame, review the suggested programs that follow. Don�t hesitate to design your own program to fit your needs and time availability. Be realistic about how much you can handle. One short, well-run event will have a far greater impact than a poorly planned and organized week. Make sure there is a balance among the following major event categories: Razzmatazz Personalities Celebrities Banners Balloons Badges Bands Dancers, clowns Crazy contests Colorful events that attract media Advice and Information Spoken: Special advice sessions Staffed booths Phone-in media programs Visual: Exhibits Local-access cable programs Television specials Radio/TV talk shows Written: Leaflets Newspaper supplements Public Participation Meetings for volunteers who serve on energy committees Radio and TV discussion programs Contests Social events Special meetings 1. Arrange a Meet your Legislators day to give citizens a chance to meet their state or U.S. representatives and discuss energy issues. 2. Seek partnerships with local businesses/organizations to: publish educational brochures; prepare a directory of local energy resources; establish a speakers bureau to address community groups, schools, offices, civic organizations, etc.; rewrite energy product information booklets, or instructions in plain English; and include energy information as bill stuffers. 3. Prepare an energy supplement for your local newspaper. 4. Arrange a media tour, including radio and TV interviews, talk shows and phone-in programs. 5. Meet with energy experts to discuss their work. 6. Hold a public meeting to introduce energy experts. 7. Develop comparative product testing exhibits or lessons. 8. Sponsor an Energy Inventions contest. 9. Sponsor a contest for the most exotic/creative unproven energy technologies. 10. Conduct employee seminars on energy issues. 11. Arrange and coordinate an energy fair with exhibits or demonstrations in a shopping mall or neighborhood shopping centers. 12. Arrange for your mayor and/or governor to proclaim Energy Awareness Month in your city or state. 13. Organize special interest meetings (such as advice on making your home or business more energy efficient; presentations on lighting, business machines, appliances, etc.). 14. Organize or conduct public seminars at community colleges, community centers, or military bases. 15. Set up an Ask the Energy Expert desk in public libraries, hardware stores, and/or shopping malls. 16. Offer car care tips at inspection stations. 17. Produce and market public service announcements for local radio and TV.

If several organizations are involved in one event, try to divide up the charges among them. Make sure people know exactly what is expected of them in the way of financial contributions. A kitty of a few hundred dollars or less should see you through if you can persuade others to help you. Some of the things you may need to spend money on are: Display space Banner Buttons Newspaper supplement Advertising Posters Printing leaflets Refreshments Prizes Postage and telephone During Energy Awareness Month, posters and other materials may be available from federal, state, and local governments, many civic and business organizations, and other local utility companies. You may also be able to use these materials at events at other times during the year. On the income or in-kind contribution side, organizations that might provide financial support, goods, or services (office space, telephones, printing) are: Those taking part in the event: Local news media Financial institutions Shopping centers Libraries Local government Non-profit foundations of corporations doing business in your area sometimes make cash contributions to events. And a note about insurance: when renting rooms or arranging exhibition space, check that the rent includes public liability insurance.

Make sure that you know what your aims and objectives are and make sure that other organizations involved do too. 2. Allow plenty of time to plan. 3. Use your local newspapers, radio, television stations and cable systems as much as possible. Involve them right from the planning stage and listen to their advice about what will be newsworthy. 4. Ask other organizations about the best ways of reaching their members and allow enough time for invitations and leaflets to get through their systems. 5. Involve other organizations in helping to plan your Energy Awareness Month (or weekend or just a day), but expect to be (and to be seen as) the leader in the venture. Always be clear about who is responsible for what. 6. Go to where people are -- downtown shopping and office areas, shopping centers and neighborhood shopping areas. Try to get bulletin board space in branch offices of financial institutions, community centers or grocery stores. 7. Don�t be afraid of razzmatazz -- it works and people enjoy it. 8. Always check out meeting halls, exhibition spaces, and shopping centers beforehand. If they�re not suitable, don�t book them; if necessary, cancel the event. A poor site can kill an event. 9. Hold a planning meeting for everyone involved at least four weeks in advance to check through details, uncover problems and follow up on last minute ideas. 10. Don�t overstretch your resources -- you still have to carry on after the month (week/day) event is over. Better to concentrate on one or a few events and get the best publicity than spread a lot of events over a long period and lose impact. Back to Energy Awareness Month Home Page [DOE] [EREN] WT02-B17-318IA060-000328-B012-182http://www.eren.doe.gov:80/events/energyam/htmldocs/eamguide/eamevnts.htm 205.168.79.27 19970115020937 text/html 16992HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 02:09:44 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 21:45:12 GMTContent-length: 16817 Events Events This is a display over several days in perhaps a shopping center to show the work of local organizations, and government, with people from those organizations on hand to talk to the public, answer questions, and give out leaflets. Visits from local celebrities, dignitaries or national figures, plus banners, photographers, local broadcasts, and surveys involving public participation all add to the attractions. Useful tips: Be an extrovert. Think about getting balloons and stick-on badges to give away. Arrange for visitors (local personalities) who will get publicity. Make sure the display space is well identified. A banner across the front tends to get hidden unless it is above people�s heads. You may need to find and fix vertical supports to raise your flag. Or give staffers eye-catching sashes, rosettes or hats. Use strong color and design. Have lots of people working at the exhibition so that visitors can be helped as quickly as possible. Get a local radio personality to do a broadcast from the exhibition. Decide in advance what to do if the weather is awful. Have an alternative site or day planned. Make sure it is publicized. Have rubber bands or paperweights available to hold down leaflets. Share costs of rent (if necessary) and insurance among participating organizations. Find volunteers for erecting and dismantling exhibition material. An on-site telephone is invaluable. Provide chairs for staff. Try to advertise on-site before you open. Use the opportunity of meeting the public to conduct a simple but substantive survey. Checklist Book space and check conditions of renting and security. Invite special visitors. Find display boards and furniture. Arrange moving, erecting and dismantling of exhibit. Agree on layout. Book other events. Get banner. Arrange schedule of volunteers. Tell the media. Timing Reserve space and plan supporting events early. Start thinking about any special surveys in ample time. Get leaflets as early as possible. Arrange volunteers� schedules about a month beforehand. See Publicity section (Page 9). Start your search for display boards early. Spend time discussing the exhibit layout with all the organizations that will be participating. This is a display of posters and leaflets illustrating the work of national and local organizations with an interest in energy, in a library, shopping center or elsewhere which can be left up for a period of time and which does not need constant staff attention. Useful Tips Reserve space early. Display space is often at a premium. If no single display space is available, consider smaller displays in shop windows or empty shop premises. Make sure organizations providing display material know who is responsible for transporting, putting up and dismantling, and who will pay. Some organizations have a minimum display period for lending their displays (to justify the cost of setting up and taking down). Find out if your display can continue when your main event is over. Replenish leaflet supplies during the event. Allow time to set up and dismantle (a day before and after display time). Walk through the public areas on the way to your exhibition and post signs at key points. Make sure your display can be secured when not in use. Your information is valuable and every effort should be made to protect it. Checklist: Reserve space and confirm dates early. Confirm renting conditions, particularly insurance (both public liability and damage to display) and security. Order displays and leaflets. Ensure good sign posting. Arrange special visitors if needed. Tell the media. If the library or shopping center produces its own publicity, check the details with them so that they describe your exhibition as you would like. Contests attract interest and involve the public in the event. Entry forms could be printed in the local paper or distributed in local shops. Stores may donate prizes and should be credited for their contributions. Ideas for Subject Matter A general energy quiz. Most creative unproven energy technology. Best energy slogan. Best designed energy stamp. Useful Tips Keep questions short and very simple. Arrange for collection of entries in neutral places. Include a tie-breaker. Make all arrangements before launching the contest. It�s easier to cancel a flop than cope with hundreds of entries on short notice. Checklist Find sponsors. Agree on competition and prizes. Compose entry form and try it out for yourselves. Agree on conditions of entry and judges. Appoint judges and agree on judging system. Arrange distribution and collection of entry forms. Arrange announcement of results and awarding of prizes. Tell the media. What kind of meeting do you want? A public meeting to give an opportunity to publicize the existence of government agencies and various organizations and groups interested in energy issues? An opportunity for representatives of these agencies and organizations to meet and talk together about what they do, how they do it and any problems they face? A training opportunity? A social event? Useful Tips Involve agencies and organizations from the start and discuss with the chief officer the kind of meeting the members would like. Allow plenty of time for them to circulate invitations to their members. Make positive efforts to get an audience if it is to be a public meeting; contact other organizations in good time; make personal contact with them to explain what you are doing. Inspect the meeting room; make sure there are enough chairs, a speaker�s lectern or platform and a sound system. Make sure the meeting room is well identified. Even modest refreshments help people relax and get to know each other. Timing Agree on the date and program early so that details can be circulated well in advance. This project uses a large room where each agency or organization has its own consulting section, with table and chairs. An alternative would be to use one room which is shared on a rotating basis among the organizations over a period of time. Most elected representatives attend local meetings to keep in touch with their constituents. An alternative idea would be to arrange a specific energy issue session linked to one of the general energy meetings. Useful Tips A specific issue session is probably not worth planning unless the site is very accessible to the general public and well identified. People need to get to the site easily. A shopping center meeting room might be set aside, on a rotating basis, for issue sessions. If it can be repeated at a later date, or become part of the center�s regular schedule, you will have established a new specialized advice service to the general public. Massive amounts of publicity are necessary. Remember that most people usually do not have energy problems or questions at any single particular time. As a result, the number of times your issue session will coincide with people having problems or questions you can help solve or answer will be fairly small. Nevertheless, a session can still be useful. Checklist Reserve the room. Discuss the format with the participating organizations. Provide furniture. Provide identification for each organization. Tell the media. Consider planning public meetings during Energy Awareness Month with other local or national organizations on particular subjects (energy conservation/do-it-yourself residential remodeling; appliance labeling and efficiency; future energy supply, etc.). An alternative would be to find a speaker, or gather a number of speakers from various organizations involved in your event, and offer them to other local organizations to speak at regular meetings. Since some organizations plan their programs six months or a year in advance, it is probably more effective to publicize your speakers panel during Energy Awareness Month with the hope that appearances can be lined up for your speakers during the coming year. Useful Tips Public meetings usually are not well attended. Any more than 20 is considered good. Try to get a captive audience. For example, if the meeting is to be at a college, ask the president, dean and responsible faculty members to publicize it, or let you publicize it, among the students. If you are co-sponsoring the event with other organizations, make sure they know it is their responsibility as well to generate an audience from their membership. Checklist Discuss ideas with other organizations. Inspect and reserve a site. Plan for refreshments. Line up speakers. Publicize to potential audiences. Identify the location of the meeting room. Car care is a popular topic and one that is likely to interest your audience. You might organize a car care fair to help educate motorists about vehicle maintenance. The fair could be held over a weekend, with various exhibits and local experts to answer questions. Or a week-long event could be planned, with a different clinic each night on a specific topic. You should be able to enlist the aid of reputable local experts such as mechanics, auto supply dealers, auto clubs and car dealers, since the event will provide good publicity for their businesses. In addition to knowing about car care, these people will probably know useful information about recent recalls of certain models, or refunds offered by auto manufacturers for specific repairs on certain categories of cars. Don�t forget to invite experts who can discuss alternatively fueled cars and new automotive technologies that promise more efficient transportation.CAR CARE EVENTS Checklist Involve and organize planners and participants -- state or local government, civic groups, driver education classes of the local high school, etc. Plan your budget and events. Choose and reserve a site. Round up experts and exhibit materials. Plan for publicity, refreshments, etc. There are several projects you could help plan with schools, such as a special energy contest (quiz, designing an energy poster, or energy stamp) or a special film for video tape showing. Many government agencies, corporations, trade associations and non-profit organizations have materials available. A good speaker is needed to introduce the films and tapes, and, if necessary, answer questions. You could put together an energy education kit, or an energy teaching kit for an adult literacy class. For example, materials distributed by the local electric utility company (meter reading cards, disconnection notices, energy efficiency tips, leaflets) can be the basis for literacy teaching. Useful Tips There is so much you could do, it could take a whole week in itself. You need the active cooperation of educators if it is to succeed. Get an inside contact and talk with school administrators and/or teacher organizations before you decide to proceed. The awarding of prizes can be a separate event with its own publicity. News media love children, so use them in the publicity. They are the energy users of tomorrow. A newspaper supplement or pamphlet is a permanent memento of your energy event. It provides key information about the event and your group. The supplement, of course, is distributed as part of your local newspaper, while the pamphlet would be distributed in quantity to the public. Most groups planning an energy event want to produce a supplement or pamphlet. Contents Program for the day, week, month. Details about local energy organizations, with addresses, hours of operation and brief outline of what they do. (Example: people won�t automatically know what a utility consumer board is and does.) Useful Tips It takes time to write copy and get approval of the final draft from everyone involved. You will want photographs or other art work which need to be prepared well in advance. Newspaper Supplement. One full page or several tabloid pages in a local newspaper with a high circulation can cost a lot of money. Try to sell other organizations on taking advertising space on your page or in the supplement to help pay for it. Consumer Information Pamphlet. Again, bulk printing of a leaflet can be expensive. Get estimates from local printers well in advance. Think carefully about the message that is important to the public and how you will distribute the pamphlet (at the exhibit, local libraries, etc.) before you begin production. Checklist Confirm titles, addresses, and telephone numbers with organizations appearing in supplement or pamphlet and a simple description of what they do. Have names, addresses, and telephone numbers checked by someone who is not familiar with them. Collect interesting stories and make contacts for newspapers to interview to provide editorial copy for the supplement. Although not an essential part of the week, a social event for the organizers is a bonus and gives cohesion to the group that has come together to plan it. You could make it part of one of your events such as the meeting of energy representatives, or it could be a special event, perhaps at the end of the week when everyone could relax and thank-yous could be made (with special recognition given to the workers and organizers). But remember, this too will need organizing and invitations must be sent.

O. Wilson discusses the future of biodiversity CI pioneers aquaculture technology in Gulf of California Armed attack on CI biological station in the Selva Lacandona The Netherlands' highest conservation award goes to CI president The Coffee connection to conservation Madagascar's Indri Washington, DC: The indri announces itselfin the eastern rain forests of Madagascar with its unmistakable,eerie wailing song. The largest of the lemurs, the indri usesits long hind legs to hop through the canopy like a kangaroo whilelooking for leaves and fruit to eat. The indri, along with Madagascar'sother 31 lemur species, occur nowhere else in the world. Environmentaldestruction and hunting, however, severely threaten the indriand other lemurs, which require large undisturbed ecosystems tosurvive. Slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, cattle-ranching,and mining have altered about 80% of Madagascar's original forestcover. CI is working in the Zahamena Nature Reserve to ensurethe future of these unique primates and the habitats on whichthey depend. "Shade Coffee" Yields Global Conservation Opportunities Americans consume 350 million cups of coffee each day, and that's just a fraction of coffee consumption around the globe. With over 11 million hectares in production, coffee is now the world's largest agricultural commodity. Coffee, however, is typically grown on "sun farm" plantations that result in substantial clear-cutting of tropical rain forest. Our high demand for coffee is linked to ecosystem destruction across the tro../resource/icons. Organic "shade farm" coffee, however, representsa significant opportunity to satisfy the demands of coffee-drinkers worldwide and make coffee cultivation more environmentally benign.Grown under rain forest canopy, shade farm coffee has the potential to prevent deforestation, and hence, protect biodiversity. Comparing bird populations on plantations and shade farms offers compelling evidence: In a recent Smithsonian study, researchersfound 140 bird species near shade farms in Chiapas, Mexico, and only five or six on sun farms in the same vicinity. Because organic coffee requires no agrochemicals, it also protects the health of local people and ecosystems. CI is exploringrelations with coffee-grower organizations by providing financial and technical support to farmers who are introducing shade-grown, organic coffee. Toensure income for this niche in the coffee market, CI is alsoworking with US coffee importers and distributors to help increasethe size of organic-coffee markets. "By providing this assistanceto shade farmers, CI hopes to use coffee as a major driver ofbiodiversity conservation around the world," said Mike Saxenian,CI's Senior Director for Conservation Enterprise. "Gainingthe commitment of corporations to expand coffee markets will bean important part of this process." Debt Swap a Boon for Mexico CIand US AID have secured a debt-for-nature swap in Mexico thatwill provide substantial funds for CI's conservation workwith the communities near the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in the Selva Lacandona region. The swap--thefirst one since the Mexican government recently reauthorized suchexchanges--relieves Mexico of $488,000 worth of debt and generates$336,500 to be spent exclusively on conservation projects. CI Field Trips In 1996, CI will be offering exclusive field tripsfor our supporters and friends. Our country program staff willlead these custom-designed adventures to visit CI sites and beyond.Destinations for the coming year are Guatemala, Costa Rica andPanama, Botswana, Ghana, and Brazil.

CI Launches New Coastal Conservation Program Washington, DC: Decreasing fisheries and rising numbers of endangered marine creatures are two indicators of a serious decline of marine habitats. But our limited knowledge of ecosystems such as coral reefs hampers our abilities to protect their biological wealth. Less than ten percent ofthe world's oceans sampled for their diversity. CI's Board ofDirectors has recently approved a new coastalconservation program that will systematically address these challenges. CI's new program, to be managed by CI staff member and marinebiologist Tim Werner, will focus on the protection of coral reefs, estuaries, and other coastal habitats, including high-priority regions such as Mexico's Gulf of California and the Tubbataha Reefs of the Philippines. As withits terrestrial programs, CI's marine strategy focuses on rigorous collection of scientific data to help NGOs and governments set conservation priorities, and the development of community-based economic alternatives.

O. Wilson Perhaps the best-known and most respected spokesman for globalbiodiversity, Dr. Edward O. Wilson had a candid conversation recentlywith CI News From the Front staff. Harvard professor, field biologistand Pulitzer-prize winning author, Dr. Wilson shared his thoughtson matters ranging from what the future holds for global biodiversityto the United States' role in biodiversity conservation. CI News: Why is biodiversity important? Dr. Wilson: Global biodiversityis important for three primary reasons. First, it is crucialto the stability of ecosystems and their resistance to environmentalstress. Second, the millions of species of plants, animals, andmicroorganisms are a largely unexplored treasure house of newscientific information, pharmaceuticals, crops, petroleum substitutes,and other products of great importance to humanity. Third, andsomewhat less tangible, is the contribution of natural ecosystemsto human psychological development and health. CI News: What role can the United States play in global biodiversity conservation? Dr. Wilson: The US is not just a military superpower, but also aneconomic and intellectual superpower. This country has the responsibilityto lead in scientific research on biodiversity, including theidentification and assessment of the hotspots. It should feelan obligation to provide -- in the spirit of the 1992 Rio Conference-- technical and economic assistance to permit maintenance ofbiodiversity and economic growth in developing countries wherefauna and flora are richest and most threatened. CI News: How well educated do you believe the public is about biodiversity? Dr. Wilson: One of the main problems I've seen in talking to membersof Congress and the media is a lack of understanding about thewhole issue. One recent poll revealed that only 20 percent ofAmericans know what biodiversity is, and what the endangered speciesissue is all about. Of those, however, 80 percent believe thisit is matter of high priority. This shows that at a gut levelpeople are in favor of environmental protection, but they don'tknow enough to exert pressure on their political leaders. Thisis also where Conservation International can play a key role,by constantly calling attention to the plight of the rest of lifethat is pushed up against a wall. CI News: What can be done to raise public awareness? Dr. Wilson: Drama. You have to find waysto get people to identify emotionally with the issue. We needecodrama, movies that have conservation themes and a very highentertainment value. We need a combination of conventional educationwith every form of literary and theatrical expression that canbe brought to bear to create an emotional allegiance. I've triedto convince other writers and creative people to bring conservationinto the popular literary culture. It is a vast area for newcreative efforts. A promising sign is that the younger a personis, the more interested he or she is in natural history and conservation. This is evidence that already the exposure, particularly fromtelevision, is exerting a good effect. CI News: What does the future hold for global biodiversity? Dr. Wilson: During the next 50 years, we need to keep our expanding humanity from pushing the rest of life off the face of the earth. I think things aregoing to come together in about 50 years, because that is probablywhen human population will peak at double what it is now. Atthis time there will also be enough technology transfer aroundthe world to move a large part of that population toward higherenergy consumption and migration to cities. We either will beimproving the quality of life around the world, or it will deteriorateinto a much more serious division between the haves and the have-nots. CI News: What needs to be done immediately? Dr. Wilson: Several years ago, Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Institute andI outlined a three-step approach to identifying biodiversity hotspots,and to manage research for maximum effectiveness. At the firstlevel is rapid assessment, and Conservation International shouldbe applauded to taking the leading role in this with its RapidAssessment Program. A second step, already underway, is to establishresearch stations for studies and long-term monitoring of biodiversityand other aspects of the environment. The third phase, also underwaybut requiring much more time, is a global survey of biodiversity. Within 50 to 100 years, we could have a complete picture of theworld's fauna and flora, combined with efforts to save that biodiversity. CI News: What are the obstacles to achieving this? Dr. Wilson: Not much is being done to increase the number of scientists to conductthe global biodiversity survey. It isn't happening because thefederal government is just not expanding an emphasis on science. CI News: What is the role of the local people? Dr. Wilson: Clearly local people must be involved. They must have access to sustainable economic development that is not too invasive on the natural ecosystems. And in terms of pure research on biodiversity, it will be veryimportant for local people to be part of the process of collecting,by working as parataxonomists. CI News: Would you like to add a final message? Dr. Wilson: Think about all the media attentionbeing given to other current issues like Bosnia. If biodiversitywere to receive that much coverage, we wouldn't have any problems. The dilemma of biodiversity, in the long-term, is one of themost relevant aspects of human existence. The problem is peoplejust don't know it yet. To return to the News From the Front, click here. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

"When I first cameto the coastal town of Guaymas 15 years ago, a thriving fishingfleet in the Gulf of California provided 60 percent of Mexico'sfish catch from abundant, biodiverse waters," recalls MachangelesCarvajal, CI's Gulf of California Program Coordinator. "Sincethen, an economic collapse in the region has followed the gulf'secological decline. My work aims to simultaneously revive the localeconomies and the ecosystems." With professional background inboth marine biology and community development and a lifelongpassion for the sea, Machangeles is helping the region's coastalcommunities find economic alternatives to current destructiveoverharvesting of fisheries. Machangeles is a leading innovator in a technology known as aquaculture that cultivates fish and shellfish in theirnatural environment. Machangeles not only pioneered the development of the aquaculture technique for scallops, she is helping a number of groups, including an all women's group, set up Mexico's very first scallop aquaculture farms in the townof El Golfo de Santa Clara located in the Biosphere Reserve ofthe upper Gulf of California. In another project, Machangeles and her colleagues test experimentalshrimping nets to replace standard ones that damage life on theocean floor. Although they are in the early stages of testing, their plan is to identify a net that yields a largeshrimp catch, while minimizing the number of other species killed, and to design an education campaign to promote its use. "Machangeleshas an exceptional ability to catalyze people to collective action,"said Alejandro Robles, CI's Mexico Program Executive Director."Her energy has been instrumental in building a cooperativespirit among the academic institutions, coastal communities, andthousands of fishermen of the Gulf of California." Land Shortage Spurs Raid on CI Biological Station Chiapas, Mexico: Armed groups of local Tzeltal farmers twice looted CI's OcotalBiological Station in the Selva Lacandona region in southern Mexicoin October. The field station helps CI coordinate biological researchin the northern section of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve,Mexico's largest remaining expanse of primary tropical rain forest. The attacks came in the wake of long-building tensions over theTzeltales' struggle to find new farmland. Due to population growth,obsolete agricultural practices, and cattle-ranching on the bestlands, small farmers have exhausted their land and are demandingmore. The only large tracts remaining, however, are containedwithin the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve or are inhabited bythe other indigenous peoples. In recent months, Tzeltal farmershave also pushed into territory belonging to the indigenous LacandonMaya people (see NFF 1:1). Since September 1995, CI Mexico's SelvaLacandona program coordinator Victor Hugo Hernandez has been mediatingwith government officials and members of these local communitiesto work out these problems. But inviting indigenous leaders, farmers,and government officials to tackle the complicated disputes overland tenure issues is only the first step. Defusing pressuresover land tenure issues requires development of economic alternativesfor farmers, often taking several years to get programs up andrunning. "The problem is, conservationists don't operatein a vacuum," remarked CI Vice President James Nations. "Youcan't say, 'Hey, just hang on until we can get our program offthe ground.' Conflicts can ignite, just when you think the stageis set for positive alternatives." Netherlands' Order of Golden Ark Awarded to CI President Amsterdam, The Netherlands: CI President, Russell A. Mittermeier, received theOrder of the Golden Ark Award from His Royal Highness Prince Bernhardof the Netherlands in a ceremony at the Soestdijk Palace on November4, 1995. The Order of the Golden Ark was established by PrinceBernhard in 1971 to recognize people committed to internationalnature conservation and its recipients include Richard Leakey andSir David Attenborough. As he bestowed the honor, PrinceBernhard cited Dr. Mittermeier for "...his leadership in,and promotion of, the importance of biological diversity on aglobal scale, his efforts to identify those areas of highest priority,and his commitment to developing conservation programs to ensuretheir sustainability."

Rapid Assessment Program analyses and recommendations are published in CI's RAP Working Papers. So far, RAP teams have surveyed habitats in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Belize, Mexico, Guyana, and New Ireland (in Papua New Guinea)--and found so much previously unknown biodiversity that decision-makers in many of these countries are using the results to set new conservation priorities and redefine protected areas. Future RAP trips will target further work on the eastern slopes of the Andes, and ecosystems in Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. To learn more about field team activities, click here.

Straddling the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border where the eastern slopes of the Andes drop into the Amazon Basin, the Condor region is inaccessible and only sparsely populated, and until recent years, its ecosystems were poorly understood by science. Yet recent CI RAP expeditions to the Ecuadorian and Peruvian sides of the Condor have revealed extraordinarily rich biodiversity and unusual ecosystems. And for CI and conservationists in both Ecuador and Peru, establishing conservation areas for the Condor may offer both countries the seeds of a peaceful solution: Parks for Peace (Parques para la paz). Working with indigenous groups, business leaders, development planners, and government representatives from both Peru and Ecuador, CI is preparing a project profile and conservation-area feasibility study, representing the first step toward developing a proposal for a solution. The study will compile important biological data from CI's RAP findings and use them to emphasize the negative consequences of continued war activities for the people of the Condor, their natural resources, and economies. When completed, the study will be submitted to high-level Peruvian and Ecuadorian officials. Under their leadership, this process could ultimately lead to the establishment of a pair of linked conservation areas in the contested border region. "We believe we can advance the conservation-area concept behind the weight of our RAP findings," said Adrian Forsyth, CI's Vice President for Conservation Biology. Recommendations from past RAP expeditions have influenced conservation decisions in countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Guyana. Condor RAP Trips' Remarkable Discoveries The Condor RAP trips to Ecuador (1993) and Peru (1994) revealed a very unusual assemblage of vegetation and habitats, some of which had never before been documented. Thanks to the support of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian militaries, RAP scientists were able to reach previously unknown, high-altitude habitats by helicopter. In both Ecuador and Peru, the RAP team discovered habitat similar to that known as "tepui" in Venezuela and Guyana -- open, boggy orchid fields on flat-top mountains not previously recorded in the central Andes. Newly identified species include the largest-known shrew opossum in the world, 20 new orchid species on the Peru side, 6 new butterfly species also in Peru, and 2 new beetles. A species of pygmy owl was recently described and named after the late Ted Parker, who recorded its song in Ecuador in 1993. CI Joins Forces with Intel and UNESCO Washington, DC: A new partnership between CI, Intel Corporation, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will bring cutting-edge computer technology to 25 biosphere reserves in developing countries. Under the recently announced agreement, Intel will donate $270,000 for hardware and software purchases, technical support, and training. CI will supply CISIG software, and both CI and UNESCO will provide training through regional workshops. The participating reserves will be selected by the end of 1995. "The Intel-CI-UNESCO agreement is an enormous opportunity to strengthen the world's biosphere reserve network," said John Musinsky, CI Natural Resource Specialist. "It will allow for information exchange with access to the Internet, and strengthen the capacity of local institutions to better use conservation analysis tools. This is an important step toward integrating activities among the reserves." Created by UNESCO in 1976, the 324 biosphere reserves are international protected areas that combine conservation, sustainable natural resource use, and scientific research. Rescue Mission for Endangered World Heritage Site Cartagena, Colombia: CI's Colombia and International Communications Programs are planning a nationwide awareness campaign to preserve an area that all Colombians view with pride -- the diverse natural habitats of Cartagena Bay. The campaign, combining creative media techniques and environmental education, is designed to unite Colombians in supporting conservation efforts in Cartagena Bay. Located on Colombia's Caribbean coast, Cartagena Bay is a World Heritage Site, containing rich and varied ecosystems -- mangrove forests, coral reefs, freshwater estuaries, and dry forests -- as well as the country's richest historical sites. But rampant pollution, commercial development, uncontrolled tourism, and population growth threaten to overwhelm what remains of these precious resources. Planning for the communications campaign began in May with a creative workshop that brought together a group of 30 key participants, including a former mayor and the city's Secretary of the Environment, and advertising professionals, conservationists, and consultants. Results included the formation of "Cartagena Convida," the group that will guide the campaign and prepare for the official launching in early 1996. "Our strategy is to empower the people of Cartagena themselves to provide the creative forces and the scientific information for the campaign," said Wendy Arenas, CI's program coordinator for Cartagena Convida. "Achieving this sense of ownership among the people of Cartagena is a key step toward the success of the campaign and ultimately in changing how Colombians think about their environment." 12,000 Fact, 80 Maps Focus Priorities for Madagascar Washington, DC: Preliminary results of CI's conservation priority-setting workshop in Madagascar have prompted plans for a major CI RAP expedition in this critically important country. "This information will help Madagascar determine its own long-term plan to conserve biodiversity and how to use more than $100 million for on-the-ground projects," said Silvio Olivieri, CI's Vice President for Conservation Planning and Technical Cooperation. Some 120 scientists from the world over attended the workshop in April in the nation's capital, Antananarivo. Their data covering every aspect of Madagascar's besieged environment was compiled into databases containing more than 12,000 records and over 80 CISIG maps. Between 12 and 14 new CISIG maps will be created, revealing biodiversity conservation priorities and human disturbance patterns. The final report containing the priority-setting maps will be completed this fall. Brazil Nut Cookies Available atSubway Shops!

A year after RAP's original assessment report was circulated, the Bolivian government and the World Bank began negotiations for financial support of important conservation areas, and both ranked Madidi as one of six high-priority sites to receive significant funding. Madidi was declared a national park in October, 1995. The Kanuku Mountains Region of Guyana is being considered for biosphere reserve designation after RAP highlighted its national significance. In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the team scientifically described the largest dry tropical forest in the world. Part of this several-million-hectare region will become part of Bolivia's protected system. In Peru, RAP team members assisted in the development of a national park feasibility study leading to the creation of The Tambopata-Candamo Reserved Zone, a protected area of 1.5 million hectares. In September 1995, RAP offered a training course in Bolivia. The course focused on different methods for biological inventories, understanding the importance of scale and expertise in biological assessments using a landscape approach, and producing integrated reports with practical recommendations for conservation, management, monitoring, and environmental education. Biological Knowledge In Peru, the team found one of the rarest birds in the world, the Southern Helmeted Curassow, previously known only from four museum specimens. In Condor, Ecuador, a new species of mammal, a marsupial rat, was recently described by RAP scientist, Dr. Luis Albuja, from the Escuela Politecnica Nacional. In Condor, Peru, 20 new species of butterflies, 18 new species of orchids, 2 new species of beetles, and 5 records of bird species were documented. A brief trip to the Chocó in Colombia yielded remarkably high discovery rates for new vertebrate species. Of some 70 reptiles and amphibians collected in four days, ten percent were previously undescribed. In southern Mexico the team discovered a new species of wild cacao, a finding that could broaden the gene pool, potentially providing higher productivity and disease resistance, for cultivated cacao. Future RAP Projects RAP plans to expand its coverage of the Andean region and the Asia-Pacific region: RAP plans to run a series of three trips over the next two-and-a-half years to the island of New Guinea, alternating between Irian Jaya (on the western portion of the island) and Papua New Guinea (on the eastern portion of the island).

The government of Suriname is currently considering logging concession deals that would affect seven million acres --about one-fourth of the country's land. "What Suriname is being asked to do is sell off a major portion of its forest assets for promises of economic return that are only a fraction of the true value of these forests, and even that return is uncertain. Indeed some analyses indicate that these concessions will wind up costing Suriname money over the long term," said CI President Russ Mittermeier. "This kind of neocolonial exploitation has no place at the end of the 20th century." Several timely factors have encouraged the Surinamese Parliament to delay approval of the concessions. First, CI's resource economist, Dick Rice, prepared a realistic analysis of the proposed concession agreements, refocusing the debate on issues of actual profit and loss. A delegation of government and private forest experts organized by the U.S. State Department concluded from this report that Suriname would make only a small fraction of anticipated revenue due to the many loopholes in the contracts. Alternatives to Concessions. CI has also encouraged Suriname to consider economic alternatives to logging. In June, a CI-sponsored visit to Costa Rica for a group of Suriname Parliament members yielded important information on development options and caused a further delay on the logging concession vote. The Suriname delegates met with Costa Rican President Jos Maria Figueres Olsen, who urged the delegates not to undersell themselves, but rather to take advantage of Costa Rica's experience in working toward sustainability. The delegates learned firsthand about Costa Rica's achievements in ecotourism and bioprospecting, two potentially profitable alternatives to logging. According to Figueres, Suriname can leap-frog over an entire era of natural resource misuse and become a 21st century model for appropriate development. Despite the success of the trip, the debate in Suriname has reached a critical point. The Asian loggers are pushing for a quick decision from the Suriname Parliament. Many key Surinamese politicians see the investments, which the companies claim would total over $250 million, as a key step in bolstering the country's collapsing economy. Seeking a short-term solution to Suriname's financial crisis, Mittermeier, joined by CI's Policy Vice President Ian Bowles and other European and U.S. NGO leaders, met with Inter-American Development Bank President, Enrique Iglesias, in part prompting the IDB to propose a financial-assistance plan to Suriname's President Ronald Venetiaan. Following CI's strategy, the IDB is organizing another Surinamese delegation to Costa Rica in September. CI is already overseeing a significant economic initiative that has begun to produce income for Suriname: a bioprospecting agreement that links the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company, Bristol-Myers Squibb, the National Institutes of Health, Surinamese government agencies and NGOs, and the indigenous Saramakaner tribe. "Royalties from even one new plant-derived drug would dwarf logging money, without taking down trees," said Mittermeier. Spotlight on Suriname. A final key factor has been the media attention generated over the proposed logging of this virtually untouched wilderness. Mittermeier, whose research has targeted Suriname's forests for the last 20 years, has been instrumental in bringing the debate before an international audience. He has published op-eds in the Christian Science Monitor and The Wall Street Journal, given interviews to Associated Press TV, Voice of America, and the Chicago Tribune, and escorted ABC TV crews and reporters from Time Magazine and the Washington Post to Suriname.

CI Mexico's Victor Hugo Hernandez and his staff are assisting Mexican government officials and indigenous leaders in resolving this dispute. Although Mexican troops have moved to stop further seizure of Lacandon lands, the people are concerned that the "Naha invasion" will resume when the military leaves. In the words of one Lacandon Maya leader, "They have turned all their forest to pasture, and now they want the forest we have kept alive for our families." CI's strategic interest centers on protecting the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which overlaps 90 percent of the Lacandon territory. Home to nearly half of Mexico's known biodiversity, the reserve is the largest remaining tract of primary rain forest in the country. Equally important to CI is helping to build local conservation capacity in communities surrounding the Montes Azules reserve. Since 1991, CI has worked with the Lacandon community, which is now struggling to hold on to its last ancestral lands and preserve its cultural identity. The Tzeltal Maya invaders appear to be taking advantage of political unrest in the region instigated by the armed rebellion of the Zapatista National Liberation Army that began in early 1994, destroying more than 200 hectares of Lacandon Maya forest in a northern section of the Selva Lacandona. Over the past year, the Tzeltal have taken over another 2,000 hectares of Lacandon forest. Their extreme actions reflect the intense economic and land-use pressures that are crippling the region.

Commonly found in rain forests throughout the Neotropics, several blue morpho species thrive in Mexico's Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. But the remarkable diversity of butterflies and other wildlife in Montes Azules -- researchers have identified 500 butterfly species alone in the region around CI's Chajul Biological Station -- is jeopardized by deforestation for traditional agriculture and cattle ranching. CI is working with communities around Chajul to develop feasible economic alternatives, including a butterfly-farming enterprise that increases butterfly populations and provides income to families who would otherwise clear forest for cornfields and cattle. New CI Staff Member to Launch Monitoring and Evaluation Program Washington, DC: Jorgen Thomsen, CI's new Senior Director forConservation Biology, is launching an organization-wide Monitoringand Evaluation Program--a standardized ecosystem-monitoring systemthat can measure success or shortcomings of biodiversityconservation work across the globe. The first such universalsystem developed by any conservation organization, monitoring andevaluation will be a boon for all CI field programs as it helpsthem to continually refine community-based projects and makeoptimal use of limited conservation dollars. A seasonedconservationist from Denmark, Thomsen has held prominent positionsin numerous international conservation organizations, includingWorld Wildlife Fund and TRAFFIC International and brings with himimportant alliances/affiliations in the European conservationcommunity. Cyclone Destroys CI Project Site, Relief Underway Fenerive, Madagascar: In January, a violent cyclone swept throughMadagascar's Zahamena Nature Reserve, devastating local communitieswhere CI works. The strongest cyclone to hit these villages in 20years, the storm completely destroyed schools, agricultural sites,over 50 percent of the homes, as well as a CI office in the nearbytown of Fenerive. CI, the only NGO with an ongoing program in thearea, has been working with relief organizations, including CARE,to rebuild homes and provide emergency food and health care. "The storm will push back our work at least three months, butwill not diminish CI's high level of commitment in the region,"said Leon Rajaobelina, CI's Madagascar Program Executive Director. "We're committed to helping these communities get back on theirfeet." CI's work in Zahamena focuses on the greatest human threat tothe rich flora and fauna of the reserve: agricultural development. For subsistence reasons, local people slash-and-burn forestspredominantly for rice production--a practice that has causedwidespread erosion and watershed damage along the region's hillyterrain. CI is working with these communities to implement localeconomic alternatives to forest destruction and to provide healthcare services.

New Cattle Fences Lock Out Wildlife in Botswana Gaborone, Botswana: The government of Botswana has recently built three major"emergency" cattle fences across one of the country's last wilderness areas in an attempt to containan outbreak of lung disease in cattle. The fences--stretching across a region from the western edgeof the Okavango Delta to the Namibian border--were constructed without environmental impactassessments or consultation with the local people. Conservationists fear the new fences could restrictmigration of Botswana's wildlife populations. There is a growing body of evidence that the expansion of Botswana's network of cattlefences might be linked to declines in the country's wildlife population over the same period. Sincethe 1950s, over 2,000 miles of fences have been built throughout the country to comply with healthstandards set by the European Community on all imported beef. Today, the Botswana landscape is a web of fences that have interrupted the migration routesof once nomadic wildlife populations. In 1983, an estimated 50,000 wildebeest died from dehydrationand starvation along a fence in the Central Kalahari region, unable to reach water and forage on theother side. Decreasing wildlife populations in Botswana's ecologically sensitive Okavango Delta --one of the world's last great landlocked wetlands -- are also of particular concern: in the past twodecades, buffalo and zebra populations in the region have declined by 60 and 30 percent, respectively. "CI is concerned with these developments," said Karen Ross, Director of CI's Okavango DeltaProgram. "Further fences could severely restrict remaining wildlife corridors connecting to Namibiaand Angola, jeopardizing the delta's wildlife heritage. We are in a close dialogue with thegovernment and NGOs to find a sustainable balance between cattle ranching and wildlife protection." In a disturbing parallel to the recent mad cow disease crisis in Britain, the government orderedthe extermination of hundreds of thousands of cattle in northern Botswana when three new fencesfailed to stop the disease's spread. Despite the ineffectiveness of the fences, the government hasauthorized their permanent status as "veterinary cordon" fences. Neotropical Birds Offers New Insights On Ecosystems Neotropical Birds: Ecology and Conservation, by Douglas F. Stotz,John W. Fitzpatrick, Theodore A. Parker III, and Debra K.Moskovits, compiles, for the first time, extensive data on theecological and geographical distributions of all 4,037 bird speciesfrom Mexico south to Tierra del Fuego. From this information,presented in almost 300 pages of tables, the authors have analyzedpriorities for conservation in the Neotropics, showing how birdcommunities help determine which regions and habitats are in mosturgent need of protection. As top conservation priorities,Neotropical Birds points to the biological communities found in thelower slopes of the Andes, the tropical deciduous forests, and toonce-extensive grasslands and scrubs of central Brazil --communities facing the most immediate threats from development. Much of the previously unpublished information gathered inthis volume was collected by ornithologist Ted Parker, director ofCI's Rapid Assessment Program, before his untimely death in 1993. Stotz, Fitzpatrick, Parker, and Moskovits worked in closelycollaboration with CI during the eight-year development of thisproject.

Campaigning to Protect Peru's "Land of Butterflies" Lima, Peru: In February, CI premiered its documentary film, "Volvera Tambopata," as part of its public awareness campaign for thecountry's biological treasure, the Tambopata-Candamo region. Foryears, CI has been working with Peruvian institutions to leveragesupport for the creation of a national park in Tambopata. Thecampaign will help create momentum for the formal recognition ofthe park. "Volver a Tambopata"("Return to Tampota") was produced by CIand supported by Xerox and Citibank, which partially funded theproduction. The largest national television network, PanamericanaTV, ran the documentary in a prime-time spot, obtaining a first-place rating with over three million viewers. "In just a fewweeks, millions of Peruvians learned about the importance ofTambopata, many of whom had never heard of this critical regionbefore," said Haroldo Castro, CI's Senior Director of InternationalCommunications. CI is distributing the film to NGOs, governmentagencies, and schools throughout Peru. Tambopata is strategically located in the heart of a potentialconservation "mega-corridor" that would link protected areas inPeru with those in Bolivia, including the recently declared MadidiNational Park (see NFF 1:2). Tambopata has the highest recordednumber of bird, butterfly, and ant species in the world. In a fivesquare-kilometer area of Tambopata, which means "land ofbutterflies" in the regional Quechua language, one biologistidentified 1,200 butterfly species. CI-Peru's strategy in Tambopata has been two-fold: to conductextensive ecological and social studies in Tambopata, and to lobbyintensively with NGOs to influence national environmental policyand leverage support of the park's creation. In a 1994 expeditionto the region, CI's RAP team found Tambopata to be unique in itsdiversity of habitats, resulting in its enormous richness ofspecies. Based on their results, RAP scientists have recommendedto the Peruvian government the creation of the Bahuaja-SoneneNational Park within the Tampopata reserve. CI's socio-economicresearch in Tambopata has helped us assess current and potentialland uses and to better understand the threats to the region'sbiodiversity, particularly that of agricultural expansion. Brazilian President Pledges Support of CI mission In a recent meeting with CI staff and board members, BrazilianPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged to assume a leadershiprole in international biodiversity conservation and expressed hisstrong support of CI's work. The CI group emphasized to Cardosothat Brazil is in an ideal position to take on this challenge--given both its biological wealth and the fact that it is one of theworld's major economic powers. "Cardoso is committed to using hisinfluence among Latin American leaders to champion conservationwork in South American and elsewhere," said Peter Seligmann, CI'sChairman of the Board and CEO. "He is well aware that hiscontinent's vast biological resources are perhaps its greatesteconomic asset." To begin articulating this leadership role, Cardoso issupporting an innovative infrastructure project conceived by CIboard member Eliezer Batista, which is designed to integratebiodiversity conservation with long-term development plans in SouthAmerica. Cardoso also will advance a proposal for a bi-nationalpeace park with the Peruvian and Ecuadorian presidents for theirdisputed border region, the Cordillera del Condor, identified by CIas a critical priority ecosystem (see NFF 1:1). To broaden supportfor conservation in Brazil, Cordoso will work to stimulate privatesector investment in ecologically sustainable projects in thecountry. "Cardoso is very interested in building a 'south-south' dialogueamong Latin American nations on urgent regional issues," "He iswell aware that the countries' vast biological resources areperhaps their greatest economic asset." New Park A Cross-Border Conservation Victory Guatemala City, Guatemala: On November 9, 1995, Guatemala declaredthe Chiquibul Biosphere Reserve -- a milestone in Central Americancross-border conservation. The 83,000-hectare park connects withBelize's Chiquibul National Park and Forest Reserve, creating a keyconservation link between the Maya Tropical Reserve and the MayaMountains of Belize. A socioeconomic study of regionalcommunities, supported by Conservation International and theProspect Hill Foundation, was a major factor in the park'screation. The study recommended the region's protection based onfindings of growing colonization rates and environmentallydestructive land uses. Days after Guatemala's announcement, CI convened a ground-breaking summit of government officials, NGOs, and field scientistsfrom both countries -- the first of its kind -- that set thefoundation for joint management of both parks and the regionalwatershed they contain. "These events are crucial given thehistoric tension between the two countries," said James Nations, CIVice President for Mexico and Central America. "To protect the parkfrom the threats of an ever-increasing human population, CI willcontinue to work with both governments, NGOs, and local communitiesto develop sustainable enterprises and land-use plans."

Given its economic power, tourism provides powerful incentives to government policy-makers and local people to conserve natural resources which attract outside visitors. The immensity of the tourism industry, however, and the possibility of its explosive growth in a region, can overwhelm natural resources and community infrastructure. Ecotourism Highlights New support positioned CI to manage a community development and ecotourism project in communities neighboring Madidi National Park in Bolivia. In Brazil, CI successfully launched a training program on ecotourism both in strategic planning and product development. With the U.S. Forest Service, the department used innovative research techniques to help evaluate the economic potential of ecotourism in Bahia, Brazil.

This strategy stresses sound policy and assists in long-term regional planning, provides training, and sponsors model site development. To support these initiatives, CI develops alliances with key partners in the public and private sectors, provides technical assistance to regional program staff and local partners, and seeks project funding. Ecotourism initiatives are now a significant component of the majority of CI's regional programs in 22 countries worldwide. Examples of current activities include the following: Bolivia: CI is helping to develop indigenously owned, managed, and operated ecotourism and other small enterprises in the village of San José and neighboring towns in and around the buffer zone of the Madidi National Park. Enterprise development is based on the sound use and management of the area's resource base through ecotourism, agroforestry, indigenous handicraft production, and non-timber forest products extraction. Brazil: CI is sponsoring ecotourism workshops which train participants in ecotourism planning and product development. The workshops are bringing together the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, interdisciplinary teams of planners, architects, environmental experts, market analysts, and members of the international conservation community. The trainees then instruct other Brazilians at regional workshops. The workshop format will be replicated for other CI in-country programs. Another CI initiative is helping to provide the Kayapó Indian communities of Brazilian Amazon with sustainable economic alternatives to mining, and seeks to carefully redesign the current unsustainable timber harvesting practices in the region. CI facilitated the creation of a permanent research station, the Kayapó Center for Ecological Studies, which will aid the development of a forest management strategy and non-timber forest products, and act as an ecotourism base for the area. Guatemala: CI is developing three alternative tourist routes to draw visitors into the spectacular, but rarely seen areas of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. The route development involves several local communities and tour operators and benefits local villages and businesses. CI is offering training so that local people may become tourism professionals. The Eco-Escuela, a school located in the San Andrés community, offers a unique combination of Spanish language instruction with an environmental curriculum. Villagers receive income from teaching and housing students. The school also serves as a means of drawing individuals to an area that might otherwise be bypassed and helps direct tourists to other nearby ecotourism sites. Ghana: As part of the USAID-sponsored project to develop tourism around Ghana's Kakum Nature Park, CI opened a canopy walkway last Earth Day (April 23, 1995). The site has attracted more than 6,000 tourists to date. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

Madidi National Park. Since a RAP expedition identified the area's biodiversity in1990, CI has been working with the Bolivian government to makeMadidi a legally protected area. In Madidi National Park, Boliviaadds a significant new link in a chain of protected areas thatincludes Pilon Lajas Biosphere Reserve, the Chimane Forest, andthe Beni Biosphere Reserve. In 1995, Bolivian President GonzaloSanches de Lozada, recognizing the country's important biologicalheritage, also created the 3.2 Chaco National Park. CI is workingwith the leaders of both Bolivia and Peru to extend this chainof protected areas by establishing Peru's Tambopata Candamo ReservedZone, which lies directly across the border from Madidi NationalPark, as an officially designated protected area. Should Tambopataattain protected status, this "string of pearls" wouldachieve international stature as one of the world's most biologicallyimportant areas. The Chalalan Project. With the support of theInter-American Development Bank, CI is working sustainable developmentinitiatives with the Tacana-Quechua Indian people of San Josede Uchupiamonas near Madidi National Park. In particular, CIis focusing on ecotourism as a village enterprise. The ecotourismfacility near Lake Chalalan will allow visitors to experienceintact rain forest, and enable the people of San Jose to benefitfrom careful stewardship of their lands. The Beni BiosphereReserve and Chimane Indigenous Territory CI continues to workwith Chimane indigenous communities in the Beni Biosphere reserveand Pilon Lajas, exploring the viability of rain forest productsand supporting community development initiatives. The BolforProject In 1995, a Conservation Policy study based on the BOLFORProject in the Chimane Forest raised questions about the benefitsof sustainable forest management. Research showed that current"unsustainable," though highly selective logging methodswere found to be nearly five times more profitable than sustainablelogging, while causing up to two-thirds less damage.

Amazonia Atlantic Forest Caatinga Pantanal Starting with its first Portuguese settlers in the sixteenthcentury, Brazil has fiercely pursued development. Farming, mining,logging, and development have delved into its rich biodiversitywith little thought to conserving its resources. Now, Brazil'sbiodiversity -- considered the greatest of any country in theworld -- is at risk of becoming part of its mythic past. Ineach of Brazil's five major ecosystems, CI Brazil is demonstratinghow innovative, local conservation strategies can counteract entrenchedpatterns of misuse and poorly planned development. But the sheerscale of the challenges facing Brazil-- a country nearly the sizeof the U.S.--necessitates major policy shifts at the nationallevel as well. Nationwide Policy Initiatives CI's strategy inBrazil is a sophisticated mix of grassroots conservation projects,national policy initiatives, and training efforts. Through closecollaboration with a network of universities, NGOs, and communitygroups, CI-Brazil is helping to trigger a sea-change in the wayBrazilians view their resources. CI-Brazil has formed significantties to more than a dozen major national and international corporationsdoing business in Brazil. Representatives from these corporationshave joined CI's in-country advisory board--a way to secure steadysupport for our long-term conservation strategy. CI-Brazil hasbecome a lead player in the conservation community and in 1995,CI helped in the design of Brazil's new National Biological TrustFund. Furthermore, the Board of the GEF's Biodiversity Fund forBrazil appointed CI Brazil's vice president as a co-chair. Thisappointment affirms CI's vision of conservation and development,and gives CI a major voice in which efforts receive funding. ConservationScience for Brazil To help design Brazil's Biodiversity Strategy--animportant obligation under the international Biodiversity Convention--CI-Brazildeveloped a priority-setting methodology and a Portuguese versionof CI's Geographic Information System, CISIG, which now connectsmore than 60 institutional and individual users nationwide. CIstaff and its partners continue to provide training and distributeCISIG data free of charge to NGOs and universities. In May 1995,CI-Brazil launched its Internet home page, which can be reachedat www.conservation.org, housing more than 200 clkmaps of the distributionof plants and animals, demographic and economic information, landuse.

In the northern Peténregion of Guatemala, population is mushrooming by seven percenteach year -- largely from immigration. Colonization is now a majorsource of deforestation, estimated at 200-400 square kilometersper year. Conservationists and rural communities watch apprehensivelyas petroleum pipelines, industrial logging, and new settlementsencroach on the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the region's 1.6 millionhectare protected area. CI's challenge is to cultivate economicopportunities for local inhabitants that reduce the pressuresof slash-and-burn agriculture. People of the Petén traditionallyharvest and export a range of nontimber forest products. CI isworking on a USAID-sponsored program to nurture this commerceby designing community-based enterprises based on sustainableuse of forest resources. These novel concessions concentrateon harvesting nontimber forest products such as chicle, used inchewing gum; xate, a decorative floral palm; and allspice. Oneof CI's successful micro-enterprises is the potpourri factoryin El Cruce de Dos Aguadas, providing income to local people fromnondestructive forest use. The single largest incomegenerator in northern Guatemala is tourism. CI is supportinglow impact ecotourism through the EcoEscuela de Espanol, our Spanishlanguage school in the town of San Andres, and CINCAP, a new environmentaleducation center for visitors to the Petén. Also in 1995,CI inaugurated the Scarlet Macaw Trail through the Maya BiosphereReserve, a new eco-adventure trail to outstanding natural areasand archaeological sites. CI's conservation solutions in the MayaBiosphere Reserve include: developing community-based factories to produce non-timber forest products; establishing the Eco-Escuela de Español with the Community of San Andrés for teaching Spanish and environmental studies to non-Guatemalans and providing income locally; setting up community forestry projects in Carmelita and San Andrés; and, establishing the Center for Information on the Culture, Nature and Arts of the Petén, promoting ecotourism in the area, and providing a market for local artisans.

In Ghana we focus on a valuable remnantof the Upper Guinean rain forest in West Africa that once spreadfrom Guinea to Ivory Coast. The forest that endures forms oneof Africa's most diverse ecosystems. CI is working with officials,scientists, and local communities to develop a visitor centerand other ecotourism services for the Kakum National Park, whichis an important component of a larger ecotourism marketing strategyfor the Central Ghana region. Comprising 360 square kilometersof rain forest, Kakum has been logged for 50 years, yet stillcontains thriving wildlife populations including forest elephantsand seven species of primates, and is a major source of waterfor the central coast communities. CI completed a "first"here in 1995. On Earth Day, Kakum National Park opened Africa'sfirst canopy walkway to visitors. This 350-meter bridge of rope,ladders, wooden planks, and safety netting allows researchersand ecotourists to experience canopy life -- viewing the plantsand animals that live above the surface of the earth in the treetops. The canopy walkway is attracting record numbers of paying visitorsto the park. Some 20,000 enjoyed the park in 1995, up from 700in 1993. Importantly, most of these visitors are Ghanaians learningabout their nation's immense biodiversity. Cultivating a senseof pride and ownership enhances citizens' commitment to conservation.

Spanning portions of nine South American nations, the Amazon is the largest remaining tropical rain forest on earth. Its forests are home to the greatest variety of life on earth, including countless species that have yet to be discovered. With 16 million inhabitants already living in the region, the Amazon remains Brazil's "last frontier". Although more than 400,000square kilometers of this tropical forest have fallen to logging,mining, and other development schemes, the forest is so vast thathuge expanses of it remain comparatively untouched. Support forthe region's indigenous people, who have conserved the area forthousands of years, is key to preventing further destruction. Upper Xingu Region CI has been working with the indigenous Kayapócommunity on the 800,000 hectare Aukre Reservation for more thanfive years, helping the people identify environmentally healthyalternatives to goldmining and clear-cutting. The diversifiedeconomy that CI is helping to cultivate is already yielding benefitsfor this forest society. In 1995 CI continued work that will establishthe community-managed Kayapó Center for Ecological Researchas a permanent base for programs in both scientific research andecotourism. The community-owned "air taxi" became aself-supporting enterprise, bringing scientists and officialsto the Kayapó Center. CI's first ecotourism expeditionto the community is planned for 1996. The Kayapó teamorganized and trained by CI is now preparing a zoning proposalfor the reservation. Kayapó leaders are also trying toconvince nearby tribes to cooperate with Aukre in a joint planfor sustainable management of Indian lands in the region. Adramatic victory for conservation was achieved when 15 Kayapóleaders outside Aukre made a collective decision to ban loggingand mining on their 10,000,000 hectare reservation. This decisionwas partly a reaction to the negative effects of miners and loggerson Kayapó communities, where alcoholism and disease havetaken their toll. But it was also inspired by CI's program inAukre. The enterprise of the Aukre Kayapó is becoming amodel for regionwide conservation strategy.

Once stretching the entire length of Brazil's Atlanticcoastline, the Atlantic Forest has been whittled away by settlers,agriculture, and industrial development to the point that nowonly 8 percent of the original forest remains. The vestigialforest lies in isolated fragments that form the last refuge forincreasingly rare species of primates, birds, and plants; conservingwhat remains is top priority for CI Brazil. CI is particularlyactive in Southern Bahia, which holds the highest known botanicaldiversity in the world, and Zona da Mata, an important centerof endemism and one of the country's most devastated habitats. Program emphases include encouraging private landowners to convertholdings into legally recognized private nature reserves; andcreating connecting "corridors" to allow wildlife tomove between the isolated forest patches. Southern Bahia In1995 field research by CI's Policy Program and CI Brazil yieldeddramatic results: econometric models compared the costs and returnsof growing cocoa, ranching cattle, and clear-cut logging. Cattleranching and clear-cutting are shown to be a net drain on localeconomies. Since tourism is becoming an economic force in SouthernBahia, CI also calculated the worth to tourists of protectingscenic forest resources. The models suggest that deforesting theIlheus region would cost the region $75 million a year in foregonetourism revenue. On the other hand, protecting the forests andadding such enhancements as canopy walks could increase regionaleconomic returns by $15.6 million a year over today's earnings. To publicize these results, CI and its local partner, IESB, helda three-day workshop. Eighty participants, representing all walksof life, attended. In addition, CI held an ecotourism trainingworkshop for tourism operators and NGOs. Zona da Mata Preventingfurther destruction of the Atlantic Forest habitat is CI's chiefobjective. Along with Fundacao Biodiversitas and other NGO anduniversity partners, CI supports ongoing biological surveys tolocate important forest fragments that might be turned into privatereserves. The partners are developing a database and GIS systemfor the network of private reserves in the state of Minas Gerais.CI is also supporting two model private reserves.

Located one and a half hours directly west of Accra, Cape Coast is the heart of Ghana's rich historical past. It offers the visitor a unique view of Ghana as the first point of contact and former center of European colonial activity on Africa's West Coast. Three of the Central Region's most prominent fortifications, Cape Coast and Elmina Castles and Fort St. Jago record the horror of the millions of Africans who were captured, enslaved and shipped to the Americas. Thirty kilometers north of Cape Coast you will find a rain forest -- Kakum National Park. Within the park's borders live a number of internationally recognized endangered species, including the forest elephant, bongo and Diana monkey. Biologists estimate that a total of 300 bird species; 600 butterfly species; 100 reptile, mammal, and amphibian species; and at least a quarter million insect species inhabit Kakum. People also live in the vicinity of Kakum National Park. Kakum's neighbors have long relied on the forest for household staples, including bushmeat, medicinal plants and materials to build houses. To help protect the forest, they have stopped harvesting these products inside the park. To compensate for their sacrifice the Ghanaian Government has worked with USAID and a US nonprofit called Conservation International to develop the park as a tourist attraction, and provide local people with training, jobs, and new sources of income. However, many first-time visitors to a rain forest feel disappointed. Most of the forest's animals are difficult to see. One reason is that the majority live 60 to 150 feet above the ground, hiding in the dense tangle of vegetation called the canopy, a big umbrella created by wide-spreading, closely-packed tree crowns. Conservation International and the Ghana Wildlife Department constructed Kakum's canopy walkway so that school children and tourists here could do something even scientists most places cannot: safely and comfortably explore a tropical rain forest canopy. The 350 meter-long walkway is supported by eight huge emergent trees. Surrounding each support tree is a wooden platform where visitors and researchers can stop and spend time observing the rain forest from heights up to twelve stories off the ground! The canopy walkway is attracting record numbers of paying visitors to the park. Some 20,000 enjoyed the park in 1995, up from 700 in 1993. Importantly, most of these visitors are Ghanaians learning about their nation's immense biodiversity. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

We fulfill our mission by finding solutions to critical limiting factors, problems common to many of our local partners, but problems that small local organizations may not have the means to solve on their own. Throughout the world, particularly in the species-rich tropics, institutions working to protect biodiversity face similar problems as well as obstacles to solving them. Likewise. the best solutions to local challenges often turn out to be universal. As an organization working in virtually all of earth's tropical rain forest hotspots -- in addition to many other biologically rich habitats -- CI is an ideal vehicle for developing and widely disseminating successful approaches to biodiversity conservation. One of the biggest barriers to effective conservation everywhere is lack of basic information about ecosystems, a prerequisite to all rational planning and environmental decision-making. Through Regional Conservation Assesmments, CPTC solves this problem by bringing together the best expertise and technology to produce a comprehensive analysis of a region's conservation status. Once priorities are established, methods must be developed for planning and facilitating appropriate conservation action. Science is at the heart of finding these answers. Local Capacity-building Regional Conservation Analyses CISIG CI-UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Project SIGNATURA Regional Conservation Analysis and Priority Setting Workshops CI's Conservation Priority Setting Workshops and Regional Conservation Analyses bring together leaders in science, government, and non-governmental sectors to set regional and national conservation priorities. The workshops create a consensus-based framework for conservation action. Our goals are to: organize and convene conservation priority consensus-building projects in all of the world's rain forest "hotspot" regions; integrate global-scale conservation priority data for the major tropical regions: Latin America, Asia/Pacific, and Africa; and, recommend and promote policy changes within the next five years to ensure the sustainable use of biodiversity. Since 1990, CI has held a number of Priority Setting Workshops, including those in the Amazon Basin, Brazil, Papua New Guinea, , Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and Madagascar. During the upcoming year, workshops will be held in Indonesia's Irian Jaya, the Sea of Cortez, Mexico, and the Cerrado, Brazil. Regional Conservation Assessments have been held to evaluate the conservation status of the Maya Forest Region (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize), to assess biodiversity needs in Guyana, and evaluate infrastructure development throughout the Andes (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia). For more information about Regional Conservation Analysis or Priority Setting Workshops, contact Chris Rodstrom at 1-202-429-5660, or C.Rodstrom@Conservation.org. Capacity Building in Science and Technology CI also runs programs to develop scientific skills and the capacity for conservation planning with people living in the world's "hotspots." Local capacity-building reduces the dependence of partnership organizations on CI, while increasing the impact of regional organizations in supporting the technical needs of the region. CI provides training and technical support to local institutions and field programs that have limited expertise and access to technology, and facilitates the exchange of information and experience among non-U.S. institutions concerned with resource management. CI also seeks to make key biodiversity maps and databases available at the field level to support science-based conservation, research and training activities, and improve CI's outreach. Training Workshops in Science and Technology Over the past three years, Conservation International has sponsored 36 training workshops in 17 countries. More than 280 people from NGOs, academic institutions, and government agencies have participated in these workshops, held in both rural and urban areas. Each two- to three-week workshop provides intensive instruction and practice in the use of geographic information systems, GPS, image classification, database development, and Internet access and data exchange. The program has been successful in establishing two regional training centers in Brazil and Peru that have conducted six workshops of their own. CI-UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Capacity-building Project This year we began a new initiative that will help us further develop the outreach of this program. In collaboration with UNESCO, CI will provide training and technical support in GIS analysis, database development, and communications to 25 biosphere reserves in the world's hotspots. SIGNATURA Network The SIGNATURA Network utilizes e-mail, a newsletter, regional thematic workshops, and occasional conferences to spread informationan about GIS. Members of the network are encouraged to publish articles about their own experiences in environmental planning, discussing both the practical applications of GIS analysis and the operational aspects of developing a GIS database. The network's newsletter, SIGNATURA, is published in both Spanish and Portuguese, and has more than 1000 subscribers. CISIG Development Program CISIG (CI's Geographic Information System) is a computer tool that integrates and displays maps showing biological, social, and economic data for conservation analysis. It is available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Also available is PRISMA, a database publishing and distribution tool for distributing GIS databases on CD-ROM.

The countries of Mexico and CentralAmerica are more than a land bridge; they form a biological bridgebetween the great North and South American continents. The complexintermingling of northern temperate and southern tropical genepools has created the region's extraordinarily rich biodiversity. The impressive diversity and endemism of the Sea of Cortez stemsfrom its subtropical conditions and its isolated position betweenBaja California and mainland Mexico. Yet accelerating rates offorest and marine destruction, growing populations, and economicpressures are prompting political leaders throughout the regionto move toward new approaches of sustainable development. CIis working with rural communities to help them utilize forest,marine, and other natural resources in ways that foster long-termecological health instead of devastation. And to protect thelast great tropical forests of Central America, CI is bringingtogether governments to work together on protecting habitats thatspan national boundaries. The extensive Maya Tropical Forestcovering southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and Belize is onecase in point. In August 1995, CI worked with the U.S. Man andthe Biosphere Directorate to bring together representatives fromMexico, Guatemala, and Belize to assess the state of the MayaTropical Forest -- the largest lowland forest in Central America-- shared by the three countries. At this conference, 75 scientists,conservationists, and government officials produced a trinationalaction plan for the forest's conservation and sustainable development. This marks the first time that three nations have come togetherin cooperative management of an ecosystem of this magnitude. Asubsequent CI-sponsored summit has led to action in another importantprotected area in the Maya Mountains on the Guatemala/Belize border. Working with partners in both countries, CI was able to bringtogether government officials and conservationists for the firstbinational agreements on the future of the Chiquibul Forest andthe river the two nations share. In November 1995, Guatemalaannounced the creation of the 83,000-hectare Chiquibul BiosphereReserve to mirror the Chiquibul National Park across the borderin Belize. Together, the two areas protect the Chiquibul Riverwatershed, which is vital to both countries. With 80 percentof northern Guatemala's border with Belize under protected areastatus, one of the most important regions in Mexico and CentralAmerica for migratory birds is secure.

The belt of tropical forest that parallels theAndes Mountains from Colombia to Bolivia is one of the biologicallyrichest ecosystems on earth. Here the Andean foothills slope intothe Amazon Basin, and the range of elevations and habitats serveas an immense laboratory for the evolution of species. Withinthis region live more than 50 percent of all bird species foundin the Neotro../resource/icons, as well as 44 percent of all Neotropical mammals. One biologist found 43 ant species living in a single tree inPeru -- the same number of species found in the entire Britishisles. This abundance, combined with high levels of endemism--thenumbers of plant and animal species that live nowhere else-- makethe Andes region one of the world's top ecological "hotspots." Today both natural ecosystems and traditional cultures are atrisk from logging, road building, mining, oil exploitation, colonizationschemes. With the region's burgeoning population growth, plansfor more further economic development loom on the horizon. Recognizingthe inevitability of economic change in the Andes, CI is workingwith many partners to forge development strategies that do notharm the region's diversity of cultures or species. CI's workin the Andes in 1995 were capped by a groundbreaking cooperativeeffort with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), a financialinstitution investing in transportation and other infrastructureprojects in the Andean countries. In a historic move, CAF invitedCI to review road-building proposals for connecting the five Andeancountries and make conservation recommendations. CI analyzedthe economic, environmental, and social consequences of specificroad projects, and presented our conclusions for the most environmentallybenign options at a widely attended meeting with CAF and otherAndean experts in October 1995.

A stable water supply is vital to the survival of theOkavango Delta--the world's largest inland wetland and a sanctuaryfor an extraordinary array of wildlife in this otherwise aridregion. The delta is home to nearly 9,000 diverse species; therefuge for Africa's last free-roaming herds of antelope, buffalo,zebras, and giraffe, as well as lions, cheetah, vivid birdlife,and aquatic animals. It is also the tribal land of three distinctindigenous peoples who give the region a unique cultural makeup. Wise management of the region's water resources is key to protectingits biodiversity into the 21st century. CI Botswana has activelysupported the establishment of the OKACOM trinational commission-- the first agency jointly administered by Botswana and its upstreamneighbors, Angola and Namibia. This commission could have wide-rangingimplications for cooperative development and conservation of theresource they all share: the Okavango River. In 1996, CI andBotswana's Department of Wildlife and National Parks will finishbuilding the Letswee Center facility in the Maun Wildlife EducationPark. Already, many schoolchildren have been guided throughthe park, where most of them glimpsed their astounding wildlifeheritage for the first time. CI also worked with the Ministryof Education to create Project Okavango, a curriculum supplementfor environmental education throughout the school years. In addition,CI and five local villages have teamed up to construct the OkavangoWilderness Camp to provide Botswana children an intimate interactionwith the natural life of the Delta, while providing the localcommunities with an economic enterprise. CI has also been helpingdevelop environmentally sustainable enterprises at the villagelevel. Current projects include a basketmaking studio in whichresidents use palms and natural dyes from the forest. CI is encouragingvillagers, particularly women, to run their own craft workshopsand market their products through their own cooperative. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

Greater Cartagena Bay Ecosystem This spectacular World Heritage Site is gradually deteriorating,subject to rampant pollution, uncontrolled building and tourism,and population growth. In 1995 CI organized a workshop to stimulatethinking on clean-up and protection for Cartagena Bay that plantedthe seeds for a public awareness campaign called Cartagena Convida. Now a coalition of communications professionals is turning CartagenaConvida into a wide-ranging and innovative public communicationscampaign on the health of the ecosystem to improving the qualityof life through clean air and water, sustainable development,and biological and human diversity--and what citizens can do tomake a difference. The Chocó The isolated Chocóregion along Colombia's Pacific coast still retains nearly three-quartersof its forest cover. But an impending road construction projectand rapid increase in coastal development threatens the naturalhabitat as well as the culture and livelihoods of local communities. With local partner Fundacion Inguede, CI has been studying possibilitiesfor ecotourism and training local artisans in tagua nut carving. Ethnobotanical surveys and research have identified a naturalfiber (pita), a tree oil (huina), a vegetable wax (hoja blanca)and two tree resins as other marketable forest commodities forthe region. CI also supports Fundación Inguede's AmargalBiological Station and the Cape Corrientes watershed managementprogram. Caparú Binational Park In a remote corner of theColombian Amazon, Drs. Tom and Sara Defler, a husband and wifeteam, live and work -- as they have for the past 12 years -- onthe intricate relationships of species in the humid, lowland tro../resource/icons. CI is supporting long-term research on this complex Amazon ecosystem. Their research focuses on primate and bird communities in theregion. In addition, they study plant communities, collectingthe data that short-term expeditions cannot provide on plant phenology-- periodic behaviors, such as flowering and fruiting.

La Amistad BiosphereReserve, a World Heritage site, is home to more than 10,000 speciesof plants, 30-40 percent of which are found nowhere else. Thecore area of La Amistad Biosphere Reserve is a 667,000-hectarebinational conservation area linking Costa Rica and Panama. LaAmistad contains extensive undisturbed forest, including the largesttracts of cloud forest remaining in Central America. Yet eachyear, forest fires and the agriculture eat away at the park'sedges. The AMISCONDE project, a partnership with McDonald's Corporation,Clemson University and two leading NGOs in Costa Rica and Panama,helps local farmers, community groups and businesses to makessmaller farms more profitable -- thus preventing encroachment. Focusing on intensive, organic farming, soil conservation techniques,agroforestry, and introducing new products like fruit trees, AMISCONDEis helping to raise yields on land that is already cleared. Toopen new opportunities, AMISCONDE has initiated an agriculturalcredit program and is helping to improve market access. And toraise conservation awareness among the local population, the projectis also working on environmental education among farmers, women'sand children's groups as well as strengthening the communities'organization levels. In 1995, a sense of regional ownership ofthe program coalesced, as communities assume greater responsibilityin managing the projects and deepen their commitment to protectingthe reserve. CI's Shaman's Apprentice program completed a fullyear of training with the Teribe Indians of northwestern Panama. The project provides grants to young Teribe men and women towork with and learn from elder "shamans," encouragingthe transfer of traditional knowledge on to the next generation. CI, in conjunction with the Columbus Zoo, is also working withthe Teribe to develop local ecotourism. The project has builta lodge and is currently designing trails and training staff.CI's conservation solutions in La Amistad include: creating a community-managed credit system that promotes local micro-enterprises, such as nurseries of native tree species; starting the "Future Leaders Program," teaching children to take leadership roles in protecting the environment, and other environmental education activities; and, introducing soil conservation techniques and alternative crops to improve agricultural yields and linking these products with international markets.

Tagua Initiative CI'sfirst experiment in conservation-based enterprise, in the ComunaRio Santiago-Cayapas in northwest Ecuador, continues to expand,now providing a income for some 1,800 community members and theirfamilies. This project has also provided incentive for the communityto protect the forests buffering the adjacent Cotacachi-CayapasEcological Reserve. RAP Expedition In 1995, the RAPteam surveyed the Cordillera del Condor, along the disputed Ecuador-Peruborder. The expedition confirmedthe urgent need to protect the Condor region, documenting theextensive threats to its ecosystems, particularly from the borderwar in early 1995.

But as the country undergoes rapid economic change,an absence of strong environmental policies coupled with a varietyof environmentally unfriendly development schemes threaten itsnatural heritage. Strikingly, the country has only one legallyprotected area on the books--- Kaieteur National Park. In cooperationwith national efforts, CI is supporting a plan proposed by Guayaneseofficials for a network of protected areas that would showcasea cross-section of the country's ecosystems. CI Guyana is alsodeveloping a model for conservation-based enterprises.

Sprawling over some 17,000islands and covering only 0.2 percent of the earth's surface,Indonesia has the greatest wealth of species in the Old World.Today, the country is undergoing rapid economic and populationgrowth, with natural habitats destroyed at a fearsome rate. Torecognize and protect the most critical remaining ecosystems,CI has forged close partnerships with Indonesian NGOs and scientificorganizations. At the national level, CI has helped found a majoralliance of Indonesian business, NGO, scientific, and governmentleaders -- INDECON -- which is creating a network of ecotourisminitiatives throughout the country. The Togian Islands, CentralSulawesi With YABSHI--the Indonesian Foundation for the Advancementof Biological Sciences--and Ibnu Chaldun, a rural developmentNGO, CI has laid the groundwork for an integrated conservationand development program that embraces both terrestrial and marineecosystems. During 1995, the research station on Malenge Islandwas significantly expanded and served as the homebase for twoEarthwatch biological surveys. From the resulting inventoriesof coral reef and rain forest ecosystems, as many as six new animalspecies have been identified. The consortium of NGOs have alsoassessed the immediate threats to biodiversity facing the TogianIsland peoples, among them, the fascinating Bajau people, or seagypsies. Currently, we are investigating conservation enterpriseinitiatives, including the prospects for community-based ecotours. Irian Jaya This is the largest Indonesian province and occupiesthe western half of the island of New Guinea. As one of the world'sfew tropical forest wilderness areas, Irian Jaya is the last equatorialfrontier in Asia undergoing rapid ecological and socioeconomicchange. Roads, logging, emigration from western Indonesia, andmining are among many economic activities that are degrading IrianJaya's superb forest and coastal ecosystems. Since its uniqueecology is almost completely unstudied, in 1995 CI signed an agreementwith the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, the provincial CenderwasihUniversity, and the provincial government for training, biodiversitysurveys, and analysis of conservation priority areas. In addition,CI is cooperating with the Asmat people of southern Irian Jayafor mapping their traditional natural resource use. In 1995,CI produced a base map of the Asmat region's intricate swamp andriver system based on a satellite image and data collected fromAsmat collaborators. West Java In the Gunung Gede PrangrangoNational Park, CI forged a new alliance among local NGOs and thepark authority. A mere hour-and-a-half drive from downtown Jakarta,Genung Gede is the most heavily visited national park in the country. During 1995, a generous donation from the Indonesian Bank Pinaesaanhas launched the start of an ambitious conservation educationcenter that targets Indonesian youth and business executives.

Perhaps nowhere on earth does biological largesse contrast morestarkly with economic distress than in Madagascar. This islandnation harbors unique biodiversity. For instance, while Madagascaroccupies less than two percent of Africa's land mass, more than80 percent of Madagascar's plants and an even higher proportionof animals are endemic-- occurring nowhere else on the planet. Check out the new Madagascar Biodiversity CD-ROM. Despite this biological wealth, the people of Madagascar livein extreme poverty, with an average per capita income is only$190 a year. Poor people often have no choice but to slash andburn the forest for subsistence agriculture, charcoal production,and hunting. As much as 80 percent of the original Malagasyforest is already felled. One of the top three hotspots on theplanet, Madagascar is facing the possibility of mass extinctions. CI's COEFOR project addresses Madagascar's extensiveforests that stand outside their protected area system, the so-calledclassified forests, that serve as watersheds and protectors ofbiodiversity as well as providing timber, medicinal plants, andother products for local use. Through the COEFOR project, CIis now leading a new wave of forest management by helping residentsestablish model community management plans. In 1995, after CI'sconservation priority-setting workshop, the government of Madagascarplaced COEFOR's priority reserves at the top of its environmentalagenda. In 1995, CI published the firstof its Tropical Field Guide series, Lemurs of Madagascar. Headingthe group of scientists who compiled this volume is CI Presidentand primatologist, Russell A. Mittermeier. This guide is designedto attract ecotourists to Madagascar and engage them in "watching"and "life-listing" other creatures in addition to birds. In the long run, this guide on Madagascar's unique primate species-- and the guides on other species to follow -- will expand theaudience of nature enthusiasts in the discovery, study, and conservationof tropical wildlife. Also in this turning-pointyear of 1995, the former head of CI's Madagascar program foundedthe country's first environmental NGO--named FANAMBY, taken fromthe title of CI's award-winning video about Madagascar's ecology:"Fanamby: Green Challenge for the Red Island. Zahamena Integral Reserve In 1995, CI's work continued on the ZahamenaIntegral Reserve in northeast Madagascar. We are helping stemencroachment on the reserve with a variety of community conservationand development projects, including boosting farm yields. CIhas set up an endowment to finance the project long-term, startingwith a debt-for-nature swap that generated more than $1 millionin local currency. In late 1995, CI organized a novel monitoringproject, using digital, high-altitude photography and videographyfrom a small plane. The images, keyed into the Geographical InformationSystem (GIS), will allow analysts to see just what use is beingmade of the reserve, and where. The precise aerial photographywill also enable CI to confirm reports that forest encroachmenthas greatly decreased since CI's projects began. AnkarafantsikaReserve Complex The Ankarafantsika Reserve contains critical watershedterrain for the nation's second largest rice-growing center. Because of deforestation, though, rivers running down from Ankarafantsikainto the rice fields are increasingly loaded with sandy silt,which chokes off young rice shoots. Yields of rice, the country'sstaple food, have been falling. In 1995, CI secured a major grantfrom German Development Aid (KfW) for its project, largely onthe basis of our work at Zahamena. For the past two years, CIhas been working to protect the reserve by helping raise incomesin an environmentally sustainable way for people living in andaround the reserve. Efforts are underway to reduce the use offire and clear-cutting in the region, which in turn will reducesoil run-off into the rice paddies below and help ensure a stablerice crop.
