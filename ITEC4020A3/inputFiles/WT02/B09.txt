After the expenditure of approximately $8.5 million and deliberations spanning several years, the Ontario Fair Tax Commission (FTC) issued its final Report entitled "Fair Taxation in a Changing World" in December, 1993. The Report measures over 1100 pages and is supported by a large number of research papers and working group reports. Georgist organizations in Ontario made four presentations to the Commission in London, Peterborough, Ottawa and Toronto. An extensive Report on the property tax base in Peterborough was filed with the Commission along with other supporting documentation with respect to land value taxation and the implementation of a two tier approach to local property taxation.. In its final Report the Commission devoted less than two pages to "Two-Tier Assessment". The approach was rejected on the grounds that: "We do not view the tax system as an appropriate planning tool." (page 699) Furthermore the Commission maintained that: "two-tier assessment and taxation would exaggerate the one characteristic of market value assessment that is most undesirable from a benefit tax perspective - the value measured includes values attributable to future uses of the property and future potential capital gains. Because the locational attributes that give rise both to potential future uses and to increases in value in excess of inflation attach to land rather than to buildings two-tier assessment and taxation would increase the weight given to these non-use related values." (pages 699-700). This paper explores the reasons why a reasonably well-informed and research-supported tax commission like the FTC could so thoroughly misjudge and misinterpret a proposal like converting an undifferentiated mill rate on the total estimated market value of real property to a differentiated mill rate on the building and land components. These reasons are complex and interrelated. They are both institutional and historical and connect with a considerable array of social, economic, legal and professional interests. The first stage of coming to grips with why the tax proposals of Henry George are generally not incorporated into the deliberations of modern tax commissions is to identify comprehensively the conventions which govern tax economics. Tax authorities are transaction-seekers. Most tax systems are transaction-based. Transactions are thought to be an indicator of "capacity" to pay taxes. Tax systems are thus based on perceptions which are indicia of horizontal and vertical equities. Taxes are primarily in personam, i.e., related to personal capacity. This is equally true of the taxation of corporate profits since tax incidence studies trace the ultimate burden of the tax to wage-earners, consumers or the owners of capital. In other words it is assumed only individuals pay taxes. Hence the fundamental prejudice in tax economies against the Georgist separation of the taxation of the natural resource and the taxable capacity of the person who utilizes that resource. Modern tax systems are to a substantial degree "rent-seeking", i.e., there is a continuous appropriation by nonproducers of producers. Only producers are assumed to have ability to pay, the "fairness" of the tax system residing in its limning of the degree or magnitude of ability to pay. The tax system is fundamentally objective, quantitative and neutral. "A buck is a buck is a buck" was the nostrum of the Carter Royal Commission on Taxation in the 1960's and this assumption has prevailed in subsequent tax commissions. This is at odds with George's categorization of income, primarily as earned and unearned increments. Given the diversity in taxable capacity amongst individuals there must be a "tax mix" or a "tax mosaic" in order to ensure that the horizontal and vertical equities are approached, if not achieved. Some mixture of progressive and regressive taxation (eg. progressive income and regressive sales taxes) is acceptable in order to achieve varying tax objectives related to tax avoidance, taking resources out of the community, reducing economic distortion, and so on. The redistributive justice issues embedded in 20th century tax systems are ex post facto. i.e., remedial attempts to correct fundamental maldistributions of property and income. George's "sovereign remedy" is primarily preventative, i.e., it seeks to correct injustice in the distribution of property and income and only then can one assume that there will be justice in taxation. Modern tax systems capitalize the active and passive factors of production, treating all transactions related thereto and all income dependant thereon indiscriminately. Tax systems although based on personal taxable capacity are thus buttressed by concepts that are transpersonal, translocal and transnational. Georgist tax reforms are in one sense highly localized and immobile and yet have implications that go well beyond any currently existing taxing jurisdiction. Georgist reforms force more re-localization, eg. negate absentee landlordism and discourage underutilization of urban land resources. Owners of land will thus be less separated from the utilizers of nature. exhaustive and encompasses of all forms of taxation. The categorization and evaluation of income and expenditure in relation to labour and capital is therefore the only operational task in determining tax liability. The modern tax system is thus infinitely diversified and diversifiable. This protects both the integrity of the system and makes it highly adaptable in a changing and complex economy. Collection of economic rent appears monolithic and dated since it tends to undermine the difficulties in identifying this rent and appropriating it for the state. The absence of income does not relieve tax liability in the Georgist system. Asset rich and income poor owners have a more viscerable attachment to their property than income-earners who take their property in the fungible form of money. Hence the perceived intrusive nature of the Georgist reforms. They appear less calibrated to individual circumstances than modern income and commodities tax systems. The Ontario Fair Tax Commission accepted without critical evaluation the primary conventions of modern tax economics. It attempted to roll back the so-called "crisis in progressive taxation" that was endemic in many industrialized countries in the 1980's. But this perceived crisis in taxation based on a graduated ability-to-pay basis was not a result of deeper reflections on the nature of in rem and in personam taxation or how the tax system may collect unearned increments related to economic rent or how taxing authorities may even more accurately distinguish between economic rents and the income of producers. Vertical and horizontal equity is now being more critically examined. A more predominating concept has been "tax neutrality". Neutrality was one of the primary grounds for the introduction of a value-added tax in Canada. The most neutral of all taxes is of course the land value tax. If the Georgist reforms are to play a more prominent role in tax commissions, then its advocates have to become adept at identifying controversies in the conventional academic literature on tax economics and demonstrate how George's economic philosophy addresses these issues.

Since Ontario relies more on property tax than any other province and since the property tax in Ontario raises more revenue than any other single tax, apart from personal income tax, it is important that the property tax work for the taxpayers and not against them. Guest speaker on Sunday June 27, 1993 was Mr. Ted Gwartney. He was Director of the British Columbia Assessment Authority from 1973 to 1986. During his term as Assessment Commissioner he was successful in implementing a province-wide reassessment of all real estate, over 1.2 million parcels, and for creating a database which allows the annual reassessment of all real estate values. Annual updating of assessments is less expensive than the system currently used in Ontario. Canadian Georgists believe that the present property tax should be reformed so that there is a differential mill rate on the land and building component of the total real estate assessment. When a greater proportion of revenue comes from the land component it tends to stabilize land values by limiting rapid changes in land prices. Ontario is one of the few assessment jurisdictions that does not show separate land and building assessments on its Notices of Assessment. Mr. Gwartney was able to reduce the staff complement and assessment costs by 25% in British Columbia by adopting innovative methods including an on-line computer system for the 1,250,000 land parcels. The calibre of the assessments continue to be considered the foremost in the world and are used by banks and real estate agents for benchmark values in their appraisals. Mr. Gwartney has made six trips to Russia to give training seminars on land assessment. He has prepared a land assessment manual that describes five methods for assessing land values even when there has been no market evidence for seventy years. The Russian Municipal Association, which is comprised of the 100 largest cities in Russia has adopted land value taxes as the primary source of local revenue. Russia is considering the use of site value taxation to fund the clean up of environmental pollution. With its skilled assessment staff, Ontario can facilitate a similar site value (two tier property tax) system on very short notice. Novgorod (population 340,000), the original capital city of Russia, plans to raise all public revenue from land value taxes to fund municipal services and schools. They also plan to rebate to their citizens all income and sales taxes paid to the federal government. Mr. Frank Peddle (Ottawa) announced to the Conference that the Ottawa-Carleton Region is requesting a Two Tier Property Tax impact study during the next reassessment cycle, which would bring the base year to 1992. The City of Peterborough has had a long standing request for a Two Tier Property Tax pilot project but cannot get the provincial government to introduce enabling legislation to implement its study. On Monday June 28, 1993 Jean Smith (Toronto) and Ted Gwartney appeared before the Ontario Fair Tax Commission. In addition to information above it was pointed out to the Commission that the tax on the land value portion of the property tax is more progressive than the income tax because in all municipalities land ownership (land value) is more concentrated than income ownership, and the land value reflects more community created value while the building component reflects better the individual's ability to pay. It appears improvements to Ontario's assessments are not only needed to bring the system into the 21st century but it is possible to achieve these improvements and still save tax dollars. A question asked at the beginning of the Conference was "Can Ontario move toward genuine property tax reform and will the Fair Tax Commission meet the challenge?" The question is still unanswered. JOHN FISHER Conference Co-Chair CONFERENCE ON PROPERTY TAX REFORM MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO JUNE 27, and 28, 1993 Canadian Georgists are now organizing themselves for the coming battle on Property Tax Reform. At the opening session of the Canadian Georgist Conference a brief background of each sponsoring organization was given with the Canadian Council of Georgist Organizations being adopted as the collective name. Henry George Foundation of Canada - The Foundation dates from 1930 when Ernest Farmer and Arthur Roebuck established a fund for political and educational activities. The current President is Peter Vanmeggalen, while Jack Bea is the Treasurer. Oscar Boelens Foundation - This Foundation dates from 1964 when Oscar Boelens donated his estate to perpetuate the ideas of Henry George. The Chairman is Ben Sevack, Harry Payne is Secretary-Treasurer and Leo Klag is a director. School of Economic Science - The School was established in 1939. It was most active in the 60's and 70's when numerous classes were taught in the Toronto area. Acting Director is John Fisher. Canadian Research Committee on Taxation - The Committee has produced numerous briefs to various levels of government on tax matters. Research Director is Frank Peddle, who is currently preparing for publication a comprehensive study of land value taxation in Canada. Peterborough (Mal McCarthy) and Rodney (John Fisher) Two-Tier Property Tax Committees - Both Committees have produced Two Tier Studies. Mal described the beginnings through the Kiwanis Club and his successful efforts to get city council backing for a Two Tier pilot study. The beginnings of a Canadian Council of Georgist Organizations may develop as follows: HENRY GEORGE FOUNDATION OSCAR BOELENS FOUNDATION OF CANADA FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REGISTERED CHARITIES SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC SCIENCE CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION TWO TIER PROPERTY TAX COMMITTEES Frank Peddle reported that three independent Ottawa groups addressed the Fair Tax Commission on the Two Tier Property Tax issue. These organizations are Citizens for Fair Taxes - Chairman Frank Spink, Coalition for Fair Municipal Taxes - Chairman Gerry LePage and Action Sandy Hill - Bob Edmonds Letters of support were received from Mary Rawson member of the Vancouver Planning Board, Vancouver, B.C. and Bob Clancy, Henry George Institute, New York. Mr. Seth Rudin attended the Conference on behalf of the Ontario Liberal Party. A long time Georgist and friend Craig Cringan (Mississauga) was remembered and recognized as contributing much to the fight for meaningful tax reform. The Monday morning hearing at the Fair Tax Commission went very well (see notes on Ted Gwartney and Jean Smith). Ted and Jean made an impressive presentation but were the four panelists listening? We will know later this year when the final report is available! Although only 14 people attended the Conference, good ideas were exchanged, focus and direction were strengthened, valuable contacts were made (including the Fair Tax Commission) beyond the group. The Two Tier Property Tax philosophy was given collective support as the best alternative in the search for property tax reform because it combines social justice and incentive for economic growth.

The conference was organized by the Henry George School of Social Science of Santo Domingo. The energetic and much-loved, Lucy Silfa, the founder and director of the School, hosted the gathering of economists, tax experts and scholars. Ben Sevack of Montreal attended in his capacity as President of the Canadian Research Committee on Taxation and represented Canada along with the writer. Why would representatives from the United States, Argentina, the Cayman Islands, Canada and the Dominican Republic itself meet to discuss as a matter of vital contemporary concern the little known works of the nineteenth-century American philosopher and economist Henry George? The answer lies in recognizing the cause of the malaise that is currently gripping the political, economic and social institutions of societies around the world and in the studied inability of these institutions to account in a convincing way for the problems they perpetrate. These institutions systematically discourage what is beneficial to the community while subsidizing and rewarding the unproductive and environmental degradation. There is a tendency today to link intuitively the global and the competitive. On the other hand, seldom are the reasons for the current worldwide economic downturn universalized so that the distortions of economic life which make it possible and profitable to grow bananas in Scotland are not unlike the distortions of the property tax in Montreal which contribute to urban blight, unaffordable housing and the wasteful subsidization of land speculation. It is primarily the structure of taxation not necessarily its level which impedes economic life. Henry George's fundamental theme in his well known Progress and Poverty, and in other works such as Social Problems, Protection or Free Trade, and the Science of Political Economy is that the burden of running society should fall the least upon those activities that are beneficial to the well-being of the community and more on those activities that are a detriment to social and economic betterment. What does this philosophy mean in practice? A good example would be the current efforts of Georgist organizations in Canada to promote meaningful and genuine reform to a system of taxation that has become in all its prosaic complexity a tremendous burden on the Canadian economy and indeed on the spirit of the nation. The two tier or two rate method of property taxation, advocated by some Georgist organizations such as the Peterborough, Ontario Two Tier Property Tax Committee in its Report of January, 1992, lowers the tax burden on buildings and improvements. The trade-off is that revenue from holding land idle and underutilized is increased. The tax system is thus adjusted to give those who are contributing constructively to the community a break. High housing costs, land speculation, costly urban sprawl and the overall deterioration of our cities are some of the negatives ameliorated by this tax. Fairness in taxation is not simply a matter of promoting greater equity, it must be a matter of structuring taxes so as to reduce social overhead costs while at the same time creating more wealth for all to share less unequally. Henry George is not only the inspiration for equitable land reform and economic advancement in impoverished countries like the Dominican Republic. Canada and the U.S. are becoming more and more impoverished and polarized primarily because the counter-productive tax and expenditure policies of the government work incrementally to undermine the social, economic and psychological fabric upon which the liberal democracies were founded. There is a cruel irony here for traditional liberals. Progressive social programs do not achieve their objectives because the revenue engine created to fund them exacerbates the conditions which necessitate the programs. Hence the current downward spiral of increasing expenditures achieving less and less social justice and increasing taxes requiring greater social expenditures. It is the knowledge that there are viable, and yet generally unknown, alternatives to the current malaise that brought participants in the various Georgist organizations together in Santo Domingo. George's life and work encompass abiding insights into human nature and socio-economic relations. The non-profit Georgist research organizations, their paid professionals and volunteers, work diligently to undertake and promote research into the detailed economic application of Georgist principles to modern economic circumstances. The result has been a diverse yet coherent and still growing body of research that is beginning to have a wide-ranging influence in academic, governmental and business circles. While in Santo Domingo, a delegation from the Georgist organizations met with President Joachim Balaguer, who was a student of the Georgist philosophy while in exile in the U.S. in the 1960s. The Dominican Republic, like many other countries, is burdened with an immense foreign debt, increasing poverty and malnutrition, and the continual decay of basic infrastructure. The persistent interruption of electrical power in Santo Domingo is just one of the more visible hardships. Land and tax reforms on the Georgist model in the Dominican Republic will be difficult on account of the concentration of landownership among 35 or 40 families. Everyone was enthusiastic that a reform would finally be undertaken which would result in real change for the 7 million citizens of the Dominican Republic. How long can the institutions of the status quo hold out against a philosophy of economics that is a theoretical and practical answer to the same detrimental policies that have strangled such seemingly different economies as those of Canada and the Dominican Republic?

Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of societies and brought to a halt social progress.By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and the maintenance of a social safety net. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT) does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean environments. CRCT is able to assist tax reform groups develop a different approach to tax issues. In order to carry out its purposes and objectives, the CRCT is conducting a systematic program of research in the fields of taxation and fiscal policy by: elaborating the fundamental principles which underlie just, fair, equitable and efficient methods of taxation; designing tax systems for individuals, business enterprises and municipalities which meet the tests of fairness, simplicity and economic efficiency; studying the various methods and types of taxation at all levels of government in order to evaluate their cumulative effect. PRINCIPLES The guiding principle for research conducted by the CRCT is that a fair and sound method of taxation should infringe as little as possible upon individual liberty and effort. Equally, it is necessary that methods of taxation be devised which do not negate, as do current forms of taxation, the productive capacity of our economy or subsidize environmentally detrimental practices. Tax experts generally focus on either the ability-to-pay or the cost-benefit approaches. The objectives of tax reform are often said to be equity, efficiency, simplicity and stability. The CRCT has integrated these various approaches and objectives into one coherent and comprehensive tax philosophy. Future tax reforms will have to meet the tests of both the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit concepts. The CRCT is of the view that genuine tax reform is not achievable unless impartial research is conducted into methods of taxation which take into account the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit approaches as complementary and interdependent aspects of any tax. The unifying principle of ability to pay in proportion to benefits received is the basis for the CRCT's research into devising taxes which have the following fundamental characteristics: bear as lightly as possible upon productive, environmentally sound and socially beneficial activity; bear equally on all citizens so to neither advantage nor disadvantage anyone as compared with others; be certain, not arbitrary - reliable, simple and easily understood; be cheaply and efficiently collected and administered. The Canadian tax system at all levels of government violates the basic tenets of a sound program of public revenue generation. For example, municipal property taxes on total property values penalize improvements to buildings, subsidize land speculation, and inflate housing costs. Complex taxes on the net income of business enterprises, and arbitrary sales and excise taxes, further add to inflation and interest rates, which in turn make the economy more uncompetitive and lower the standard of living for everyone. PROGRAMS In order to contribute to the development of tax policies which provide constructive alternatives to the current negative systems of taxation, the CRCT has structured a research program which has three main components: replacement of current municipal taxes on buildings and businesses by a two tier property tax in which there would be a higher mill rate on land or site values rather than on the improvements to the site; replacement of all sales taxes, and of taxes on the net income of businesses, by a business earnings tax, whereby business enterprises would be taxed on that portion of their earnings or income which is equivalent to their costs of production; replacement of the current personal income tax system by a simple proportional income tax which would eliminate most forms of preferential tax treatment and substitute a personal exemption that is above the poverty line for all individuals and families. These three components of the CRCT's research program constitute a progressive framework for genuine tax reform. By interrelating ability to pay and cost benefit in the design of appropriate methods of taxation for cities, business enterprises and individuals, special privileges and benefits embedded in the present tax system in Canada will be greatly reduced. At the same time, community- and government-created values will be recaptured by the public treasury for the further provision of social goods and services. The CRCT actively encourages other research organizations as well as community groups and individuals to conduct their own research and analysis into the effects of making structural changes to the current tax system on the basis of the general principle of interrelating the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit concepts. For instance, the CRCT is willing to assist municipalities in analyzing the tax and economic impact of levying differential mill rates on land and buildings. Such studies can show the degree to which a simple change in the property tax system - downtaxing buildings and uptaxing site values - results in positive effects on business investment, employment and the provision of affordable housing in municipal tax jurisdictions. COURSES In affiliation with other research organizations in Canada and the United States, the CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION offers courses and seminars on a wide range of topics in taxation and tax-related fields in economics, public finance, philosophy and political economy. For more information contact either the Ottawa or Montreal office. MEMBERSHIP Membership in the CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION is open to anyone interested in the objectives and guiding principles of the organization. Membership fees are twenty dollars ($20.00) per annum. All members have access to a wide range of research reports, studies, documents and materials either produced by the Committee or in its possession. FUNDING The CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION, in order to pursue its objectives, encourages donations from individuals, business enterprises and foundations. The Committee also collaborates in its research efforts with other research organizations both public and private.

Peddle, Ph.D. COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TAXATION CITIES AND GREED is an easily comprehensible examination of the assessment and taxation of the building and land components of real estate in Canadian municipalities. Ottawa lawyer Francis K. Peddle exposes the damaging economic and social effects of the indiscriminate taxation of both buildings and land as the primary source of revenue for local government. Dr. Peddle shows how the many negative influences currently embedded in the local property tax can be alleviated by simultaneously lowering the tax or mill rate on the building component of the real estate tax and proportionately increasing the rate on the land value component. URBAN ECONOMICS This book examines the interlocking problems which pervade our urban economies and systems of municipal property taxation. The principal proposal of the book, which would see the current system of property taxation replaced by a site value system of taxation, or what is now often called, especially in the United States, a two tier property tax, has been long advocated by tax reform groups, urban economists and others who are dismayed at how real estate speculation and the monopolization of community-created wealth negatively affects our economies. CONTENTS CITIES AND GREED analyzes in depth how the current property tax discourages improvements to properties, encourages land speculation and increases land costs, contributes to urban blight and thwarts urban renewal, results in environmentally destructive urban sprawl, raises municipal costs and abets the housing shortage and inadequate housing. The issues of fairness and equity in taxation are addressed as well as the distorting effect of the current property tax on property rights and urban planning. The book connects cycles in real estate speculation with unemployment, inflation and declining productivity. CITIES AND GREED evaluates the basic principles which should govern any system of taxation as they have developed in the history of economics. The positive effect of land value taxation is surveyed as it has been variously implemented around the world. There is also a chapter on the history and practice of land value taxation in Canada during the twentieth century. TAX REVOLT There is now a pervasive and profound tax revolt going on in Canada that is aimed at the tax policies of all levels of government. What form this revolt will take in the coming years is anybody's guess, but there is no doubt it will intensify. This publication shows readers that there are viable and constructive alternatives to the current tax. CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of society and brought to a halt social progress. Not infrequently the end result of arbitrary and punitive forms of taxation is social turmoil and revolution. By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and extending a helping hand to the needy. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves. The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean urban environments.

Peddle, Ph.D. CRITIQUE OF TAX COMMISSIONS Tax commissions are often the source of key policy recommendations with respect to the design of our system of public finance. HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS explores the prevailing economic, social and political assumptions which guide modern day tax commissions. This critical evaluation, by Ottawa lawyer and writer Francis K. Peddle, focuses on tax philosophy and principles. It illustrates the frequent misapplication of tax principles as well as their often contradictory and inconsistent juxtaposition. The particular analysis in this book has relevance for all tax commissions. ONTARIO FAIR TAX COMMISSION In December, 1993 the Ontario Fair Tax Commission issued its final Report entitled Fair Taxation in a Changing World. The Report was the first major review of the tax system in Ontario in 25 years. The Fair Tax Commission spent $8.6 million and conducted an extensive consultation program with the public. It also confidently persuaded itself that its Report would form the basis of tax policy development well into the future. Although the Report feigns objectivity, its recommendations are driven by political ideology and are often based on poor and incomplete research. The Report's major recommendation with respect to property taxation would have a highly regressive, unfair and counterproductive effect on the tax system and the economy in Ontario. CONTENTS HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS contains an in depth analysis of the Report of the Fair Tax Commission with a view to exposing many of its incoherent pronouncements on property, income and sales taxation. Part One examines tax principles and looks at the untenable assumptions underlying the "tax mix" philosophy of public revenue generation. The false opposition of sales and income taxes is also discussed. Part Two undertakes a detailed evaluation of the Report and focuses on local government finance. Particular attention is paid to the basis for property assessment in Ontario. Why the Fair Tax Commission choose to avoid recommending two tier property taxation will be of special interest to readers. Part Three deals with property tax appeals and makes some suggestions that are directed at fundamental reform. CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVES This book relies on the economic philosophy of Henry George to draw its conclusions as to why the work of modern day tax commissions is futile and results in negative consequences with respect to the design of tax systems. A tax system based on the principles of Henry George's economic philosophy moves us towards fairness and justice in the distribution of property and income. In doing so we come closer to fairness and justice in taxation. CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of society and brought to a halt social progress. Not infrequently the end result of arbitrary and punitive forms of taxation is social turmoil and revolution.By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and extending a helping hand to the needy. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves. The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean urban environments.

Understanding export regulations, responsibilities and preferred procedures give companies just this kind of advantage. Knowledge yields more timely approvals of license requests and the confidence to fully pursue international opportunities with minimal expenditure of time and valuable resources. CSL can help your company in this critical area. We conduct intensive in-house seminars and audits to ensure that your personnel know how to be fully compliant with changing laws while at the same time optimizing international business opportunities. COMPLIANCE A successful compliance program lies at the heart of every efficient export system. Companies cannot afford to ignore record keeping and reporting requirements, and the potential for government audits. To ignore is to risk delays, denials and even fines or debarment. In recent years, penalties for violations have been significantly reduced for companies that have first-rate compliance programs. CSL can train your company on-site to bring your export programs into compliance. We will work with you to design a program that complies with the law, and also suits your individual business requirements. Our comprehensive Compliance Program meets the requirements of the Departments of State and Commerce. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Our tailored educational programs address the needs of specific departments and personnel: The Executive Program is designed to educate upper management about their responsibilities and liabilities; The Marketing Program focuses on the responsibilities of your front-line sales personnel -- how to sell and, at the same time, comply with the rules; The Foreign Customer Program addresses reexport issues and documentation requirements of your foreign clients. THE CSL SEMINAR At least once a year CSL Associates conducts an interactive, intensive multi-day seminar with limited participation. The Seminar focuses on individual questions and group participation so attendees get the latest information they need to know. Beginners and experts alike will both learn from and enjoy sessions on export licensing, country and regional policy concerns, and compliance. The seminar offers one-on-one sessions with CSL experts and government representatives to discuss sensitive company issues. THE CSL NEWSLETTER CSL’s monthly newsletter highlights timely developments in the regulatory process, foreign policy developments, noteworthy international events, staff changes at key government agencies and violations of pertinent statutes. The CSL education and compliance programs will help your company become more confident about complying with the regulations, and in the international marketplace.

(a) Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) authorizes the President to control the export and import of defense articles and defense services. The statutory authority of the President to promulgate regulations with respect to exports of defense articles and defense services was delegated to the Secretary of State by Executive Order 11958, as amended (42 FR 4311). This subchapter implements that authority. By virtue of delegations of authority by the Secretary of State, these regulations are primarily administered by the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State. (b) Authorized Officials. All authorities conferred upon the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls by this subchapter may be exercised at any time by the UnderSecretary of State for International Security Affairs, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, or the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs responsible for supervising the Office of Defense Trade Controls unless the Legal Adviser or the Assistant Legal Adviser for Political-Military Affairs of the Department of State determines that any specific exercise of this authority under this subsection may be inappropriate. (c ) Eligibility. Only U.S. persons (as defined in § 120.15) and foreign governmental entities in the United States may be granted licenses or other approvals (other than retransfer approvals sought pursuant to this subchapter). Foreign persons (as defined in § 120.16) other than governments are not eligible. U.S. persons who have been convicted of violating the criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.27, who have been debarred pursuant to part 127 or 128 of this subchapter, who are the subject of an indictment involving the criminal statues enumerated in § 120.27, who are ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other form of authorization to import defense articles or defense services from any agency of the U.S. Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or other forms of authorization to export) from any agency of the U.S. Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or other forms of authorization to export ) from any agency of the U.S. Government, who are subject to Department of State Suspension/Revocation under § 126.7 (a)(1)-(a)(7) of this subchapter, or who are ineligible under § 127.6(c ) of this subchapter are generally ineligible. Applications for licenses or other approvals will be considered only if the applicant has registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls pursuant to part 122 of this subchapter. All applications and requests for approval must be signed by a U.S. person who has been empowered by the registrant to sign such documents. (d) The exemptions provided in this subchapter do not apply to transactions in which the exporter or any party to the export (as defined in § 126.7(e) of this subchapter) is generally ineligible as set forth above in paragraph (c ) of this section, unless an exception has been granted pursuant to § 126.7(c ) of this subchapter. § 120.2 DESIGNATION OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE SERVICES. The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a) and 2794(7)) provides that the President shall designate the articles and services deemed to be defense articles and defense services for purposes of this subchapter. The items so designated constitute the United States Munitions List and are specified in part 121 of this subchapter. Such designations are made by the Department of State with the concurrence of the Department of Defense. For a determination on whether a particular item is included on the U.S. Munitions List see § 120.4 (a). § 120.3 POLICY ON DESIGNATING AND DETERMINING DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE SERVICES. An article or service may be designated or determined in the future to be a defense article (see § 120.6) or defense service (see § 120.9) if it: (a) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for a military application, and (i) Does not have predominant civil application, and (ii) Does not have performance equivalent (defined by form, fit and function) to those of an article or service used for civil applications; or (b) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for a military or intelligence applicability such that control under this subchapter is necessary. The intended use of the article or service after its export (i.e. for a military or civilian purpose) is not relevant in determining whether the article or service is subject to the controls of this subchapter. Any item covered by the U.S. Munitions List must be within the categories of the U.S. Munitions List. The scope of the U.S. Munitions List shall be changed only by amendments made pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) § 120.4 COMMODITY JURISDICTION. (a) The commodity jurisdiction procedure is used with the U.S. Government if doubt exists as to whether an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. It may also be used for consideration of a redesignation of an article or service currently covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The Department must submit a report to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from the U.S. Munitions List. Upon written request, the Office of Defense Trade Controls shall provide a determination of whether a particular article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The determination, consistent with Secs. 120.2, 120.3 and 120.4, entails consultation among the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce and other U.S. Government agencies and industry in appropriate cases. (b) Registration with the Office of Defense Trade Controls as defined in part 122 of this subchapter is not required prior to submission of a commodity jurisdiction request. If it is determined that the commodity is a defense article or service covered by the U.S. Munitions List, registration is required for exporters, manufacturers, and furnishers of defense articles and defense services (see part 122 of this subchapter). (c ) Requests shall identify the article or service, and include a history of the product's design, development and use. Brochures, specifications and any other documentation related to the article or service shall be submitted in seven collated sets. (d)(1) A determination that an article or service does not have predominant civil applications hall be made by the Department of State, in accordance with this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account: (i) The number, variety and predominance of civil applications; (ii) The nature, function and capability of the civil applications; and (iii) The nature, function and capability of the military applications. (2) A determination that an article does not have the performance equivalent, defined by form, fit and function, to those used for civil applications shall be made by the Department of State, in accordance with this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account: (i) The nature, function, and capability of the article; (ii) Whether the components used in the defense article are identical to those components originally developed for civil use. NOTE: The form of the item is its defined configuration, including the geometrically measured configuration, density and weight or other visual parameters which uniquely characterize the item, component or assembly. For software, form denotes language, language level and media. The fit of the item is its ability to physically interface or interconnect with or become an integral part of another item. The function of the item is the action or actions it is designed to perform. (3) A determination that an article has significant military or intelligence applications such that it is necessary to control its export as a defense article shall be made, in accordance with this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account: (i) the nature, function and capability of the article; (ii) The nature of controls imposed by other nations on such items (including COCOM and other multilateral controls), and (iii) That items described on the COCOM Industrial List shall not be designated defense articles or defense services unless the failure to control such items on the U.S. Munitions List would jeopardize significant national security or foreign policy interests. (e) The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide a preliminary response within 10 working days of receipt of a complete request for commodity jurisdiction. If after 45 days the Office of Defense Trade Controls has not provided a final commodity jurisdiction determination, the applicant may request in writing to the Director, Center for Defense Trade that this determination be given expedited processing. (f) State, Defense and Commerce will resolve commodity jurisdiction disputes in accordance with established procedures. State shall notify Defense and Commerce of the initiation and conclusion of each case. (g) A person may appeal a commodity jurisdiction determination by submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Director of the Center for Defense Trade. The Center for Defense Trade will provide a written response of the Director's determination within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. If desired, an appeal of the Director's decision can then be made directly to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. § 120.5 RELATION TO REGULATIONS OF OTHER AGENCIES. If an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List, its export is regulated by the Department of State, except as indicated otherwise in this subchapter. For the relationship of this subchapter to regulations of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, see § 123.20 of this subchapter.

Authority: Secs. 2 and 38, Pib. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311, 1977 Comp. P. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658) § 122.1 Registration requirements. (a) Any person who engages in the United States in the business of either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or furnishing defense services is required to register with the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Manufacturers who do not engage in exporting must nevertheless register. (b) Exemptions. Registration is not required for: (1) Officers and employees of the United States Government acting in an official capacity. (2) Persons whose pertinent business activity is confined to the production of unclassified technical data only. (3) Persons all of whose manufacturing and export activities are licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. (4) Persons who engage only in the fabrication of articles for experimental or scientific purpose, including research and development. (c ) Purpose. Registration is primarily a means to provide the U.S. Government with necessary information on who is involved in certain manufacturing and exporting activities. Registration does not confer any export rights or privileges. It is generally a precondition to the issuance of any license or other approval under this subchapter. § 122.2 Submission of registration statement. (a) General. The Department of State Form DSP-9 (Registration Statement) and the transmittal letter required by paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted by an intended registrant with a payment by check or money order payable to the Department of State of one of the fees prescribed in 122.3(a) of this subchapter. The Registration Statement and transmittal letter must be signed by a senior officer who has been empowered by the intended registrant to sign such documents. The intended registrant shall also submit documentation that demonstrates that it is incorporated or otherwise authorized to do business in the United States. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will return to the sender any Registration Statement that is incomplete, or that is not accompanied by the required letter or payment of the proper registration fee. (b) Transmittal letter. A letter of transmittal, signed by an authorized senior officer of the intended registrant, shall accompany each Registration Statement. (1) The letter shall state whether the intended registrant, chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g. comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors: (i) Has ever been indicted for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of this subchapter; or (ii) Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. Government. (2) The letter shall also declare whether the intended registrant is owned or controlled by foreign persons (as defined in 120.16 of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is owned or controlled by foreign persons, the letter shall also state whether the intended registrant is incorporated or otherwise authorized to engage in business in the United States. (c ) Definition. For purposes of this section, ownership means that more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the firm are owned by one or more foreign persons. Control means that one or more foreign persons have the authority or ability to establish or direct the general policies or day-to-day operations of the firm. Control is presumed to exist where foreign persons own 25 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities if no U.S. persons control an equal or larger percentage. The standards for control specified in 22 CFR 60.2(c ) also provide guidance in determining whether control in fact exists. § 122.3 Registration fees. (a) A person who is required to register may do so for a period up to 5 years upon submission of a completed form DSP-9, transmittal letter, and payment of a fee as follows: 1 year $250 2 years 500 3 years 700 4 years 850 5 years 1,000 (b) Lapse in registration. A registrant who fails to renew a registration and, after an intervening period, seeks to register again must pay registration fees for any part of such intervening period during which the registrant engaged in the business of manufacturing or exporting defense articles or defense services. (c ) Refund of fee. Fees paid in advance for future years of a multiple year registration will be refunded upon request if the registrant ceases to engage in the manufacture or export of defense articles and defense services. A request for a refund must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls prior to the beginning of any year for which a refund is claimed. § 122.4 Notification of changes in information furnished by registrants. (a) A registrant must, within five days of the event, notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by registered mail if: (1) Any of the persons referred to in 122.2(b) are indicted for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of this subchapter, or become ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to export or temporarily import defense articles or defense services from any agency of the U.S. government; or (2) There is a material change in the information contained in the Registration Statement, including a change in the senior officers; the establishment, acquisition or divestment of a subsidiary or foreign affiliate; a merger; a change of location; or the dealing in an additional category of defense articles or defense services. (b) A registrant must notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by registered mail at least 60 days in advance of any intended sale or transfer to a foreign person of ownership or control of the registrant or any entity thereof. Such notice does not relieve the registrant from obtaining the approval required under this subchapter for the export of defense articles or defense services to a foreign person, including the approval required prior to disclosing technical data. Such notice provides the Office of Defense Trade Controls with the information necessary to determine whether the authority of section 38(g)(6) of the Arms Export Control Act regarding licenses or other approvals for certain sales or transfers of articles or data should be invoked (see 120.10 and 126.1(e) of this subchapter). (c ) The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another company or acquires, or is acquired by, another company or a subsidiary or division of another company shall advise the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the following: (1) The new firm name and all previous firm names being disclosed; (2) The registration number that will survive and those that are to be discontinued (if any); (3) The license numbers of all approvals on which unshipped balances will be shipped under the surviving registration number, since any license not the subject of notification will be considered invalid; and (4) Amendments to agreements approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to change the name of a party to those agreements. The registrant must, within 60 days of this notification, provide to the Office of Defense Trade Controls a signed copy of an amendment to each agreement signed by the new U.S. entity, the former U.S. licensor and the foreign licensee. Any agreements not so amended will be considered invalid. (d) Prior approval by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for any amendment making a substantive change. § 122.5 Maintenance of records by registrants. (a) A person who is required to register must maintain records concerning the manufacture, acquisition and disposition of defense articles; the provision of defense services; and information on political contributions, fees, or commissions furnished or obtained, as required by part 130 of this subchapter. All such records must be maintained for a period of five years from the expiration of the license or other approval. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may prescribe a longer or shorter period in individual cases. (b) Records maintained under this section shall be available at all times for inspection and copying by the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls or a person designated by the Director (the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service or a person designated by the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service or another designee), or the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service or a person designated by the Commissioner.

Note: These Exceptions do not apply to shipments that transit the U.S. to or from Canada (see § 123.19 and § 126.5 of this subchapter for exceptions). (b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import (but not the subsequent export) without a license of unclassified defense articles that are to be incorporated into another article, or modified, enhanced, upgraded, altered, improved or serviced in any other manner that changes the basic performance or productivity of the article prior to being returned to the country from which they were shipped or prior to being shipped to a third country. A DSP-5 is required for the reexport of such unclassified defense articles after incorporation into another article, modification, enhancement, upgrading, alteration or improvement. (c ) Requirements. To use an exemption under § 123.4 (a) or (b), the following criteria must be met: (1) The importer must meet the eligibility requirements set forth in 120.1(b) of this subchapter; (2) At the time of export, the ultimate consignee named on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) must be the same as the foreign consignee or end-user of record named at the time of import; and (3) As stated in § 126.1 of this subchapter, the temporary import must not be from or on behalf of a proscribed country listed in that section unless an exception has been granted in accordance with § 126.3 of this subchapter. (d) Procedures. To the satisfaction of the District Director of Customs, the importer and exporter must comply with the following procedures: (1) At the time of temporary import -- (i) File and annotate the applicable U.S. Customs document (e.g., Form CF 3461, 7512, 7501, 7523 or 3311) to read: ``This shipment is being imported in accordance with and under the authority of 22 CFR 123.4(a) (identify subsection),'' and (ii) Include, on the invoice or other appropriate documentation, a complete list and description of the defense article(s) being imported, including quantity and U.S. dollar value; and (2) At the time of export, file with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit a Shipper's Export Declaration (Department of Commerce Form 7525-V) and include on the SED or as an attachment the following information: (i) the U.S. Customs entry document number or a copy of the U.S. Customs documentation under which the article was imported; (ii) the following statement: ``22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR 120.1(b) applicable.'' § 123.5 Temporary export licenses. (a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may issue a license for the temporary export of unclassified defense articles (DSP-73). Such licenses are valid only if (1) the article will be exported for a period of less than 4 years and will be returned to the United States and (2) transfer of title will not occur during the period of temporary export. Accordingly, articles exported pursuant to a temporary export license may not be sold or otherwise permanently transferred to a foreign person while they are overseas under a temporary export license. A renewal of the license or other written approval must be obtained from the Office of Defense Trade Controls if the article is to remain outside the United States beyond the period for which the license is valid. (b) Requirements. Defense articles authorized for temporary export under this section may be shipped only from a port in the United States where a District Director of Customs is available, or from a U.S. Post Office (see 39 CFR part 20), as appropriate. The license for temporary export must be presented to the District Director of Customs who, upon verification, will endorse the exit column on the reverse side of the license. In some instances of the temporary export of technical data (e.g postal shipments), self-endorsement will be necessary (see §123.22(d)). The endorsed license for temporary export is to be retained by the licensee. In the case of a military aircraft or vessel exported under its own power, the endorsed license must be carried on board such vessel or aircraft as evidence that it has been duly authorized by the Department of State to leave the United States temporarily. (c ) Upon the return to the United States of defense articles covered by a license for temporary export, the license will be endorsed in the entry column by the District Director of Customs. This procedure shall be followed for all exits and entries made during the period for which the license is valid. The licensee must send the license to the Office of Defense Trade Controls immediately upon expiration or after the final return of the defense articles approved for export, whichever occurs first. § 123.6 Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses. Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses are considered integral parts of the United States for the purpose of this subchapter. An export license is therefore not required for shipment between the United States and a foreign trade zone or a Customs bonded warehouse. In the case of classified defense articles, the provisions of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual will apply. An export license is required for all shipments of articles on the U.S. Munitions List from foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses to foreign countries, regardless of how the articles reached the zone or warehouse. § 123.7 Exports to warehouses or distribution points outside the United States. Unless the exemption under §123.16(b)(1) is used, a license is required to export defense articles to a warehouse or distribution point outside the United States for subsequent resale and will normally be granted only if an agreement has been approved pursuant to §124.14 of this subchapter. § 123.8 Special controls on vessels, aircraft and satellites covered by the U.S. Munitions List. (a) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of any aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the U.S. Munitions List is an export for purposes of this subchapter and requires a license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This requirement applies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is physically located in the United States or abroad. (b) The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vessel or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List which is not registered in the United States but which is located in the United States constitutes an export. A license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is therefore required. Such transactions may also require the prior approval of the Maritime Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration or other agencies of the U.S. Government. § 123.9 Country of ultimate destination and approval of reexports or retransfers. (a) The country designated as the country of ultimate destination on an application for an export license, or on a Shipper's Export Declaration where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, must be the country of ultimate end-use. The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before reselling, transferring, transshipping, or disposing of a defense article to any end user, end use or destination other than as stated on the export license, or on the Shipper's Export Declaration in cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter. Exporters must ascertain the specific end-user and end-use prior to submitting an application to the Office of Defense Trade Controls or claiming an exemption under this subchapter. (b) The exporter shall incorporate the following statement as an integral part of the bill of lading, and the invoice whenever defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List are to be exported: These commodities are authorized by the U.S. Government for export only to (country of ultimate destination) for use by (end-user). They may not be transferred, transshipped on a non-continuous voyage, or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either in their original form or after being incorporated into other end-items, without the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State.'' (c ) A U.S. person or a foreign person requesting approval for the reexport or retransfer, or change in end-use, of a defense article shall submit a written request which shall be subject to all the documentation required for a permanent export license (see §123.1) and shall contain the following: (1) The license number under which the defense article was previously authorized for export from the United States; (2) A precise description, quantity and value of the defense article; (3) A description of the new end-use; and (4) Identification of the new end-user. (d) The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before reselling, transferring, transshipping on a non-continuous voyage, or disposing of a defense article in any country other than the country of ultimate destination, or anyone other than the authorized end-user, as stated on the Shipper's Export Declaration in cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter. (e) Reexports or retransfers of U.S.-origin components incorporated into a foreign defense article to a government of a NATO country, or the governments of Australia or Japan, are authorized without the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, provided: (1) The U.S.-origin components were previously authorized for export from the United States, either by a license or an exemption; (2) The U.S.-origin components are not significant military equipment, the items are not major defense equipment sold under a contract in the amount of $14,000,000 ($14 million) or more; the articles are not defense articles or defense services sold under a contract in the amount of $50,000,000 ($50 million) or more; and are not identified in part 121 of this subchapter as Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) items; and (3) The person reexporting the defense article must provide written notification to the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the retransfer not later than 30 days following the reexport. The notification must state the articles being reexported and the recipient government. (4) In certain cases, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may place retransfer restrictions on a license prohibiting use of this exemption. § 123.10 Non-transfer and use assurances. (a) A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) is required for the export of significant military equipment and classified articles including classified technical data. A license will not be issued until a completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This form is to be executed by the foreign consignee, foreign end-user, and the applicant. The certificate stipulates that, except as specifically authorized by prior written approval of the Department of State, the foreign consignee and foreign end-user will not reexport, resell or otherwise dispose of the significant military equipment enumerated in the application outside the country named as the location of the foreign end-use or to any other person. (b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83 for the export of any other defense articles or defense services. (c ) When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense article or defense service to a non-governmental foreign end-user, the Office of Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of issuing the license that the appropriate authority of the government of the country of ultimate destination also execute the certificate. § 123.11 Movements of vessels and aircraft covered by the U.S. Munitions List outside the United States. (a) A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required whenever a privately-owned aircraft or vessel on the U.S. Munitions List makes a voyage outside the United States. (b) Exemption. An export license is not required when a vessel or aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section departs from the United States and does not enter the territorial waters or airspace of a foreign country if no defense articles are carried as cargo. Such a vessel or aircraft may not enter the territorial waters or airspace of a foreign country before returning to the United States, or carry as cargo any defense article, without a temporary export license (Form DSP-73) from the Department of State. (See §123.5.) § 123.12 Shipments between U.S. possessions. An export license is not required for the shipment of defense articles between the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. possessions. A license is required, however, for the export of defense articles from these areas to foreign countries. § 123.13 Domestic aircraft shipments via a foreign country. A license is not required for the shipment by air of a defense article from one location in the United States to another location in the United States via a foreign country. The pilot of the aircraft must, however, file a written statement with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit in the United States. The original statement must be filed at the time of exit with the District Director of Customs. A duplicate must be filed at the port of reentry with the District Director of Customs, who will duly endorse it and transmit it to the District Director of Customs at the port of exit. The statement will be as follows: Domestic Shipment Via a Foreign Country of Articles on the U.S. Munitions List Under penalty according to Federal law, the undersigned certifies and warrants that all the information in this document is true and correct, and that the equipment listed below is being shipped from (U.S. port of exit) via (foreign country) to (U.S. port of entry), which is the final destination in the United States. Description of Equipment Quantity: Equipment: Value: Signed: Endorsement: Customs Inspector. Port of Exit Date: Signed: Endorsement: Customs Inspector. Port of Entry: Date:. § 123.14 Import certificate/delivery verification procedure. (a) The Import Certificate/Delivery Verification Procedure is designed to assure that a commodity imported into the territory of those countries participating in IC/DV procedures will not be diverted, transshipped, or reexported to another destination except in accordance with export control regulations of the importing country. (b) Exports. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may require the IC/DV procedure on proposed exports of defense articles to non-government entities in those countries participating in IC/DV procedures. In such cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an export license application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the original Import Certificate, which must be provided and authenticated by the government of the importing country. This document verifies that the foreign importer complied with the import regulations of the government of the importing country and that the importer declared the intention not to divert, transship or reexport the material described therein without the prior approval of that government. After delivery of the commodities to the foreign consignee, the Department of State may also require U.S. exporters to furnish Delivery Verification documentation from the government of the importing country. This documentation verifies that the delivery was in accordance with the terms of the approved export license. Both the Import Certificate and the Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter by the foreign importer. (c ) Triangular transactions. When a transaction involves three or more countries that have adopted the IC/DV procedure, the governments of these countries may stamp a triangular symbol on the Import Certificate. This symbol is usually placed on the Import Certificate when the applicant for the Import Certificate (the importer) states either (1) that there is uncertainty whether the items covered by the Import Certificate will be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; (2) that he or she knows that the items will not be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; or (3) that, if the items are to be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate, they will subsequently be reexported to another destination. All parties, including the ultimate consignee in the country of ultimate destination, must be shown on the completed Import Certificate. § 123.15 Congressional notification for licenses. All exports of major defense equipment, as defined in §120.8 of this subchapter, sold under a contract in the amount of $14,000,000 or more, or exports of defense articles and defense services sold under a contract in the amount of $50,000,000 or more, may take place only after the Office of Defense Trade Controls notifies the exporter through issuance of a license or other approval that 30 calendar days have elapsed since receipt by the Congress of the certification required by 22 U.S.C. 2776(c)(1) and that Congress has not enacted a joint resolution prohibiting the export. Persons who intend to export defense articles and defense services pursuant to any exemption in this subchapter (e.g., §126.5 of this subchapter) under the circumstances described in the first sentence of this subsection must notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by letter of the intended export and, prior to transmittal to Congress, provide a signed contract and a DSP-83 signed by the applicant, the foreign consignee and end-user. § 123.16 Exemptions of general applicability. (a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified defense articles for which no approval is needed from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions do not apply to: Proscribed destinations under §126.1 of this subchapter; exports for which Congressional notification is required; MTCR articles; Significant Military Equipment (SME); and may not be used by persons who are generally ineligible as described in §120.1(c ) of this subchapter. All shipments of defense articles, including those to and from Canada, require a Shippers Export Declaration (SED). If the defense article is exempt from licensing, the SED must cite the exemption. Refer to §123.22(c ) for Shipper's Export Declaration requirements. (b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter: (1) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of defense articles being exported in furtherance of an approved manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement or distribution agreement provided that: (i) The defense articles to be exported support the activity and must be identified by item, quantity and value in the agreement; and (ii) Any provisos or limitations placed on the authorized agreement are adhered to; and (iii) The exporter certifies on the Shipper's Export Declaration that the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. This is done by writing, ``22 CFR 123.16(b)(1) and AG (identify agreement number) applicable and (iv) The total value of all shipments does not exceed the value authorized in the agreement. (v) In the case of distribution agreements, export must be made directly to the approved foreign distributor. (2) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export of components or spare parts (for exemptions for firearms and ammunition see §123.17) without a license when the total value does not exceed $500 in a single transaction and: (i) The components or spare parts are being exported to support a defense article previously authorized for export; and (ii) The spare parts or components are not going to a distributor, but to a previously approved end-user of the defense articles; and (iii) The spare parts or components are not to be used to enhance the capability of the defense article; (iv) exporters shall not split orders so as not to exceed the dollar value of this exemption; (v) the exporter may not make more than 24 shipments per calender year to the previously authorized end user; (vi) The exporter must certify on the Shipper's Export Declaration that the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. This is done by writing 22 CFR 123.16(b)(2) applicable. (3) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license, of packing cases specially designed to carry defense articles. (4) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license, of unclassified models or mock-ups of defense articles, provided that such models or mock-ups are nonoperable and do not reveal any technical data in excess of that which is exempted from the licensing requirements of §125.4(b) of this subchapter and do not contain components covered by the U.S. Munitions List (see §120.6(b) of this subchapter). Some models or mockups built to scale or constructed of original materials can reveal technical data. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written certification to the District Director of Customs that these conditions are met. This exemption does not imply that the Office of Defense Trade Controls will approve the export of any defense articles for which models or mocks-ups have been exported pursuant to this exemption. (5) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary export without a license of unclassified defense articles to any public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event if that article has previously been licensed for a public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event and the license is still valid. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written certification to the District Director of Customs that these conditions are met. (6) For exemptions for firearms and ammunition for personal use refer to §123.17. (7) For exemptions for firearms for personal use of members of the U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees see §123.18. (8) For exports to Canada refer to §126.5 of this subchapter. (9) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary export without a license by a U.S. person of any unclassified component, part, tool or test equipment to a subsidiary, affiliate or facility owned or controlled by the U.S. person (see §122.2(c ) of this subchapter) if the component, part, tool or test equipment is to be used for manufacture, assembly, testing, production, or modification provided: (i) The U.S. person is registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls and complies with all requirements set forth in part 122 of this subchapter; (ii) No defense article exported under this exemption may be sold or transferred without the appropriate license or other approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. § 123.17 Exports of firearms and ammunition. (a) Except as provided in §126.1 of this subchapter, District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of components and parts for Category I(a) firearms, except barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete breach mechanisms when the total value does not exceed $500 wholesale in any transaction. (b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of nonautomatic firearms covered by Category I(a) of §121.1 of this subchapter if they were manufactured in or before 1898, or are replicas of such firearms. (c ) District Directors of Customs shall permit U.S. persons to export temporarily from the United States without a license not more than three nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of §121.1 of this subchapter and not more than 1,000 cartridges therefor, provided that: (1) A declaration by the U.S. person and an inspection by a customs officer is made; (2) The firearms and accompanying ammunition must be with the U.S. person's baggage or effects, whether accompanied or unaccompanied (but not mailed); and (3) They must be for that person's exclusive use and not for reexport or other transfer of ownership. The foregoing exemption is not applicable to a crew-member of a vessel or aircraft unless the crew-member declares the firearms to a Customs officer upon each departure from the United States, and declares that it is his or her intention to return the article(s) on each return to the United States. It is also not applicable to the personnel referred to in §123.18. (d) District Directors of Customs shall permit a foreign person to export without a license such firearms in Category I(a) of §121.1 of this subchapter and ammunition therefor as the foreign person brought into the United States under the provisions of 27 CFR 178.115(d). (The latter provision specifically excludes from the definition of importation the bringing into the United States of firearms and ammunition by certain foreign persons for specified purposes). (e) District Directors of Customs shall permit U.S. persons to export without a license ammunition for nonautomatic firearms referred to in paragraph (a) of this section if the quantity does not exceed 1,000 cartridges (or rounds) in any shipment. The ammunition must also be for personal use and not for resale or other transfer of ownership. The foregoing exemption is also not applicable to the personnel referred to in §123.18. § 123.18 Firearms for personal use of members of the U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees of the U.S. Government. The following exemptions apply to members of the U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees of the U.S. Government who are U.S. persons (both referred to herein as personnel). The exemptions apply only to such personnel if they are assigned abroad for extended duty. These exemptions do not apply to dependents. (a) Firearms. District Directors of Customs shall permit nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of §121.1 of this subchapter and parts therefor to be exported, except by mail, from the United States without a license if: (1) They are consigned to servicemen's clubs abroad for uniformed members of the U.S. Armed Forces; or, (2) In the case of a uniformed member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a civilian employee of the Department of Defense, they are for personal use and not for resale or other transfer of ownership, and if the firearms are accompanied by a written authorization from the commanding officer concerned; or (3) In the case of other U.S. Government employees, they are for personal use and not for resale or other transfer of ownership, and the Chief of the U.S. Diplomatic Mission or his designee in the country of destination has approved in writing to Department of State the import of the specific types and quantities of firearms into that country. The exporter shall provide a copy of this written statement to the District Director of Customs. (b) Ammunition. District Directors of Customs shall permit not more than 1,000 cartridges (or rounds) of ammunition for the firearms referred to in paragraph (a) of this section to be exported (but not mailed) from the United States without a license when the firearms are on the person of the owner or with his baggage or effects, whether accompanied or unaccompanied (but not mailed). § 123.19 Canadian and Mexican border shipments. A shipment originating in Canada or Mexico which incidentally transits the United States en route to a delivery point in the same country that originated the shipment is exempt from the requirement for an in transit license. § 123.20 Nuclear materials. (a) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to equipment in Category VI(e) and Category XVI of §121.1 of this subchapter to the extent such equipment is under the export control of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. (b) A license for the export of any machinery, device, component, equipment, or technical data relating to equipment referred to in Category VI(e) will not be granted unless the proposed export comes within the scope of an existing Agreement for Cooperation for Mutual Defense Purposes concluded pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with the government of the country to which the article is to be exported. Licenses may be granted in the absence of such an agreement only (1) if the proposed export involves an article which is identical to that in use in an unclassified civilian nuclear power plant, (2) if the proposed export has no relationship to naval nuclear propulsion, and (3) if it is not for use in a naval propulsion plant. § 123.21 Duration, renewal and disposition of licenses. (a) A license is valid for four years. The license expires when the total value or quantity authorized has been shipped or when the date of expiration has been reached, whichever occurs first. Defense articles to be shipped thereafter require a new application and license. The new application should refer to the expired license. It should not include references to any defense articles other than those of the unshipped balance of the expired license. (b) Unused, expired, expended, suspended, or revoked licenses must be returned immediately to the Department of State. § 123.22 Filing of export licenses and Shipper's Export Declarations with District Directors of Customs. (a) The exporter must deposit the license with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit before shipment, unless paragraph (d) of this section or §125.9 applies (for exports by mail, see §123.24). Licenses for temporary export or temporary import are to be retained by the exporter and presented to the District Director of Customs at the time of import or export for endorsement. If necessary, the export may be made through a port other than the one designated on the license if the exporter complies with the procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service. Every license will be returned to the Office of Defense Trade Controls by the District Director of Customs when the total value or quantity authorized has been shipped or when the date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first. (b) Before shipping any defense article, the exporter must also file a Shipper's Export Declaration with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit (unless otherwise exempt from filing a Shipper's Export Declaration). The District Director of Customs at the port of exit must authenticate the Shipper's Export Declaration, and endorse the license to show the shipments actually made. The District Director of Customs will return a copy of each authenticated Shipper's Export Declaration to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (c ) Except for the export of unclassified technical data, an exporter must file a Shipper's Export Declaration with District Directors of Customs or Postmasters in those cases in which no export license is required because of an exemption under this subchapter. The exporter must certify that the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter by writing 22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR 120.1(b) applicable on the Shipper's Export Declaration, and by identifying the section under which an exemption is claimed. A copy of each such declaration must be mailed immediately by the exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (d) A Shipper's Export Declaration is not required for exports of unclassified technical data. Exporters shall notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the initial export of the data by either returning the license after self endorsement or by sending a letter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The letter shall provide the method, date, license number and airway bill number (if applicable) of the shipment. The letter must be signed by an empowered official of the company and provided to the Office of Defense Trade Controls within thirty days of the initial export. (e) If a license for the export of unclassified defense articles, including technical data, is used but not endorsed by U.S. Customs or a Postmaster for whatever reason (e.g., electronic transmission, unavailability of Customs officer or Postmaster, etc.), the person exporting the article must self-endorse the license, showing when and how the export took place. Every license shall also be returned by the exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls when the total value or quantity authorized has been shipped or when the date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first. § 123.23 Monetary value of shipments. District Directors of Customs shall permit the shipment of defense articles identified on any license when the total value of the export does not exceed the aggregate monetary value (not quantity) stated on the license by more than ten percent, provided that the additional monetary value does not make the total value of the license or other approval for the export of any major defense equipment sold under a contract reach $14,000,000 or more, and provided that the additional monetary value does not make defense articles or defense services sold under a contract reach the amount of $50,000,000 or more. § 123.24 Shipments by mail. A Shipper's Export Declaration must be authenticated before an article is actually sent abroad by mail (see §123.22(d)). The postmaster or exporter will endorse each license to show the shipments made. Every license must be returned by the exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls upon completion of the mailings. § 123.25 Amendments to licenses. (a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may approve an amendment to a license for permanent export, temporary export and temporary import of unclassified defense articles. A suggested format is available from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (b) The following types of amendments to a license that will be considered: Addition of U.S. freight forwarder or U.S. consignor; change due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of commodity; and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party is only transporting the equipment and will not process (e.g., integrate, modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see §123.23. (c ) The following types of amendments to a license will not be approved: Additional quantity, changes in commodity, country of ultimate destination, end-use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or extension of duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be amended if that party is acting as freight forwarder and the export does not involve technical data. A new license is required for these changes. Any new license submission must reflect only the unshipped balance of quantity and dollar value. § 123.26 Recordkeeping requirement for exemptions. When an exemption is claimed for the export of unclassified technical data, the exporter must maintain a record of each such export. The business record should include the following information: A description of the unclassified technical data, the name of the recipient end-user, the date and time of the export, and the method of transmission. § 123.27 Temporary export for personal use of Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic products. (a) District Directors of Customs may permit a U.S. citizen or a U.S. person who is a lawful permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(20) to temporarily export from the United States without a license not more than one each of any unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic hardware product and not more than a single copy of each type of unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic software product provided that: (1) The software product(s) are to be used only on a simultaneously temporarily exported Category XIII(b)(1) hardware product or a simultaneously exported item on the Commerce Control List (CCL); and (2) The cryptographic products covered by Category XIII(b)(1) are not destined for export to a destination listed in Sec. §126.1 of the ITAR (22 CFR126.1) which is prohibited by a United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 49 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism -- currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria); and (3)(i) The encryption products remain in the possession of the exporting person or the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling with him/her, or for their exclusive use and not for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export or transfer of ownership or control. The export of cryptographic products identified in Category XIII(b)(1) in any other circumstances, for example, those in which a person contemplates sales, marketing, or demonstration must be licensed in accordance with policies and procedures in this subchapter. (ii) Special definition.

(a) The controls of this part apply to the export of technical data and the export of classified defense articles. Information which is in the public domain (see §120.11 of this subchapter and § 125.4(b)(13)) is not subject to the controls of this subchapter. (b) A license for the export of technical data and the exemptions in 125.4 may not be used for foreign production purposes or for technical assistance unless the approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls has been obtained. Such approval is generally provided only pursuant to the procedures specified in part 124 of this subchapter. (c) Technical data authorized for export may not be reexported, transferred or diverted from the country of ultimate end-use or from the authorized foreign end-user (as designated in the license or approval for export) or disclosed to a national of another country without the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (d) The controls of this part apply to the exports referred to in paragraph (a) of this section regardless of whether the person who intends to export the technical data produces or manufactures defense articles if the technical data is determined by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to be subject to the controls of this subchapter. (e) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to technical data related to articles in Category VI(e) and Category XVI. The export of such data is controlled by the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. §125.2 Exports of unclassified technical data. (a) A license (DSP-5) is required for the export of unclassified technical data unless the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. In the case of a plant visit, details of the proposed discussions must be transmitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for an appraisal of the technical data. Seven copies of the technical data or the details of the discussion must be provided. (b) Patents. A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for the export of technical data whenever the data exceeds that which is used to support a domestic filing of a patent application or to support a foreign filing of a patent application whenever no domestic application has been filed. Requests for the filing of patent applications in a foreign country, and requests for the filing of amendments, modifications or supplements to such patents, should follow the regulations of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in accordance with 37 CFR part 5. The export of technical data to support the filing and processing of patent applications in foreign countries is subject to regulations issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 184. (c ) Disclosures. Unless otherwise expressly exempted in this subchapter, a license is required for the oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons. A license is required regardless of the manner in which the technical data is transmitted (e.g., in person, by telephone, correspondence, electronic means, etc.). A license is required for such disclosures by U.S. persons in connection with visits to foreign diplomatic missions and consular offices. §125.3 Exports of classified technical data and classified defense articles. (a) A request for authority to export defense articles, including technical data, classified by a foreign government or pursuant to Executive Order 12356, successor orders, or other legal authority must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for approval. The application must contain full details of the proposed transaction. It should also list the facility security clearance code of all U.S. parties on the license and include the Defense Investigative Service cognizant security office of the party responsible for packaging the commodity for shipment. A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) executed by the applicant, foreign consignee, end-user and an authorized representative of the foreign government involved will be required. (b) Classified technical data which is approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls either for export or reexport after a temporary import will be transferred or disclosed only in accordance with the requirements in the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. Any other requirements imposed by cognizant U.S. departments and agencies must also be satisfied. (c ) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained for the export of technical data by a U.S. person to a foreign person in the U.S. or in a foreign country unless the proposed export is exempt under the provisions of this subchapter. (d) All communications relating to a patent application covered by an invention secrecy order are to be addressed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (see 37 CFR 5.11). §125.4 Exemptions of general applicability. (a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified technical data for which approval is not needed from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions, except for paragraph (b)(13) of this section, do not apply to exports to proscribed destinations under §126.1 of this subchapter or for persons considered generally ineligible underv§ 120.1(c ) of this subchapter. The exemptions are also not applicable for purposes of establishing offshore procurement arrangements. If §126.8 of this subchapter requirements are applicable, they must be met before an exemption under this section may be used. Transmission of classified information must comply with the requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual and the exporter must certify to the transmittal authority that the technical data does not exceed the technical limitation of the authorized export. (b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. (1) Technical data, including classified information, to be disclosed pursuant to an official written request or directive from the U.S. Department of Defense; (2) Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement approved by the Department of State under part 124 of this subchapter and which meet the requirements of §124.3 of this subchapter; (3) Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a contract between the exporter and an agency of the U.S. Government, if the contract provides for the export of the data and such data does not disclose the details of design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article; (4) Copies of technical data, including classified information, previously authorized for export to the same recipient. Revised copies of such technical data are also exempt if they pertain to the identical defense article, and if the revisions are solely editorial and do not add to the content of technology previously exported or authorized for export to the same recipient; (5) Technical data, including classified information, in the form of basic operations, maintenance, and training information relating to a defense article lawfully exported or authorized for export to the same recipient. Intermediate or depot-level repair and maintenance information may be exported only under a license or agreement approved specifically for that purpose; (6) Technical data, including classified information, related to firearms not in excess of caliber .50 and ammunition for such weapons, except detailed design, development, production or manufacturing information; (7) Technical data, including classified information, being returned to the original source of import; (8) Technical data directly related to classified information which has been previously exported or authorized for export in accordance with this part to the same recipient, and which does not disclose the details of the design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article; (9) Technical data, including classified information, sent by a U.S. corporation to a U.S. person employed by that corporation overseas or to a U.S. Government agency. This exemption is subject to the limitations of §125.1(b) and may be used only if: (i) The technical data is to be used overseas solely by U.S. persons; (ii) If the U.S. person overseas is an employee of the U.S. Government or is directly employed by the U.S. corporation and not by a foreign subsidiary; and (iii) The classified information is sent overseas in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. (10) Disclosures of unclassified technical data in the U.S. by U.S. institutions of higher learning to foreign persons who are their bona fide and full time regular employees. This exemption is available only if: (i) The employee's permanent abode throughout the period of employment is in the United States; (ii) The employee is not a national of a country to which exports are prohibited pursuant to 126.1 of this subchapter; and (iii) The institution informs the individual in writing that the technical data may not be transferred to other foreign persons without the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls; (11) Technical data, including classified information, for which the exporter, pursuant to an arrangement with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy or NASA which requires such exports, has been granted an exemption in writing from the licensing provisions of this part by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such an exemption will normally be granted only if the arrangement directly implements an international agreement to which the United States is a party and if multiple exports are contemplated. The Office of Defense Trade Controls, in consultation with the relevant U.S. Government agencies, will determine whether the interests of the United States Government are best served by expediting exports under an arrangement through an exemption (see also paragraph (b)(3) of this section for a related exemption); (12) Technical data which is specifically exempt under part 126 of this subchapter; or (13) Technical data approved for public release (i.e., unlimited distribution) by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency or Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review. This exemption is applicable to information approved by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency for public release in any form. It does not require that the information be published in order to qualify for the exemption. §125.5 Exemptions for plant visits. (a) A license is not required for the oral and visual disclosure of unclassified technical data during the course of a classified plant visit by a foreign person, provided (1) the classified visit has itself been authorized pursuant to a license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls; or (2) the classified visit was approved in connection with an actual or potential government-to-government program or project by a U.S. Government agency having classification jurisdiction over the classified defense article or classified technical data involved under Executive Order 12356 or other applicable Executive Order; and (3) the unclassified information to be released is directly related to the classified defense article or technical data for which approval was obtained and does not disclose the details of the design, development, production or manufacture of any other defense articles. In the case of visits involving classified information, the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual (Department of Defense Manual 5220.22M) must be met. (b) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not required for the disclosure of oral and visual classified information to a foreign person during the course of a plant visit approved by the appropriate U.S. Government agency if (1) the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual have been met, (2) the classified information is directly related to that which was approved by the U.S. Government agency, (3) it does not exceed that for which approval was obtained, and (4) it does not disclose the details of the design, development, production or manufacture of any defense articles. (c ) A license is not required for the disclosure to a foreign person of unclassified technical data during the course of a plant visit (either classified or unclassified) approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls or a cognizant U.S. Government agency provided the technical data does not contain information in excess of that approved for disclosure. This exemption does not apply to technical data which could be used for design, development, production or manufacture of a defense article. §125.6 Certification requirements for exemptions. (a) To claim an exemption for the export of technical data under the provisions of Secs. 125.4 and 125.5, an exporter must certify that the proposed export is covered by a relevant paragraph of that section. For §125.4, certification consists of marking the package or letter containing the technical data: ``22 CFR 125.4 (identify subsection) applicable.'' This certification must be made in written form and retained in the exporter's files for a period of five years. A Shippers Export Declaration is not required for exports of unclassified technical data (see §123.22 (d) of this subchapter. (b) If a District Director of Customs or Postmaster is unavailable at the time of export, or if the export is via oral, visual, or electronic means, the exporter must also complete a written certification as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section. §125.7 Procedures for the export of classified technical data and other classified defense articles. (a) All applications for the export or temporary import of classified technical data or other classified defense articles must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls on Form DSP-85. (b) An application for the export of classified technical data or other classified defense articles must be accompanied by seven copies of the data and a completed Form DSP-83 (see §123.10 of this subchapter). Only one copy of the data or descriptive literature must be provided if a renewal of the license is requested. All classified materials accompanying an application must be transmitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls in accordance with the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual (Department of Defense Manual Number 5220.22-M). §125.8 Filing of licenses for exports of unclassified technical data. (a) Licenses for the export of unclassified technical data must be presented to the appropriate District Director of Customs or Postmaster at the time of shipment or mailing. The District Director of Customs or Postmaster will endorse and transmit the licenses to the Office of Defense Trade Controls in accordance with the instructions contained on the reverse side of the license. (b) If a license for the export of unclassified technical data is used but not endorsed by U.S. Customs or a Postmaster for whatever reason (e.g., electronic transmission, unavailability of Customs officer or Postmaster, etc.), the person exporting the data must self-endorse the license, showing when and how the export took place. Every license must be returned to the Office of Defense Trade Controls when the total value authorized has been shipped or when the date of expiration has been reached, whichever occurs first. §125.9 Filing of licenses and other authorizations for exports of classified technical data and classified defense articles. Licenses and other authorizations for the export of classified technical data or classified defense articles will be forwarded by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to the Defense Investigative Service of the Department of Defense in accordance with the provisions of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual.

L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2780, 2791 and 2797); E.O. 11958, 41 FR 4311; E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22 U.S.C. 2658; 22 U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205. §126.1 Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries. (a) General. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This policy applies to: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Byelarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Tajikistan and Vietnam. This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Haiti, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda Somalia, the Sudan, and Zaire) or for whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State Department notice published in the Federal Register. The exemptions provided in the regulations in this subchapter, except §§ 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of this subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to any proscribed countries or areas. With regard to section §123.27 the exemption does not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to countries prohibited by a United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780), to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. (b) Shipments. A defense article licensed for export under this subchapter may not be shipped on a vessel, aircraft or other means of conveyance which is owned or operated by, or leased to or from, any of the proscribed countries or areas. (c ) Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council embargoes. Whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles and services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department of State publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trae by the U.S. perons who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which are located inside or outside the United States. (d) Terrorism. Exports to countries which the Secretary of State has determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism are contrary to the foreign policy of the United States and are thus subject to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the requirements of section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780) and the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801, note). The countries in this category are: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria. The same countries are identified pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)). (e) Proposed sales. No sale or transfer and no proposal to sell or transfer any defense articles, defense services or technical data subject to this subchapter may be made to any country referred to in this section (including the embassies or consulates of such a country), or to any person acting on its behalf, whether in the United States or abroad, without first obtaining a license or written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. However, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it is the policy of the Department of State to deny licenses and approvals in such cases. Any person who knows or has reason to know of such a proposed or actual sale, or transfer, of such articles, services or data must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (f) Angola. Consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 864 of September 15, 1993, an arms embargo exists with respect to UNITA. Accordingly, exports subject to this subchapter are prohibited in accordance with Security Council Resolution 864, Executive Order 12865 of September 29, 1993m and the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, on December 10, 1993 (56 FR 64904). §126.2 Temporary suspension or modification of this subchapter. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may order the temporary suspension or modification of any or all of the regulations of this subchapter in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United States. §126.3 Exceptions. In a case of exceptional or undue hardship, or when it is otherwise in the interest of the United States Government, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls may make an exception to the provisions of this subchapter. §126.4 Shipments by or for United States Government agencies. (a) A license is not required for the temporary import, or temporary export, of any defense article, including technical data or the performance of a defense service, by or for any agency of the U.S. Government (1) for official use by such an agency, or (2) for carrying out any foreign assistance, cooperative project or sales program authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means. This exemption applies only when all aspects of a transaction (export, carriage, and delivery abroad) are effected by a United States Government agency or when the export is covered by a United States Government Bill of Lading. This exemption, however, does not apply when a U.S. Government agency acts as a transmittal agent on behalf of a private individual or firm, either as a convenience or in satisfaction of security requirements. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before defense articles previously exported pursuant to this exemption are permanently transferred (e.g., property disposal of surplus defense articles overseas) unless (i) the transfer is pursuant to a grant, sale, lease, loan or cooperative project under the Arms Export Control Act or a sale, lease or loan under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, or (ii) the defense articles have been rendered useless for military purposes beyond the possibility of restoration. Note: Special definition. For purposes of this section, defense articles exported abroad for incorporation into a foreign launch vehicle or for use on a foreign launch vehicle or satellite that is to be launched from a foreign country shall be considered a permanent export. (b) This section does not authorize any department or agency of the U.S. Government to make any export which is otherwise prohibited by virtue of other administrative provisions or by any statute. (c ) A license is not required for the temporary import, or temporary or permanent export, of any classified or unclassified defense articles, including technical data or the performance of a defense service, for end-use by a U.S. Government Agency in a foreign country under the following circumstances: (1) The export or temporary import is pursuant to a contract with, or written direction by, an agency of the U.S. Government; and (2) The end-user in the foreign country is a U.S. Government agency or facility, and the defense articles or technical data will not be transferred to any foreign person; and (3) The urgency of the U.S. Government requirement is such that the appropriate export license or U.S. Government Bill of Lading could not have been obtained in a timely manner. (d) A Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), required under §123.22(c ) of this subchapter, and a written statement by the exporter certifying that these requirements have been met must be presented at the time of export to the appropriate District Director of Customs or Department of Defense transmittal authority. A copy of the SED and the written certification statement shall be provided to the Office of Defense Trade Controls immediately following the export. §126.5 Canadian exemptions. (a) District Directors of Customs and postmasters shall permit the export or temporary import without a license of any unclassified defense article or any unclassified technical data to Canada for end-use in Canada by Canadian citizens or return to the United States, or from Canada for end-use in the United States or return to a Canadian citizen in Canada, with the exception of the articles or related technical data listed in paragraph (b) of this section. (b) Exceptions. The exemptions of this section do not apply to the following articles and related technical data: (1) Fully automatic firearms in Category I(a) which are not for end-use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of Canada; (2) Nuclear weapons strategic delivery systems and all components, parts, accessories, attachments specifically designed for such systems and associated equipment; (3) Nuclear weapon design and test equipment listed in Category XVI; (4) Naval nuclear propulsion equipment listed in Category VI(e); (5) Aircraft listed in Category VIII(a); (6) Submersible and oceanographic vessels and related articles listed in Category XX (a) through (d). (7) Defense articles, defense services, or related technical data for use by a foreign national other than a Canadian. (c ) Related requirements. The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license does not exempt an exporter from complying with the requirements set forth in §123.15 of this subchapter or from filing the Shipper's Export Declaration required by § 123.22 of this subchapter. (d) Part 124 agreements. The requirements of part 124 of this subchapter must be complied with in the situations contemplated in that part. For example, the exemptions of this section may not be used for the provision of defense services except pursuant to an approved manufacturing licenseagreement or technical assistance agreement. §126.6 Foreign-owned military aircraft and naval vessels, and the Foreign Military Sales program. (a) A license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not required if: (1)(i) The article or technical data to be exported was sold, leased, or loaned by the Department of Defense to a foreign country or international organization pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and (ii) The article or technical data was delivered to representatives of such a country or organization in the United States; and (iii) The article or technical data is to be exported from the United States on a military aircraft or naval vessel of that government or organization or via the Defense Transportation Service (DTS). (b) Foreign military aircraft and naval vessels. A license is not required for the entry into the United States of military aircraft or naval vessels of any foreign state if no overhaul, repair, or modification of the aircraft or naval vessel is to be performed. However, Department of State approval for overflight (pursuant to the 49 U.S.C. 1508) and naval visits must be obtained from the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, Office of International Security Operations. (c ) Procedures for the Foreign Military Sales Program. (1) District Directors of Customs are authorized to permit the export and temporary import of classified and unclassified defense articles, defense services and technical data without a license if the articles or technical data were sold, leased or loaned by the U.S. Department of Defense to foreign governments or international organizations under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program of the Arms Export Control Act. This procedure may be used only if a proposed export is: (i) Pursuant to an executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513); and (ii) Accompanied by a properly executed DSP-94, or in the case of a classified shipment, an approved Letter of Offer and Acceptance; and (iii) Made by the relevant foreign diplomatic mission of the purchasing country or its authorized freight forwarder, provided that the freight forwarder is registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls pursuant to part 122 of this subchapter, and, if classified defense articles or technical data are involved, has the requisite U.S. Government security clearance and a transportation plan has been approved as in §126.6(a)(1), above and the defense articles or technical data are shipped in compliance with the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. (2) Filing and documents. (i) The original copy of completed Form DSP-94, together with one copy of the corresponding authenticated DD Form 1513 and a Shipper's Export Declaration, must be filed with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit prior to actual shipment. An executed DD Form 1513 is one which has been signed by: (A) an authorized Department of Defense representative and countersigned by the Comptroller, Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA); and (B) by an authorized representative of the foreign government. (ii) SED or Outbound Manifest. The Shipper's Export Declaration or, if authorized, the outbound manifest, must be annotated as follows: This shipment is being exported under the authority of Department of State Form DSP-94. It covers FMS Case (case identification), expiration date _________. 22 CFR 126.6 applicable.

Licenses or approvals shall be denied or revoked whenever required by any statute of the United States (see 127.6 and 127.10 of this subchapter). Any application for an export license or other approval under this subchapter may be disapproved, and any license or other approval or exemption granted under this subchapter may be revoked, suspended, or amended without prior notice whenever: (1) The Department of State deems such action to be in furtherance of world peace, the national security or the foreign policy of the United States, or is otherwise advisable; or (2) The Department of State believes that 22 U.S.C. 2778, any regulation contained in this subchapter, or the terms of any U.S. Government export authorization (including the terms of a manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement, or export authorization granted pursuant to the Export Administration Act, as amended) has been violated by any party to the export or other person having significant interest in the transaction; or (3) An applicant is the subject of an indictment for a violation of any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in §120.27 of this subchapter; or (4) An applicant or any party to the export or the agreement has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in §120.27 of this subchapter; or (5) An applicant is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other authorization to import defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the U.S. Government; or (6) An applicant, any party to the export or agreement, any source or manufacturer of the defense article or defense service or any person who has a significant interest in the transaction has been debarred, suspended, or otherwise is ineligible to receive an export license or other authorization from any agency of the U.S. government (e.g., pursuant to debarment by the Department of Commerce under 15 CFR part 388 or by the Department of State under part 127 or 128 of this subchapter); or (7) An applicant has failed to include any of the information or documentation expressly required to support a license application or other request for approval under this subchapter or as required in the instructions in the applicable Department of State form; or (8) An applicant is subject to sanctions under other relevant U.S. laws (e.g., the Missile Technology Controls title of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991 (Pub. L. 101-510); the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-182); or the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-484)). (b) Notification. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify applicants or licensees or other appropriate United States persons of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The reasons for the action will be stated as specifically as security and foreign policy considerations permit. (c ) Reconsideration. If a written request for reconsideration of an adverse decision is made within 30 days after a person has been informed of the decision, the U.S. person will be accorded an opportunity to present additional information. The case will then be reviewed by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (d) Reconsideration of certain applications. Applications for licenses or other requests for approval denied for repeated failure to provide information or documentation expressly required will normally not be reconsidered during the thirty day period following denial. They will be reconsidered after this period only after a final decision is made on whether the applicant will be subject to an administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this subchapter. Any request for reconsideration shall be accompanied by a letter explaining the steps that have been taken to correct the failure and to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter. (e) Special definition. For purposes of this section, the term party to the export means: (1) The chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers and officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) and any member of the board of directors of the applicant; (2) The freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the applicant; and (3) Any consignee or end-user of any item to be exported. §126.8 Proposals to foreign persons relating to significant military equipment. (a) Certain proposals to foreign persons for the sale or manufacture abroad of significant military equipment require either the prior approval of, or prior notification to, the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (1) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior approval requirement. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or presentation designed to constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any foreign person to purchase significant military equipment on the U.S. Munitions List whenever all the following conditions are met: (i) The value of the significant military equipment to be sold is $14,000,000 or more; and (ii) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any foreign country other than a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan; and (iii) The sale would involve the export from the United States of any defense article or the furnishing abroad of any defense service including technical data; and (iv) The identical significant military equipment has not been previously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale under the Foreign Military Sales Program of the Department of Defense, to any foreign country. (2) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior notification requirement. The Office Defense Trade Controls must be notified in writing at least thirty days in advance of any proposal or presentation concerning the sale of significant military equipment whenever the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section are met and the identical equipment has been previously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale under the FMS Program to any foreign country. (3) Manufacture abroad of significant military equipment: Prior approval requirement. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or presentation designed to constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any foreign person to enter into any manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement for the production or assembly of significant military equipment, regardless of dollar value, in any foreign country, whenever: (i) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any foreign country; and (ii) The agreement would involve the export from the United States of any defense article or the furnishing abroad of any defense service including technical data. (b) Definition of proposal or presentation. The terms proposal or presentation (designed to constitute a basis for a decision to purchase and to enter into any agreement) mean the communication of information in sufficient detail that the person communicating that information knows or should know that it would permit an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into the manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. For example, a presentation which describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery would require prior notification or approval, as appropriate, where the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section are met. By contrast, the following would not require prior notification or approval: Advertising or other reporting in a publication of general circulation; preliminary discussions to ascertain market potential; or merely calling attention to the fact that a company manufactures a particular item of significant military equipment. (c ) Satisfaction of requirements. (1) The requirement of this section for prior approval is met by any of the following: (i) A written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controls approving the proposed sale or agreement or approving the making of a proposal or presentation. (ii) A license issued under §125.2 or §125.3 of this subchapter for the export of technical data relating to the proposed sale or agreement to the country concerned. (iii) A temporary export license issued under §123.5 of this subchapter relating to the proposed sale or agreement for a demonstration to the armed forces of the country of export. (iv) With respect to manufacturing license agreements or technical assistance agreements, the application for export licenses pursuant to the two preceding subparagraphs must state that they are related to possible agreements of this kind. (2) The requirement of this section for prior notification is met by informing the Office of Defense Trade Controls by letter at least 30 days before making the proposal or presentation. The letter must comply with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and must identify the relevant license, approval, or FMS case by which the identical equipment had previously been authorized for permanent export or sale. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide written acknowledgment of such prior notification to confirm compliance with this requirement and the commencement of the 30-day notification period. (d) Procedures. Unless a license has been obtained pursuant to §126.8(c)(1) (ii) or (iii), a request for prior approval to make a proposal or presentation with respect to significant military equipment, or a 30-day prior notification regarding the sale of such equipment, must be made by letter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The letter must outline in detail the intended transaction, including usage of the equipment involved and the country (or countries) involved. Seven copies of the letter should be provided as well as seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning the equipment. (e) Statement to accompany licensing requests. (1) Every application for an export license or other approval to implement a sale or agreement which meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section must be accompanied by a statement from the applicant which either: (i) Refers to a specific notification made or approval previously granted with respect to the transaction; or (ii) Certifies that no proposal or presentation requiring prior notification or approval has been made. (2) The Department of State may require a similar statement from the Foreign Military Sales contractor concerned in any case where the United States Government receives a request for a letter of offer for a sale which meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. (f) Penalties. In addition to other remedies and penalties prescribed by law or this subchapter, a failure to satisfy the prior approval or prior notification requirements of this section may be considered to be a reason for disapproval of a license, agreement or sale under the FMS program. (g) License for technical data. Nothing in this section constitutes or is to be construed as an exemption from the licensing requirement for the export of technical data that is embodied in any proposal or presentation made to any foreign persons. §126.9 Advisory opinions. Any person desiring information as to whether the Office of Defense Trade Controls would be likely to grant a license or other approval for the export of a particular defense article or defense service to a particular country may request an advisory opinion from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These opinions are not binding on the Department of State and are revocable. A request for an advisory opinion must be made in writing and must outline in detail the equipment, its usage, the security classification (if any) of the articles or related technical data, and the country or countries involved. An original and seven copies of the letter must be provided along with seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning the defense article or defense service. §126.10 Disclosure of information. (a) Freedom of Information. Subchapter R of this title contains regulations on the availability to the public of information and records of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter R apply to such disclosures by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. (b) Determinations required by law. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) provides that certain information required by the Department of State in connection with the licensing process may generally not be disclosed to the public unless certain determinations relating to the national interest are made in accordance with the procedures specified by that provision. Determinations required by section 38(e) shall be made by the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs. (c ) Information required under part 130. Part 130 of this subchapter contains specific provisions on the disclosure of information described in that part. (d) National Interest Determinations. In accordance with section 38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(e)), the Secretary of State has determined that the following disclosures are in the national interest of the United States: (1) Furnishing information to foreign governments for law enforcement or regulatory purposes; and (2) Furnishing information to foreign governments and other agencies of the U.S. Government in the context of multilateral or bilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia Group, and COCOM). §126.11 Relations to other provisions of law. The provisions in this subchapter are in addition to, and are not in lieu of, any other provisions of law or regulations. The sale of firearms in the United States, for example, remains subject to the provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations administered by the Department of the Treasury. The performance of defense services on behalf of foreign governments by retired military personnel continues to require consent pursuant to Part 3a of this title. Persons who intend to export defense articles or furnish defense services should consequently not assume that satisfying the requirements of this subchapter relieves one of other requirements of law. §126.12 Continuation in force. All determinations, authorizations, licenses, approvals of contracts and agreements and other action issued, authorized, undertaken, or entered into by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, or under the previous provisions of this subchapter, continue in full force and effect until or unless modified, revoked or superseded by the Department of State. §126.13 Required information. (a) All applications for licenses (DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85), all requests for approval of agreements and amendments thereto under part 124 of this subchapter, all requests for other written authorizations, and all 30-day prior notifications of sales of significant military equipment under 126.8(c ) must include a letter signed by a responsible official empowered by the applicant and addressed to the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, stating whether: (1) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is the subject of an indictment for or has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in §120.27 of this subchapter since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976); (2) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. Government; (3) To the best of the applicant's knowledge, any party to the export as defined in §126.7(e) has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in §120.27 of this subchapter since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976), or is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from any agency of the U.S. government; and (4) The natural person signing the application, notification or other request for approval (including the statement required by this subsection) is a citizen or national of the United States, has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence (and maintains such a residence) under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101(a), section 101(a)20, 60 Stat. 163), or is an official of a foreign government entity in the United States. (b) In addition, all applications for licenses must include, on the application or an addendum sheet, the complete names and addresses of all U.S. consignors and freight forwarders, and all foreign consignees and foreign intermediate consignees involved in the transaction. If there are multiple consignors, consignees or freight forwarders, and all the required information cannot be included on the application form, an addendum sheet and seven copies containing this information must be provided. The addendum sheet must be marked at the top as follows: ``Attachment to Department of State License From (insert DSP-5, 61, 73, or 85, as appropriate) for Export of (insert commodity) valued at (insert U.S. dollar amount) to (insert country of ultimate destination).'' The Office of Defense Trade Controls will impress one copy of the addendum sheet with the Department of State seal and return it to the applicant with each license. The sealed addendum sheet must remain attached to the license as an integral part thereof. District Directors of Customs and Department of Defense transmittal authorities will permit only those U.S. consignors or freight forwarders listed on the license or sealed addendum sheet to make shipments under the license, and only to those foreign consignees named on the documents. Applicants should list all freight forwarders who may be involved with shipments under the license to ensure that the list is complete and to avoid the need for amendments to the list after the license has been approved. If there are unusual or extraordinary circumstances that preclude the specific identification of all the U.S. consignors and freight forwarders and all foreign consignees, the applicant must provide a letter of explanation with each application. (c ) In cases when foreign nationals are employed at or assigned to security-cleared facilities, provision by the applicant of a Technology Control Plan (available from the Defense Investigative Service) will facilitate processing.

All persons abroad subject to U.S. jurisdiction who obtain temporary custody of a defense article exported from the United States or produced under an agreement described in part 124 of this subchapter, and irrespective of the number of intermediate transfers, are bound by the regulations of this subchapter in the same manner and to the same extent as the original owner or transferer. (c ) A person with knowledge that another person is then ineligible pursuant to Secs. 120.1(c ) of this subchapter or 126.7 of this chapter, is then subject to an order of debarment, or interim suspension, may not, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, without prior disclosure of the facts to, and written authorization from, the Office of Defense Trade Controls: (1) Apply for, obtain, or use any export control document as defined in § 127.2(b) for such debarred, suspended, or ineligible person; or (2) Order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of, forward, transport, finance, or otherwise service or participate in any transaction which may involve any defense article or the furnishing of any defense service for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter for export, where such debarred, suspended, or ineligible person may obtain any benefit therefrom or have any direct or indirect interest therein. (d) No person may willfully cause, or aid, abet, counsel, demand, induce, procure or permit the commission of any act prohibited by, or the omission of any act required by 22 U.S.C. 2778, 22 U.S.C. 2779, or any regulation, license, approval, or order issued thereunder. §127.2 Misrepresentation and omission of facts. (a) It is unlawful to use any export or temporary import control document containing a false statement or misrepresenting or omitting a material fact for the purpose of exporting any defense article or technical data or the furnishing of any defense service for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter. Any false statement, misrepresentation, or omission of material fact in an export or temporary import control document will be considered as made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001, 22 U.S.C. 2778 and 22 U.S.C. 2779.

Any person who willfully: (a) Violates any provision of section 38 or section 39 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2779), or any undertaking specifically required by part 124 of this subchapter; or (b) In a registration, license application or report required by section 38 or section 39 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2278 and 2779) or by any rule or regulation issued under either section, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine or imprisonment, or both, as prescribed by 22 U.S.C. 2778(c). §127.4 Authority of U.S. Customs Service officers. (a) U.S. Customs Service officers may take appropriate action to ensure observance of this subchapter as to the export or the attempted export of any defense article or technical data, including the inspection of loading or unloading of any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft. This applies whether the export is authorized by license or by written approval issued under this subchapter. (b) U.S. Customs Service officers have the authority to investigate, detain or seize any export or attempted export of defense articles or technical data contrary to this subchapter. (c ) Upon the presentation to a Customs Officer of a license or written approval authorizing the export of any defense article, the customs officer may require the production of other relevant documents and information relating to the proposed export. This includes an invoice, order, packing list, shipping document, correspondence, instructions, and the documents otherwise required by the U.S. Customs Service. §127.5 Authority of the Defense Investigative Service. In the case of exports involving classified technical data or defense articles, the Defense Investigative Service may take appropriate action to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. Upon a request to the Defense Investigative Service regarding the export of any classified defense article or technical data, the Defense Investigative Service official or a designated government transmittal authority may require the production of other relevant documents and information relating to the proposed export. §127.6 Seizure and forfeiture in attempts at illegal exports. (a) An attempt to export from the United States any defense articles in violation of the provisions of this subchapter constitutes an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. Whenever it is known or there is probable cause to believe that any defense article is intended to be or is being or has been exported or removed from the United States in violation of law, such article and any vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in such attempt is subject to seizure, forfeiture and disposition as provided in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. (b) Similarly, an attempt to violate any of the conditions under which a temporary export or temporary import license was issued pursuant to this subchapter or to violate the requirements of 123.2 of this subchapter also constitutes an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code, and such article, together with any vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in any such attempt is subject to seizure, forfeiture, and disposition as provided in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. §127.7 Debarment. (a) In implementing section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs may prohibit any person from participating directly or indirectly in the export of defense articles, including technical data or in the furnishing of defense services for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter for any of the reasons listed below. Any such prohibition is referred to as a debarment for purposes of this subchapter. The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs shall determine the appropriate period of time for debarment, which shall generally be for a period of three years. (b) Grounds. (1) The basis for a statutory debarment, as described in paragraph (c ) of this section, is any conviction for violating the Arms Export Control Act (see §127.3 of this subchapter) or any conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act. (2) The basis for administrative debarment, described in part 128 of this subchapter, is any violation of 22 U.S.C. 2778 or any rule or regulation issued thereunder when such a violation is of such a character as to provide a reasonable basis for the Office of Defense Trade Controls to believe that the violator cannot be relied upon to comply with the statute or these rules or regulations in the future, and when such violation is established in accordance with part 128 of this subchapter. (c ) Statutory Debarment. Section 38(g)(4) of the Arms Export Control Act prohibits the issuance of licenses to persons who have been convicted of violating the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.27 of this subchapter. Discretionary authority to issue licenses is provided, but only if certain statutory requirements are met. It is the policy of the Department of State not to consider applications for licenses or requests for approvals involving any person who has been convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act or convicted of conspiracy to violate that Act for a three year period following conviction. Such individuals shall be notified in writing that they are debarred pursuant to this policy. A list of persons who have been convicted of such offenses and debarred for this reason shall be published periodically in the Federal Register. Debarment in such cases is based solely upon the outcome of a criminal proceeding, conducted by a court of the United States, that established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with due process. The procedures of part 128 of this subchapter are not applicable in such cases. (d) Appeals. Any person who is ineligible pursuant to paragraph (c ) of this section may appeal to the Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs for reconsideration of the ineligibility determination. The procedures specified in §128.13 of this subchapter are applicable in such appeals. §127.8 Interim suspension. (a) The Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is authorized to order the interim suspension of any person when the Director believes that grounds for debarment (as defined in §127.6 of this part) exist and where and to the extent the Director finds that interim suspension is reasonably necessary to protect world peace or the security or foreign policy of the United States. The interim suspension orders prohibit that person from participating directly or indirectly in the export of any defense article or defense service for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter. The suspended person shall be notified in writing as provided in §127.6(c ) of this part (statutory debarment) or §128.3 of this subchapter (administrative debarment), whichever is appropriate. In both cases, a copy of the interim suspension order will be served upon that person in the same manner as provided in §128.3 of this subchapter. The interim suspension order may be made immediately effective, without prior notice. The order will state the relevant facts, the grounds for issuance of the order, and describe the nature and duration of the interim suspension. No person may be suspended for a period exceeding 60 days unless proceedings under §127.6(c ) of this part or under part 128 of this subchapter, or criminal proceedings, are initiated before the expiration of that period. (b) A motion or petition to vacate or modify an interim suspension order may be filed at any time with the Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs. After a final decision is reached, the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls will issue an appropriate order disposing of the motion or petition and will promptly inform the respondent accordingly. §127.9 Applicability of orders. For the purpose of preventing evasion, orders of the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, debarring a person under §127.6 and orders of the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, suspending a person under §127.7 may be made applicable to any other person who may then or thereafter (during the term of the order) be related to the debarred person by affiliation, ownership, control, position of responsibility, or other commercial connection. Appropriate notice and opportunity to respond to charges will be given. §127.10 Civil penalty. (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, Department of State, is authorized to impose a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed that authorized by 50 U.S.C. App. 2410(c ) for each violation of 22 U.S.C. 2778, or any regulation, order, license or approval issued thereunder. This civil penalty may be either in addition to, or in lieu of, any other liability or penalty which may be imposed. (b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may make: (1) The payment of a civil penalty under this section or (2) The completion of any administrative action pursuant to this part 127 or 128 of this subchapter a prior condition for the issuance, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license or other approval. §127.11 Past violations. (a) Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, licenses or other approvals may not be granted to persons who have been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of this subchapter or who are ineligible to receive any export licenses from any agency of the U.S. government, subject to a narrowly defined statutory exception. This provision establishes a presumption of denial for licenses or other approvals involving such persons. This presumption is applied by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to all persons convicted or deemed ineligible in this manner since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act (Pub. L. 94-329; 90 Stat. 729) (June 30, 1976). (b) Policy. An exception to the policy of the Department of State to deny applications for licenses or other approvals that involve persons described in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be considered unless there are extraordinary circumstances surrounding the conviction or ineligibility to export, and only if the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, that the applicant has taken appropriate steps to mitigate any law enforcement and other legitimate concerns, and to deal with the causes that resulted in the conviction, ineligibility, or debarment. Any person described in paragraph (a) of this section who wishes to request consideration of any application must explain, in a letter to the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, the reasons why the application should be considered. If the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs concludes that the application and written explanation have sufficient merit, it shall consult with the Office of the Legal Adviser and the Department of the Treasury regarding law enforcement concerns, and may also request the views of other departments, including the Department of Justice. If the Office of Defense Trade Controls does grant the license or other approval, subsequent applications from the same person need not repeat the information previously provided but should instead refer to the favorable decision. (c ) Debarred persons. Persons debarred pursuant to § 127.6(c ) (statutory debarment) may not utilize the procedures provided by this section while the debarment is in force. Such persons may utilize only the procedures provided by §127.7(d) of this part. §127.12 Voluntary disclosures. (a) General policy. The Department strongly encourages the disclosure of information to the Office of Defense Trade Controls by persons, firms or any organization that believe they may have violated any export control provision of the Arms Export Control Act, or any regulations, order, license, or other authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act. Voluntary self-disclosure may be considered a mitigating factor in determining the administrative penalties, if any, that should be imposed by the Department. Failure to report such violation(s) may result in circumstances detrimental to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. (b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 128 of this subchapter concerning violation(s) of the export control provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and these regulations. (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is received by the Office of Defense Trade Controls for review prior to such time that either the Department of State or any other agency, bureau or department of the United States Government obtains knowledge of either the same or substantially similar information from another source and commenced an investigation or inquiry that involves that information, and that is intended to determine whether the Arms Export Control Act or these regulations, or any other license, order or other authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act has been violated. (3) It is possible that the activity in question -- despite voluntary disclosure -- might merit penalties, administrative actions, sanctions, or referrals to the Department of Justice for consideration as to whether criminal prosecution is warranted. In the latter case, the Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary nature of the disclosure although the Department of Justice is not required to give that fact any weight. The Office of Defense Trade Controls has the sole discretion to consider whether ``voluntary disclosure,'' in context with other relevant information in a particular case, should be a mitigating factor in determining what, if any, administrative action will be imposed. Some of the mitigating factors the Office of Defense Trade Controls may consider are: (i) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper application been made; (ii) Why the violation(s) occurred; (iii) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation; (iv) Whether the person or firm has instituted or improved an internal compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violation(s); (v) Whether the person making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management. (If not, then a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure as covered in this section.) (4) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on, to create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter. (c ) Notification. (1) Any person or firm wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls as soon as possible after violation(s) are discovered and then conduct a thorough review of all export-related transactions where violation(s) are suspected. (2) Notification of violation(s) must be in writing and should include the following information: (i) A precise description of the nature and extent of the violation(s) (e.g., an unauthorized shipment, doing business with a party denied U.S. export privileges, etc.); (ii) The exact circumstances surrounding the violation(s) (a thorough explanation of why, when, where, and how the violation(s) occurred); (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violation(s); (iv) Export license numbers, if applicable; (v) U.S. Defense Trade List category and subcategory, product descriptions, quantities, and characteristics of the commodities or technical data involved; (vi) A description of any corrective actions already undertaken; (vii) The name and address of the person(s) making the disclosure and a point of contact, if different, should further information be needed. (3) Factors to be considered include, for example, whether the violation(s) were intentional or inadvertent; the degree to which the person or firm responsible for the violation(s) making the disclosure was familiar with the laws and regulations; and whether the violator was the subject of prior administrative or criminal action under the AECA. In addition to immediately providing written notification, persons, firms, companies and organizations are strongly urged to conduct a thorough review of all export-related transactions where possible violation(s) are suspected. (d) Documentation. (1) The written disclosure should be accompanied by copies of those documents that substantiate it. Where appropriate, the documentation should include, but is not limited to: (i) Licensing documents (e.g., license applications, export licenses and end-user statements); (ii) Shipping documents (e.g., shipper's export declarations, airway bills and bills of lading); (iii) Any other relevant documents must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the Office of Defense Trade Controls requests them or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been made. (e) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. Certifications made by a firm, corporation or any other organization should be executed by someone with the authority to do so. (f) Oral presentations. It is generally not necessary to augment the written presentation with an oral presentation. However, if the person making the disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, a request for one should be included with the written presentation. (g) Voluntary disclosures should be sent to: Compliance Analysis Division, PM/DTC, SA-6, room 200, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602.

Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act. 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2780, 2791, and 2797); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311: 22 U.S.C. 2658; E.O. 12291, 46 FR 1981. §128.1 Exclusion of functions from the Administrative Procedure Act. The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to control the import and export of defense articles and services in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. It authorizes the Secretary of State to make decisions on whether license applications or other written requests for approval shall be granted, or whether exemptions may be used. It also authorizes the Secretary of State to revoke, suspend or amend licenses or other written approvals whenever the Secretary deems such action to be advisable. The administration of the Arms Export Control Act is a foreign affairs function and is thus encompassed within the meaning of the military and foreign affairs exclusion of the Administrative Procedure Act and is thereby expressly exempt from various provisions of that Act. Because the exercising of the foreign affairs function, including the decisions required to implement the Arms Export Control Act, is highly discretionary, it is excluded from review under the Administrative Procedure Act. §128.2 Administrative Law Judge The Administrative Law Judge referred to in this part is an Administrative Law Judge appointed by the Department of State or of the Department of Commerce, as provided in 15 CFR 788.2. The Administrative Law Judge is authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties provided for in Secs. 127.7, 127.8, and 128.3 through 128.16 of this subchapter. §128.3 Institution of administrative proceedings. (a) Charging letters. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Control, with the concurrence of the Office of the Legal Adviser, Department of State, may initiate proceedings to impose debarment or civil penalties in accordance with §127.7 or §127.10 of this subchapter respectively. Administrative proceedings shall be initiated by means of a charging letter. The charging letter will state the essential facts constituting the alleged violation and refer to the regulatory or other provisions involved. It will give notice that if the respondent to answer the charges with 30 days, as provided in §128.5(a), and indicate that a failure to answer will be taken as an admission of the truth of the charges. It will inform the respondent that he or she is entitled to an oral hearing if a written demand for one is filed with the answer or within 7 days after service of the answer. The respondent will also be informed that he or she may, if so desired, be represented by counsel of his or her choosing. Charging letters may be amended from time to time, upon reasonable notice. (b) Service. A charging letter is served upon a respondent: (1) If the respondent is a resident of the United States, when it is mailed postage prepaid in a wrapper addressed to the respondent at that person's last known address; or when left with the respondent or the agent or employee of the respondent; or when left at the respondent's dwelling with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing herein; or (2) If the respondent is a non-resident of the United States, when served upon the respondent by any of the foregoing means. If such methods of service are not practicable or appropriate, the charging letter may be tendered for service on the respondent to an official of the government of the country wherein the respondent resides, provided that there is an agreement or understanding between the United States Government and the government §128.4 Default. (a) Failure to answer. If the respondent fails to answer the charging letter, the respondent may be held in default. The case shall then be referred to the Administrative Law Judge for consideration in a manner as the Administrative Law Judge may consider appropriate. Any order issued shall have the same effect as an order issued following the disposition of contested charges. (b) Petition to set aside defaults. Upon showing good cause, any respondent against whom a default order has been issued may apply to set aside the default and vacate the order entered thereon. The petition shall be submitted to duplicate to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520. The Director will refer the petition to the Administrative Law Judge for consideration and a recommendation. The Administrative law Judge will consider the application and may order a hearing and require the respondent to submit further evidence in support of his or her petition. The filing of a petition to set aside a default does not in any manner affect an order entered upon default and such order continues in full force and effect unless a further order is made modifying or terminating it. §128.5 Answer and demand for oral hearing. (a) When to answer. The respondent is required to answer the charging letter within 30 days after service. (b) Contents of answer. An answer must be responsive to the charging letter. It must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's defense or defenses. In the answer, the respondent must admit or deny specifically each separate allegation of the charging letter, unless the respondent is without knowledge, in which case the respondent's answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as denial. Failure to deny or controvert any particular allegation will be deemed an admission thereof. The answer may set forth such additional or new matter as the respondent believes support a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set forth in an answer shall be deemed waived. Evidence offered thereon by the respondent at a hearing may be refused except upon good cause being shown. If the respondent does not demand an oral hearing, he or she shall transmit, within seven (7) days after the service of his or her answer, original or photocopies of all correspondence, papers, records, affidavits, and other documentary or written evidence having any bearing upon or connection with the matters in issue.

(a) Discovery by the respondent. The respondent, through the Administrative Law Judge, may request from the Office of Defense Trade Controls any relevant information, not privileged, that may be necessary or helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may provide any relevant information, not privileged, that may be necessary or helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may supply summaries in place or original documents and may withhold information from discovery if the interests of national security or foreign policy so require, or if necessary to comply with any statute, executive order or regulation requiring that the information may not be disclosed. The respondent may request the Administrative Law Judge to request any relevant information, books, records, or other evidence, from any other person or government agency so long as the request is reasonable in scope and not unduly burdensome. (b) Discovery by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The Office of Defense Trade Controls or the Administrative Law Judge may request from the respondent admissions of facts, answers to interrogatories, the production of books, records, or other relevant evidence, so long as the request is relevant and material, reasonable in scope, and not unduly burdensome.

If the respondent fails to respond with reasonable diligence to the requests for discovery by the Office of Defense Trade Controls or the Administrative Law Judge, on her or his own motion or motion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, and upon such notice to the respondent as the Administrative Law Judge may direct, may strike respondent's answer and declare the respondent in default, or make any other ruling which the Administrative Law Judge deems necessary and just under the circumstances. If a third party fails to respond to the request for information, the Administrative Law Judge shall consider whether the evidence sought is necessary to a fair hearing, and if it is so necessary that a fair hearing may not be held without it, the Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss the charges. §128.7 Prehearing conference. (a)(1) The Administrative Law Judge may, upon his own motion or upon motion of any party, request the parties or their counsel to a prehearing conference to consider: (i) Simplification of issues; (ii) The necessity of desirability of amendments to pleadings; (iii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof; or (iv) Such other matter as may expedite the disposition of the proceeding. (2) The Administrative Law Judge will prepare a summary of the action agreed upon or taken at the conference, and will incorporate therein any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties. (3) The conference proceedings may be recorded magnetically or taken by a reporter and transcribed, and filed with the Administrative Law Judge. (b) If a conference is impracticable , the Administrative Law Judge may request the parties to correspond with the person to achieve the purposes of a conference. The Administrative Law Judge shall prepare a summary of action taken as in the case of a conference. §128.8 Hearings. (a) A respondent who had not filed a timely written answer is not entitled to a hearing, and the case may be considered by the Administrative Law Judge as provided in Sec. 128.4(a). If any answer is filed, but no oral hearing demanded, the Administrative Law Judge may proceed to consider the case upon the written pleadings and evidence available. The Administrative Law Judge may provide for the making of the record in such manner as the Administrative Law Judge deems appropriate. If respondent answers and demands an oral hearing, the Administrative Law Judge, upon due notice, shall set the case for hearing, unless a respondent has raised in his answer no issues of material fact to be determined. If respondent fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, the hearing nevertheless may proceed in respondent's absence. The respondent's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceedings or action thereafter. (b) The Administrative Law Judge may administer oaths and affirmations. Respondent may be represented by counsel. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the Administrative Law Judge the proceeding will be taken by a reporter or by magnetic recording, transcribed, and filed with the Administrative Law Judge. Respondent may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy upon payment of proper costs. §128.9 Proceedings before and report of Presiding Official. (a) The Administrative Law Judge may conform any part of the proceedings before him or her to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The record may be made available in any other administrative or other proceeding involving the same respondent. (b) The Administrative Law Judge, after considering the record, will prepare a written report. The report will include findings of fact, findings of law, a finding whether a law or regulation has been violated, and the Administrative Law Judge's recommendations. It shall be transmitted to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, Department of State. §128.10 Disposition of proceedings. Where the evidence is not sufficient to support the charges, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls or the Administrative Law Judge will dismiss the charges. Where the Administrative Law Judge finds that a violation has been committed, the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation shall be advisory only. The Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs will review the record, consider the report of the Administrative Law Judge, and make an appropriate disposition of the case. The Director may issue an order debarring the respondent from participating in the export of defense articles or technical data or the furnishing of defense services as provided in Sec. 127.7 of this subchapter, impose a civil penalty as provided in Sec. 127.10 of this subchapter or take such action as the Administrative Law Judge deems appropriate. Any debarment order will be effective for the period of time specified therein and may contain such additional terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate. A copy of the order together with a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be served upon the respondent. § 128.11 Consent Agreements (a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls and the respondent may, by agreement, submit to the Administrative Law Judge a proposal for the issuance of a consent order. The Administrative Law Judge will review the facts of the case and the proposal and may conduct conferences with the parties and may require the presentation of evidence in the case. If the Administrative Law Judge does not approve the proposal, the Administrative Law Judge will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no consent proposal had been made. If the proposal is approved, the Administrative Law Judge will report the facts of the case along with recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. If the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs does not approve the proposal, the case will proceed as though no consent proposal had been made. If the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs approves the proposal, an appropriate order may be issued. (b) Cases may also be settled prior to service of a charging letter. In such an event, a proposed charging letter shall be prepared, and a consent agreement and order shall be submitted for the approval and signature of the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, and no action by the Administrative Law Judge shall be required. Cases which are settled may not be reopened or appealed. §128.12 Rehearings. The Administrative Law Judge may grant a rehearing or reopen a proceeding at any time for the purpose of hearing any relevant and material evidence which was not known or obtainable at the time of the original hearing. A report for rehearing or reopening must contain a summary of such evidence, and must explain the reasons why it could not have been presented at the original hearing. The Administrative Law Judge will inform the parties of any further hearing, and will conduct such hearing and submit a report and recommendations in the same manner as provided for the original proceeding (Described in Sec. 128.10). §128.13 Appeals. (a) Filing of appeals. An appeal must be in writing, and be addressed to and filed with the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520. An appeal from a final order denying export privileges or imposing civil penalties must be filed within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the order. If the Under Secretary cannot for any reason act on the appeal, he or she may designate another Department of State official to receive and act on the appeal. (b) Grounds and conditions for appeal. The respondent may appeal from the debarment or from the imposition of a civil penalty (except the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to a consent order pursuant to §128.11) upon the ground: (1) That the findings of a violation are not supported by any substantial evidence; (2) that a prejudicial error of law was committed: or (3) that the provisions of the order are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify upon which of these grounds the appeal is based and must indicate from which provisions of the order the appeal is taken. An appeal from an order issued upon default will not be entertained if the respondent has failed to seek relief as provided in §128.4(b). (c) Matters considered on appeal. An appeal will be considered upon the basis of the assembled record. This record consists of (but is not limited to) the charging letter, the respondent's answer, the transcript or magnetic recording of the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, the report of the Administrative Law Judge, the order of the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, and any other relevant documents involved in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge. The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs may direct a rehearing and reopening before the Administrative Law Judge if he or she finds that the record is insufficient or that new evidence is relevant and material to the issues and was not known and was not available to the respondent at the time of the original hearings. (d) Effect of appeals. The taking of an appeal will not stay the operation of any order. (e) Preparation of appeals.--(1) General requirements. An appeal shall be in letter form.

(f) Decisions. All appeals will be considered and decided within a reasonable time after they are filed. An appeal may be granted or denied in whole or in part, or dismissed at the request of the appellant. The decision of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs will be final. §128.14 Confidentiality of proceedings. Proceedings under this part are confidential. The documents referred to in Sec. 128.17 are not, however, deemed to be confidential. Reports of the Administrative Law Judge and copies of transcripts or recordings of hearings will be available to parties and, to the extent of their own testimony, to witnesses. All records are available to any U.S. Government agency showing a proper interest therein. §128.15 Orders containing probationary periods. (a) Revocation of probationary periods. A debarment or interim suspension order may set a probationary period during which the order may be held in abeyance for all or part of the debarment or suspension period, subject to the conditions stated therein. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may apply without notice to any person to be affected thereby, to the Administrative Law Judge for an order revoking probation when it appears that the conditions of the probation have been breached. The facts in support of the application will be presented to the Administrative Law Judge, who will report thereon and make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. The latter will make a determination whether to revoke probation and will issue an appropriate order. (b) Hearings--(1) Objections upon notice.

Any person adversely affected by an order revoking probation, without notice may request that the order be set aside by filing his objections thereto with the Administrative Law Judge. The request will not stay the effective date of the order or revocation. (3) Requirements for filing objections. Objections filed with the Administrative Law Judge must be submitted in writing and in duplicate. A copy must be simultaneously submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Denials and admissions, as well as any mitigating circumstances, which the person affected intends to present must be set forth in or accompany the letter of objection and must be supported by evidence. A request for an oral hearing may be made at the time of filing objections. (4) Determination. The application and objections thereto will be referred to the Administrative Law Judge. An oral hearing if requested, will be conducted at an early convenient date, unless the objections filed raise no issues of material fact to be determined. The Administrative Law Judge will report the facts and make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, who will determine whether the application should be granted or denied and will issue an appropriate order. A copy of the order and of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be furnished to any person affected thereby. (5) Effect of revocation on other actions. The revocation of a probationary period will not preclude any other action concerning a further violation, even where revocation is based on the further violation. §128.16 Extension of time.

The information required to be furnished pursuant to this paragraph must be so furnished no later than 30 days after the contract award to such supplier, or such earlier date as may be specified by the Department of Defense. For purposes of this paragraph, a contract award includes a purchase order, exercise of an option, or other procurement action requiring a supplier to furnish defense articles or defense services to the Department of Defense for the purposes of section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2762). (c ) In determining whether an applicant or its vendors, or a supplier or its vendors, as the case may be, have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more in respect of any sale so as to require a report under this section, there must be included in the computation of such aggregate amount any political contributions in respect of the sale which are paid by or on behalf of, or at the direction of, any person to whom the applicant, supplier or vendor has paid, or offered or agreed to pay, a fee or commission in respect of the sale. Any such political contributions are deemed for purposes of this part to be political contributions by the applicant, supplier or vendor who paid or offered or agreed to pay the fee or commission. (d) Any applicant or supplier which has informed the Office of Defense Trade Controls under this section that neither it nor its vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or commissions in an aggregate amount requiring the information specified in § 130.10 to be furnished, must subsequently furnish such information within 30 days after learning that it or its vendors had paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or commissions in respect of a sale in an aggregate amount which, if known to applicant or supplier at the time of its previous communication with the Office of Defense Trade Controls, would have required the furnishing of information under §130.10 at that time. Any report furnished under this paragraph must, in addition to the information specified in §130.10, include a detailed statement of the reasons why applicant or supplier did not furnish the information at the time specified in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable. §130.10 Information to be furnished by applicant or supplier to the Office of Defense Trade Controls.

(b) In responding to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the statement must: (1) With respect to each payment reported, state whether such payment was in cash or in kind. If in kind, it must include a description and valuation thereof. Where precise amounts are not available because a payment has not yet been made, an estimate of the amount offered or agreed to be paid must be provided; (2) With respect to each recipient, state: (i) Its name; (ii) Its nationality; (iii) Its address and principal place of business; (iv) Its employer and title; and (v) Its relationship, if any, to applicant, supplier, or vendor, and to any foreign purchaser or end-user. (c ) In submitting a report required by §130.9, the detailed information specified in paragraph (a)(4) and (b) of this section need not be included if the payments do not exceed: (1) $2,500 in the case of political contributions; and (2) $50,000 in the case of fees or commissions.

(d) Every person required to furnish the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must respond fully to each subdivision of those paragraphs and, where the correct response is none or not applicable,'' must so state. §130.11 Supplementary reports. (a) Every applicant or supplier who is required under §130.9 to furnish the information specified in 130.10 must submit a supplementary report in connection with each sale in respect of which applicant or supplier has previously been required to furnish information if: (1) Any political contributions aggregating $2,500 or more or fees or commissions aggregating $50,000 or more not previously reported or paid, or offered or agreed to be paid by applicant or supplier or any vendor; (2) Subsequent developments cause the information initially reported to be no longer accurate or complete (as in the case where a payment actually made is substantially different in amount from a previously reported estimate of an amount offered or agreed to be paid); or (3) Additional details are requested by the Office of Defense Trade Controls with respect to any miscellaneous payments reported under §130.10(c). (b) Supplementary reports must be sent to the Office of Defense Trade Controls within 30 days after the payment, offer or agreement reported therein or, when requested by the Office of Defense Trade Controls, within 30 days after such request, and must include: (1) Any information specified in §130.10 required or requested to be reported and which was not previously reported; and (2) The Defense Trade Control license number, if any, and the Department or Defense contract number, if any, related to the sale. §130.12 Information to be furnished by vendor to applicant or supplier. (a) In order to determine whether it is obliged under §130.9 to furnish the information specified in §130.10 with respect to a sale, every applicant or supplier must obtain from each vendor, from or through whom the applicant acquired defense articles or defense services forming the whole or a part of the sale, a full disclosure by the vendor of all political contributions or fees or commission paid, by vendor with respect to such sale. Such disclosure must include responses to all the information pertaining to vendor required to enable applicant or supplier, as the case may be, to comply fully with Secs.130.9 and 130.10. If so required, they must include the information furnished by each vendor in providing the information specified. (b) Any vendor which has been requested by an applicant or supplier to furnish an initial statement under paragraph (a) of this section must, except as provided in paragraph (c ) of this section, furnish such statement in a timely manner and not later than 20 days after receipt of such request. (c ) If the vendor believes that furnishing information to an applicant or supplier in a requested statement would unreasonably risk injury to the vendor's commercial interests, the vendor may furnish in lieu of the statement an abbreviated statement disclosing only the aggregate amount of all political contributions and the aggregate amount of all fees or commissions which have been paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by the vendor with respect to the sale. Any abbreviated statement furnished to an applicant or supplier under this paragraph must be accompanied by a certification that the requested information has been reported by the vendor directly to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The vendor must simultaneously report fully to the Office of Defense Trade Controls all information which the vendor would otherwise have been required to report to the applicant or supplier under this section. Each such report must clearly identify the sale with respect to which the reported information pertains. (d)(1) If upon the 25th day after the date of its request to vendor, an applicant or supplier has not received from the vendor the initial statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or supplier must submit to the Office of Defense Trade Controls a signed statement attesting to: (i) The manner and extent of applicant's or supplier's attempt to obtain from the vendor the initial statement required under paragraph (a) of this section; (ii) Vendor's failure to comply with this section; and (iii) The amount of time which has elapsed between the date of applicant's or supplier's request and the date of the signed statement; (2) The failure of a vendor to comply with this section does not relieve any applicant or supplier otherwise required by 130.9 to submit a report to the Office of Defense Trade Controls from submitting such a report. §130.13 Information to be furnished to applicant, supplier or vendor by a recipient of a fee or commission. (a) Every applicant or supplier, and each vendor thereof; (1) In order to determine whether it is obliged under §130.9 or §130.12 to furnish information specified in §130.10 with respect to a sale; and (2) Prior to furnishing such information, must obtain from each person, if any, to whom it has paid, or offered or agreed to pay, a fee or commission in respect of such sale, a timely statement containing a full disclosure by such a person of all political contributions paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by it or on its behalf, or at its direction, in respect of such sale. Such disclosure must include responses to all the information required to enable the applicant, supplier or vendor, as the case may be, to comply fully with Secs. 130.9, 130.10, and 130.12. (b) In obtaining information under paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant, supplier or vendor, as the case may be, must also require each person to whom a fee or commission is paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, to furnish from time to time such reports of its political contributions as may be necessary to enable the applicant, supplier or vendor, as the case may be, to comply fully with Secs. 130.9, 130.10, 130.11, and 130.12. (c ) The applicant supplier or vendor, as the case may be, must include any political contributions paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by or on behalf of, or at the direction of, any person to whom it has paid, or offered or agreed to pay a fee or commission in determining whether applicant, supplier or vendor is required by Secs. 130.9, 130.11, and 130.12 to furnish information specified in §130.10. §130.14 Recordkeeping. Each applicant, supplier and vendor must maintain a record of any information it was required to furnish or obtain under this part and all records upon which its reports are based for a period of not less than five years following the date of the report to which they pertain. §130.15 Confidential business information. (a) Any person who is required to furnish information under this part may identify any information furnished hereunder which the person considers to be confidential business information. No person, including any applicant or supplier, shall publish, divulge, disclose, or make known in any manner, any information so identified by a vendor or other person unless authorized by law or regulation. (b) For purposes of this section, confidential business information means commercial or financial information which by law is entitled to protection from disclosure. (See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (3) and (4); 18 U.S.C. 1905; 22 U.S.C. 2778(e); Rule 26(c)(7), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.) §130.16 Other reporting requirements. The submission of reports under this part does not relieve any person of any requirements to furnish information to any federal, state, or municipal agency, department or other instrumentality as required by law, regulation or contract. §130.17 Utilization of and access to reports and records. (a) All information reported and records maintained under this part will be made available, upon request for utilization by standing committees of the Congress and subcommittees thereof, and by United States Government agencies, in accordance with section 39(d) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2779(d)), and reports based upon such information will be submitted to Congress in accordance with sections 36(a)(8) and 36(b)(1) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 2776 (a)(8) and (b)(1)). (b) All confidential business information provided pursuant to this part shall be protected against disclosure to the extent provided by law. (c ) Nothing in this section shall preclude the furnishing of information to foreign governments for law enforcement or regulatory purposes under international arrangements between the United States and any foreign government.

Hopefully, your level of relief coincides with mylevel of exhilaration at taking on a new challenge -- one thatpromises new directions for the company. I hope to provide youwith new insights and perspectives in addressing licensing andother concerns. After 32 years of government service, I am ready for theexciting challenge of the private sector and the possibilitiestherein. I feel fortunate to be a part of CSL and work with somany leading-edge companies. My first priority in this period of transition is to establishthe ties with you that I am sure will develop into a long andfruitful business relationship. I have enjoyed conversing withyou and I look forward to playing an important role in furtheringyour export interests. The timing of CSL’s annual seminar couldn’t bebetter. It will enable me to meet many of you first-hand and giveus the opportunity to discuss mutual concerns in a constructiveand relaxed fashion. In the meantime, all of us at CSL lookforward to doing whatever we can to assist you. Please do nothesitate to call. Executive Notes EAR UPDATE The Bureau of Export Administration will publish a notice (in thenext few weeks) in the Federal Register extending the deadlinefor compliance with the new EAR to December 31, 1996. Inaddition, BXA will publish a notice debundling the LST exception:if using LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, CTP write that abbreviation on theShipper’s Export Declaration instead of LST. Also, thesub-abbreviations (such as PTS for spare parts under the categoryRPL replacement spare parts) are eliminated. 22 CFR 126.1 CHANGES . . . AGAIN! The State Department issued the official notice on August 12removing the Ukraine from the list of proscribed destinationslisted at 22 CFR 126.1(a). Now applications for the Ukraine willbe reviewed on a case-by-case basis. SLOVENIA MAY BE ADDED TO FIRST-TIER LIST Secretary of Defense William Perry may show support for includingSlovenia in the first tier of nations to be eligible for NATOexpansion. NATO expansion will be discussed at the next meetingof NATO participants in December. ENCRYPTION WEEK Several industry associations joined forces to sponsor"CRYPTO-ACTION WEEK," September 3-10, 1996, to mobilizesupport in favor of the liberalization of national encryptionpolicy. The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), ElectronicFreedom Foundation (EFF), the Electronic Privacy InformationCenter (EPIC) and Wired Magazine encourage participation in twoways: sign the petition at http://www.crypto.com/ petition, andmake an appointment with a congressperson’s local office todiscuss the issue. These groups hope to put pressure on the Houseand Senate to bring cryptography bills to the floor: theBurns/Leahy Pro-CODE bill awaits a vote by the Senate CommerceCommittee; and, the Goodlate bill, HR 3011, awaits a hearing bythe House Judiciary Committee. The Clinton Administration opposesboth bills. CLINTON MAY REVERSE POLICY ON SOUTH AMERICA According to the Dallas Morning News and The Washington PostPresident Clinton may reverse the US policy on the sale ofadvanced weapons to South America in order to gain votes. Thesale of Lockheed- Martin-made F-16s to Chile and Brazil couldcreate thousands of jobs and increase Clinton’s popularityin Texas. Chile wants to buy 20-odd fighters and Brazil may be inthe market for up to 150. 200 export sales translates to $4billion in exports and 4,000 jobs. South American policy is a hot issue in the Administration andhas been under internal debate for many months. Also, arms policytowards South America may become a campaign issue: the relaxationof controls is part of the Republican platform. International opinions on the proposed change are mixed.Brazil, Chile and Peru strongly favor the proposed new policy.Argentina, on the other hand, urged the administration not tochange the policy as it would lead to an arms race in the region. The current policy debate may prevent US firms from competingin Brazil’s fighter contest, possibly worth $5.2 billion for72 aircraft. Brazil is interested in F-16 and Navy F/A-18fighters, but it is unclear whether Clinton will allow the sale.It is quickly becoming a policy test case. The issue of sales to Peru is a fiery topic considering itsrecent border conflict with Ecuador. US negotiators are trying toresolve the dispute and do not want to alienate either side withthe arms issue. Last month Defense Secretary William Perry urged to Clinton toend the ban, but Secretary of State, Warren Christopher said theban is necessary because of regional instability. Indeed,Christopher hopes to broach restraint in conventional arms salesto Latin America through the Wassenaar Arrangement. 1995 ARMS SALES TOTALS SURPRISE The total of world arms sales fell in 1995 to $28.8 billion,the lowest level since the Cold War. Russia’s total salestopped $9 billion, a sharp increase from the $3.8 billion totalin 1994. China accounted for the majority of purchases, acquiringS7-27 fighter planes and Kilo-class attack submarines. The UStotal was $8.2 billion, down from $12.8 billion in 1994.France’s total also declined sharply from $8.9 billion in1994 to $3.8 billion in 1995. For the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union,Russia sold more arms to developing countries last year than anyother supplier, with a commitment for $6 billion worth ofmunitions items. However, Russia’s willingness to useincentives and offsets may lead to long-term problems. Accordingto Defense News, the high level of technology transferred, andthe skill-level of the purchasing countries (China, India, etc.)will probably lead to those countries manufacturing theequipment. The US Government came in second, with $3.789 billion andFrance, third with $2.4 billion. These totals include allgovernment transfers to countries excluding the US, Russia,nations of the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and NewZealand. IRAN LIBYA SANCTIONS CONTROVERSY CONTINUES Nations around the would condemned the US for the Iran LibyaOil Sanctions Act, the new law penalizing firms that invest inthe energy sectors of Iran and Libya. The EU and other groupsdenounced the measure as violation of world trade law, as it isthird party application of US law. The EU is preparingretributive sanctions to counter the US ones. The measure is designed to punish Iran and Libya for thesupport of terrorism. Iran denounced the measure as the act of a "slave"of Israel. Direct trade between the US and both Iran and Libya isalready prohibited by law. Turkey recently signed a $23 billion gas development deal withIran that may be subject to the sanctions. Under the 23 yeardeal, a pipeline would be built to supply Turkey with oil. Turkeyclaims the deal is not an investment in the energy sector,instead a simple purchase, and therefore not subject to thesanctions. However, the deal will not help the US-Turkishrelationship, already shaky. France’s Total SA has a $600 million deal with Iran todevelop offshore oil sources. Total SA would be sanctioned underthe act with possible penalties including: banning executivesfrom the US, limiting US investment in the firms, and banning thecompany from all export transactions. Most nations have a trading relationship with Iran, but notLibya. SECURITY OF AIRFREIGHT CARGO by Peter O’Rorke The recent tragedy of TWA 800 has again thrown airlinesecurity arrangements into the spotlight. The media attention hasfocused on measures designed to check the luggage of passengers,but of course cargo represents just as significant a threat. Asexporters, we share a duty to maintain the most stringentsecurity arrangements possible will all air shipments. This meansthought must be given to all aspects of your purchasing,trucking, packing and international forwarding operations. Inmany companies these functions are separate, so it is up tomanagers and other executives to ensure that your company isvigilant throughout all these departments. Freight Security Hints: Become familiar with your US vendors. Learn about theirorganization. Tell them that the goods you are purchasing fromthem may be air freighted. If they are packing for export, makesure they do this in a secure area. Use reputable truckers who move the material quickly anddirectly . Avoid leaving your shipments with others, in truckerwarehouses, etc. Carefully inspect all material when received. If packed forexport, check for signs of tampering. If only a domestic pack, isthe packaging intact? When you repack for export or consolidatewith other items, ensure that this is done in a secure area towith controlled access. If you use a freight forwarder, ask them to prove to you thatyour material is in secure storage until it is delivered to theairline. Check them out! Drive out to their offices/warehousesand see how long you can wander around without being challenged. There has been effort by the FAA and airlines following theTWA crash to tighten up security. This involves the use ofexporter signed certificates that must be delivered to theairline with the cargo. Those are currently rather vague and mostof us in the industry believe that these forms will be replacedwith more detailed ones that show more information about theshipment. More to the point, however, is to remember that asigned form is no substitute for proper procedure, constantlyenforced, to ensure that the cargo you export does not containthe makings of another disaster. TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS CWC: DEADLINE LOOMS The Senate must consider the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)by September 15, 1996, and it is likely to reach the floor soonafter the Summer recess ends September 3. The CWC is almostuniversally supported -- by the Administration, the Joint Chiefs,the Commerce Department and the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation. Its few detractors include -- Sen. Jessie Helms(R-SC) and the Heritage Foundation -- who claim the regulationswill unfairly impact small businesses. If the CWC is ratified by 65 nations (60 have done so to date)it will enter into force. Six months after the 65th nationratifies, the CWC will require companies to register with theirrespective governments if they manufacture chemical weaponsagents or precursors. There is a three-tiered schedule ofcompliance according to the strength and type of the chemicalagents. Companies must register and they may be subject tointernational inspections. In the US, these regulations will beadministered by the Commerce Department. Most experts predict the CWC will have little impact on USbusinesses. In fact, it could actually help US commerce, byforcing other nations to be more transparent with their ownchemical industries. CTBT NEGOTIATIONS FAIL After months of efforts negotiators could not come to anagreement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Indiavetoed the current language on August 15 and ended any chance ofa treaty in the near future. India demanded that the fivedeclared nuclear powers China, France, Russia, US and UK agree toa timetable for complete nuclear disarmament before it wouldsign. None of the five agreed to this plan. Because of India’s opposition, the treaty cannot bepresented to the UN General Assembly by the UN Conference onDisarmament as planned. However, Mexico, Brazil, Egypt, Peru andPakistan, in a group lead by Australia, are expected to presentthe CTBT to the General Assembly as the "Friends of theCTBT." The treaty can pass the General Assembly with asimple majority. However, current language makes it necessary forall 44 states with nuclear reactors to agree to ratify thetreaty, thus India can prevent ratification. Iran also voicedobjections to the CTBT. In fact, India may begin to more aggressively pursue its ownmissile programs and reserves the right to build the bomb. Alarge majority supports their nuclear programs. If the IndianGovernment did accept the current CTBT language, it could losethe next election because of this issue alone. In a country fullof divergent views, nuclear arms is one of the few issuesunifying different groups. Treaties already in force ban the test of nuclear armseverywhere except under ground. China was the last country totest their nuclear forces, with an underground explosion thissummer. France received international criticism for their testsin the South Pacific several month ago. India has not tested anuclear device since their sole explosion in 1974, but is widelybelieved to have the capability of assembling a nuclear warheadin a limited amount of time. Pakistan and Israel have not tested,but are believed to have the technology. Ironically, Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first PrimeMinister, first proposed the idea of a nuclear test ban in 1954. VIOLATIONS GERMANS SOLD CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO LIBYA German authorities arrested two businessmen for allegedlyselling chemical weapons equipment to Libya. According tointelligence sources, the smuggling operation allowed the Libyansto rebuild a major chemical plant. The chemical weapons equipment in question would allow theLibyans to mix poison gases in a full automated environment,allowing sarin and soman poison gases to be mixed safely. Theequipment was purchased for $2.15 million from Siemens AG anddiverted through Belgium. German Authorities only released the first names of the two --Udo B. and Detlef C., and the full name of Berge Balanian, thesuspected middle man. The Germans are being held in investigative custody while thegovernment investigates them and seeks Balanian, believed to bein Libya. Opposition parties accused the Social DemocratGovernment of having an ineffective export regime. NATO SEIZES MORE CROAT WEAPONS NATO seized a 106 mm rifle, anti-tank weapons, grenades, minesand other equipment at a police station in Croat-controlledterritory. All weapons in the former Yugoslavia are supposed tobe kept in NATO-monitored storage facilities. DID YOU KNOW????? A few helpful hints for DTC cases: Licensing Officers at DTC are returning without actions casesbecause the backup data is not collated into sets. Remember, inmost cases 7 collated sets of technical data must be submitted.When in doubt, always submit 7 collated sets, it is not worthrisking a RWA! Be careful when referencing "attachments." Youshould only reference items like freight forwarder lists andparts lists as attachments -- pages that will actually becomepart of the license. Other technical data or contracts should notbe referenced as an attachment, because it will not be part ofthe issued license. If a U.S. Customs officer notes a referenceto an attachment that is not part of the license, it may delay toconfusion and delay your shipment. When applying for a spare parts license, it is not necessaryto attach a complete parts list. Lengthy lists only create morework for you, State and Customs. State will stamp the approvedlicense with the "no major components authorized"message to ensure only spare parts go out on the license. Customscan track spares shipments by the dollar value alone. DTC and DoD are examining licenses to send drawings in supportof a request for quotation with increased scrutiny. Whensubmitting this kind of case, be sure to explain exactly what thedrawings will be used for, and why this transaction does not givemanufacturing know-how or other technical assistance. The burdenis on the applicant to show the transaction does not require aTAA or MLA. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS CHINA-TAIWAN-US TENSION OVER MISSILE SALES he continuing saga of Sino-US-Taiwan triangle continued thismonth over new Taiwanese purchases. Taiwan will buy $420 millionworth of US weapons including 1,299 Stinger missiles, launchers,and .50 caliber ammunition. China immediately denounced theproposed sale saying it would damage bilateral relations andamounted to American instigation of Taiwan’s separatism.China considers Taiwan to be a rebel province. The Foreign Ministry said the sale violated the 1982 agreementto reduce arms sales to Taiwan. That agreement guides all US armstransfers to Taiwan. No offensive arms are currently sold toTaiwan and transfers of new equipment are scrutinized closely. The Defense Department considers this sale to be a "donedeal" and the State Department supports it as consistentwith US foreign policy towards Taiwan and will not affect theregional military balance. The sale will not require extensive UStraining or assistance. The sale of Avenger anti-aircraft missile systems to Taiwanalso angers China. The State Department approved that sale twoyears ago. It is consistent with the US policy to sell onlydefensive weapons to Taiwan. Deputy spokesman Glyn Davies saidthere were no plans to reconsider the previous decision. CHINA TRANSFERRED MISSILE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY TO PAKISTAN Late in August the Washington Post revealed US intelligencesources strongly suspect that China is transferring missilemanufacturing technology to Pakistan. The secret factory, capableof manufacturing medium range M-11 type missiles, was builtoutside the capital city of Islamabad with drawings and hardwaresupplied by the government of China. The factory is still underconstruction, but is suspected of having production capabilitieswithin two years. Some intelligence sources suspect Pakistan isdeveloping nuclear warheads for these missiles. Vice President Al Gore confirmed (vaguely) the accuracy of thePost’s report by admitting the Administration is discussingthe issue with the Chinese. The transfer of this technology is in direct violation ofChina’s pledge to adhere to the Missile Technology ControlRegime (MTCR) guidelines. China pledged not to transferMTCR-controlled know-how and material after the US imposedsanctions related to a previous transfer to Pakistan. Intelligence sources do not know if the factory will becapable of producing complete missiles. Pakistan may need toimport guidance systems to make the M-11 clones function. It is unclear what the US will do at this point. By law, theAdministration must impose sanctions if China violates itspledge, but is the Administration willing or able to prove theviolations occurred? Sino-American relations have beenextraordinarily tense in the past year; conflicts over the USvisit of Taiwan’s president, China’s war-games,intellectual property disputes, the suspected Chinese transfer ofring magnets to Pakistan and human rights concerns have impactedbilateral relations. Only recently, had the two countries begunto patch up these sore spots. In the unlikely event the Administration does impose the MTCRsanctions, exports to China would be limited even further andmost imports from China would be banned for two years. Sanctionswould effect $39 billion worth of annual trade between thenations. So far Pakistan has denied the existence of the factory andChina has refused to comment. IRAN FILES TWO GERMAN SUITS Iran announced in late August it will sue German governmentofficials, and German powerhouse Siemens A.G. for their roles intwo unrelated matters. The suit against the German officials seeks punitive damagesfor the role Germany played in helping Iraq with its chemicalweapons programs. Iraqi chemical weapons were used against Iranin the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Iran is suing Siemens for $5.4 billion worth of damagesbecause the firm did not complete a nuclear power plant. Siemensabandoned the project in 1979 after the Islamic revolution.Siemens announced in 1992, it could not fulfill its end of thecontract because the German government would not let it exportcritical parts to Iran. Russia signed an $800 million deal tocomplete the Bushehr plant. UAE NARROWS AIRCRAFT CHOICE TO F-16 and RAFALE In the stiff competition to win the UAE’s $6 billionaircraft contract, only the F-16 and the Rafale remain alive. Thefinal decision will be announced in the next few months. The UAEmay also purchase a few more Mirage 2000s to complement itsexisting fleet of 36 Mirages. Whatever planes are selected,delivery will not be made until 2000. ISRAEL SEEKS FMS SURCHARGE WAIVER Israel asked the US to waive the 3 percent surcharge on allFMS deals, a move which would give Israel an effective $35million increase in annual aid. Currently all nations receiving FMS assistance must pay the surcharge to the Pentagon. Israelseeks a waiver because the $1.8 billion annual assistance theyreceive does not have the same purchasing power it did in the1980s. The Pentagon has not commented, but a waiver is unlikely,because it would require additional surcharges be placed on othernations’ aid. EU TO REVIEW MISSILE JV The European Commission is investigating the proposed missilejoint venture between British Aerospace and Lagardere Groupe. Theconsolidation of the two firms’ guided missile programs maystrengthen their already dominant position, and thus beobjectionable by the Commission. If the merger goes forward, itwill create the largest guided weapons business in Europe.Analysts see the merger as a key step in the consolidation of theEuropean defense industry. ASIA TURNS TO SUBS In recent months Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea andNorth Korea have all made moves to upgrade or acquire submarines.Defense analysts point to a perceived threat from China as theexplanation for the renewed interest in the underwater arena.According to Defense News, Japan in particular has monitoredChina’s sub activities with interest. However, budgets arelimited and most Asian nations are looking at long-termacquisition strategies and diesel equipment to save cash. AFGHANISTAN APPEALS FOR ARMS President Burhanuddin Rabbini of Afghanistan appealed to theUN not to impose an arms embargo on his nation, because rebelswill still be able to get shipments. The proposed embargo,designed to keep rebel factions from getting weapons, will bedebated b the UN General Assembly this month. The US addedAfghanistan to its list of proscribed destinations (22 CFR 126.1)last month, and is asking the Wassenaar Arrangement countries toconsider adding Afghanistan and the Sudan to its list ofproscribed countries. UKRAINE SELLS TANKS TO PAKISTAN Ukraine recently sold 300 T-80UD tanks worth $550 million toPakistan. The Ukraine has increasingly turned to South Asia forsales -- recently closing deals with India for military trucksand with Sri Lanka for military transport planes. Since thecollapse of the Soviet Union the Ukraine lost most of its defensesales. MALAYSIAN OFFICERS An opposition leader accused the defense ministry ofpurchasing sub-standard equipment from ex-officers this month.The government demanded the names of these officers to pursue theallegations. The equipment in questions may be obsolete andeffect the readiness of the Malaysian Air Force. Malaysia hasspent $4.4 billion on defense in the past five years. POLAND TO RECONSIDER BOSNIAN TANK DEAL According to Prime Minister Cimoszewicz, Poland will considercarefully the US proposal to supply Polish tanks to Bosnia. Underthe US proposal, NATO funds would be used to buy $50 millionworth of T-72 tanks for the Bosnian army. Poland’s cautionstems from concerns over regional stability. BUSINESS NEWS Austria ordered sights and stands for a new anti-tank missilesystem from Bofors of Sweden. The $20.5 million deal will becompleted in 1998. DynCorp was awarded a key subcontract from Battelle MemorialInstitute to provide support to the Army’s preparations forthe implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). British Aerospace won a tech-transfer contract from the Saudisto maintain their Tornado warplanes. Major offsets are involvedin the contract. The total value of the deal has not beenreleased as of yet. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS CALL FOR INDONESIAN ARMS BAN The Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights andHuman Rights Watch-Asia called for a ban on munitions trade withIndonesia and the end to all state visits to the island nation.Indonesia recently cracked down on all political opposition andrioting disrupted the capital. The US State Department alreadybans all small weapons and crowd-control equipment to Indonesia. TURKEY AND POLAND BUY HELICOPTERS Turkey announced plans to spend $3 billion on 145 new attackhelicopters over the next ten years. The government is acceptingbids and will look at the offset package in particular whenevaluating proposals. Helicopters under consideration include theUHU-HAS Tiger, the A-129 Mangusta, the Mi-28, the AH-64 Apache,the AH-1W Super Cobra and the RAH-66 Comanche. Poland will soon announce who won its Huzar combat helicopterupgrade. The Elbit-Rafael team is expected to win the deal.Proposals from Israel Aircraft Industries, Lod, Euromissile S.A.and Rockwell are also under consideration. The deal will alsoinclude offsets. IRAQ STILL CIRCUMVENTING UN UN Inspector Rolf Ekeus reported to the UN Security Councilthat Iraq continues to violate its promise to allow inspectionsof weapons facilities. Iraq repeatedly denied UN inspectorsaccess to files and facilities, and even loaded some weapons ontrucks and trains to circumvent inspections. The UN maintains astrict embargo against Iraq and will continue to do so until UNinspectors are satisfied that Iraq has eliminated its chemicaland biological weapons and missile programs. US ANGERS THAILAND OVER MISSILE SALE The Clinton Administration rejected a request from Thailand toallow the sale of AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Airmissiles. Thailand wanted the missiles to equip their new F/18s.However, the Administration was not persuaded by Thailand’sreasons for the sale, and the US has a position not to introducenew weapons technology into a region. If Malaysia buys RussianAA-12 "Adder" missiles, the US will reconsider theAIM-120 question. RUSSIA WILL HELP IRAN BUILD SATELLITE Russia agreed to help Iran build and launch its firstsatellite in the next three years. Russia is Iran’s largestarms supplier and helped Iran build its first nuclear powerplant. The purpose of the satellite has not been released. RUSSIAN FIRMS SAYS NO TAIWAN SALE Taiwan announced this month they wanted to buy Russianhelicopters, but arms exporter Rosvooruzheniye, denies any deal.Taiwan is interested in Russian helicopters because they arecheap and did not expect Russia to turn away a potential sale.Russia has not ruled out the sale, but said they will be verycautious because of the effect on PRC relations. The PRC isRussia’s largest arms customer and their huge orders helpedRussia reclaim the top world sales title for 1995.

SEMINAR INQUIRES We have received many questions about the CSL Seminar heldannually in South Carolina. We are planning to hold the seminarthis year, probably in late October, but have not settled all thedetails. We hope to finalize the arrangements in the next fewweeks. UN EMBARGO ENDS The UN Embargo against former Yugoslavia expired June 18. Thefive-year ban officially ended five months after the Dayton peacetreaty was signed. RUSSIA REMOVED FROM PROSCRIBED LIST Russia is no longer a proscribed destination for Munitions Listexport and import transactions. However, an agreement between theU.S. and Russia does limit the kinds of firearms permitted to beimported into the U.S. from Russia. Please contact our office forthe complete listing. SED ERRORS Census and Customs expressed concern that 50% of paper ShipperExport Declarations (SED) are being filled out improperly. Bothagencies blame late filing of complete and accurate SEDs for theproblem. If voluntary compliance does not solve the issue,shipments may be delayed or detained because of incomplete SEDs. SATELLITE PROBLEMS Warning! If you have a Commerce license for a satellite to belaunched in another country, you may not discuss detailed launchvehicle data without a State Department license for technicaldata. Several companies have gotten in trouble because of thisimportant distinction. The U.S. Government is consideringrequiring ITAR tech data licenses for all foreign launches tocover just that situation. U.S. Government UNDER SECRETARY FOR ARMS CONTROL GRILLED BY HOUSE COMMITTEE The Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control andInternational Security Affairs, Lynn Davis, was questioned by theHouse International Relations committee over the administrationshandling of global arms proliferation, especially coming fromChina. Davis, and Democrat members of the committee, pointed outseveral of the administration's accomplishments, including thedenuclearization of the CIS (excluding Russia) and China'scommitment to not sell missiles which are proscribed under theMTCR. Under pressure from the US, Russia agreed to halt armssales to Iran, a provision which became part of the Wassennaaragreement. Davis stated that Chinese arms sales are a current andfuture threat. According to the Under-Secretary, the StateDepartment is trying to convince China to follow Russia and agreenot to sell arms to Iran. Republican representatives used the hearing as an opportunityboth to criticize Clinton and to level accusations against China.Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Benjamin Gilman (R-NY)offered "do and don't" lists for combatingproliferation, including being the need to levy sanctions whenthey are threatened and ignore empty promises offered byproliferators. Smith, at the hearing, railed against Chinesehuman rights violations for ten minutes, finally asking ". .. Why would any reasonable person believe the Chinese?!"Davis responded to numerous questions of this sort by replyingthat the Chinese had lived up to commitments to not sell MTCRclass missiles. NASA AND EXPORT LICENSING NASA is a rather unique government agency from the licensingperspective as it both reviews license applications, and appliesfor its own. Bob Tucker and Julia Kortum handle all licenses atNASA. This year to date they have received and reviewed about 120ITAR cases. They try to complete all reviews within 20 workingdays, but that has proven to be difficult since they also receiveCCL and FAA cases. Most of the time NASA recommends approval withprovisos for ITAR cases. In addition, NASA participates in theMissile Technology Export Control Regime (MTEC) and MTAG(Military Technology Advisory Group). According to NASA, you can speed up the review process byinforming them in advance that a case is on the way -- by phoneor by providing an advance copy. In addition, if you plan ameeting with DTSA or DTC regarding your case, NASA would like toknow so they can participate in the briefing as well. As an exporter, NASA strictly follows the regulations setforth in the EAR and the ITAR. They even have their owncompliance program! HOUSE APPROVES NEW 'BUY AMERICA' PROVISIONS On June 13 the House passed the Hoke amendment, a measurewhich will force the Pentagon to buy only American-made landinggear. The bill was in response to the fall of US share in landinggear from 86 percent in 1992 to 24 percent this year. Otherproducts protected by similar measures include anchor chains,gyrocompasses and some ship propellers. Whether or not the amendment will become a part of the DefenseAuthorization bill, depends on the upcoming conference. NATOallies are watching this provision in particular as a bellwetherto measure America's willingness to open its own defense market.Currently the US exports goods worth more than four times that ofwhat it imports from Europe. HOUSE APPROVES SANCTIONS FOR IRAN/LIBYA INVESTORS Despite opposition from U.S. trading partners, the Houseapproved a bill which would require the President to impose twoof six sanctions on any foreign company investing $40 million ormore in Iranian or Libyan oil and gas. The bill was designed topenalize European companies who continue to trade with thoserogue nations despite hostility and support of terroristactivities. The President supports the bill, and with a similar Senatemeasure already passed, it seems likely to be enacted. Europe andCanada are expected to protest at the G-7 meeting this summer.Allies object to the Iranian portion of the proposed sanctiononly, since most already have sanctions in place against Libya.Iran has verbally assaulted the U.S. for the measure. INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF US PARIAH POLICY The European Union, highly critical of US initiatives such asthe Helms-Burton Act (enacted) and the Iran Oil Sanctions Act(now in conference) decided to mute its criticism ofcontroversial US trade policies. Still, the EU will ask the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) to issue a consultative decision on theinternational legality of Helms-Burton. They complain the Actresults in discrimination in US markets against firms that tradewith Cuba, and the US is overstepping its jurisdiction byattempting to regulate the behavior of foreign firms. TheEuropean Union also will likely ask the WTO to review the IranOil Sanctions Act (see related story). Canada and Mexico, however, will not be silent on the issue ofHelms-Burton. Both have significant trade ties with Cuba. TheOrganization of American States (OSA) passed a resolutioncondemning the Helms-Burton legislation. The Mexicans alsothreatened to slap punitive duties on US exports entering theircountry, although the possibility of this happening under theframework of NAFTA is uncertain and, one would think, unlikely,given the economic reliance of Mexico on the US. Canada, whichallows its firms to ignore US court rulings in any case, willallow its companies to sue American firms involved inHelms-Burton cases. Despite all this, the administration plans toimplement the provisions of Helms-Burton, a politically popularbill. ENCRYPTION UPDATE This month there was another congressional hearing relating tothe Internet and encryption controls and S. 1726 "Promotionof Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-Code) Act of1996." Pro-Code is co-sponsored by Senator Conrad Burns(R-MT) and would relax control on software with more than 40-bitencryption. The bill is supported by industry. According to the Information Technology Association of America(ITAA), current encryption policy would cost 200,000 jobs and $60billion over the next four years, if continued. In a related development, Microsoft discretely hired alobbyist to support its Washington interests. According to theCongressional Monitor, the encryption issue is on the lobbyist'stop agenda. CTBT CLOSE TO SUCCESS AND FAILURE Negotiators for the eight countries confirmed or thought topossess nuclear technology have been close to closing theComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) all month, but neverable to finalize the treaty. Success seemed impossible last weekas India announced they would not sign the treaty three daysbefore talks were scheduled to be completed. The US then turnedto Pakistan to ask them to support the treaty despite India'sposition but Pakistan did not agree to this concession. On the day of the deadline, Friday, the chairman of thenegotiations presented all eight countries with a final draft ofthe CTBT with several unresolved provisions. France was the onlycountry to announce it would accept the treaty. Instead of afinal agreement, governments will vote in late July whether thetreaty should go before the General Assembly of the UN. The eightnations would have to come to an agreement by July 29 in order tomake the treaty's progress feasible. When the US changed its position in the middle of the CTBTtalks, all five declared nuclear powers, US, UK, France, Russiaand China agreed that the three 'undeclared' powers, India,Pakistan and Israel had to sign as well for the treaty to bemeaningful. Previously, the US hoped the pressure of the treatywould force the undeclared powers to adhere to its provisions.The US agreed in exchange for tougher inspection standards. However India has used this agreement, to force its ownagenda-- insisting the treaty also required the destruction ofexisting nuclear weapons within a negotiated time period. Indiacalled the treaty without such a provision a "charade."That provision is unacceptable to the other parties. Some sayBritain, Russia and China are hiding behind India's reluctanceand truly do not want the CTBT to come into force. As the June 28 deadline rapidly approached, countries workedto reach some sort of compromise. The negotiators discussed anUS-supported position to let the treaty take effect with theratification of 75 nations, but Britain and Russia rejected theidea. China even agreed to give up so-called 'peaceful' tests thatthey wanted to remain exempt, as long as the other parties agreedto reexamine the treaty in ten years. If the issues among the eight principal countries can beresolved before the July 29 meeting of the Conference onDisarmament, the CTBT could still progress as originallyscheduled. Such an agreement seems unlikely at this point. NATO EXPANSION MAY BECOME CAMPAIGN ISSUE In a June 25 speech, Bob Dole stressed the need for a firmtimetable for NATO expansion in the next two years. He also saidthat Russia must not be allowed to intimidate its neighbors orprevent NATO expansion. While Clinton supports the inclusion ofPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO, he has downplayedthe issue because of the Russian elections. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana responded that NATO isscheduled to decide on new members in 1997 and there was no needto speed up the timetable. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the top candidatesfor early NATO expansion. Last week the President of the Ukrainemet with Polish officials to discuss the Polish bid for NATOmembership and other regional issues. VIOLATION Rotchco, a New York firm exporting surplus military and policedepartment equipment, has been charged with illegally exportingdefense-related articles. These items included night visionequipment, hand grenades, and chemical protective suits. Saleswere to a number of foreign companies, including one linked tothe Japanese cult involved in Tokyo's subway gassings. DID YOU KNOW?????

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS EGYPT DENIES PURCHASES FROM NORTH KOREA Last week Egypt denied reports it purchased missile parts andlaunchers from North Korea. The materials in question wouldenable Egypt to make its own short-range missiles. According to the Egyptian government, the reports are justattempts to separate the US and Egypt. The State Department isstill investigating the reports, which if proven, would put Egyptin an awkward position as the recipient of over one billion ayear in US military aid. EUROPE EXPECTED TO GAIN GROUND IN ASIAN MARKETS According to Defense News, European defense companies areexpected in increase sales to East Asia and take market shareaway from US suppliers. East Asian nations are turning away fromUS companies for two reasons: export controls, and theunavailability of sought after equipment (like dieselsubmarines). In addition, the aggressive sales tactics ofEuropean companies are helping them to close more deals. The US now holds a 49 percent market share in comparison toEurope's 10 percent, however that could change quickly. And theEast Asian market is one of the healthiest -- defense budgetshave grown 23 percent in the last ten years. With export controls causing delays and preventing thetransfer of some high-tech equipment, East Asian countries arelooking elsewhere. European competitors are more than willing tostep into the gap. CHINA AND PAKISTAN: WHAT NOW ?!? This timeit appears Pakistan may have assembled M-11 missilesshipped to them by the Chinese three years ago. The M-11 candeliver a nuclear warhead, and Pakistan is considered one ofthree "threshold," or "undeclared," nuclearstates (along with Israel and India). US law calls for sanctions to be imposed on China over theaffair. The State Department said that sanctions will be imposedif it is proven the missiles were deployed. Despite numerousreasons to impose sanctions like intellectual property issues andprevious technology exports to Pakistan, the US has beenreluctant to impose sanctions on China. It is even alleged the US government might have alteredintelligence reports to play down the possibility of the missilesbeing deployed; the State Department, however, denies anyalterations. Senator Pressler has asked for a delay in shipments of alreadypaid for military materiel to Pakistan pending a resolution ofthis controversy. CONVERSATION WITH OFFICIAL FROM INDIAN EMBASSY While at the Lynn Davis hearing, CSL had a chance to conversewith a member of the Indian embassy staff. He expressed concernsover US efforts to limit arms sales through sanctions andinternational regimes, saying that the average Indian wassuspicious of US motivations and angry that the US would denyothers weapons it itself owns. This could become significantbecause political power in India is shifting to more populistleaders. Indeed, he believed that the nationalistic BJP party -which claims it will hold nuclear tests should it attain (andhold) power - would win easily if elections were held today. FRANCE RECONSIDERS DEFENSE BUDGET CUTS Under German pressure, France agreed to reverse its spendingplans and restore funding to joint Franco-German programs. Thisannouncement of cuts last month took the Germans by surprise. TheGerman government was angered by this plan, as it represented areversal of close Franco-German defense planning. A drop inFrench procurement, furthermore, would have entailed greater perunit costs for the Germans. It is no surprise that the funds allocated for the jointprograms will come from planned imports from the United Statesand other third party countries. Purchases of the E-2C Hawkeye,for instance, are being reduced. The French budget also calls forcuts in French-only systems such as the Rafale fighter andLeClerc tank. This last group of cuts angered French legislators,although the defense budget easily passed in the NationalAssembly. Defense cuts are expected to cost the French defenseindustry approximately 60,000 jobs, out of 300,000 currently, by2002. ISRAEL STEPS INTO TRADE GAP WITH TURKEY Israel and Turkey are developing a military partnership andattracting world attention. An agreement signed in Februaryallows for Israeli pilots to train in Turkey. Israel and Turkeyalso foresee future joint naval exercises. Turkey will likely purchase military equipment and contractingservices from the Israeli defense industry. A $600 million dealhas almost been concluded for Israel to upgrade Turkish F-4fighters. Israel is also competing for contracts to outfit theTurkish army with assault rifles and refueling aircraft. Turkeyis developing alternate supply sources than the United States,due to US restrictions on arms exports to Turkey. Turkey has been criticized by other mostly-Muslim states andits own Islamic fundamentalists for its growing ties to Israel.The Turkish government, for its part, feels threatened by hostileneighbors on the one hand and disapproving allies on the other.Israel is in some a natural ally against common foes such asSyria, Iran, and Iraq. The election of Netanyahu in Israel mayresult in closer ties between Jerusalem and Ankara. Meanwhile, Iran announced its willingness to sign a treatywith Syria to counterbalance the Turko-Israeli agreement. Therehas been some amount of tension between Syria and Turkey inrecent years. Turkey accuses Syria of supporting PKK rebels, andSyria demands greater water rights from the Euphrates. Recentreports indicate, but Turkey denies, a buildup of Turkish troopson the Syrian border. The budding Turko-Israeli relationship is threatened by thepossibility of the Islamic Welfare Party coming to power inTurkey. The Welfare Party is opposed to the close ties with theWest and extremely critical of the growing relationship betweenTurkey and Israel. Welfare Party officials said that if it shouldform the next Turkish government, the deals with Israel would beterminated. Turkish president Demirel asked the Welfare Party totry and form a parliamentary majority following the collapse of amore moderate government in early June. The Turkish campaign against Kurdish separatists continued inJune. Turkey claimed to have killed over 225 guerillas in onefive-day period. These skirmishes with the PKK may mean morescrutiny of military exports to Turkey in the future. Israel, to quell Greek anxieties about the Turko-Israeliagreements, agreed to a framework for military cooperationsimilar to that it has with Turkey. Current plans, which have yetto be cemented, only include joint naval exercises. UKRAINIAN ARMS INDUSTRY REBOUNDS After years of decline, the Ukrainian arms industry'sproduction rose 3 percent to just over $200 million. In the fourprevious years, the industry had seen its defense industryworkforce cut to one-fifth its level at the collapse of theUnion. Much of this was the result of extensive defenseconversion. The Ukraine plans extensive cooperation with theRussian defense industry. They also intend to aggressively pursueexport markets as a way to keep its arms industry alive. Thisaggression has created some international suspicion -- the USState Department is investigating a transfer of Ukrainian weaponstechnology to Libya, a violation of international sanctions. BRITISH FACE DISCRIMINATION FROM UAE According to the British Embassy, an official from the UAErecently hinted that British bids for large commercial deals donot receive equal consideration because of the lack of a defensepact between the two countries. The proposed pact has been on thetable for over two years, but the two nations have not been ableto finalize the details. The UAE wants Britain to commit to extensive support in theevent their security is threatened. The UAE does have defensepacts with the U.S. and France, and those countries have won $4.3billion worth of defense orders in the past three years.According to Reuters, France has pledged up to 70,000 troops, 120jet fighters and 200 helicopters if the UAE is attacked. British defense firms are urging the government to completethe defense pact soon, in particular before a $6 billion warplanecontract is awarded this year. France is aggressively pursuingthe contract, with a visit by the Foreign Minister just thismonth to discuss their proposal. Officially British, U.S. andFrench companies are competing for the deal, but sources indicatethere are no British firms on the UAE short list. HOME FOUND FOR PAKISTANI F-16s After years of debate over the fate of the F-16s purchasedlong ago by Pakistan, there appears to be a concrete plan to sellthem to Indonesia. Indonesia will likely receive the planes in atleast two purchases, the first containing eleven aircraft.Pakistan, which still technically owns the aircraft, agreed tothe sale so long as it receives the proceeds and the US makes upthe difference between the current and 1985 value of the planes.This amount is expected to be around $150 million. The Indonesia F-16 deal does not represent a change in USpolicy towards that country. US firms are still prohibited fromselling Indonesia any equipment, such as small arms or riot gear,usable against the population of East Timor. The F-16, a piece ofmajor defense equipment, does not fall into this category. Thispolicy is similar to a British one allowing the sale of Hawkanti-aircraft missiles to Indonesia. There have been reportsthese missiles were used against ground targets in East Timor,and the UK has been criticized for the sale. EVENTS IN THE BALKANS An accord was reached between the Muslim-Croat Federation, theBosnian Serbs, Croatia, and Yugoslavia on arms controls for theregion. Under the terms of the agreement, the Bosnian Serbs willdecrease their stock of tracked combat vehicles, and the Bosniangovernment will increase theirs. The goal is to achieve a roughbalance between the Bosnian combatants and their neighboringsupporters. The Bosnian Muslims and Croats still cannot reach anagreement on combining their armed forces, a failure ofnegotiations which is holding up the delivery of millions ofdollars in US equipment to the two erstwhile allies. Last month, Bosnian Serbs were removed from the list ofspecially designated nationals. Earlier this year sanctionsagainst Serbia and Montenegro were suspended and Bosnia andHerzegovina were declare eligible for defense exports. TheAdministration supports trade with former Yugoslavia inprinciple, but is likely to be cautious about trade. Wranglingover an election in Bosnia, the status of human and minorityrights in Serb controlled territory, and the fate of Serbian warcriminals could all serve to limit or prevent exports to theBosnian Serbs for a considerable length of time. AEGEAN CREATES TENSION BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY A series of war games in the Aegean, a fight over anuninhabited island and a dozen complaints about territorial waterviolations escalated tensions between Greece and Turkey. On June16 Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis warned Turkey they wouldactively defend any attack on any of their islands in the Aegean. Greece appealed to the US and Russia for support, warning theTurkish threats could destabilize the region. The US moderatedone of the disputes between Greece and Turkey. So far the ClintonAdministration has not taken sides, and responded coolly to theGreek position. Partially in response to the tensions, Greece plans topurchase $10 billion worth of arms in the next five years. Theiracquisition list includes F-16 fighters, helicopter, missiles andsubmarines. Greece currently spends 4.6% of their GDP on defense. ARMSCOR APPLAUDS U.S. EMBARGO Armscor, South Africa's state weapons agency said they havebenefitted from a U.S. embargo. Armscor General Manager, EricEsterhuyse revealed several countries, seeking to remain outsidethe U.S. sphere of influence have purchased from Armscor becauseof the embargo. Armscor remains embargoed because of a deal made during theapartheid era in violation of U.S. sanctions at that time. HIZBOLLAH SENDS IRAQI ARMS TO BAHRAIN The Kuwaiti Hizbollah sent weapons left over from Iraqi troopsto their counterpart in Bahrain. The Bahraini group was recentlyaccused by the government of Bahrain of plotting to overthrow thegovernment of the Emir. Kuwaiti militants are suspected of hoarding the arms leftafter Iraq retreated in 1991 and the government of Kuwait hasbeen trying to confiscate. Bahrain arrested five individuals forsmuggling arms from Kuwait in early June. BOTSWANA'S ACQUISITIONS RAISE CONCERNS Botswana signed a contact last month for 13 CF-5 fighterbombers from Canada, and negotiated another deal with theNetherlands for 50 German Leopold tanks -- in total over $100million purchase for the African nation. The acquisitions areraising eyebrows from several sources. The German government may try to block the export according totheir reexport regulations. Apparently several unnamedgovernments have put pressure on Bonn to stop the deal. In addition, Namibia has protested the build up and iscurrently involved in a minor border dispute with Botswana. Otherneighbors, including Zimbabwe have no opposition. Most of all, policy analysts and regional experts are puzzledby the move. As Reuters put it, "Botswana -- landlocked,peaceful, unthreatened and prosperous" should have no reasonfor a major buildup. The government of Botswana said they plannedto use the equipment for border patrols and anti-poachingactivities. INTERNATIONAL SHORTS FOR ONCE, ARMS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS INTO CHINA Technology transfers from Israel to China were the subject of ameeting between State Department and Israeli officials reportedin the Washington Times. The Israelis are suspected oftransferring US aircraft technology to the Chinese in 1992. TheWashington Times claimed a leaked CIA report was its source . Thetransferred technology would be installed into the Chinese F-10fighter, expected to be deployable in ten years. Technology fromthe Patriot SAM is also suspected of having been transferred toChina from Israel. BRITISH MOD WILL AWARD BILLIONS WORTH OF CONTRACTS The British MOD is close to finalizing several procurement dealsworth several billion pounds. The MOD hopes to conclude itspurchases before the upcoming election. Major acquisitions areexpected in advanced missiles for the RAF and naval programs. AEROSPATIALE AND DASSAULT MERGER WILL BE FINALIZEDSOON The two aerospace giants of France, Aerospatiale and Dassault,are close to finalizing the state-encouraged merger between thetwo. Serge Dassault, who owned 49.9 percent of Dassault willreceive a 27 percent interest in the new company, short of the 33percent necessary for veto power. When merged,Aerospatiale-Dassault's total value will be more than $6 billion. RUSSIAN CHANGES MAY EFFECT EXPORTS The recent personnel changes inside Boris Yeltsin's governmentmay effect Russia's export policy and volume according to DefenseNews. Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, was recentlyfired in a shake-up that included the appointment of Lt. GenAlexander Lebed as national security adviser and Russian SecurityCouncil secretary. Soskovets was actively involved in many ofRussia's arms export deals including some controversial ones withIran and South Africa. At this point it is too soon to say howthe changes, and the election will effect Russia's policy. RISKS CHANGE UNDER "NEW WORLD ORDER" According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute(SIPRI), the danger of global nuclear destruction has diminished,but the threat of proliferation of chemical, biological andnuclear weapons has increased. Their research also indicates theU.S. lead world arms sales with 43% of transacting; Russia'stotal rose to 17%. SIPRI's 1996 Yearbook is published by OxfordUniversity Press; a brief summary of the report is available athttp://www.sipri.se/pubs/yb96/. EUROPE'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY MUST CONSOLIDATE TO COMPETE At a recent seminar of the European defense industry's topprofessionals agreed -- European companies have to change the waythey do business now to compete with their American counterparts.However, individual countries disagree on how to make theirfuture a success -- the French are actively consolidating andseeking preferences, while the British have a more free marketapproach. Under the EU, individual countries have control overtheir own arms industries, so wide-scale EU cooperation is notlikely in the near future. WORLD DISARMAMENT WILL COST BILLIONS According to the Bonn International Centre for Conversion (BICC)the cost of disposing of surplus weapons may reach between $90and 4185 billion in the next 10 to 20 years. BICC reports thedanger of poor states such as the former communist satellites toimproperly store or export the unneeded items. They recommendestablishing an international disarmament fund. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SAYS NO TO INDONESIAN ARMS DEALS The European Parliament urged all its members to stop sellingmunitions to Indonesia because of that country's record on humanrights, in particular its treatment of annexed East Timor. Sevenof the eight member parties supported the non-binding resolution. FRENCH DEFENSE EXPORTS INCREASE IN 1995 Largely because of orders from the Middle East, French defenseexports rose to $ 6.7 billion from $6.34 billion in 1994. 69.3percent of the total was from naval sales, with two frigates soldto Saudi Arabia for a total of $3.6 billion. TAIWAN SHOULD GET STINGER MISSILE PACKAGE According to Defense News, the Pentagon is expected to notifyCongress of its intent to transfer Stinger missile systems toTaiwan. The $200 million-deal is not likely to face oppositionfrom the Hill. This transfer introduces a new technology into theregion and encourage other Asian countries to request thetechnology. China is expected to protest the deal which someexperts consider a direct result of China's activities in Marchin the Taiwan Strait. IRAQ GIVES UN WEAPONS RECORDS Iraq gave UN arms inspector Rolf Ekes "all" of itsfiles on chemical, biological and surface-to-surface missileslast week. The UN sought these files since the end of the PersianGulf War. In addition, Iraq agreed to let UN inspectorsunrestricted access to any site they want to see. This change inIraqi policy seems to indicate a willingness to cooperate withthe terms of the 1991 treaty that ended the conflict in order tohave the trade embargo lifted. Recently Iraq negotiated aone-time oil for food trade deal with the UN. Ekes holds Iraq isstill concealing several important reports on chemical,biological and nuclear weapons. CHINA CHARGES US IMPORTER China charged William P. Chen, a US citizen with importingcontraband and evading customs checks. Some view this arrest as aresponse to the US criminal investigation of several Chinesecitizens arrested last month for illegally importing automaticweapons into the US. UN SANCTIONS UN sanctions on Iraq will likely be extended. Recent tensionssurrounding the UN Iraqi mission, responsible for investigatingBaghdad's weapons of mass destruction, led the US to threaten toveto any attempt to lift UN sanctions. Such a move is favored byRussia and France, opposed by the US and Britain. Iraq mustdestroy its stockpiles of chemical, biological, and ballisticmissiles in order for the sanctions to be lifted. UAE THREATENS US ORDERS The United Arab Emirates (UAE) threatened to cancel an order forUS made aircraft unless the US agrees to allow the UAEjurisdiction over US troops involved in crimes there. The Navy,with the most personnel stationed in the country, is reluctant toagree to until it has completed a study comparing UAE law toAmerican law. They fear the Muslim country's law would be muchharsher than American law. However, the proposed aircraft deal isworth close to $20 billion over a dozen years, and the UAE hassignaled its readiness to walk if the US doesn't meet itsdemands.

It is a lawsuit where one or more individuals are claiming to represent all others who have been similarly injured by the same defendant or group of defendants. For example, suppose a defective computer diskette causes a floppy drive to ignite and burn once inserted. If 500,000 of those defective diskettes are sold, then the purchaser of one diskette might bring a class action against the manufacturer seeking to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers. A more detailed description can be found in the special Federal Rule of Civil Procedure for Class Actions. Who gets the money in such cases? If the person who filed the class action prevails, any award or settlement must be made available to all members of the class. Attorneys representing the class are also entitled to a reasonable fee. Members of the class are not entitled to seek an additional award beyond that obtained by the class representative. What if the defendant wins? A defendant who prevails in a class action is protected from further lawsuits by all persons who were members of the class at the time. Why is notice important? Notice serves three purposes. First, potential class members need to be notified that a class lawsuit exists. The potential members must decide if they want to remain members of the class and be represented by the person who initially brought the lawsuit, or "opt out" of the class and do something on their own (like bring a separate lawsuit). Generally, if a potential class member fails to opt out, the individual is deemed to be a member of the class. Notice is necessary to inform class members of the lawsuit and of their ability to opt out. Second, class members need to be notified of a potential settlement, so they can provide input on whether the settlement is acceptable. Third, class member need to be notified when a pool of money or other award is available so they can participate and obtain their fair share. What sort of notice is required? Generally, courts are required to "direct to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances." Does this mean that I am entitled to receive notice if I'm a member of a class? No. The standard is "best practicable" notice, not "actually received" notice. There is no requirement of actual notice to a class member, only notice that is "reasonably calculated" to reach interested persons. If reasonable efforts result in no notice to you, tough luck. What do you mean "tough luck"? You may totally miss the chance to collect on an award to which you are entitled AND you may have lost the opportunity to obtain legal relief for yourself. Consider the case of Mr. Peters, a resident of New York who was injured on an Amtrak train following an accident. A class action on behalf of all passengers was brought in federal court in Philadelphia. Notice was mailed to the affected parties, but Mr. Peters' address was incomplete and he never received notice of the lawsuit. Months after the class action was settled, Mr. Peters sued Amtrak seeking $500,000 in compensatory damage and $1 million in punitive damages. Amtrak argued that Peters could not bring his lawsuit because he was bound by the settlement of the class action - he was a member of the class who had not opted out. He had lost the right to bring a separate lawsuit on his own. Peters argued that he was never given the chance to opt out because he had never received notice. Amtrak won. (And on appeal, Amtrak won again.) For you legal scholars out there, this case is Peters v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., 966 F.2d 1483 (D.C. Cir. 1992). See generally, "Lawsuits to End All Lawsuits, Settlements May Limit Victims' Future Right to Sue", by Barry Meier, THE NEW YORK TIMES, January 10, 1996. What type of notice efforts are considered reasonable? Sending notice by mail is almost always considered reasonable. When addresses are unobtainable, notice by publication is often used. This means that class action notices may be published for one or two days in local, regional or national newspapers, and perhaps in a magazine. What happens if I don't look at the right page in the selected newspaper on the day notice is published? You may never know that you are entitled to share in a class award. Or you may miss the chance to "opt out" or "opt in" to a class suit. What do you mean "opt in"? In certain types of class actions an individual must affirmatively request to be included as a class member in order to take advantage of an already filed suit. For example, class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) are governed by the "opt in" rule. Wouldn't it make sense to put class notices on the Web, where they would be continuously available to millions of individuals? Definitely. Are most class action notices posted on the Web? No. Why Not? Lawyers and courts have only recently started to incorporate the Internet technology into their procedures and decisions. Also, up until recently there has not been a central location on the Web for posting class action notices. Now there is Central Notice, at www.notice.com. | Central Notice Home | Class Actions | Product Recalls | Missing Children | | Lawyer Find | Consumer Complaints | Contact Us | © 1996 The Notice Company, LLC.

WT02-B09-35IA048-000842-B038-257http://www.notice.com:80/lawyerinfo.html 206.119.147.119 19970119183810 text/html 10414HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 18:44:19 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 12-Sep-96 02:21:18 GMTContent-length: 10229Content-type: text/html CENTRAL NOTICE - Class Actions - Lawyer Information CLASS ACTIONS Frequently Asked Questions From Lawyers Why would I want to post a Class Action Notice on the Internet? The purpose of giving notice to absent class members is to assure procedural fairness and due process. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 instructs that the notice be the "best practicable" under the circumstances, including individual notice to members who can be identified through "reasonable" efforts. State rules of procedure, from California to Florida to New York, include similar requirements. In addition, Congress recently enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which provides for a special early notice in securities class actions to be published "in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service" advising members of the purported plaintiff class. Posting a notice on the Internet may be one of the most cost efficient means of reaching millions of potential members. For the modest price of obtaining an Internet presence, a document can be posted and made continuously available to nearly 40 million Internet users. And the number of users is expected to increase at least fivefold by the end of the century. Courts have broad discretion in formulating standards for appropriate notice. Orders are now being fashioned which require Internet posting in addition to print media publication. As technology and society advance, notice by electronic distribution will become standard. OK, the Internet sounds good. But why post at www.notice.com? Putting your notice on the Internet isn't enough. It needs to be positioned where individuals, who may be unaware that they are potential members of a class, might reasonably expect to look. As of January 1996 over 170,000 commercial domains were registered on the Internet, representing an annual increase of 586%. Plus there are tens of thousands of academic, governmental and other organizational domains. Each domain may have within it an unlimited number of pages. Every page or document on the Internet has a unique address called its URL (uniform resource locator). The various search engines that are available on the Internet indexed an estimated 19 to 21 million or more URLs as of the beginning of 1996. And the numbers keep growing. Is it reasonable to expect that a posting on any page will get noticed? Class actions may cover a wide variety of subjects and may have national or international scope. The subject matters range from computer chips to polybutylene pipe, from corporate antitrust to consumer fraud. An action filed in Alabama may bind class members from Maine to Wyoming. A central location on the Internet, not limited by considerations of geography or topic, is required. A site that not only is registered with all of the major search engines, but one where users would naturally expect to find a notice of importance. That location is www.notice.com. How do I get my Class Action Notice posted at www.notice.com? There are four ways: First, if you have a home site on the Internet, you can load the notice on a separate page at your site. Then send an email to legal@notice.com with the URL of the notice page along with a 10-to-15 word description to go along with it. Second, you might have the defendant in the class action post the notice at a special location at its home on the Internet. See, e.g., In re INTEL PENTIUM(TM) PROCESSOR LITIGATION, where the notice is posted at Intel's site. Again, send an email to legal@notice.com with the URL of the notice along with a brief description. Third, you might consider going to an independent service bureau who would put the notice on a separate page at the bureau's site. Again, send an email to legal@notice.com with the URL of the notice location along with a brief description. Fourth, we will load the notice for you onto a designated URL at www.notice.com ("Your-Notice-URL") and then post it. We will also keep you advised as to how many times Your-Notice-URL has been visited. How much does it cost? We post notices without charge. If we load the notice and create Your-Notice-URL (option 4 above), there are setup and maintenance fees for page development which vary based on the length (number of pages) of the notice, the processing required (e.g., electronic file transfer or paper document scan) and the time period for maintenance. Will you certify a posting? At your request, we will provide a certificate confirming the date that we post the URL of your notice. You may also request a certificate of continuity, confirming the continuous time period during which we have posted the URL of your notice. Please note: Unless we have loaded the notice and maintained Your-Notice-URL (option 4 above), we will not be able to certify that the notice has actually resided at the designated URL. We can only certify that the URL which you designated (under options 1 through 3 above) has been posted and maintained. There is a charge of $50 per certificate. Exactly what will you post for free? We will post the complaint, proposed settlement, or other judicially approved notice document. We will not post the entire docket file. Will you post a summary report of the litigation? Some law firms and organizations prepare descriptions of past or current litigation work. Such documents, while very informative, are treated as promotional material. We invite you to contact us about advertising, paid postings and sponsorship opportunities. What about notice by email? We are unaware of any court that has permitted notice to class members by email in lieu of mail sent via the U.S. Postal Service or other delivery service. Notice by email would clearly provide an effective backup process, and we can provide that service. However, if you know the recipients' email addresses, then you really don't need us to transmit the notices unless you have administrative or legal concerns. We can also assist in locating email addresses for your prospective recipients. Note: We reserve the right to modify our feesand procedures. We also reserve the right to refuse, at our sole discretion,any item submitted. | Central Notice Home | Class Actions | Product Recalls | Missing Children | | Lawyer Find | Consumer Complaints | Contact Us | © 1996 The Notice Company, LLC.

Overcome the Challenges of Success Busy people, especially executives, with a strong drive to achieve sometimes fall into what might be called the achiever's trap. Achievers' traps are attitudes and behaviors that limit potential success and destroy creative drive. Consider these possible traps and take positive action to avoid them: Trap One: Doing too much � or not enough. Believe in others and give them the opportunity to accept responsibility for significant achievement. Accept that you can't do everything. However, giving too much of your own responsibilities to others who aren't adequately trained or who don't share your goals may impede your success. Maintain a written delegation plan that details what you plan to delegate and to whom, with checkpoints. Trap Two: Failure to recognize personal growth needs. Avoid assuming you've learned all you need to know. You still have more potential for achievement. Have a plan of action for personal growth and work toward challenging goals in all areas of your life. Trap Three: Accepting mediocrity. Pushing for excellence is hard work. Avoid making the mistake of accepting mediocre performance. The "average" isn't enough for one who aspires for real success. Demand outstanding results from yourself and from those associated with you. Keep constant checks on progress toward goals. Trap Four: Failure to use the best qualities of people. Study team members. Examine their strengths, goals and desires. Then, provide them with opportunities to learn new ideas that will make them more valuable as team members and more fulfilled as individuals. Trap Five: Ignoring problems or postponing solutions. The time to solve problems is before they occur. Carefully designed procedures prevent problems or provide for their proper handling if they occur. Hurdle obstacles quickly. Once a solution is found, implement it as quickly as possible. Trap Six: Incomplete communication. Make sure people clearly know what your goals are and how they can help you achieve them. Listen carefully to all information provided by others. Trap Seven: Failure to train a successor. If you want to move up in an organization, the quickest way is to train someone to do your job. By doing so, you're available for new responsibilities. If you're in the top position, train someone to succeed you. If no one is ready to succeed you, the organization may fall when you're no longer there to lead it. Working Effectively Internationally International business may create many obstacles but it also provides many promises. Most obstacles can be avoided if you prepare sufficiently ahead of time. Here are several suggestions: Speak slowly to your clients. Although most international business people speak English, many jargons and other items don't translate well. English may not be your client's first language so be aware of the differences. Respect instead of rejecting customs you find different. Don't brag about how things are done in your country. Simply state that you've never experienced anything of that manner before. Remember that nonverbal signs are different in other cultures. Eye contact and personal space change depending on who you're doing business with. Let your clients lead you along. In America, it's proper to get down to business early. In some cultures, it's offensive not to know your business associates on a personal level first. Adapt to the nuances of other cultures. You're the outsider and should change your habits to appease the locals. Get your hands on a guidebook ahead of time. Prepare Properly for Special Events Check for problems you might encounter before your special event occurs with the following checklist: Script what everyone will be doing during the event and ask each person to practice their role beforehand. Pick a good day to hold the event. If something else in your community will compete with you, schedule your event another day. Establish a planning committee that will assist you in all the planning and coordinating the event entails. A group is much more likely to select the proper individuals for each assignment required to pull off the event. Pre-plan what photos you want taken during the event. If there will be distinguished persons present, it's always nice to be photographed with them since such photos are impressive and can be used later by promoting purposes. Form a scrapbook committee. Ask these employees to compile all the brochures, photos, stories and other material procured from the event in a book and keep the book on file to use as a reference for your next event. Evaluate the event immediately afterwards. Record on paper things you feel were done well and things you'd like to do better the next time you plan an event. Dare to Succeed as a Manager Managing is much like being a member of a fraternity or other social group. Traditions and boundaries are rarely crossed and only by those who dare succeed as an individual. Do you have the self-confidence and courage to step out on your own? Or, are you satisfied with the status quo? To break out of the mold other managers have set for you, act upon these ideas: Never assume what works for others will work for you. You're a distinct person and have unique ideas that fit your personality and abilities. Believe in yourself and your ideas. Attend to possible problems before you propose a change. Dealing with obstacles ahead of time helps you pull off your plan with few hitches. Modify the ideas of others. Some ideas of others can be altered slightly to fit into your own personality style. Gather ideas from others. Your employees may have great ideas if you listen to them. Keep an open mind and listen to every idea, no matter what the person's position is within the organization. Dare to stand out from the crowd. Let others know that you desire to be successful and are willing to take steps to make it happen. Avoid these statements: "That's been done before. It won't work," "That's not how things are done around here," "Don't take chances," "Anything that obvious can't be right," or "That's too different." Remain positive in all situations.

Hurdle Setbacks in Record Time Accidents happen all the time. Some situations get blown out of proportion and require immediate attention to prevent serious consequences. Obviously, true emergencies must be handled immediately, which means pushing aside planned activities and rearranging schedules to take care of the emergency. Here's a game plan that is sure to carry your organization or yourself over temporary hurdles and back to normal business: Stay calm. Tell yourself, "I've solved more difficult problems under pressure. I can solve this one, too." Your calm, matter-of-fact acceptance of the situation and the assumption that it can be handled keep both you and others calm and able to bring the situation under control. Isolate the major consideration. When a crisis occurs, something will probably be lost as a result of the situation � either time, money, or materials. Decide what loss can be tolerated and what loss must be avoided. Isolate the root of the problem so you can immediately respond to the real issue. Your objective is to solve the problem and regain control without a crucial loss. Return conditions to normal as soon as possible. Make the suggestion, take the action, give the instructions, and let everything return to normal. The objective for leaders in crisis management is to take personal charge of the situation for only as long as you're needed. Learn something from the situation. The handling of the crisis situation should have a direct contribution to crisis prevention in the future. Direct Your Life With a Positive Outlook Disagreeable experiences of any kind � inconvenience, trouble, embarrassment, delays, loss, or unexpected effort � are triggers for negative emotions. But, to be effective, achievers must deal with their negative emotions and project a positive outlook in all situations. Achievers set goals, dedicate themselves to achieving them, concentrate on using their strengths, and work to turn weaknesses into strengths. Combining their positive qualities, achievers form an overall frame of mind, or positive outlook, that enables them to triumph over negative emotions. Through practice and repetition, you can develop positive habits of thinking just as you can develop positive habits of behavior. Your mind believes what you tell it, and your body receives directions from your mind. Tell yourself constantly that you can overcome negative emotions � your mind and body will obey you. By applying this truth in your life, you will be well on your way to possessing a positive mental outlook. Communicate more useful, positive emotions when you're faced with negative situations by using these suggestions: Honestly evaluate your present attitude. Get a clear picture of how you view yourself, others, and various situations. Identify attitudes you admire and those you would like to change. Then, set goals to make positive changes. Note people and situations that cause negative emotions to surface. Decide in advance how you intend to think, feel and act when an undesirable situation occurs. Visualize yourself handling the situation positively. Think before you act. Deliberately act the part as you've planned and visualized, regardless of how you feel at the moment. Resolve to keep a level head no matter what others say or do. Avoid harboring ill feelings. Realize that people have sufficient reasons for whatever they do or say at any given time. Try to be more understanding of others in negative situations. Dispose of regrets. Discard false hopes, drop impractical expectations, and identify and present new options for the future. Work with others to find positive solutions to problems. Put small, everyday pains out of your mind. Keep your thoughts focused on accomplishing your goals instead of on the pressures and obstacles that stand between you and reaching your goals. Let your positive outlook on life direct you to overcome negative emotions that stand between you and the success you deserve.

the summer Tyme Management� newsletter. The actual newsletter is 4 pages long and packed with useful articles to enrich your life. If you like what you see and would like more information, please email us at rpublish@rpublish.com. Put Off Procrastination - Tackle Tasks Today Procrastination is defined in the dictionary as "to put off until some later." Do you put things off until a later time? If so, you may have been bitten by the procrastination bug. Most people procrastinate in at least one area of their life � at home, at work, at school, and other areas. In fact, procrastination has made an appearance in everyone's life at some point. But if your goal is to succeed, defeating the procrastination bug is necessary and important to achieving your dreams. Consider these ways of defeating the procrastination bug: Break projects into smaller parts. In five minutes, you could complete a task that brings you closer to your goal. Set deadlines for yourself. Having a date to shoot for in each step will spur you onward. Hold yourself accountable to the deadlines you set. Consider all your high priority "to-dos" on your planner as immovable. They all must be accomplished before you can go home or move to the next task. Get started. Once the project is moving, procrastination problems disappear. Find a simpler way to do the same task. You may be making it harder than it actually is. Simplify and delegate. Use "free" time to work hard. When meetings or trips are canceled, use the time you had devoted to them to complete a lengthy project. Use your mood swings. When you're angry, tackle high-energy tasks and when you're calm, work on the deep thinking ones. Clear off your desk and concentrate only on one task. Design your work area productively. Keep all those items you use or need for projects nearby. Log your current time use. It may not take as long as you remember to complete each task. Review your log and look for ways to improve productivity. Do tasks before they pile up. Complete your correspondence duties when the mail arrives, for example. Enjoy your leisure time. This refreshes you so you work better. Avoid worry. Worrying only stresses you out. Give yourself rewards � small ones for each step along the way and larger ones for the final completion of a project. Add more time to your day. Get up earlier or take shorter lunches. You'll get more done and feel more satisfied. Rescuing Your Lost Time Time wasted is time lost. Most people don't intend to waste their time but end up doing just that with misguided efforts that they truly believe will save them time. Are you wasting your time? Any affirmative answers to the following questions means you could spend your time better: Do you worry about anything more than once a day? Worrying is a waste of time every time. Do you take days off work just because you feel like it? Getting away from work occasionally can refresh you but abuse of this can make you fall behind. Do you complete all your tasks yourself and seldom delegate to others? Realize that other people can do some of your tasks just as productively as you. Do you bother with too many details?

The Friendship Factor: Are You Being a Good Friend? An old expression claims that genuine friendship is like sound health; its value is seldom known until it's lost. We believe that friendship is not only similar to good health, but it also plays a key role in good health. For that reason, everyone should take time to develop and nurture genuine friendships. How Good a Friend Are You? To have a good friend, you must be a good friend, one willing to devote time and effort to the relationship. The following quiz will help determine how much you know about friendship: (Answer True or False) 1. Envy is a normal part of many friendships. 2. It's possible to have too many friends. 3. In selecting friends, you should look for people of similar age and with similar backgrounds. 4. It's more difficult to make friends now than 20 years ago. 5. It's possible to outgrow friends. 6. Friendships that are too strong can be harmful. 7. In our mobile society, long-term friendships are nearly impossible. 8. A male-female friendship is not always the first step toward romance, but can be a healthy sign of the times. 9. The best friendships are 50-50 kinds of relationships. 10. Some people find it very difficult to make friends. Answers: 1. True, but that doesn't mean it should destroy the relationship. Be honest about it; admit to your friends that they have a talent or quality you envy. They may respond with a similar "confession." 2. True, if your purpose is merely to clutter your social calendar and keep yourself so busy that you escape solitude. Most people maintain friendships of different degrees. Friends range from pleasant acquaintances to intimate soulmates. 3. False. It's healthy to have friends who span the age brackets and who represent different socioeconomic backgrounds. Acceptance is the key. For a friendship to flourish, friends must accept each other for what they are and not try to initiate changes. 4. True. Think of how our society has been altered in the last few decades: More women are in the workforce; life in the suburbs means longer commuting times; families are relocating more often; people are more security-minded and install fences and other "barriers"; the competitive nature of big business pits peers against each other in a survival-of-the-fittest kind of environment; and working couples, tired at the end of the week, choose to withdraw and get away rather than seek the company of others. 5. True. Two women may be drawn together because they have children involved in the same activities. The women work on committees together, share carpool duties and enjoy discussing their common interests. After the children are grown, the women find they have less and less to discuss. The relationship ends quietly and naturally. 6. True. It's possible to be too good a friend during a crisis and actually make an unhappy situation worse. First, you can hover over hurting friends and almost smother them with concern. Second, you can empathize with hurting friends to the point of adding to their suffering. By assuming their burden, you try to lighten it, but the opposite occurs. 7. False. They merely require more work. Several ingenious methods can keep friendships alive and well. Cassette tapes can be recorded and swapped by mail; long-distance phone visits can take place often; same-time-next-year vacations can be arranged at a location convenient to both. 8. True. Many men and women view each other as colleagues who share common interests and goals. No longer does a male-female relationship have to be based on romantic attractions. Men now feel less of a need to be macho with a female friend, and women don't try to be "one of the boys." 9. True. A one-way friendship can be the source of great anxiety. An equal give-and-take friendship develops both partners. 10. True. To make friends easily, you must project friendliness. This involves taking the risk of being rejected. Often, persons who are preoccupied with themselves aren't willing to show their vulnerability to others. Overcome Control Addiction With Deliberate Choices Most of us, to some degree or another, like to be in control. For some, the ability to take command, organize and exercise leadership is a positive strength. But this strength can quickly turn into a disastrous weakness when it disrupts our most important relationships � family relationships, friendships, and business relationships. At the point where our urge to control becomes compulsive, unrestrainable and destructive to relationships, it's become control addiction. Control-addicted people are often unaware that they have a problem � or that they create problems for other people. They tend to be so convinced of the correctness of their opinion, methods and priorities that they can scarcely tolerate anyone or anything that contradicts them. They tend to feel driven by a sense of duty and generally act superior on the outside while feeling inferior on the inside. Self Test: Do You Have a Control Addiction? Take the following quiz to see if you may be addicted to control. Check the statements below that apply to you: I hate to admit my weaknesses, even if they seem obvious to others. I get irritated when other people make mistakes. I tend to use words like should, ought, must, and can't when I'm talking to other people. I tend to do an important job myself because others might not do it right. I'm annoyed and upset more often than I'd like to be. Once I've formulated an opinion, I don't tend to change it. I stay away from people whose opinions are different from mine. When I'm working on a project, I often become so focused that I get irritated when people interrupt me and I tend to snap at them. I get impatient when other people can't understand what needs to be done. I would rather let people have a false favorable impression of me than be open and vulnerable. When someone tells me about a personal problem, I feel I have to find a solution. I use silence to punish those who disappoint or disagree with me. Before starting a project, I dwell on it constantly to be sure I'll do it just right. When someone else is in a foul mood, it puts me in a foul mood too. Critical thoughts come to my mind more often than I'd like. When someone confronts me about my opinions or beliefs, I immediately begin to formulate a rebuttal. I have a mental list of standards people should meet before I accept them. I sometimes resent having to do so much for my family. I'm uncomfortable when others share very personal emotions with me. The average person will check a few of these statements. If you checked fewer than five, you're very serene and composed � or else you need to see yourself more positively. If you checked five to eight statements, you're probably fairly normal. If you checked nine or more statements, you're a likely candidate for unnecessary emotional stress and tension � and you exhibit signs of a strong need to control. Your controlling tendencies are going to create problems for you and the people around you. They will continually interfere with your relationships, and with your happiness and self-esteem. Control-addicted people can free themselves from the need always to be right; they can give themselves and others the freedom to be human and to make mistakes. The key to recovery lies in (1) understanding the addiction and (2) yielding that addiction for healing. Yielding The Addiction How can this addiction be cured? It must be yielded, moment by moment. If you're a control addict, learn to make these deliberate choices: "I choose to let others be themselves." This means allowing your children to make their own mistakes and to be human. It means letting your spouse's imperfections slide past without comment, without resentment. It means giving more slack to your friends and employees. It also means not taking over and doing things for other people in the belief they won't do it right. It means you stop pushing others to get their work done, to get to an appointment on time and to do their work better. Instead, positively encourage others to be responsible for their actions � and step back and let them act. "I choose to let me be me." The same grace you're attempting to give to others you must also give to yourself. When you feel tempted to judge yourself for a mistake, stop. Say to yourself, "I'm only human." Give yourself the right to make mistakes � even an occasional relapse into old controlling patterns. Give yourself the right to make human mistakes. "I choose to live humbly." No more acting superior while feeling inferior. From now on, you don't have to be perfect, you don't have to be right, you don't have to hide your weaknesses, and you don't have to maintain an image. Try to see every irritation, setback, and disappointment in life as a chance to learn more about humility, and in time you'll see a pattern of humility seeping into your life. "I choose to be firm without being controlling." No one is suggesting you go from being a controller to being a pushover. You can still be firm in your convictions while being open-minded and a good listener. You can be a leader without being a controller. You can be organized without being a hyperperfectionist. Practice being assertively firm without resorting to sarcasm, manipulation, accusations, the silent treatment, or a coercive tone of voice.

Eating Disorders: Know The Signs Despite frantic efforts to revive her, Karen Carpenter was pronounced dead at the hospital at the age of 32. She had collapsed at her home and went into cardiac arrest. Cause of death: malnutrition, due to anorexia nervosa. A related affliction, bulimia, has also taken its toll of lives. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are closely related eating disorders. They are characterized by the compulsive drive to control weight by unhealthy means. Anorexia nervosa is defined as self-induced starvation resulting in extreme, often life-threatening weight loss. Bulimia is defined as a pattern of overindulging in food, followed by self-induced vomiting or abuse of laxatives in order to produce weight loss. Authorities estimate that about one percent of women between ages 12 and 25 suffer from anorexia, and about one and a half percent in that age group suffer from bulimia. These disorders are commonly seen as women's disorders, although about 10 percent of anorexics or bulimics are men. The effects of anorexia nervosa and bulimia are devastating to the medical , emotional, and even spiritual well-being. Some effects include: a menstrual cycle that stops temporarily or becomes irregular; digestive impairment, resulting from the abuse of laxatives; imbalance of electrolytes in the body, causing irregular heartbeat and in extreme cases heart failure and death; low white blood cell count (anemia) and impaired immune system; inflammation of the esophagus, resulting from self-induced vomiting; erosion of tooth enamel, owing to gastric acids from self-induced vomiting; brain and central nervous system disorders, including seizures; glandular dysfunctions, including thyroid abnormalities, resulting in fatigue; kidney problems; accumulation of abdominal fluids, resulting in a "potbelly"; hiatal hernias; low blood sugar, resulting in headaches and dizziness; musculoskeletal problems from potassium deficiency, resulting in muscle spasms, pain, and muscle atrophy; and dry skin and thinning hair. A key issue to be resolved in the recovery process for anorexia nervosa and bulimia is the issue of body image. Most anorexics and bulimics hate what they see when they look in the mirror. This condition, which Minirith Meier New Life Clinics calls body hate, is quite common, particularly among women, whether a person has an eating disorder or not. People with body hate dwell on the flaws and have little or no awareness of their positive features. Body hate is exacerbated by a culture that emphasizes standards of beauty that equate being attractive with being thin. In people with eating disorders, body hate takes on excessive proportions, compelling them to reach for an impossible ideal. What should you do if a close friend or loved one shows signs of anorexia or bulimia? Here are several steps to take: Lovingly confront them about their symptoms. Seek professional medical help for family members who are minors. Seek professional therapy and emotional support for them. Be candid about their appearance. Tell them if they look unhealthy. (Make sure your honesty is coated with love.) Listen and empathize. Let them sense your love and understanding. Avoid judging or criticizing. Show love and unconditional acceptance. Persevere during the healing process and seek always to demonstrate affection and acceptance, even when it's not easy. Source: The MMNLC Complete Life Encyclopedia (Thomas Nelson Publishers). Five Essentials to a Great Marriage There are 107 million married people in the United States and many of them are aching for a better marriage. In fact, it's predicted that 66 percent of all marriages that begin this year in the United States will end in separation or divorce. In an effort to discover how couples can move from having an ordinary relationship to an extraordinary marriage, Neil Clark Warren, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist from Pasadena, California, surveyed 100 couples with "extremely healthy" marriages to unveil their secrets. His research reveals that there are 10 "secrets" to creating a brilliant marriage � five of them are absolutely essential. The Five Essentials of a Great Marriage Dream a big dream for your marriage. Warren suggests a husband and wife construct a vision of everything their marriage can be. His research couples claimed that although they often lived day-by-day, they had a great overall vision for their relationships that guided their marriages. "Every couple needs to have a vision for their future," Warren says. "And they need to keep that vision up-to-date and carefully focused." Learn to talk. Master healthy communication. All the survey participants responded that communication will give couples the wherewithal to express the strongest desires of their hearts, the most profound thoughts of their brains, and the most sensitive concerns of their souls. Work it through. Conflict is inevitable so learn to handle it productively. Nearly 50 percent of all divorces take place within three years of the wedding day. This means a lot of couples can't resolve conflict. Warren's 30 years of clinical practice have taught him that the amount of conflict in a marriage only determines the speed at which the marriage is moving toward greatness or toward destruction. "Conflict, well managed, is like a stairway that can lead you to higher and higher levels of marital brilliance," he says. Negotiate a mutually satisfying sexual relationship. Work on chemistry. The 200 people in Warren's survey reported a broad range of sexual satisfaction. From his research, Warren believes that sex by itself usually isn't vital enough to devastate any marriage if other factions are sufficiently positive. But he's convinced that if every couple can be taught to improve their sexual relationship by just 10 percent, the divorce rate would be lowered by 10 percent. Pursue spirituality! Partners in great marriages find significance in their spiritual lives. The 100 couples in Warren's sample consistently cited some form of "spirituality" as crucial to the development of their extremely healthy marriages. They pointed out what's been recognized for a long time � that when a couple gets spiritually healthy, they automatically move a significant distance in the direction of marital oneness. Finally, Warren advised that most marriages are incredibly complex. They can't be revolutionized overnight, but can move from ordinary to magnificent over time.

from the fall Total Wellness� newsletter. The actual newsletter is eight pages long and packed with useful articles to enrich your life. If you like what you see, please consider subscribing to the complete newsletter. Get a Good Night's Rest Today, people tend to be working more and resting less. In fact, for most people, there aren't enough hours in the day for all that needs to be accomplished, so they steal from the night. According to the Better Sleep Council, over the last century, Americans have cut the average nightly hours of sleep by more than 20 percent. According to American Demographics, adults who sleep six or fewer hours each night are significantly more likely than those who get more sleep to feel stressed every day. In contrast, only 14 percent of adults who sleep seven to eight hours each night feel stress daily. Good sleep habits are vital to stress prevention. To build good sleep habits, consider the following: Stick to a schedule. Get up and go to bed at the same time each day. Exercise regularly. Exercise encourages sleep by burning off tensions. Avoid stimulants. Drink caffeinated drinks no closer than six to eight hours before your bedtime. Buy a good bed. Choose a bed that offers both comfort and support. Stop smoking. Nicotine is a stronger stimulant than caffeine. Skip the after-dinner drink. Alcohol makes it more difficult to stay asleep. Strive for quality sleep. Don't feel you have to sleep eight hours; seven may be enough for you. Set aside worries. Deal with them the next day. Skip high-fat snacks before bedtime. If you're hungry, eat a low-calorie snack, like a banana or an apple. Relax before going to bed. Listen to music, take a warm bath, or read a book before going to sleep. Keep your bedroom quiet, comfortable, dark and cool. Keep yourself warm with a blanket or comforter. Avoid using your bedroom as your office or television room. Lose weight. People who are overweight tend to snore more, which can lead to inadequate sleep. Be wary of over-the-counter sleep aids. Talk to your doctor about sleep medications. Run For the Health of It For those who haven't broken a sweat in some time, begin slowly with any exercise program. Just like a well-built house, a new running program will need to have a solid foundation first. The best way to establish this foundation is to mix walking and jogging when you begin your program. You should do your running regimen every other day or at least three days a week. To build your personalized running program, consider these precautions for exercising safely: Let your exercise endurance build gradually. Don't try to do too much too soon or soreness will set in and you won't want to continue exercising. Include stretching, warmup and cool-down segments in each running session. Stretching the major muscles will help you avoid injuries. Walking before running will warm your muscles up. And, walking again at the end and then stretching again will cool your body safely back down. Pay attention to pain warnings. If your joints, feet, ankles, or legs ache, it could be an early warning that further stress could result in a worse injury. Treat these painful warnings with rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. Stop exercising if you feel pain in your chest. This could be a sign of heart attack and further exercise could damage your heart seriously. Any pain or pressure in the left or mid-chest area, left neck, shoulder, or arm, sudden lightheadedness, cold sweat, pallor, or fainting should tell you to stop exercising and call your doctor. Suit your attire and preparation to your weather conditions: For hot and humid areas, exercise in the early morning before sunrise or early evening after the sunset when it's cooler, adapt to the heat for a week before undergoing rigorous routines, drink lots of water, look for the signs of heat stroke (dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, tiredness, lack of sweat, or dangerously high body temperature), wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes, and avoid wearing rubberized or plastic weight loss suits or sweatshirts and sweat pants since they won't help you lose weight any faster (you only sweat more) and could cause heat stroke. For cold areas, wear layered clothing but wear one less layer than you would if you were outside and not exercising, protect your hands with mittens, gloves, or cotton socks, and wear a hat or cap to retain heat since almost 40 percent of your body's heat is lost through your neck and head. For rainy, icy, or snowy areas, realize that visibility levels and traction will be lower for both you and any drivers on nearby roads. Eat meals at least two hours before you exercise and don't eat until at least 20 minutes after completing your exercising. Select good running shoes that have proper cushioning in the soles. Run on soft, even surfaces such as grass fields, dirt paths, or tracks instead of cement or hilly places that are rough on your feet and joints. As you run, land on the heels of your feet instead of on the balls of your feet to minimize strain on your feet and lower legs. Watch for cars and wear reflective clothing if you run on a road at night. You'll see cars well before their drivers see you. When weather does prevent your normal running routine, visit your local mall and walk for double the time you would have jogged. For more information, contact your local American Heart Association or call 1-800-242-8721. Fight Heart Disease with Heart Healthy Eating Your food habits are one of the major risk factors for heart disease, but you can control them! To decrease your risk of heart disease, your eating plan should contain less saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. The American Heart Association (AHA) suggests abiding by these guidelines: Your daily fat intake should be less than 30 percent of your total daily calories. Saturated fatty acid intake should be less than 10 percent of your total daily calories. Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake should be no more than 10 percent of your total daily calories. Monounsaturated fatty acids should be about 10 to 15 percent of your total daily calories. Cholesterol daily intake should not exceed 300 milligrams. Sodium intake should be no more than 3,000 milligrams daily. Since adhering to those more technical recommendations may be tedious with all the calculating, the AHA also wants to pass along these tips: Eat nonfat products. Fruits, vegetables and their juices are low in fat and valuable nutritionally. Other nonfat products can be substituted for their fatty counterparts with little or no loss of taste. For example, substitute angel food cake for devil's food cake or nonfat salad dressing for regular salad dressing. Select products low in fat. Use mustard, ketchup, or low-fat mayonnaise instead of regular mayonnaise to complement sandwiches. Choose baked foods over fried ones. Buy lean meats. Fish, chicken, turkey and lean cuts of beef and pork are wise choices. You should only have two to three servings of meat daily. A serving is three ounces or about the size of a deck of cards. Switch to low-fat milk. Work at gradually reducing the fat content of the milk you drink. Start with two percent, move to one percent, then to half percent and finally to skim milk. Low-fat buttermilk is a tasteful alternative to whole milk and substituting evaporated skim milk for cream or half-n-half is wise. Try low-fat and nonfat cheeses and dairy products. Instead of regular cheese, choose low- or nonfat varieties including cottage cheese, reduced-fat ricotta cheese and skim milk mozzarella cheese. Enjoy low-fat desserts. Enjoy a frozen fruit bar instead of an ice cream bar, and choose sherbet, frozen low-fat yogurt, or ice milk instead of traditional ice cream. Cut the fat out of your bread, cereal and pasta selections. Eat a bagel instead of a doughnut, cereal instead of pastries, and warm corn tortillas instead of biscuits. Baked potatoes and pasta are very low in fat if you avoid high-fat toppings. Eat eggs, but throw out the yolk first. Use the egg whites or choose an egg substitute to make scrambled eggs, omelets, nonfat frostings, cakes, cookies and muffins. Remember that it takes two egg whites to equal one whole egg. Avoid fried foods. Choose from baking, broiling, steaming, boiling, poaching, or microwaving. Learn to enjoy the true taste of foods. Avoid drowning in gravies, sauces and other toppings. Protect Against Periodontal Disease Daily brushing and flossing are essential to proper dental care. Without proper care, periodontal disease � disorders which affect the gums and other supporting structures around the teeth � may set in. If this happens you risk tooth loss, and if left untreated, bone damage. The symptoms of peridontal disease are: red and swollen gums, bad breath, gum bleeding when brushing teeth, sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods and liquids, and loose teeth. To avoid peridontal disease: Brush your teeth daily (at least twice). Use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Control oral bacteria with an antiseptic mouthwash. A mild solution of one part hydrogen peroxide to 10 parts water helps kill bacteria. Floss your teeth daily to remove plaque. Visit your dentist regularly. Get a Grip on Your Temper If you blow your top often over things that aren't all that important, you must get a grip on your anger before it takes over your life � and destroys your relationships. When you notice anger creeping up on you, challenge it by taking these steps: Negotiate peace. Replace your anger-producing thoughts with thoughts of mercy toward others. Offer alternatives to becoming angry. Instead of growing angry toward someone who is short with you, put yourself in their shoes before passing judgment. Write a peace treaty. Jot down thoughts and other items that ignite your anger and analyze them realistically. This will usually cause you to see situations more rationally. Get your mind off your anger. Take a break by distracting yourself with something you enjoy. Stop what you're doing and exercise. Exercise produces endorphins in the brain which naturally improve your mood. Relaxation techniques work just as well. Try taking several deep breaths if exercise isn't possible. Let your anger take its course � alone. Go somewhere by yourself for at least 20 minutes. Return with a relaxed mind and look at the anger-producing situation with clear thoughts. Develop Self-Discipline to Succeed Would you like to improve the quality of your life? Then commit to positive lifestyle changes and overcome self-defeating habits. To do so, develop the power of self-discipline. Self-discipline means you work wholeheartedly and continuously toward a goal until it's achieved. Develop your self-discipline with these easy steps: Decide upon your mission. Write down five things you want most in life. Some may seem dreamy but others will be achievable. Combine them into one statement that summarizes your goals in life. Set goals. Goals work as self-fulfilling prophecies. Whatever level of success you set your sights on is usually as high as you'll go. So, set your goals high. Take action consistently. Obstacles may impede your progress. Jump over them by identifying possible obstacles ahead of time so you can handle them efficiently and productively if they occur. Keep going even through obstacles. Visualize your success. Close your eyes and see yourself as the success you want to be. Your brain often converts images into reality. Enjoy the pursuit of your goals. If you truly desire goal achievement, you'll enjoy working toward the goals. Pursue your goals with a positive attitude. Focus on the tasks at hand. Life in today's society is complex. To truly succeed, you have to be able to forget about other matters and concentrate on what's happening before you. Eliminate excuses. When you falter from time to time, don't fall back into old patterns by using an excuse. Focus on what you've already accomplished. Reward yourself. When you achieve your goal, take time to reward yourself because you worked hard to get where you are. Pinpoint Your Body's Peak Times During the day, your body undergoes many changes. Your mental, physical and emotional condition goes through summits, plateaus and valleys. Your body has a definite rhythm in which your blood pressure, body temperature, hormonal production and other bodily functions follow. Some people rise early in the morning and spring forward to face their day but start running on empty in the early evening. Others begin their day slowly but hit their peak in the early evening and work late into the night. Good timing of daily activities is important. Most studies would agree that there really is a "best time" to do things. Consider these tips: Eat wise. In most cases, modern research supports this advice, "Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper." This eating plan can improve energy levels and help you lose weight since your body burns more calories while you're active. Exercise when it's best for you. If you're trying to lose weight, working out at lunch or before dinner may suppress your appetite. If you work, exercising during lunch time may help you overcome the afternoon "slump" at the office. If you do work out during lunch, also be sure to eat a light, healthy lunch. And remember, exercising too close to bedtime may make you so charged up you can't sleep. Map your ups and downs. If you struggle with figuring out your rhythm, keep a log of your accomplishments during the day. Review the times of the day when you tend to accomplish the most. Then, focus on important activities during these times. Take your medications on time. Whether you take your medication during the day or night can make a difference in what it does to your body. Always follow your doctor's advice on when to take medications. Educate yourself when you're ready to learn. The best time to learn is when you feel your alertness is in full swing. Often, late-night studying may give you the edge on tomorrow's test, but not on long-term recall. Go To Previous Sneak Peeks Subscription Information Go to the Total Wellness� main page.

Rutherford Publishing, Inc. Total Wellness� History Total Wellness� is published by Rutherford Publishing, Inc., which is part of a family of companies dedicated to helping people reach their full potential. Paul J. Meyer founded the first company, Success Motivation Institute, Inc. (SMI), in 1960. SMI is the world's largest producer of programs on personal goal setting, sales management, time management, sales training, and management training. All of the SMI programs and courses, which are translated into 17 languages and sold in more than 60 countries, are based on the Total Person Concept� . The Total Person Concept� , which focuses on the six areas of life that together make up the total person, was established by Paul J. Meyer 35 years ago. The Total Person Concept� developed into the Total Wellness� newsletter in September, 1993, when Rutherford Publishing, Inc. joined the Paul J. Meyer family of more than 40 companies. Concept Rutherford Publishing, Inc. believes that wellness is a way of life. Total Wellness� is based on the Total Person Concept� , which was taught by Paul J. Meyer more than 35 years ago and applied to over 20 full-length personal and professional improvement programs and courses.

Test Your Skills: Do You Lead Effective Meetings? Conducting business meetings requires a talent of its own. In no other arena do you have to be leader, encourager, entertainer, speaker, listener, and facilitator all at the same time. Do you have what it takes to lead an effective meeting? Take this quiz to find out. (Answer True or False) 1. Weekly staff meetings are a good idea to keep everyone on track for the week's work. 2. Body language is less important in meetings than it is during non-meeting occasions. 3. Conference calls and computer conferencing can never replace traditional in-person meetings. 4. Always attend meetings yourself. Sending another person insults the person who called the meeting and intimidates the person you send. 5. You should group your meetings together consecutively during one morning. 6. Meeting times should be made in advance along with the meeting's ending times. 7. You should schedule a "meeting with yourself" if you're having a difficult time finding the time to complete your own tasks. 8. The more people invited to the meeting the better the outcome will be because more people will be informed at the same time. 9. At any meeting you attend, you have the right to demand a competent leader even if that means taking over the meeting yourself. 10. Monday morning, bright and early, is the best time for a meeting because everyone is refreshed from the weekend break. 11. A meeting agenda isn't necessary unless the leader needs it. 12. Meetings must begin without any social conversations beforehand. Answers: 1. False. If meetings are held regularly, they could become stale. It's better to call meetings on an "as-needed" basis. 2. False. Body language is immensely valuable in the meeting atmosphere. Nonverbal communications such as raised eyebrows, nods and notebooks closing signal distinct messages. 3. False. Conference calls, video conferences and computer conferences are becoming valuable in replacing the cost in money and time of having in-person meetings. Yet, face-to-face meetings are still needed in some instances. 4. False. Your colleagues should understand that whoever you send is totally competent of representing you. And, your employees should jump at the chance to learn and grow by attending meetings for you. 5. True. When you have meetings back-to-back and crammed into one morning, you have a viable reason to end each meeting on time � to get to your next meeting. 6. True. Open-ended meetings tend to stay unfocused. Ideally, each item to be discussed in the meeting should have an allotted time frame. When the time is up, the leader should summarize and move to the next topic or end the meeting. 7. True. Scheduling this "meeting" into your daily plan allows you an excuse to say "No" to the requests of others for your time � you have a meeting to attend. 8. False. More effort must be exerted to lead a meeting with each person added to its attendance. Keeping a multitude of people focused is often impossible. If you desire nothing more than to share information and don't want any give-and-take, a large meeting is probably okay. 9. True. Unless you're part of the upper level of leaders in your organization, this may be difficult for you to accomplish but you can do your part to keep the meeting focused on its intent. When meeting with peers, go ahead and take control yourself if the meeting is going nowhere. 10. False. Mondays and Fridays are the worst meeting days. On Mondays, everyone needs time to plan for the week and read the weekend's mail. On Fridays, people are winding down for the weekend. Wednesday mornings are the best times for meetings because everyone will be in their "work mode" and in high gear. 11. False. An agenda should be the cornerstone of every meeting. Ideally, it should be completed and given to meeting attendees a few days before the meeting. 12. False. Social talk tends to "soften" the atmosphere. Keep the conversation to a minimum and start the meeting on time. Motivating Employees To Change Behavior As a leader and manager, one of your primary responsibilities is to get your employees to produce desirable results through specific behaviors. To do this, many times you have to get them to actually change their behavior patterns. The key principle to understand in changing employees' behavior is that you can't change it for them; they must change it themselves. With that principle in mind, the following is how to motivate employees to change their behavior: I. Identify the Desired Behavior You Want the Employee to Have To help you identify the desired behavior, apply these principles: A. Behavior is something the employee does. Attitudes and feelings aren't behavior. B. The outcome or result of the behavior must be positive and help you and the employee reach your goals. The behavior must also be meaningful to the employee. C. The behavior must be specific and easy to understand. For example, scheduling interviews, closing sales, calculating cash receipts, etc. D. The behavior must be easy to measure accurately. II. Communicate the Behavior You Want and Be Sure the Employee Understands What You Expect in Terms of: A. The specific behavior you want. B. The benefits of mastering the behavior. C. The consequences of not executing the behavior. III. Keep Score A. Score keeping must be seen as helpful and positive. B. Accurate score keeping motivates people to do better. Personal biases of management are removed. Results are rewarded. C. Score keeping can make work fun. IV. Evaluate the Results of Keeping Score A. How did the employee do in mastering the behavior? B. What went well? C. What went wrong? How can it be corrected? V. Dealing With the Consequences A. Reinforce the desired behavior. With reinforcement, the employee will adopt the new behavior. Without it, the past behavior will return. B. In the absence of a positive and/or negative reinforcement, you will get behavior at a level just above the point of punishment or the minimum acceptable. C. When negative behavior is exhibited by an employee: 1. Give a warning and explain in depth the new behavior you expect; 2. Give frequent feedback on the spot. Don't wait! Don't store up criticisms; 3. Be sure the feedback you give is appropriate. VI. Encourage Positive Productive Behaviors Form the habit of complimenting your employees for their accomplishments to reinforce the desirable behavior. Even though an inept employee behaves as you want about 80 percent of the time, most managers tend to reinforce behavior in the opposite ratio. They typically give four reprimands or criticisms for each compliment. A. Use intrinsic (internal) rewards as opposed to extrinsic (external) rewards. B. Give positive "strokes" for positive behavior quickly and often. Give strokes honestly and unconditionally. Don't give them and take them away by adding comments such as "that was great, but I know you can do better." C. Don't penalize the employee you're rewarding by adding work to their jobs unless you're certain they want added responsibilities and duties. VII. Evaluate and Adjust Evaluate the results of the behavior. Did you and the employee succeed in reaching goals? Where do you go from here? In motivating you employees to change their behavior, one of the key criterions is that you and the employee both agree that the behavior needs to be changed and that both know exactly what the desirable behavior is. By having this clear understanding, you're both able to continuously monitor and observe the actual behavior. This allows you to deal with it immediately and make the proper adjustments. What most employees tend to do is "keep the water muddy" by not having this clear understanding with their managers. To effectively help employees change their behavior, clear understanding and accountability is an absolute must. Use these principles to get the most out of yourself and your people.

The actual newsletter is eight pages long and packed with useful articles to enrich your life. If you like what you see, please consider subscribing to the complete newsletter. Keeping Your Cool In a Heat Wave Many people enjoy the warmth and sunshine of long summer days. However, many of these same people overdo activities and suffer heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and life-threatening heat strokes. According to the American Red Cross, heat can affect anyone. The key is to know how to prevent emergencies from occurring in the first place. Consider these heat wave safety tips: Slow down. Avoid strenuous activities outside between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. If you must do strenuous activities, do them during the coolest part of the day, which is usually in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. Stay inside. Air conditioning keeps you cool. If air conditioning isn't available, stay on the lowest level of the house, out of the sunshine. Electric, or ceiling, fans can help sweat evaporate, which cools your body. Dress lightly. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing. Light colors will reflect away some of the sun's energy. Drink water. Nothing satisfies thirst better than water. Drink plenty of water, even if you don't feel thirsty. Avoid drinks with alcohol or caffeine in them. They can make you feel good briefly, but make the heat's effect on your body worse. This is especially true of beer, which actually dehydrates the body. Eat small meals, more often. Choose lighter foods and fewer proteins, which increase metabolic heat. Avoid using salt tablets unless directed to do so by your doctor. If you exercise outdoors, follow these safety rules: Build up resistance to the heat slowly. Know your limits and slow down when you tire. Exercise early in the morning or late in the evening. Carry a water bottle. Drink a few ounces every 15 minutes and try squirting some water on your body to cool off. Stay in the shade. For example, pick a jogging or biking route through a shaded area. Stop if you begin to feel woozy. Go inside and drink water. Call for help if the feeling doesn't subside. Heart Disease: A Preventable Disaster If a natural disaster wiped out a million North Americans, the whole world would panic. But that many people die each year from the personal disaster of heart disease. To reduce your risk of heart disease, apply these suggestions: Control your blood pressure. High blood pressure causes constant high-pressured pumping which can wear out the heart and blood vessels. Cut salt in your diet and increase your potassium and calcium intake. Eat bananas, potatoes and low-fat dairy products, like yogurt and skim milk, which have potassium and calcium. Shed extra pounds. Risk rises as weight goes up. But don't be the victim of the latest fad diets. Lose weight gradually by eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol, high-fiber diet. Avoid excessive alcohol. Drinking weakens kidneys and stiffens the arteries. Studies show that people who have three or more drinks a day have higher blood pressure than those who drink less. Control stress. Suppressing anger, anxiety and other emotions tightens blood vessel walls and increases the heart's output. Reduce stress with these activities: deep breathing, exercise, volunteer work, gardening, prayer, talking with friends, playing with a pet, or any other activity that relaxes you. Seek help - talk to a friend or counselor, or join a support group. Snuff out cigarettes. Tobacco products contribute to high blood pressure and increase your risk of heart disease. Talk to your doctor about how to stop your smoking habit. Eat fish. Fish contain heart-saving omega-3 fatty acids, which help cut cholesterol. Some of the best types of fish to eat are salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout and haddock. Munch on apples. Apples contain pectin, a soluble fiber which helps reduce your cholesterol level. Exercise regularly. Exercise can break down plaque and send it to the liver for disposal. Exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes. But avoid jumping into a fitness program. Start slowly and work up. Get checked regularly. Have your blood pressure, cholesterol level, weight and general health monitored regularly by your doctor. For more information, contact your local American Heart Association or call 1-800-242-8721. Analyzing Risk of Early Heart Attack The fatal heart attack of the 28-year-old Russian skater Sergei Grinkov is an example of how heart disease can strike in an instant without warning. However, Grinkov had a high cholesterol reading, high blood pressure and a family history of heart disease. For most people under age 44, the risk of heart attack is small. But for people with a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure, statistics are less than comforting. Smoking, being overweight, or having diabetes can also increase risk. Does your present lifestyle predestine you to heart disease? Check the statements below that describe your lifestyle: Your blood pressure is checked regularly. You exercise at least 30 minutes, three times a week. Your weight is within your recommended amount. You don't smoke and try to avoid secondhand smoke. You eat a balanced diet and limit your intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. If you checked less than five, set new goals and strive to lead a more healthy lifestyle.

Work Out Your Wintertime Blues When old man winter blows into town, will you stay inside or will you venture outside and continue your outdoor workout as usual? Cold weather doesn't have to mean an end to outdoor exercising. Many people find running, cycling, skiing, or walking outdoors in the winter a good way to avoid the wintertime blues. To continue exercising outside, simply make allowances for the weather and adjust your workout appropriately. Here are suggestions to help you continue to have an exhilarating outdoor workout, despite the cold: Warm up inside. Jog in place and stretch all of your major muscle groups inside before going outside. Drink plenty of fluids. In colder weather, your body has the added responsibility of warming and moistening the cold air you breathe. Drink water before, during and after your workouts. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks since both can dehydrate your body. Alcohol may also give a false sense of warmth. Withstand the wind chill. The wind chill can drop temperatures drastically. To lessen the wind's effect, move against it at the beginning of your workout and keep it behind you as you finish your workout. This allows you to get the worst over at the onset before you become tired. Be reflective. In the winter, daylight hours are shorter and vision ranges are distorted by weather conditions. Wear reflective clothing that will stand out against your surroundings. Move constantly. If you have to stop exercising while outside, put on extra clothing before you get cold. Try to stay in constant motion while you're outside in the winter cold. Be cautious. Exercising on snow or ice isn't worth risking your health. If you exercise through snow, slow your pace and wear shoes with good traction. Avoid exercising on wet ice or snow. Exercise indoors if weather conditions are extremely harsh. Protect your skin and sight. Wear sunglasses and sunscreen when outside. Snow cover reflects sunlight which burns skin quickly and can hinder your vision. Cool down inside. Jog in place and stretch your major muscle groups once inside again to cool down. Suit Up for Safe Winter Exercising Journeying out for a jog in cold weather takes preparation to keep yourself warm. When preparing for outdoor exercise, consider the following tips: Layer your clothes. The first layer should remove perspiration, the second layer should supply warmth, and the third layer should protect against wind and rain. Wear jackets with zippers so you can unzip them when you begin to sweat or remove them as you warm up. Wear thin socks that repel water away from your feet underneath thick wool socks for warmth. Stay on your feet. Choose shoes that have good traction and shock absorption for the surface you'll be exercising on. Wear shoes big enough to fit an extra pair of socks in without cramping your feet. Cover your head. Most of the heat your body loses escapes through your head. Wear a cap, hat, hood, ski mask, or scarf to prevent heat loss. Wear either mittens or gloves to warm your hands. Make sure your choice is waterproof.

The naturalproduction of ions and ozone in the "great outdoors" automaticallycontrols both of these types of pollutants in natural environments. Ionsare molecules that carry a charge of electricity. Ions are typically foundin the outdoors at a ratio of 4 negative ions to 3 positive ions. Indoors,there are very few ions and the balance is mostly positive ions. When addingnegative ions to an environment, airborne particles take on an electroniccharge and become attracted to oppositely charged particles. Consequently,airborne particles will either: a) fall out of the air due to the gravitationalpull on their accumulated weight, or b) be attracted to 'grounded' objects(similar to the attraction of lightning to the earth). Either way, theparticles are taken out of your breathing space. Ozoneis three atoms of oxygen combined. It is extremely reactive with hundredsof gaseous organic compounds. Ozone breaks the majority of these compoundsinto harmless/odorless carbon dioxide and water vapor. This process iscalled "oxidation", and is probably second only to fire in itseffectiveness at neutralizing volatile organic substances. Aero�Purepurifiers (except for the Decon {ozone only} and Ion-15 {ions only} models)emit both negative ions and low levels of ozone. They generate a4-to-3 negative-to-positive ion ratio approximating the levels found naturallyoutdoors; and the level of ozone produced is fully adjustable so that youcan tailor its output to your particular needs. Negative ions and ozonetogether are what make Aero�Pure purifiers a "two-pronged attack"on indoor air pollution.

Outdoor air pollution in cities is a major health problem. Much effortand money continues to be spent cleaning up pollution in the outdoor air.But air pollution can be a problem where you least expect it, in the placeyou may have thought was safest--your home. Many ordinary activities suchas cooking, heating, cooling, cleaning, and redecorating can cause therelease and spread of indoor pollutants at home. Studies have shown thatthe air in our homes can be even more polluted than outdoor air. Many Americans spend up to 90 percent of their time indoors, often athome. Therefore, breathing clean indoor air can have an important impacton health. People who are inside a great deal may be at greater risk ofdeveloping health problems, or having problems made worse by indoor airpollutants. These people include infants, young children, the elderly,and those with chronic illnesses. What Are Biological Pollutants? Biological pollutants are or were living organisms. They promote poorindoor air quality and may be a major cause of days lost from work or school,and of doctor and hospital visits. Some can even damage surfaces insideand outside your house. Biological pollutants can travel through the airand are often invisible. Some common indoor biological pollutants are: Animal Dander (minute scales from hair, feathers, or skin) Dust Mite and Cockroach parts Fungi (Molds) Infectious agents (bacteria or viruses) Pollen Some of these substances are in every home. It is impossible to getrid of them all. Even a spotless home may permit the growth of biologicalpollutants. Two conditions are essential to support biological growth:nutrients and moisture. These conditions can be found in many locations,such as bathrooms, damp or flooded basements, wet appliances (such as humidifiersor air conditioners), and even some carpets and furniture. Modern materials and construction techniques may reduce the amount ofoutside air brought into buildings which may result in high moisture levelsinside. Using humidifiers, unvented heaters, and air conditioners in ourhomes has increased the chances of moisture forming on interior surfaces.This encourages the growth of certain biological pollutants. The Scope Of The Problem Most information about sources and health effects of biological pollutantsis based on studies of large office buildings and two surveys of homesin northern U.S. and Canada. These surveys show that 30% to 50% of allstructures have damp conditions which may encourage the growth and buildupof biological pollutants. This percentage is likely to be higher in warm,moist climates. Some diseases or illnesses have been linked with biological pollutantsin the indoor environment. However, many of them also have causes unrelatedto the indoor environment. Therefore, we do not know how many health problemsrelate only to poor indoor air. Health Effects Of Biological Pollutants All of us are exposed to biological pollutants. However, the effectson our health depend upon the type and amount of biological pollution andthe individual person. Some people do not experience health reactions fromcertain biological pollutants, while others may experience one or moreof the following reactions: Allergic Infectious Toxic Except for the spread of infections indoors, ALLERGIC REACTIONSmay be the most common health problem with indoor air quality in homes.They are often connected with animal dander (mostly from cats and dogs),with house dust mites (microscopic animals living in household dust), andwith pollen. Allergic reactions can range from mildly uncomfortable tolife-threatening, as in a severe asthma attack. Some common signs and symptomsare: Watery eyes Runny nose and sneezing Nasal congestion Itching Coughing Wheezing and difficulty breathing Headache Fatigue Health experts are especially concerned about people with asthma. Thesepeople have very sensitive airways that can react to various irritants,making breathing difficult. The number of people who have asthma has greatlyincreased in recent years. The number of people with asthma has gone upby 59 percent since 1970, to a total of 9.6 million people. Asthma in childrenunder 15 years of age has increased 41 percent in the same period, to atotal of 2.6 million children. The number of deaths from asthma is up by68 percent since 1979, to a total of almost 4,400 deaths per year. INFECTIOUS DISEASES caused by bacteria and viruses, such as flu,measles, chicken pox, and tuberculosis, may be spread indoors. Most infectiousdiseases pass from person to person through physical contact. Crowded conditionswith poor air circulation can promote this spread. Some bacteria and virusesthrive in buildings and circulate through indoor ventilation systems. Forexample, the bacterium causing Legionnaire's disease, a serious and sometimeslethal infection, and Pontiac Fever, a flu-like illness, have circulatedin some large buildings. Talking To Your Doctor Are you concerned about the effects on your health that may be relatedto biological pollutants in your home? Before you discuss your concernswith your doctor, you should know the answers to the following questions.This information can help the doctor determine whether your health problemsmay be related to biological pollution. Does anyone in the family have frequent headaches, fevers, itchy wateryeyes, a stuffy nose, dry throat, or a cough? Does anyone complain of feelingtired or dizzy all the time? Is anyone wheezing or having difficultiesbreathing on a regular basis? Did these symptoms appear after you moved to a new or different home? Do the symptoms disappear when you go to school or the office or goaway on a trip, and return when you come back? Have you recently remodelled your home or done any energy conservationwork, such as installing insulation, storm windows, or weather stripping?Did your symptoms occur during or after these activities? Does your home feel humid? Can you see moisture on the windows or onother surfaces, such as walls and ceilings? What is the usual temperature in your home? Is it very hot or cold? Have you recently had water damage? Is your basement wet or damp? Is there any obvious mold or mildew? Does any part of your home have a musty or moldy odor? Is the air stale? Do you have pets? Do your house plants show signs of mold? Do you have air conditioners or humidifiers that have not been properlycleaned? Does your home have cockroaches or rodents? TOXIC REACTIONS are the least studied and understood health problemcaused by some biological air pollutants in the home. Toxins can damagea variety of organs and tissues in the body, including the liver, the centralnervous system, the digestive tract, and the immune system. Coping With the Problem Checking Your Home There is no simple and cheap way to sample the air in your home to determinethe level of all biological pollutants. Experts suggest that sampling forbiological pollutants is not a useful problem-solving tool. Even if youhad your home tested, it is almost impossible to know which biologicalpollutant(s) cause various symptoms or health problems. The amount of mostbiological substances required to cause disease is unknown and varies fromone person to the next. Does this make the problem sound hopeless? On the contrary, you cantake several simple, practical actions to help remove sources of biologicalpollutants, to help get rid of pollutants, and to prevent their return. Self-Inspection: A Walk Through Your Home Begin by touring your household. Follow your nose, and use your eyes.Two major factors help create conditions for biological pollutants to grow:nutrients and constant moisture with poor air circulation. Dust and construction materials, such as wood, wallboard, and insulation,contain nutrients that allow biological pollutants to grow. Firewood alsois a source of moisture, fungi, and bugs. Appliances such as humidifiers, kerosene and gas heaters, and gas stovesadd moisture to the air. A musty odor, moisture on hard surfaces, or even water stains, maybe caused by: Air-conditioning units Basements, attics, and crawlspaces Bathrooms Carpets Heating and air-conditioning ducts Humidifiers and dehumidifiers Refrigerator drip pans What You Can Do About Biological Pollutants Before you give away the family pet or move, there are less drasticsteps that can be taken to reduce potential problems. Properly cleaningand maintaining your home can help reduce the problem and may avoid interruptingyour normal routine. People who have health problems such as asthma, orare allergic, may need to do this and more. Discuss this with your doctor. Moisture Control Water in your home can come from many sources. Water can enter yourhome by leaking or by seeping through basement floors. Showers or evencooking can add moisture to the air in your home. The amount of moisturethat the air in your home can hold depends on the temperature of the air.As the temperature goes down, the air is able to hold less moisture. Thisis why, in cold weather, moisture condenses on cold surfaces (for example,drops of water form on the inside of a window). This moisture can encouragebiological pollutants to grow. There are many ways to control moisture in your home: Fix leaks and seepage. If water is entering the house from the outside,your options range from simple landscaping to extensive excavation andwaterproofing. (The ground should slope away from the house.) Water inthe basement can result from the lack of gutters or a water flow towardthe house. Water leaks in pipes or around tubs and sinks can provide aplace for biological pollutants to grow. Put a plastic cover over dirt in crawlspaces to prevent moisture fromcoming in from the ground. Be sure crawlspaces are well-ventilated. Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens to remove moisture to theoutside (not into the attic). Vent your clothes dryer to the outside. Turn off certain appliances (such as humidifiers or kerosene heaters)if you notice moisture on windows and other surfaces. Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners, especially in hot, humid climates,to reduce moisture in the air, but be sure that the appliances themselvesdon't become sources of biological pollutants. Raise the temperature of cold surfaces where moisture condenses. Useinsulation or storm windows. (A storm window installed on the inside worksbetter than one installed on the outside.) Open doors between rooms (especiallydoors to closets which may be colder than the rooms) to increase circulation.Circulation carries heat to the cold surfaces. Increase air circulationby using fans and by moving furniture from wall corners to promote airand heat circulation. Be sure that your house has a source of fresh airand can expel excessive moisture from the home. Pay special attention to carpet on concrete floors. Carpet can absorbmoisture and serve as a place for biological pollutants to grow. Use arearugs which can be taken up and washed often. In certain climates, if carpetis to be installed over a concrete floor, it may be necessary to use avapor barrier (plastic sheeting) over the concrete and cover that withsub-flooring (insulation covered with plywood) to prevent a moisture problem. Moisture problems and their solutions differ from one climate to another.The Northeast is cold and wet; the Southwest is hot and dry; the Southis hot and wet; and the Western Mountain states are cold and dry. All ofthese regions can have moisture problems. For example, evaporative coolersused in the Southwest can encourage the growth of biological pollutants.In other hot regions, the use of air conditioners which cool the air tooquickly may prevent the air conditioners from running long enough to removeexcess moisture from the air. The types of construction and weatherizationfor the different climates can lead to different problems and solutions. Maintain And Clean AU Appliances That Come In Contact With Water Have major appliances, such as furnaces, heat pumps and central airconditioners, inspected and cleaned regularly by a professional, especiallybefore seasonal use. Change filters on heating and cooling systems accordingto manufacturer's directions. (In general, change filters monthly duringuse.) When first turning on the heating or air conditioning at the startof the season, consider leaving your home until it airs out. Have window or wall air-conditioning units cleaned and serviced regularlyby a professional, especially before the cooling season. Air conditionerscan help reduce the entry of allergy-causing pollen. But they may alsobecome a source of biological pollutants if not properly maintained. Cleanthe coils and incline the drain pans according to manufacturer's instructions,so water cannot collect in pools. Have furnace-attached humidifiers cleaned and serviced regularly bya professional, especially before the heating season. Follow manufacturer's instructions when using any type of humidifier.Experts differ on the benefits of using humidifiers. If you do use a portablehumidifier (approximately 1 to 2 gallon tanks), be sure to empty its tankevery day and refill with distilled or demineralized water, or even freshtap water if the other types of water are unavailable. For larger portablehumidifiers, change the water as recommended by the manufacturer. Unplugthe appliance before cleaning. Every third day, clean all surfaces comingin contact with water with a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide, using abrush to loosen deposits. Some manufacturers recommend using diluted householdbleach for cleaning and maintenance, generally in a solution of one-halfcup bleach to one gallon water. When using any household chemical, rinsewell to remove all traces of chemical before refilling humidifier. Empty dehumidifiers daily and clean often. If possible, have the appliancedrip directly into a drain. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaningand maintenance. Always disconnect the appliance before cleaning. Clean refrigerator drip pans regularly according to manufacturer'sinstructions. If refrigerator and freezer doors don't seal properly, moisturemay build up and mold can grow. Remove any mold on door gaskets and replacefaulty gaskets. Clean Surfaces Clean mold surfaces, such as showers and kitchen counters. Remove meld from walls, ceilings, floors, and panelling. Do not simplycover mold with paint, stain, varnish, or a moisture-proof sealer, as itmay resurface. Replace moldy shower curtains, or remove them and scrub well with ahousehold cleaner and rinse before rehanging them. Dust Control Controlling dust is very important for people who are allergic to animaldander and mites. You cannot see mites, but you can either remove theirfavorite breeding grounds or keep these areas dry and clean. Dust mitescan thrive in sofas, stuffed chairs, carpets, and bedding. Open shelves,fabric wallpaper, knickknacks, and venetian blinds are also sources ofdust mites. Dust mites live deep in the carpet and are not removed by vacuuming.Many doctors suggest that their mite-allergic patients use washable arearugs rather than wall-to-wall carpet. Always wash bedding in hot water (at least 130� F) to kill dust mites.Cold water won't do the job. Launder bedding at least every 7 to 10 days. Use synthetic or foam rubber mattress pads and pillows, and plasticmattress covers if you are allergic. Do not use fuzzy wool blankets, featheror wool-stuffed comforters, and feather pillows. Clean rooms and closets well; dust and vacuum often to remove surfacedust. Vacuuming and other cleaning may not remove all animal dander, dustmite material, and other biological pollutants. Some particles are so smallthey can pass through vacuum bags and remain in the air. If you are allergicto dust, wear a mask when vacuuming or dusting. People who are highly allergy-proneshould not perform these tasks. They may even need to leave the house whensomeone else is cleaning Before You Move Protect yourself by inspecting your potential new home. If you identifyproblems, have the landlord or seller correct them before you move in,or even consider moving elsewhere. Have professionals check the heating and cooling system, includinghumidifiers and vents. Have duct lining and insulation checked for growth. Check for exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens. If there are no vents,do the kitchen and bathrooms have at least one window apiece? Does thecooktop have a hood vented outside? Does the clothes dryer vent outside?Are all vents to the outside of the building, not into attics or crawlspaces? Look for obvious mold growth throughout the house, including attics,basements, and crawlspaces, and around the foundation. See if there aremany plants close to the house, particularly if they are damp and rotting.They are a potential source of biological pollutants. Downspouts from roofgutters should route water away from the building. Look for stains on the walls, floor or carpet (including any carpetover concrete floors) as evidence of previous flooding or moisture problems.Is there moisture on windows and surfaces? Are there signs of leaks orseepage in the basement? Look for rotted building materials which may suggest moisture or waterdamage. If you or anyone else in the family has a pet allergy, ask if any petshave lived in the home. Examine the design of the building. Remember that in cold climates,overhanging areas, rooms over unheated garages, and closets on outsidewalls may be prone to problems with biological pollutants. Look for signs of cockroaches. Where Biological Pollutants May Be Found In The Home Dirty air conditioners Dirty humidifiers and/or dehumidifiers Bathroom without vents or windows Kitchen without vents or windows Dirty refrigerator drip pans Laundry room with unvented dryer Unventilated attic Carpet on damp basement floor Bedding Closet on outside wall Dirty heating/air conditioning system dogs or cats Water damage (around windows, the roof, or the basement) Warning! Carefully read instructions for use and any cautionary labeling oncleaning products before beginning cleaning procedures. Do not mix any chemical products. Especially, never mix cleaners containingbleach with any product (such as ammonia) which does not have instructionsfor such mixing. When chemicals are combined, a dangerous gas can sometimesbe formed. Household chemicals may cause burning or irritation to skin and eyes. Household chemicals may be harmful if swallowed, or inhaled. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, mucous membranes and clothing Avoid breathing vapor. Open all windows and doors and use an exhaustfan that sends the air outside. Keep household chemicals out of reach of children. Rinse treated surface areas well to remove all traces of chemicals. Correcting Water Damage What if damage is already done? Follow these guidelines for correctingwater damage: Throw out mattresses, wicker furniture, straw baskets and the likethat have been water damaged or contain mold. These cannot be recovered. Discard any water-damaged furnishings such as carpets, drapes, stuffedtoys, upholstered furniture and ceiling tiles, unless they can be recoveredby steam cleaning or hot water washing and thorough drying. Remove and replace wet insulation to prevent conditions where biologicalpollutants can grow.

Driving in cars, flying in planes, engaging in recreational activities,and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose varying degreesof risk. Some risks are simply unavoidable. Some we choose to accept becauseto do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the way wewant. And some are risks we might decide to avoid if we had the opportunityto make informed choices. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you cando something about. In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence hasindicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriouslypolluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrializedcities. Other research indicates that people spend approximately 90 percentof their time indoors. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may begreater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors. In addition,people who may be exposed to indoor air pollutants for the longest periodsof time are often those most susceptible to the effects of indoor air pollution.Such groups include the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill, especiallythose suffering from respiratory or cardiovascular disease. WHY A BOOKLET ON INDOOR AIR? While pollutant levels from in-dividual sour-ces may not pose a significanthealth risk by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributesto indoor air pollution. There can be a serious risk from the cumulativeeffects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most peoplecan take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent newproblems from occurring. This booklet was prepared by the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the levelof indoor air pollution in your own home. Because so many Americans spenda lot of time in offices with mechanical heating, cooling, and ventilationsystems, there is also a short section on the causes of poor air qualityin offices and what you can do if you suspect that your office may havea problem. A glossary and a list of organizations where you can get additionalinformation are listed at the back of this booklet. WHAT CAUSES INDOOR AIR PROBLEMS? Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the airare the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequateventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enoughoutdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carryingindoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levelscan also increase concentrations of some pollutants. Pollutant Sources There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These includecombustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobaccoproducts; building materials and furnishings as diverse as deteriorated,asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furnituremade of certain pressed wood products; products for household cleaningand maintenance, personal care, or hobbies; central heating and coolingsystems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon,pesticides, and outdoor air pollution. The relative importance of any singlesource depends on how much of a given pollutant it emits and how hazardousthose emissions are. In some cases, factors such as how old the sourceis and whether it is properly maintained are significant. For example,an improperly adjusted gas stove can emit significantly more carbon monoxidethan one that is properly adjusted. Some sources, such as building materials,furnishings, and household products like air fresh-eners, release pollutantsmore or less continuously. Other sources, related to activities carriedout in the home, release pollutants intermittently. These include smoking,the use of unvented or malfunctioning stoves, furnaces, or space heaters,the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paintstrippers in redecorating activities, and the use of cleaning productsand pesticides in house-keeping. High pollutant concentrations can remainin the air for long periods after some of these activities. Amount of Ventilation If too little outdoor air enters a home, pollutants can accumulate tolevels that can pose health and comfort problems. Unless they are builtwith special mechanical means of ventilation, homes that are designed andconstructed to minimize the amount of outdoor air that can leaky. HOW DOES OUTDOOR AIR ENTER A HOUSE? Outdoor air enters and leaves a house by: infiltration, natural ventilation,and mechanical ventilation. In a process known as infiltration, outdoorair flows into the house through openings, joints, and cracks in walls,floors, and ceilings, and around windows and doors. In natural ventilation,air moves through opened windows and doors. Air movement associated withinfiltration and natural ventilation is caused by air temperature differencesbetween indoors and outdoors and by wind. Finally, there are a number ofmechanical ventilation devices, from outdoor-vented fans that intermittentlyremove air from a single room, such as bathrooms and kitchen, to air handlingsystems that use fans and duct work to continuously remove indoor air anddistribute filtered and conditioned outdoor air to strategic points throughoutthe house. The rate at which outdoor air replaces indoor air is describedas the air exchange rate. When there is little infiltration, natural ventilation,or mechanical ventilation, the air exchange rate is low and pollutant levelscan increase. WHAT IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT? Apartments can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homesbecause many of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials,furnishings, and household products, are similar. Indoor air problems similarto those in offices are caused by such sources as contaminated ventilationsystems, improperly placed outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.Solutions to air quality problems in apartments, as in homes and offices,involve such actions as: eliminating or controlling the sources of pollution,increasing ventilation, and installing air cleaning devices. Often a residentcan take the appropriate action to improve the indoor air quality by removinga source, altering an activity, unblocking an air supply vent, or openinga window to temporarily increase the ventilation; in other cases, however,only the building owner or manager is in a position to remedy the problem.(See the section "What to Do If You Suspect a Problem" on page30.) You can encourage building management to follow guidance in EPA andNIOSH's Building Air Quality: A Guide for Building Owners and FacilityManagers.

INDOOR AIR AND YOUR HEALTH Health effects from indoor air pollutants may be experienced soon afterexposure or, possibly, years later. Immediate effects may show up aftera single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of theeyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediateeffects are usually short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment issimply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution,if it can be identified. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivitypneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after exposureto some indoor air pollutants. The likelihood of immediate reactions toindoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medicalconditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a personreacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendous-lyfrom person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biologicalpollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people canbecome sensitized to chemical pollutants as well. Certain immediate effectsare similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is oftendifficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoorair pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to thetime and place the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away whena person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effortshould be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air orfrom the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.Other health effects may show up either years after exposure has occurredor only after long or repeated periods of exposure. These effects, whichinclude some respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, can be severelydebilitating or fatal. It is prudent to try to improve the indoor air qualityin your home even if symptoms are not noticeable. More information on potentialhealth effects from particular indoor air pollutants is provided in thesection, "A Look at Source-Specific Controls." While pollutantscommonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects,there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periodsof exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. People alsoreact very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further researchis needed to better understand which health effects occur after exposureto the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which occurfrom the higher concentrations that occur for short periods of time. Thehealth effects associated with some indoor air pollutants are summarizedin the chart in the middle of this booklet titled "Reference Guideto Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home." IDENTIFYING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS Some health effects can be useful indicators of an indoor air qualityproblem, especially if they appear after a person moves to a new residence,remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a home with pesticides. If youthink that you have symptoms that may be related to your home environment,discuss them with your doctor or your local health department to see ifthey could be caused by indoor air pollution. You may also want to consulta board-certified allergist or an occupational medicine specialist foranswers to your questions. Another way to judge whether your home has orcould develop indoor air problems is to identify potential sources of indoorair pollution. Although the presence of such sources (see illustrationat the beginning of this booklet) does not necessarily mean that you havean indoor air quality problem, being aware of the type and number of potentialsources is an important step toward assessing the air quality in your home.A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air qualityis to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significantsources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems withthe ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home may nothave enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls,smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment,and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect odorsin your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reenteringyour home, note whether odors are noticeable. MEASURING POLLUTANT LEVELS T he federal government recommends that you measure the level of radonin your home. Without measurements there is no way to tell whether radonis present because it is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Inexpensivedevices are available for measuring radon. EPA provides guidance as torisks associated with different levels of exposure and when the publicshould consider corrective action. There are specific mitigation techniquesthat have proven effective in reducing levels of radon in the home. (See"Radon" section on p. 11 of this booklet for additional informationabout testing and controlling radon in homes.) For pollutants other thanradon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptomsor signs of poor ventilation and specific sources or pollutants have beenidentified as possible causes of indoor air quality problems. Testing formany pollutants can be expensive. Before monitoring your home for pollutantsbesides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionalswho have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrialbuildings. WEATHERIZING YOUR HOME The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in orderto reduce the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherizationis underway, however, steps should also be taken to minimize pollutionfrom sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in YourHome" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should be alertto the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air,moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additionalweatherization measures should not be undertaken until these problems havebeen corrected. Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problemsby adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, suchas caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures suchas installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-inwall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating intoa home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor airpollutants from sources inside the home can increase. THREE BASIC STRATEGIES 1) Source Control Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminateindividual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources,like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, likegas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In manycases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protectingindoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilationcan increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution inyour home are listed later in this section. 2) Ventilation Improvements Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutantsin your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Mosthome heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems,do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows anddoors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or runninga window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoorventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoorsremove contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located andalso increase the outdoor air ventilation rate. It is particularly importantto take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-termactivities that can generate high levels of pollutants--for example, painting,paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging inmaintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.You might also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you canand if weather permits. Advanced designs of new homes are starting to featuremechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of thesedesigns include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also knownas air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heatexchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and ReferralService (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929. 3) Air Cleaners There are many types and sizes of air cleaners on the market, rangingfrom relatively inexpensive table-top models to sophisticated and expensivewhole-house systems. Some air cleaners are highly effective at particleremoval, while others, including most table-top models, are much less so.Air cleaners are generally not designed to remove gaseous pollutants. Theeffectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutantsfrom indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how muchair it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubicfeet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulationrate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulationrate but a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintainingit according to the manufacturer's directions. Another important factorin determining the effectiveness of an air cleaner is the strength of thepollutant source. Table-top air cleaners, in particular, may not removesatisfactory amounts of pollutants from strong nearby sources. People witha sensitivity to particular sources may find that air cleaners are helpfulonly in conjunction with concerted efforts to remove the source. Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting thathouseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratoryexperiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonablenumber of houseplants remove significant quantities of pollutants in homesand offices. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overlydamp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergicindividuals. At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levelsof radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devicesis uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay productsand do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home. EPA plans todo additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, areliable means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, ResidentialAir-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning devicesto reduce indoor air pollutants. For most indoor air quality problems inthe home, source control is the most effective solution. This section takesa source-by-source look at the most common indoor air pollutants, theirpotential health effects, and ways to reduce levels in the home. (For asummary of the points made in this section, see the chart in the middleof this booklet titled "Reference Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutantsin the Home.") RADON The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rockon which homes are built. As uran-ium naturally breaks down, it releasesradon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas entershomes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains,and sumps. When radon be-comes trapped in buildings and concentrationsbuild up indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern. Any home may havea radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes,and homes with or without basements. Sometimes radon enters the home throughwell water. In a small number of homes, the building materials can giveoff radon, too. However, building materials rarely cause radon problemsby themselves. Health Effects of Radon The predominant health effect associated with exposure to elevated levelsof radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with highradon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be muchlower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations(like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American LungAssociation (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimatesthat radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year.EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the UnitedStates--however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths peryear. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lungcancer is especially high. Reducing Exposure to Radon in Homes Measurelevels of radon in your home. You can't see radon, but it's not hard tofind out if you have a radon problem in your home. Testing is easy andshould only take a little of your time. There are many kinds of inexpensive,do-it-yourself radon test kits you can get through the mail and in hardwarestores and other retail outlets. Make sure you buy a test kit that haspassed EPA's testing program or is state-certified. These kits will usuallydisplay the phrase "Meets EPA Requirements." If you prefer, orif you are buying or selling a home, you can hire a trained contractorto do the testing for you. The EPA Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP)Program evaluates testing contractors. A contractor who has met EPA's requirementswill carry a special RMP identification card. EPA provides a list of companiesand indivi-dual contractors to state radon offices. You can call your stateradon office to obtain a list of qualified contractors in your area (call800-SOS RADON for a list of state radon offices). 1) Refer to the EPA guidelines on how to test and interpret your testresults. You can learn more about radon through EPA's publications, A Citizen'sGuide to Radon: The Guide to Protecting Yourself and Your Family From Radonand Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon, which are available fromstate radon offices. 2) Learn about radon reduction methods. Ways to reduce radon in your home are discussed in EPA's Consumer'sGuide to Radon Reduction. You can get a copy from your state radon office.There are simple solutions to radon problems in homes. Thousands of homeownershave already fixed radon problems. Lowering high radon levels requirestechnical knowledge and special skills. You should use a contractor whois trained to fix radon problems. The EPA Radon Contractor Proficiency(RCP) Program tests these contractors. EPA provides a list of RCP contractorsto state radon offices. A contractor who is listed by EPA will carry aspecial RCP identification card. A trained RCP contractor can study theproblem in your home and help you pick the correct treatment method. Checkwith your state radon office for names of qualified or state-certifiedradon-reduction contractors in your area. 3) Stop smoking and discourage smoking in your home. Scientific evidence indicates that smoking combined with radon is anespecially serious health risk. Stop smoking and lower your radon levelto reduce lung cancer risk 4) Treat radon-contaminated well water. While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most publicwater supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the airin your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact alab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested.Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon officeor the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information. ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the mixture of smoke that comesfrom the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and smoke exhaledby the smoker. It is a complex mixture of over 4,000 compounds, more than40 of which are known to cause cancer in humans or animals and many ofwhich are strong irritants. ETS is often referred to as "secondhandsmoke" and exposure to ETS is often called "passive smoking." Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke In 1992, EPA completed a major assessment of the respiratory healthrisks of ETS (Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancerand Other Disorders EPA/600/6-90/006F). The report concludes that exposureto ETS is responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths each yearin nonsmoking adults and impairs the respiratory health of hundreds ofthousands of children. Infants and young children whose parents smoke intheir presence are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections(pneumonia and bronchitis) and are more likely to have symptoms of respiratoryirritation like cough, excess phlegm, and wheeze. EPA estimates that passivesmoking annually causes between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tractinfections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting inbetween 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year. These children mayalso have a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which can lead to earinfections. Older children who have been exposed to secondhand smoke mayhave slightly reduced lung function. Asthmatic children are especiallyat risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases thenumber of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands ofasthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children todevelop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhandsmoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, nose, and throatirritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies havelinked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain.

Reducing Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke 1) Don't smoke at home or permit others to do so. Ask smokers to smoke outdoors. The 1986 Surgeon General's report concludedthat physical separation of smokers and nonsmokers in a common air space,such as different rooms within the same house, may reduce_but will noteliminate_non-smokers' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. 2) If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in thearea where smoking takes place. Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of reducingexposure to indoor air pollutants, also will reduce but not eliminate exposureto environmental tobacco smoke. Because smoking produces such large amountsof pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not removethem from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition,the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly reduce exposureto environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially.Consequently, the most effective way to reduce exposure to environmentaltobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there. 3) Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers. Children are particularly susceptible to the effects of passive smoking.Do not allow baby-sitters or others who work in your home to smoke indoors.Discourage others from smoking around children. Find out about the smokingpolicies of the day care center providers, schools, and other care giversfor your children. The policy should protect children from exposure toETS. BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animaldander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. Thereare many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; virusesare transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people,animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of salivaand animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potentallergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central airhandling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and othersources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminantsthrough the home. By controlling the relative humidity level in a home,the growth of some sources of biologicals can be minimized. A relativehumidity of 30-50 percent is generally recommended for homes. Standingwater, water-damaged materials, or wet surfaces also serve as a breedingground for molds, mildews, bacteria, and insects. House dust mites, thesource of one of the most powerful biological allergens, grow in damp,warm environments. Health Effects From Biological Contaminants Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivitypneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious illnesses,such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through theair. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of healthproblems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes,coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestiveproblems. Allergic reactions occur only after repeated exposure to a specificbiological allergen. However, that reaction may occur immediately uponre-exposure or after multiple exposures over time. As a result, peoplewho have noticed only mild allergic reactions, or no reactions at all,may suddenly find themselves very sensitive to particular allergens. Somediseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with exposure to toxinsfrom microorganisms that can grow in large building ventilation systems.However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that growin home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, elderlypeople, and people with breathing problems, allergies, and lung diseasesare particularly susceptible to disease-causing biological agents in theindoor air. Reducing Exposure to Biological Contaminants 1) Install and use exhaust fans that are vented to the outdoors in kitchensand bathrooms and vent clothes dryers outdoors. These actions can eliminate much of the moisture that builds up fromeveryday activities. There are exhaust fans on the market that producelittle noise, an important consideration for some people. Another benefitto using kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans is that they can reduce levelsof organic pollutants that vaporize from hot water used in showers anddishwashers. 2) Ventilate the attic and crawl spaces to prevent moisture build-up. Keeping humidity levels in these areas below 50 percent can preventwater condensation on building materials. 3) If using cool mist or ultrasonic humidifiers, clean appliances accordingto manufacturer's instructions and refill with fresh water daily. Because these humidifiers can become breeding grounds for biologicalcontaminants, they have the potential for causing diseases such as hypersensitivitypneumonitis and humidifier fever. Evaporation trays in air conditioners,dehumidifiers, and refrigera- tors should also be cleaned frequently. 4) Thoroughly clean and dry water-damaged carpets and building materials(within 24 hours if possible) or consider removal and replacement. Water-damaged carpets and building materials can harbor mold and bacteria.It is very difficult to completely rid such materials of biological contaminants. 5) Keep the house clean. House dust mites, pollens, animal dander, and other allergy-causingagents can be reduced, although not eliminated, through regular cleaning.People who are allergic to these pollutants should use allergen-proof mattressencasements, wash bedding in hot (130_F) water, and avoid room furnishingsthat accumulate dust, especially if they cannot be washed in hot water.Allergic individuals should also leave the house while it is being vacuumedbecause vacuuming can actually increase airborne levels of mite allergensand other biological contaminants. Using central vacuum systems that arevented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may alsobe of help. 6) Take steps to minimize biological pollutants in basements. Clean and disinfect the basement floor drain regularly. Do not finisha basement below ground level unless all water leaks are patched and outdoorventilation and adequate heat to prevent condensation are provided. Operatea dehumidifier in the basement if needed to keep relative humidity levelsbetween 30_50 percent. To learn more about biological pollutants, readBiological Pollutants in Your Home issued by the U.S. Consumer ProductSafety Commission and the American Lung Assoc-iation. For contact information,see the section, "Where to Go For Additional Information." STOVES, HEATERS, FIREPLACES, AND CHIMNEYS In addition to environmental tobacco smoke, other sources of combustionproducts are unvented kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces,and gas stoves. The major pollutants released are carbon monoxide, nitrogendioxide, and particles. Unvented kerosene heaters may also generate acidaerosols. Combustion gases and particles also come from chimneys and fluesthat are improperly installed or maintained and cracked furnace heat exchangers.Pollutants from fireplaces and woodstoves with no dedicated outdoor airsupply can be "back-drafted" from the chimney into the livingspace, particularly in weatherized homes. Health Effects of Combustion Products Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with thedelivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can causeunconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a range of symptomsfrom headaches, dizziness, weakness, nausea, confusion, and disorientation,to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in peoplewith chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning aresometimes confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, elderlypeople, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratorydisease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures. Nitrogendioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranesin the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposureto high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continuedexposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratoryinfection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposuresto elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the developmentof lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposureto nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and otherrespiratory diseases. Particles, released when fuels are incompletely burned,can lodge in the lungs and irritate or damage lung tissue. A number ofpollutants, including radon and benzo(a)py-rene, both of which can causecancer, attach to small particles that are inhaled and then carried deepinto the lung. Reducing Exposure to Combustion Products in Homes 1) Take special precautions when operating fuel-burning unvented spaceheaters. Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unventedkerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especiallyinstructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustmentand increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in use, opena door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the houseand open a window slightly. 2) Install and use exhaust fans over gas cooking stoves and ranges andkeep the burners properly adjusted. Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reducesexposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper adjustment, often indicatedby a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions.Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotlessignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously.Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make certain the flue inyour gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use. 3) Keep woodstove emissions to a minimum. Choose properly sized new stoves that are certified as meeting EPA emissionstandards. Make certain that doors in old woodstoves are tight-fitting.Use aged or cured (dried) wood only and follow the manufacturer's directionsfor starting, stoking, and putting out the fire in woodstoves. Chemicalsare used to pressure-treat wood; such wood should never be burned indoors.(Because some old gaskets in woodstove doors contain asbestos, when replacinggaskets refer to the instructions in the CPSC, ALA, and EPA booklet, Asbestosin Your Home, to avoid creating an asbestos problem. New gaskets are madeof fiberglass.) 4) Have central air handling systems, including furnaces, flues, andchimneys, inspected annually and promptly repair cracks or damaged parts. Blocked, leaking, or damaged chimneys or flues release harmful combustiongases and particles and even fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide. Strictlyfollow all service and maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturer,including those that tell you how frequently to change the filter. If manufacturer'sinstructions are not readily available, change filters once every monthor two during periods of use. Proper maintenance is important even fornew furnaces because they can also corrode and leak combustion gases, includingcarbon monoxide. Read the booklet What You Should Know About CombustionAppliances and Indoor Air Pollution to learn more about combustion pollutants.The booklet is available by contacting CPSC, EPA's IAQ INFO Clearinghouse,or your local ALA. (See "Where to Go for Additional Information"for contact information.) HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products.Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning,disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels are madeup of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compoundswhile you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored. EPA'sTotal Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of abouta dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homesthan outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural orhighly industrial areas. Additional TEAM studies indicate that while peopleare using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselvesand others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations canpersist in the air long after the activity is completed. Health Effects of Household Chemicals The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatlyfrom those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect.As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect willdepend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed.Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders,and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some peoplehave experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, notmuch is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organicsusually found in homes. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancerin animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancerin humans. Reducing Exposure to Household Chemicals 1) Follow label instructions carefully. Potentially hazardous products often have warnings aimed at reducingexposure of the user. For example, if a label says to use the product ina well-ventilated area, go outdoors or in areas equipped with an exhaustfan to use it. Otherwise, open up windows to provide the maximum amountof outdoor air possible. 2) Throw away partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicalssafely. Because gases can leak even from closed containers, this single stepcould help lower concentrations of organic chemicals in your home. (Besure that materials you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilatedarea but are also safely out of reach of children.) Do not simply tossthese unwanted products in the garbage can. Find out if your local governmentor any organization in your community sponsors special days for the collectionof toxic household wastes. If such days are available, use them to disposeof the unwanted containers safely. If no such collection days are available,think about organizing one. 3) Buy limited quantities. If you use products only occasionally or seasonally, such as paints,paint strippers, and kerosene for space heaters or gasoline for lawn mowers,buy only as much as you will use right away. 4) Keep exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chlorideto a minimum. Consumer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers,adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is knownto cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbonmonoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure tocarbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health hazard informationand cautions on the proper use of these products. Use products that containmethylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the areais well ventilated. 5) Keep exposure to benzene to a minimum. Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of thischemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint supplies,and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will reducebenzene exposure include eliminating smoking within the home, providingfor maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint suppliesand special fuels that will not be used immediately. 6) Keep exposure to perchloroethylene emissions from newly dry-cleanedmaterials to a minimum. Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning.In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recentstudies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both inhomes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning processso they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemicalduring the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however,do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Takingsteps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleanedgoods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not acceptthem until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odorare returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner. FORMALDEHYDE Formaldehyde is an important chemical used widely by industry to manufacturebuilding materials and numerous household products. It is also a by-productof combustion and certain other natural processes. Thus, it may be presentin substantial concentrations both indoors and outdoors. Sources of formaldehydein the home include building materials, smoking, household products, andthe use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosenespace heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals,serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it isused to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a componentof glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coatingproducts. In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likelyto be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde(UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard(used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwoodplywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinetsand furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts,cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higherresin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generallyrecognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.Other pressed wood products, such as softwood plywood and flake or orientedstrandboard, are produced for exterior construction use and contain thedark, or red/black-colored phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin. Although formaldehydeis present in both types of resins, pressed woods that contain PF resingenerally emit formaldehyde at considerably lower rates than those containingUF resin. Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) haspermitted only the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to specifiedformaldehyde emission limits in the construction of prefabricated and mobilehomes. In the past, some of these homes had elevated levels of formaldehydebecause of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products usedin their construction and because of their relatively small interior space.The rate at which products like pressed wood or textiles release formaldehydecan change. Formaldehyde emissions will generally decrease as productsage. When the products are new, high indoor temperatures or humidity cancause increased release of formaldehyde from these products. During the1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installedin the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure.However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoorconcentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homesare now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehydeemissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI wasinstalled many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehydenow. Health Effects of Formaldehyde Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes,burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathingin some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There isevidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. Ithas also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer inhumans. Reducing Exposure to Formaldehyde in Homes Ask about the formaldehydecontent of pressed wood products, including building materials, cabinetry,and furniture before you purchase them. If you experience adverse reactionsto formaldehyde, you may want to avoid the use of pressed wood productsand other formaldehyde-emitting goods. Even if you do not experience suchreactions, you may wish to reduce your exposure as much as possible bypurchasing exterior-grade products, which emit less formaldehyde. For furtherinformation on formaldehyde and consumer products, call the EPA Toxic SubstanceControl Act (TSCA) assistance line (202-554-1404). Some studies suggest that coating pressed wood products with polyurethanemay reduce formaldehyde emissions for some period of time. To be effective,any such coating must cover all surfaces and edges and remain intact. Increasethe ventilation and carefully follow the manufacturernstructions whileapplying these coatings. (If you are sensitive to formaldehyde, check thelabel contents before purchasing coating products to avoid buying productsthat contain formaldehyde, as they will emit the chemical for a short timeafter application.) Maintain moderate temperature and humidity levels andprovide adequate ventilation. The rate at which formaldehyde is releasedis accelerated by heat and may also depend somewhat on the humidity level.Therefore, the use of dehumidifiers and air conditioning to control humidityand to maintain a moderate temperature can help reduce formaldehyde emissions.(Drain and clean dehumidifier collection trays frequently so that theydo not become a breeding ground for microorganisms.) Increasing the rateof ventilation in your home will also help in reducing formaldehyde levels. PESTICIDES According to a recent survey, 75 percent of U.S. households used atleast one pesticide product indoors during the past year. Products usedmost often are insecticides and disinfectants. Another study suggests that80 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors and thatmeasurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the airinside homes. The amount of pesticides found in homes appears to be greaterthan can be explained by recent pesticide use in those households; otherpossible sources include contaminated soil or dust that floats or is trackedin from outside, stored pesticide containers, and household surfaces thatcollect and then release the pesticides. Pesticides used in and aroundthe home include products to control insects (insecticides), termites (termiticides),rodents (rodenticides), fungi (fungicides), and microbes (disinfectants).They are sold as sprays, liquids, sticks, powders, crystals, balls, andfoggers. In 1990, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reportedthat some 79,000 children were involved in common household pesticide poisoningsor exposures. In households with children under five years old, almostone-half stored at least one pesticide product within reach of children.EPA registers pesticides for use and requires manufacturers to put informationon the label about when and how to use the pesticide. It is important toremember that the to kill.ese products can be dangerous if not used properly.In addition to the active ingredient, pesticides are also made up of ingredientsthat are used to carry the active agent. These carrier agents are calledHousehold Products. However, as with other household products, there isinsufficient understanding at present about what pesticide concentrationsare necessary to produce these effects. Exposure to high levels of cyclodienepesticides, commonly associated with misapplication, has produced varioussymptoms, including headaches, dizziness, muscle twitching, weakness, tinglingsensations, and nausea. In addition, EPA is concerned that cyclodienesmight cause long-term damage to the liver and the central nervous system,as well as an increased risk of cancer. There is no further sale or commercialuse permitted for the following cyclodiene or related pesticides: chlordane,aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor. The only exception is the use of heptachlorby utility companies to control fire ants in underground cable boxes. Reducing Exposure to Pesticides in Homes 1) Read the label and follow the directions. It is illegal to use any pesticide in any manner inconsistent with thedirections on its label. Unless you have had special training and are certified,never use a pesticide that is restricted to use by state-certified pestcontrol operators. Such pesticides are simply too dangerous for applicationby a noncertified person. 2) Use only the pesticides approved for use by the general public andthen only in recommended amounts; increasing the amount does not offermore protection against pests and can be harmful to you and your plantsand pets. 3) Ventilate the area well after pesticide use. Mix or dilute pesticides outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and onlyin the amounts that will be immediately needed. If possible, take plantsand pets outside when applying pesticides to them. 4) Use nonchemical methods of pest control when possible. Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application,it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as wellas indoors. Depending on the site and pest to be controlled, one or moreof the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides,such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selectionof disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants andpets. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain thatwooden building materials do not come into direct contact with the soiland by storing firewood away from the home. By appropriately fertilizing,watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatmentsof lawns can be dramatically reduced. 5) If you decide to use a pest control company, choose one carefully. Ask for an inspection of your home and get a written control programfor evaluation before you sign a contract. The control program should listspecific names of pests to be controlled and chemicals to be used; it shouldalso reflect any of your safety concerns. Insist on a proven record ofcompetence and customer satisfaction. 6) Dispose of unwanted pesticides safely. If you have unused or partially used pesticide containers you want toget rid of, dispose of them according to the directions on the label oron special household hazardous waste collection days. If there are no suchcollection days in your community, work with others to organize them. 7) Keep exposure to moth repellents to a minimum. One pesticide often found in the home is paradichlorobenzene, a commonlyused active ingredient in moth repellents. This chemical is known to causecancer in animals, but substantial scientific uncertainty exists over theeffects, if any, of long-term human exposure to paradichlorobenzene. EPArequires that products containing paradichlorobenzene bear warnings suchas "avoid breathing vapors" to warn users of potential short-termtoxic effects. Where possible, paradichlorobenzene, and items to be protectedagainst moths, should be placed in trunks or other containers that canbe stored in areas that are separately ventilated from the home, such asattics and detached garages. Paradichlorobenzene is also the key activeingredient in many air fresheners (in fact, some labels for moth repellentsrecommend that these same products be used as air fresheners or deodorants).Proper ventilation and basic household cleanliness will go a long way towardpreventing unpleasant odors. 8) Call the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network (NPTN). EPA sponsors the NPTN (800-858-PEST) to answer your questions aboutpesticides and to provide selected EPA publications on pesticides. ASBESTOS Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used commonly in a varietyof building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos products. Manufacturers havealso voluntarily limited uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most commonlyfound in older homes, in pipe and furnace insulation materials, asbestosshingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating materials, and floortiles. Elevated concentrations of airborne asbestos can occur after asbestos-containingmaterials are disturbed by cutting, sanding or other remodeling activities.Improper attempts to remove these materials can release asbestos fibersinto the air in homes, increasing asbestos levels and endangering peopleliving in those homes. Health Effects of Asbestos The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. Afterthey are inhaled, they can remain and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestoscan cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominallinings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal).Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until many years after exposurebegan. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevatedconcentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothingand equipment brought home from job sites. Reducing Exposure to Asbestos in Homes 1) Learn how asbestos problems are created in homes. Read the booklet, Asbestos in Your Home, issued by CPSC, the ALA, andEPA. To contact these organizations, see the section, "Where to GoFor More Information. 2) If you think your home may have asbestos, dont panic! Usually it is best to leave asbestos material that is in good conditionalone. Generally, material in good condition will not release asbestosfiber. There is no danger unless fibers are released and inhaled into thelungs. Do not cut, rip, or sand asbestos-containing materials. Leave undamagedmaterials alone and, to the extent possible, prevent them from being damaged,disturbed, or touched. Periodically inspect for damage or deterioration. 3) Discard damaged or worn asbestos gloves, stove-top pads, or ironingboard covers. Check with local health, environmental, or other appropriate officialsto find out about proper handling and disposal procedures. If asbestosmaterial is more than slightly damaged, or if you are going to make changesin your home that might disturb it, repair or removal by a professionalis needed. 4) Before you have your house remodeled, find out whether asbestos materialsare present. 5) When you need to remove or clean up asbestos, use a professionallytrained contractor. Select a contractor only after careful discussion of the problems inyour home and the steps the contractor will take to clean up or removethem. Consider the option of sealing off the materials instead of removingthem. Call EPASCA assistance line (202-554-1404) to find out whether yourstate has a training and certification program for asbestos removal contractorsand for information on EPAsbestos programs. LEAD Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant.In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Servicescalled lead the "number one environmental threat to the health ofchildren in the United States." There are many ways in which humansare exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil,deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individualbreathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Beforeit was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline,water pipes, and many other products. Old lead-based paint is the mostsignificant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposuresto lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed fromsurfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrationsof airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust fromoutdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and use oflead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making. Health Effects of Exposure to Lead Lead affects practically all systems within the body. At high levelsit can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lower levels of lead canadversely affect the brain, central nervous system, blood cells, and kidneys.The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe.They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels,shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses,infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adultssince lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissuesof small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Childrenmay have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust ontheir hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objectsinto their mouths. Get your child tested for lead exposure. To find outwhere to do this, call your doctor or local health clinic. For more informationon health effects, get a copy of the Centers for Disease Control's, PreventingLead Poisoning in Young Children (October 1991). Ways to Reduce Exposure to Lead 1) Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible. Mop floors and wipe window ledges and chewable surfaces such as cribswith a solution of powdered automatic dishwasher detergent in warm water.(Dishwasher detergents are recommended because of their high content ofphosphate.) Most multi-purpose cleaners will not remove lead in ordinarydust. Wash toys and stuffed animals regularly. Make sure that childrenwash their hands before meals, nap time, and bedtime. 2) Reduce the risk from lead-based paint. Most homes built before 1960 contain heavily leaded paint. Some homesbuilt as recently as 1978 may also contain lead paint. This paint couldbe on window frames, walls, the outside of homes, or other surfaces. Donot burn painted wood since it may contain lead. 3) Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition; donot sand or burn off paint that may contain lead. Lead paint in good condition is usually not a problem except in placeswhere painted surfaces rub against each other and create dust (for example,opening a window). 4) Do not remove lead paint yourself. Individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint becausethese activities generate large amounts of lead dust. Consult your statehealth or housing department for suggestions on which private laboratoriesor public agencies may be able to help test your home for lead in paint.Home test kits cannot detect small amounts of lead under some conditions.Hire a person with special training for correcting lead paint problemsto remove lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnantwomen, should leave the building until all work is finished and clean-upis done. For additional information dealing with lead-based paint abatement contactthe Department of Housing and Urban Development for the following two documents:Comprehensive and Workable Plan for the Abatement of Lead-Based Paint inPrivately Owned Housing: Report to Congress (December 7, 1990) and Lead-BasedPaint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Publicand Indian Housing (September 1990). 5) Do not bring lead dust into the home. If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, ina radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, youmay unknowingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes. Youmay also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very closeto homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the building.Soil by roads and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumesfrom cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feetbefore entering the home. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby,change your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes separately.Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirtwhich sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from eatingdirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside. 6) Find out about lead in drinking water. Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water usuallypicks up lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made withlead materials. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking wateris to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the watersupplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet,Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can doif you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking WaterHotline (800-426-4791) for more information. 7) Eat right. A child who gets enough iron and calcium will absorb less lead. Foodsrich in iron include eggs, red meats, and beans. Dairy products are highin calcium. Do not store food or liquid in lead crystal glassware or importedor old pottery. If you reuse old plastic bags to store or carry food, keepthe printing on the outside of the bag.

WHEN BUILDING A NEW HOME Building a new home provides the opportunity for preventing indoor airproblems. However, it can result in exposure to higher levels of indoorair contaminants if careful attention is not given to potential pollutionsources and the air exchange rate. Express your concerns about indoor airquality to your architect or builder and enlist his or her cooperationin taking measures to provide good indoor air quality. Talk both aboutpurchasing building materials and furnishings that are low-emitting andabout providing an adequate amount of ventilation. The American Societyof Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommends aventilation rate of 0.35 ach (air changes per hour) for new homes, andsome new homes are built to even tighter specifications. Particular careshould be given in such homes to preventing the build-up of indoor airpollutants to high levels. Here are a few important actions that can make a difference: 1) Use radon-resistant construction techniques. Obtain a copy of the EPA booklet, Radon-Resistant Construction Techniquesfor Residential Construction, from your state radon office or health agency,your state homebuilders' association, or your EPA regional office. 2) Choose building materials and furnishings that will keep indoor airpollution to a minimum. There are many actions a homeowner can take to select products thatwill prevent indoor air problems from occurring; a couple of them are mentionedhere. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyderesin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, considerusing solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wallcarpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements,make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installingthe carpet. Do not per- manently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesivesso that the carpet can be removed if it becomes wet. 3) Provide proper drainage and seal foundations in new construction. Air that enters the home through the foundation can contain more moisturethan is generated from all occupant activities. 4) Become familiar with mechanical ventilation systems and considerinstalling one. Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systemsthat bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficientheat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). 5) Ensure that combustion appliances, including furnaces, fireplaces,woodstoves, and heaters, are properly vented and receive enough supplyair. Combustion gases, including carbon monoxide, and particles can be back-draftedfrom the chimney or flue into the living space if the combustion applianceis not properly vented or does not receive enough supply air. Back-draftingcan be a particular problem in weatherized or tightly constructed homes.Installing a dedicated outdoor air supply for the combustion appliancecan help prevent backdrafting. DO YOU SUSPECT YOUR OFFICE HAS AN INDOOR AIR PROBLEM? Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In fact, manyoffice buildings have significant air pollution sources. Some of thesebuildings may be inadequately ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilationsystems may not be designed or operated to provide adequate amounts ofoutdoor air. Finally, people generally have less control over the indoorenvironment in their offices than they do in their homes. As a result,there has been an increase in the incidence of reported health problems. HEALTH EFFECTS A number of well-identified illnesses, such as Legionnaire's disease,asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, have been directlytraced to specific building problems. These are called building-relatedillnesses. Most of these diseases can be treated; nevertheless, some poseserious risks. Sometimes, however, building occupants experience symptomsthat do not fit the pattern of any particular illness and are difficultto trace to any specific source. This phenomenon has been labeled sickbuilding syndrome. People may complain of one or more of the followingsymptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat;sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; dizziness;nausea; irritability and forgetfulness. Poor lighting, noise, vibration,thermal discomfort, and psychological stress may also cause, or contributeto, these symptoms. There is no single manner in which these health problemsappear. In some cases, problems begin as workers enter their offices anddiminish as workers leave; other times, symptoms continue until the illnessis treated. Sometimes there are outbreaks of illness among many workersin a single building; in other cases, health symptoms show up only in individualworkers. In the opinion of some World Health Organization experts, up to30 percent of new or remodeled commercial buildings may have unusuallyhigh rates of health and comfort complaints from occupants that may potentiallybe related to indoor air quality. WHAT CAUSES PROBLEMS? Three major reasons for poor indoor air quality in office buildingsare the presence of indoor air pollution sources; poorly designed, maintained,or operated ventilation systems; and uses of the building that were unanticipatedor poorly planned for when the building was designed or renovated. Sourcesof Office Air Pollution As with homes, the most important factor influencingindoor air quality is the presence of pollutant sources. Commonly foundoffice pollutants and their sources include environmental tobacco smoke;asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building supplies; formaldehydefrom pressed wood products; other organics from building materials, carpet,and other office furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, restroomair fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography andprint shops; biological contaminants from dirty ventilation systems orwater-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest managementpractices. Ventilation Systems Mechanical ventilation systems in largebuildings are designed and operated not only to heat and cool the air,but also to draw in and circulate outdoor air. If they are poorly designed,operated, or maintained, however, ventilation systems can contribute toindoor air problems in several ways. For example, problems arise when,in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bringin adequate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also occursif the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placedin such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zoneof building occupants. Improperly located outdoor air intake vents canalso bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boileremissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally,ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves byspreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers,humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces ofventilation duct work. Use of the Building Indoor air pollutants can be circulated from portionsof the building used for specialized purposes, such as restaurants, printshops, and dry-cleaning stores, into offices in the same building. Carbonmonoxide and other components of automobile exhaust can be drawn from undergroundparking garages through stairwells and elevator shafts into office spaces.In addition, buildings originally designed for one purpose may end up beingconverted to use as office space. If not properly modified during buildingrenovations, the room partitions and ventilation system can contributeto indoor air quality problems by restricting air recirculation or by providingan inadequate supply of outdoor air. WHAT TO DO IF YOU SUSPECT A PROBLEM If you or others at your office are experiencing health or comfort problemsthat you suspect may be caused by indoor air pollution, you can do thefollowing: 1) Talk with other workers, your supervisor, and union representativesto see if the problems are being experienced by others and urge that arecord of reported health complaints be kept by management, if one hasnot already been established. 2) Talk with your own physician and report your problems to the companyphysician, nurse, or health and safety officer. 3) Call your state or local health department or air pollution controlagency to talk over the symptoms and possible causes. 4) Encourage building management to obtain a copy of Building Air Quality:A Guide for Building Owners and Facility Managers. Building Air Quality(BAQ) is simply written, yet provides comprehensive information for identifying,correcting, and preventing indoor air quality problems. BAQ also providessupporting information such as when and how to select outside technicalassistance, how to communicate with others regarding indoor air issues,and where to find additional sources of information. BAQ is available for$24 from U.S. GPO, Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh,PA 15250-7954; stock #055-000-00390-4 or call (202) 783-3238. 5) Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildingscannot be effectively identified or remedied without a comprehensive buildinginvestigation. These investigations may start with written questionnairesand telephone consultations in which building investigators assess thehistory of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In somecases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the problem and on-site visitsare unnecessary. 6) More often, however, investigators will need to come to the buildingto conduct personal interviews with occupants, to look for possible sourcesof the problems, and to inspect the design and operation of the ventilationsystem and other building features. Because taking measurements of pollutantsat the very low levels often found in office buildings is expensive andmay not yield information readily useful in identifying problem sources,investigators may not take many measurements. The process of solving indoorair quality problems that result in health and comfort complaints can bea slow one, involving several trial solutions before successful remedialactions are identified. 7) If a professional company is hired to conduct a building investigation,select a company on the basis of its experience in identifying and solvingindoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings. 8) Work with others to establish a smoking policy that eliminates involuntarynonsmoker exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. 9) Call the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)for information on obtaining a health hazard evaluation of your office(800-35NIOSH), or contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,(202) 219-8151. COMMON ALLERGEN Dust mites, microscopic animals found in household dust, produce a commonallergen. Exposure to house dust mites, animal-related allergens (animaldander and cat saliva), and mold have been estimated to cause 200,000 ormore emergency room visits a year by asthma patients. Humid or damp conditionsusually lead to greater numbers of dust mites. WHAT ABOUT CARPET? In recent years, a number of consumers have associated a variety ofsymptoms with the installation of new carpet. Scientists have not beenable to determine whether the chemicals emitted by new carpets are responsible.If you are installing new carpet, you may wish to take the following steps: 1) Talk to your carpet retailer. Ask for information on emissions fromcarpet. 2) Ask the retailer to unroll and air out the carpet in a well-ventilatedarea before installation. 3) Ask for low-emitting adhesives if adhesives are needed. 4) Consider leaving the premises during and immediately after carpetinstallation. You may wish to schedule the installation when most familymembers or office workers are out. 5) Be sure the retailer requires the installer to follow the Carpetand Rug Institute's installation guidelines. 6) Open doors and windows. Increasing the amount of fresh air in thehome will reduce exposure to most chemicals released from carpet. Duringand after installation, use window fans, room air conditioners, or othermechanical ventilation equipment you may have installed in your house,to exhaust fumes to the outdoors. Keep them running for 48 to 72 hoursafter the new carpet is installed. 7) Contact your carpet retailer if objectionable odors persist. 8) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper carpet maintenance. REFERENCE GUIDE TO MAJOR INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS IN THE HOME The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the healtheffects mentioned. However, it is not necessarily true that the effectsnoted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in thehome. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their healtheffects is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed effectscould occur. RADON Sources: Earth and rock beneath home; well water; building materials. Health Effects: No immediate symptoms. Estimated to contributeto between 7,000 and 30,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Smokers are athigher risk of developing radon-induced lung cancer. Levels in Homes: Based on a national residential radon surveycompleted in 1991, the average indoor radon level is 1.3 picocuries perliter (pCi/L). The average outdoor level is about 0.4 pCi/L. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1)Test your home for radon_it's easy and inexpensive. 2)Fix your home if your radon level is 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L)or higher. 3)Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still pose a risk, and in many casesmay be reduced. 4) If you want more information on radon, contact your state radon office,or call 800-SOS RADON. ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE Source: Cigarette, pipe, and cigar smoking. Health Effects: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches;lung cancer; may contribute to heart disease. Specifically for children,increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitisand pneumonia, and ear infections; build-up of fluid in the middle ear;increased severity and frequency of asthma episodes; decreased lung function. Levels in Homes: Particle levels in homes without smokers orother strong particle sources are the same as, or lower than, those outdoors.Homes with one or more smokers may have particle levels several times higherthan outdoor levels. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Do not smoke in your home or permit others to do so. 2) Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers. 3) If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in thearea where smoking takes place. Open windows or use exhaust fans. BIOLOGICALS Sources: Wet or moist walls, ceilings, carpets, and furniture;poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners; bedding;household pets. Health Effects: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; shortness ofbreath; dizziness; lethargy; fever; digestive problems. Can cause asthma;humidifier fever; influenza and other infectious diseases. Levels in Homes: Indoor levels of pollen and fungi are lowerthan outdoor levels (except where indoor sources of fungi are present).Indoor levels of dust mites are higher than outdoor levels. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Install and use fans vented to outdoors in kitchens and bathrooms. 2) Vent clothes dryers to outdoors. 3) Clean cool mist and ultrasonic humidifiers in accordance with manufacturer'sinstructions and refill with clean water daily. 4) Empty water trays in air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and refrigeratorsfrequently. 5) Clean and dry or remove water-damaged carpets. 6) Use basements as living areas only if they are leakproof and haveadequate ventilation. Use dehumidifiers, if necessary, to maintain humiditybetween 30_50 percent. CARBON MONOXIDE Sources: Unvented kerosene and gas space heaters; leaking chimneysand furnaces; back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters, woodstoves,and fireplaces; gas stoves. Automobile exhaust from attached garages. Environmentaltobacco smoke. Health Effects: At low concentrations, fatigue in healthy peopleand chest pain in people with heart disease. At higher concentrations,impaired vision and coordination; headaches; dizziness; confusion; nausea.Can cause flu-like symptoms that clear up after leaving home. Fatal atvery high concentrations. Levels in Homes: Average levels in homes without gas stoves varyfrom 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm). Levels near properly adjusted gasstoves are often 5 to 15 ppm and those near poorly adjusted stoves maybe 30 ppm or higher. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Keep gas appliances properly adjusted. 2) Consider purchasing a vented space heater when replacing an unventedone. 3) Use proper fuel in kerosene space heaters. 4) Install and use an exhaust fan vented to outdoors over gas stoves. 5) Open flues when fireplaces are in use. 6) Choose properly sized woodstoves that are certified to meet EPA emissionstandards. Make certain that doors on all woodstoves fit tightly. 7) Have a trained professional inspect, clean, and tune-up central heatingsystem (furnaces, flues, and chimneys) annually. Repair any leaks promptly. 8) Do not idle the car inside garage. NITROGEN DIOXIDE Sources: Kerosene heaters, unvented gas stoves and heaters. Environmentaltobacco smoke. Health Effects: Eye, nose, and throat irritation. May cause impairedlung function and increased respiratory infections in young children. Levels in Homes: Average level in homes without combustion appliancesis about half that of outdoors. In homes with gas stoves, kerosene heaters,or unvented gas space heaters, indoor levels often exceed outdoor levels. Steps to Reduce Exposure: See steps under carbon monoxide. ORGANIC GASES Sources: Household products including: paints, paint strippers,and other solvents; wood preservatives; aerosol sprays; cleansers and disinfectants;moth repellents and air fresheners; stored fuels and automotive products;hobby supplies; dry-cleaned clothing. Health Effects: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches,loss of coordination, nausea; damage to liver, kidney, and central nervoussystem. Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected orknown to cause cancer in humans. Levels in Homes: Studies have found that levels of several organicsaverage 2 to 5 times higher indoors than outdoors. During and for severalhours immediately after certain activities, such as paint stripping, levelsmay be 1,000 times background outdoor levels. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Use household products according to manufacturer's directions. 2) Make sure you provide plenty of fresh air when using these products. 3) Throw away unused or little-used containers safely; buy in quantitiesthat you will use soon. 4) Keep out of reach of children and pets. 5) Never mix household care products unless directed on the label. RESPIRABLE PARTICLES Sources: Fireplaces, woodstoves, and kerosene heaters. Environmentaltobacco smoke. Health Effects: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; respiratoryinfections and bronchitis; lung cancer. (Effects attributable to environmentaltobacco smoke are listed elsewhere.) Levels in Homes: Particle levels in homes without smoking orother strong particle sources are the same as, or lower than, outdoor levels. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Vent all furnaces to outdoors; keep doors to rest of house open whenusing unvented space heaters. 2) Choose properly sized woodstoves, certified to meet EPA emissionstandards; make certain that doors on all woodstoves fit tightly. 3) Have a trained professional inspect, clean, and tune-up central heatingsystem (furnace, flues, and chimneys) annually. Repair any leaks promptly. 4) Change filters on central heating and cooling systems and air cleanersaccording to manufac-turer's directions. FORMALDEHYDE Sources: Pressed wood products (hardwood plywood wall paneling,particleboard, fiberboard) and furniture made with these pressed wood products.Urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI). Combustion sources and environmentaltobacco smoke. Durable press drapes, other textiles, and glues. Health Effects: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; wheezing andcoughing; fatigue; skin rash; severe allergic reactions. May cause cancer.May also cause other effects listed under "organic gases." Levels in Homes: Average concentrations in older homes withoutUFFI are generally well below 0.1 (ppm). In homes with significant amountsof new pressed wood products, levels can be greater than 0.3 ppm. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Use "exterior-grade" pressed wood products (lower-emittingbecause they contain phenol resins, not urea resins). 2) Use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to maintain moderate temperatureand reduce humidity levels. 3) Increase ventilation, particularly after bringing new sources offormaldehyde into the home. PESTICIDES Sources: Products used to kill household pests (insecticides,termiticides, and disinfectants). Also, products used on lawns and gardensthat drift or are tracked inside the house. Health Effects: Irritation to eye, nose, and throat; damage tocentral nervous system and kidney; increased risk of cancer. Levels in Homes: Preliminary research shows widespread presenceof pesticide residues in homes. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Use strictly according to manufacturer's directions. 2) Mix or dilute outdoors. 3) Apply only in recommended quantities. 4) Increase ventilation when using indoors. Take plants or pets outdoorswhen applying pesticides to them. 5) Use nonchemical methods of pest control where possible. 6) If you use a pest control company, select it carefully. 7) Do not store unneeded pesticides inside home; dispose of unwantedcontainers safely. 8) Store clothes with moth repellents in separately ventilated areas,if possible. 9) Keep indoor spaces clean, dry, and well ventilated to avoid pestand odor problems. ASBESTOS Sources: Deteriorating, damaged, or disturbed insulation, fireproofing,acoustical materials, and floor tiles. Health Effects: No immediate symptoms, but long-term risk ofchest and abdominal cancers and lung diseases. Smokers are at higher riskof developing asbestos-induced lung cancer. Levels in Homes: Elevated levels can occur in homes where asbestos-containingmaterials are damaged or disturbed. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) It is best to leave undamaged asbestos material alone if it is notlikely to be disturbed. 2) Use trained and qualified contractors for control measures that maydisturb asbestos and for cleanup. 3)Follow proper procedures in replacing woodstove door gaskets thatmay contain asbestos. LEAD Sources: Lead-based paint, contaminated soil, dust, and drinkingwater. Health Effects: Lead affects practically all systems within thebody. Lead at high levels (lead levels at or above 80 micrograms per deciliter(80 _g/dl) of blood) can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lowerlevels of lead can cause adverse health effects on the central nervoussystem, kidney, and blood cells. Blood lead levels as low as 10 _g/dl canimpair mental and physical development. Steps to Reduce Exposure: 1) Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible. 2) Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition; donot sand or burn off paint that may contain lead. 3) Do not remove lead paint yourself. 4) Do not bring lead dust into the home. 5) If your work or hobby involves lead, change clothes and use doormatsbefore entering your home. 6) Eat a balanced diet, rich in calcium and iron. PESTS There are simple steps people can take to prevent, reduce, or controlpest infestations. Such techniques can become part of an overall pest managementprogram (sometimes called "integrated" pest management) thatrelies on many techniques, not just chemicals.

The complaints may be localized ina particular room or zone, or may be widespread throughout the building.Incontrast, the term "building related illness" (BRI) is used whensymptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributed directlyto airborne building contaminants. A 1984 World Health Organization Committee report suggested that upto 30 percent of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be the subjectof excessive complaints related to indoor air quality (IAQ). Often thiscondition is temporary, but some buildings have long-term problems.Frequently,problems result when a building is operated or maintained in a manner thatis inconsistent with its original design or prescribed operating procedures.Sometimes indoor air problems are a result of poor building design or occupantactivities. Indicators of SBS include: Building occupants complain of symptoms associated with acute discomfort,e.g., headache; eye, nose, or throat irritation; dry cough; dry or itchyskin; dizziness and nausea; difficulty in concentrating; fatigue; and sensitivityto odors. The cause of the symptoms is not known. Most of the complainants report relief soon after leaving the building. Indicators of BRI include: Building occupants complain of symptoms such as cough; chest tightness;fever, chills; and muscle aches. The symptoms can be clinically defined and have clearly identifiablecauses. Complainants may require prolonged recovery times after leaving thebuilding. It is important to note that complaints may result from other causes.These may include an illness contracted outside the building, acute sensitivity(e.g., allergies), job related stress or dissatisfaction, and other psychosocialfactors. Nevertheless, studies show that symptoms may be caused or exacerbatedby indoor air quality problems. Causes of Sick Building Syndrome The following have been cited causes of or contributing factors to sickbuilding syndrome: Inadequate ventilation: In the early and mid 1900's, buildingventilation standards called for approximately 15 cubic feet per minute(cfm) of outside air for each building occupant, primarily to dilute andremove body odors. As a result of the 1973 oil embargo, however, nationalenergy conservation measures called for a reduction in the amount of outdoorair provided for ventilation to 5 cfm per occupant. In many cases thesereduced outdoor air ventilation rates were found to be inadequate to maintainthe health and comfort of building occupants. Inadequate ventilation, whichmay also occur if heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systemsdo not effectively distribute air to people in the building, is thoughtto be an important factor in SBS. In an effort to achieve acceptable IAQwhile minimizing energy consumption, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeratingand Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recently revised its ventilationstandard to provide a minimum of 15 cfm of outdoor air per person (20 cfm/personin office spaces). Up to 60 cfm/person may be required in some spaces (suchas smoking lounges) depending on the activities that normally occur inthat space (see ASHRAE Standard 62-1989). Chemical contaminants from indoor sources: Most indoor air pollutioncomes from sources inside the building. For example, adhesives, carpeting,upholstery, manufactured wood products, copy machines, pesticides, andcleaning agents may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including formaldehyde.Environmental tobacco smoke contributes high levels of VOCs, other toxiccompounds, and respirable particulate matter. Research shows that someVOCs can cause chronic and acute health effects at high concentrations,and some are known carcinogens. Low to moderate levels of multiple VOCsmay also produce acute reactions. Combustion products such as carbon monoxide,nitrogen dioxide, as well as respirable particles, can come from unventedkerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces and gas stoves. Chemical contaminants from outdoor sources: The outdoor air thatenters a building can be a source of indoor air pollution. For example,pollutants from motor vehicle exhausts; plumbing vents, and building exhausts(e.g., bathrooms and kitchens) can enter the building through poorly locatedair intake vents, windows, and other openings. In addition, combustionproducts can enter a building from a nearby garage. Biological contaminants: Bacteria, molds, pollen, and virusesare types of biological contaminants. These contaminants may breed in stagnantwater that has accumulated in ducts, humidifiers and drain pans, or wherewater has collected on ceiling tiles, carpeting, or insulation. Sometimesinsects or bird droppings can be a source of biological contaminants. Physicalsymptoms related to biological contamination include cough, chest tightness,fever, chills, muscle aches, and allergic responses such as mucous membraneirritation and upper respiratory congestion. One indoor bacterium, Legionella,has caused both Legionnaire's Disease and Pontiac Fever. These elements may act in combination, and may supplement other complaintssuch as inadequate temperature, humidity, or lighting. Even after a buildinginvestigation, however, the specific causes of the complaints may remainunknown. A Word About Radon and Asbestos... SBS and BRI are associated with acute or immediate health problems;radon and asbestos cause long-term diseases which occur years after exposure,and are therefore not considered to be among the causes of sick buildings.This is not to say that the latter are not serious health risks; both shouldbe included in any comprehensive evaluation of a building's IAQ. Building Investigation Procedures The goal of a building investigation is to identify and solve indoorair quality complaints in a way that prevents them from recurring and whichavoids the creation of other problems. To achieve this goal, it is necessaryfor the investigator(s) to discover whether a complaint is actually relatedto indoor air quality, identify the cause of the complaint, and determinethe most appropriate corrective actions. An indoor air quality investigation procedure is best characterizedas a cycle of information gathering, hypothesis formation, and hypothesistesting. It generally begins with a walkthrough inspection of the problemarea to provide information about the four basic factors that influenceindoor air quality: 1) the occupants, 2) the HVAC system, 3) possible pollutantpathways, 4) possible contaminant sources. Preparation for a walkthrough should include documenting easily obtainableinformation about the history of the building and of the complaints; identifyingknown HVAC zones and complaint areas; notifying occupants of the upcominginvestigation; and, identifying key individuals needed for informationand access. The walkthrough itself entails visual inspection of criticalbuilding areas and consultation with occupants and staff. The initial walkthrough should allow the investigator to develop somepossible explanations for the complaint. At this point, the investigatormay have sufficient information to formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis,and see if the problem is solved. If it is, steps should be taken to ensurethat it does not recur. However, if insufficient information is obtainedfrom the walk through to construct a hypothesis, or if initial tests failto reveal the problem, the investigator should move on to collect additionalinformation to allow formulation of additional hypoth- eses. The processof formulating hypotheses, testing them, and evaluating them continuesuntil the problem is solved. Although air sampling for contaminants might seem to be the logicalresponse to occupant complaints, it seldom provides information about possiblecauses. While certain basic measurements, e.g., temperature, relative humidity,CO2, and air movement, can provide a useful "snapshot" of currentbuilding conditions, sampling for specific pollutant concentrations isoften not required to solve the problem and can even be misleading. Contaminantconcentration levels rarely exceed existing standards and guidelines evenwhen occupants continue to report health complaints. Air sampling shouldnot be undertaken until considerable information on the factors listedabove has been collected, and any sampling strategy should be based ona comprehensive understanding of how the build- ing operates and the natureof the complaints. Solutions to Sick Building Syndrome Solutions to sick building syndrome usually include combinations ofthe following: 1) Pollutant source removal or modification is an effective approachto resolving an IAQ problem when sources are known and control is feasible.Examples include routine maintenance of HVAC systems, e.g., periodic cleaningor replacement of filters; replacement of water-stained ceiling tile andcarpeting; institution of smoking restrictions; venting contaminant sourceemissions to the outdoors; storage and use of paints, adhesives, solvents,and pesticides in well ventilated areas, and use of these pollutant sourcesduring periods of non-occupancy; and allowing time for building materialsin new or remodeled areas to off-gas pollutants before occupancy. Severalof these options may be exercised at one time. 2) Increasing ventilation rates and air distribution often can be acost effective means of reducing indoor pollutant levels. HVAC systemsshould be designed, at a minimum, to meet ventilation standards in localbuilding codes; however, many systems are not operated or maintained toensure that these design ventilation rates are provided. In many buildings,IAQ can be improved by operating the HVAC system to at least its designstandard, and to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989 if possible. When there are strongpollutant sources, local exhaust ventilation may be appropriate to exhaustcontaminated air directly from the building. Local exhaust ventilationis particularly recommended to remove pollutants that accumulate in specificareas such as rest rooms, copy rooms, and printing facilities. (For a moredetailed discussion of ventilation, read Indoor Air Facts No. 3R, Ventilationand Air Quality in Office Buildings.) 3) Air cleaning can be a useful adjunct to source control and ventilationbut has certain limitations. Particle control devices such as the typicalfurnace filter are inexpensive but do not effectively capture small particles;high performance air filters capture the smaller, respirable particlesbut are relatively expensive to install and operate. Mechanical filtersdo not remove gaseous pollutants. Some specific gaseous pollutants maybe removed by adsorbent beds, but these devices can be expensive and requirefrequent replacement of the adsorbent material. In sum, air cleaners canbe useful, but have limited application. Education and communication are important elements in both remedialand preventive indoor air quality management programs. When building occupants,management, and maintenance personnel fully communicate and understandthe causes and consequences of IAQ problems, they can work more effectivelytogether to prevent problems from occurring, or to solve them if they do.

Background EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoorlevels of many pollutants often are significantly higher than outdoor levels.These levels of indoor air pollutants are of particular concern becauseit is estimated that most people spend approximately 90 percent of theirtime indoors. In recent years, comparative risk studies performed by EPA and its ScienceAdvisory Board have consistently ranked indoor air pollution among thetop five environmental risks to public health. EPA, in close cooperationwith other federal agencies and the private sector, has begun a concertedeffort to better understand indoor air pollution and to reduce peoples'exposure to air pollutants in offices, homes, schools and other indoorenvironments where people live, work and play. Tobacco smoking has long been recognized as a major cause of death anddisease, responsible for an estimated 434,000 deaths per year in the UnitedStates. Tobacco use is known to cause lung cancer in humans, and is a majorrisk factor for heart disease. In recent years, there has been concern that non-smokers may also beat risk for some of these health effects as a result of their exposure( passive smoking") to the smoke exhaled by smokers and smoke givenoff by the burning end of cigarettes. As part of its effort to addressall types of indoor air pollution, in 1988, EPA's Indoor Air Division requestedthat EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) undertake an assessmentof the respiratory health effects of passive smoking. The report was preparedby ORD's Office of Health and Environmental Assessment. The document has been prepared under the authority of Title IV of Superfund(The Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986), which directsEPA to conduct research and disseminate information on all aspects of indoorair quality. Public and Scientific Reviews A draft of this assessment was released for public review in June 1990.In December 1990, EPA's Science Advisory Board, a committee of independentscientists, conducted a review of the draft report and submitted its commentsto the EPA Administrator in April 1991. In its comments, the SAB's IndoorAir Quality/Total Human Exposure Committee concurred with the primary findingsof the report, but made a number of recommendations for strengthening it. Incorporating these recommendations, the Agency again transmitted anew draft to the SAB in May of 1992 for a second review. Following a July1992 meeting, the SAB panel endorsed the major conclusions of the report,including its unanimous endorsement of the classification of environmentaltobacco smoke (ETS) as a Group A (known human) carcinogen. EPA also received and reviewed more than 100 comments from the public,and integrated appropriate revisions into the final risk assessment. Major Conclusions Based on the weight of the available scientific evidence, EPA has concludedthat the widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the U.S.presents a serious and substantial public health risk. In adults: ETS is a human lung carcinogen, responsible for approximately 3,000lung cancer deaths annually in U.S. nonsmokers. ETS has been classifiedas a Group A carcinogen under EPA's carcinogen assessment guidelines. Thisclassification is reserved for those compounds or mixtures which have beenshown to cause cancer in humans, based on studies in human populations. In children: ETS exposure increases the risk of lower respiratory tract infectionssuch as bronchitis and pneumonia. EPA estimates that between 150,000 and300,000 of these cases annually in infants and young children up to 18months of age are attributable to exposure to ETS. Of these, between 7,500and 15,000 will result in hospitalization. ETS exposure increases the prevalence of fluid in the middle ear, asign of chronic middle ear disease. ETS exposure in children irritates the upper respiratory tract and isassociated with a small but significant reduction in lung function. ETS exposure increases the frequency of episodes and severity of symptomsin asthmatic children. The report estimates that 200,000 to 1,000,000 asthmaticchildren have their condition worsened by exposure to environmental tobaccosmoke. ETS exposure is a risk factor for new cases of asthma in chuldren whohave not previously displayed symptoms. Scope of the Report In 1986, the National Research Council (NRC) and the U.S. Surgeon Generalindependently assessed the health effects of exposure to ETS. Both of thesereports concluded that ETS can cause lung cancer in adult non-smokers andthat children of parents who smoke have increased frequency of respiratorysymptoms and lower respiratory tract infections. The EPA scientific assessmentbuilds on these reports and is based on a thorough review of all of thestudies in the available literature. Since 1986, the number of studies which examine these issues in humanpopulations has more than doubled, resulting in a larger database withwhich to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the potential effects whichpassive smoking may have on the respiratory health of adults as well aschildren. Because only a very small number of studies on the possible associationbetween exposure to secondhand smoke and heart disease and other cancersexisted in the scientific literature at the time this assessment was firstundertaken, EPA has not conducted an assessment of the possible associationof heart disease and passive smoking. EPA is considering whether such anassessment should be undertaken in the future, but has no plans to do soat this time. Scientific Approach EPA reached its conclusions concerning the potential for ETS to actas a human carcinogen based on an analysis of all of the available data,including more than 30 epidemiologic (human) studies looking specificallyat passive smoking as well as information on active or direct smoking.In addition, EPA considered animal data, biological measurements of humanuptake of tobacco smoke components and other available data. The conclusionswere based on what is commonly known as the total weight-of-evidence"rather than on any one study or type of study. The finding that ETS should be classified as a Group A carcinogen isbased on the conclusive evidence of the dose-related lung carcinogenicityof mainstream smoke in active smokers and the similarities of mainstreamand sidestream smoke given off by the burning end of the cigarette. Thefinding is bolstered by the statistically significant exposure-relatedincrease in lung cancer in nonsmoking spouses of smokers which is foundin an analysis of more than 30 epidemiology studies that examined the associationbetween secondhand smoke and lung cancer. The weight-of-evidence analysis for the noncancer respiratory effectsin children is based primarily on a review of more than 100 studies, including50 recent epidemiology studies of children whose parents smoke. Beyond the Risk Assessment Although EPA does not have any regulatory authority for controllingETS, the Agency expects this report to be of value to other health professionalsand policymakers in taking appropriate steps to minimize peoples' exposureto tobacco smoke in indoor environments. In cooperation with other government agencies, EPA will carry out aneducation and outreach program over the next two years to inform the publicand policy makers on what to do to reduce the health risks of ETS as wellas other indoor air pollutants.

Concerns about the healthfulness of indoor air are driven by six majorfactors. First, it is now widely recognized that most people spend morethan 90 percent of their time indoors. Groups potentially more susceptibleto the effects of air pollution, like infants, the infirm, and the elderly,are inside virtually all the time. Because most of us spend so much timeinside, indoor pollution concentrations, even if they are uniformly lowerthan outdoor levels, make a significant contribution to our average exposureover a day, week, season, or year. Second, modern indoor environments contain a complex array of potentialsources of air pollution, including synthetic building materials, consumerproducts, and dust mites. Airborne emissions also occur because of thepeople, pets, and plants that inhabit these spaces. Efforts to lower energycosts by reducing ventilation rates have increased the likelihood thatpollutants generated indoors will accumulate. Third, monitoring studies inside buildings and vehicles have consistentlyfound that concentrations of many air pollutants tend to be higher indoorsthan out. Indoor air has been shown to be a complex mixture of chemical,biological, and physical agents, only a small fraction of which has beencharacterized adequately. This complexity is illustrated by the fact thatmore than 4,000 different compounds have been identified in tobacco smokealone. Fourth, scientific reports indicate that indoor measurements are oftenbetter than outdoor measurements for classifying, estimating, and predictinghuman exposures to many air pollutants. This is true even for some agentsthat are primarily of outdoor origin. A promising approach to more realisticexposure estimation is the development and refinement of models that combineinformation about pollutant concentrations in both indoor and outdoor settingswith data on time-activity patterns. Fifth among the factors driving indoor air concerns, complaints aboutinadequate indoor air quality and associated discomfort and illness area burgeoning problem in our society. Reports of illness outbreaks amongbuilding occupants, particularly office workers, with no secondary spreadof the illness to others outside the building with whom affected individualscome into contact, have become commonplace. EPA classifies these reportsinto two general categories. Building- related illness refers to episodeswhen symptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributeddirectly to airborne contaminants in the building. In contrast, sick-buildingsyndrome is defined as situations in which building occupants experienceacute health and comfort effects that appear to be linked to time spentin the building, but no specific illness or cause can be identified. The so-called chemical sensitivity syndromes, which may be caused onlypartially or not at all by chemicals, are a different, although potentiallyrelated matter. Broadly defined, "multiple chemical sensitivity"(MCS) is postulated to be development of responsiveness, including manifestationof often disabling symptoms, to extremely low concentrations of chemicalsfollowing sensitization. A controversial and emotional topic, the conceptof MCS as a distinct entity caused by exposure to chemicals has been challengedby the medical and scientific communities, and there appears to be consensusthat substantially more study is needed before MCS should be consideredas a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, many sufferers of MCS continue tobelieve that their conditions are either caused or exacerbated by indoorair pollution. And sixth, exposures to many indoor air pollutants are known or suspectedto occur at levels sufficient to cause illness or injury. Scientific evidencesuggests that respiratory disease, allergy, mucous membrane irritation,nervous system effects, cardiovascular effects, reproductive effects, andlung cancer may be linked to exposures to indoor air pollutants. Scientists consistently rank indoor air pollution at or near the topof environmental health risks in the United States. EPA reports on risk-basedpriority setting, like Unfinished Business (1987), Reducing Risk (1990),and the Regional Comparative Risk Projects (1989-92), all ranked indoorair pollution as a high- priority risk to human health. Public opinionpolls, however, continue to find that most Americans do not perceive therisks of indoor air pollution to be great. The specter of potential public health risks from contaminated indoorair presents decision makers with a dilemma. Is the problem serious enoughto warrant intervention, and, if so, what preventive or remedial actionsare most appropriate? The significance of indoor air exposures for acute and chronic healtheffects remains uncertain in most cases. Nevertheless, there is ample reasonfor concern and caution. For example, it has been estimated that exposuresof nonsmokers to ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) may cause as many as3,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the United States, as well as contributeto a wide range of noncancer diseases, including pneumonia, bronchitis,and asthma. Findings from several studies suggest that indoor concentrationsof nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and respirable particles can exceedthe National Ambient (Outdoor) Air Quality Standards set by EPA to protectpublic health. And results from many studies show that a plethora of volatileorganic chemicals and pesticides known to be toxic and/or carcinogeniccan occur indoors at concentrations significantly higher than levels thatcreate concerns in outdoor air. Designing effective and efficient indoor control strategies requiresan understanding of several pertinent factors. Contaminant characteristicsneed to be considered, including factors like concentration, reactivity,and physical state. Emission source configurations (e.g., area or pointsources) must be taken into account, and it is necessary to determine whetherdischarges are continuous or intermittent. It is also important to understandthe dose-response relationship for the contaminant of interest so thatinformed decisions can be made whether individuals are to be protectedfrom short-term exposures to peak concentrations or from long-term exposuresto relatively low concentrations. And, of course, the type of indoor enclosure(e.g., residence, office, car) has ramifications for which approaches andmethods are viable options. But providing and maintaining healthful indoor air quality is more thanjust a complex scientific and technical issue. Realization that contaminatedindoor air may pose an unacceptable health hazard raises complicated policyquestions about the proper role of government in safeguarding people'shealth inside public and private spaces. Because concerns about adverse health consequences from air pollutionhave focused traditionally on outdoor and occupational exposures, federaland state government programs concentrate on protecting public health fromoutdoor air pollutants or protecting workers' health from dangerous airpollutants in the industrial workplace. As mentioned earlier, EPA setsand enforces National Ambient Air Quality Standards that are designed toprotect the general public to within an adequate margin of safety. TheOccupational Safety and Health Administration enforces consensus standardsfor industrial work environments, which are designed such that no employeewill suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity. However,federal responsibility and authority for indoor air quality in the nonworkplaceare less well defined. There is ample precedent for government authority and responsibilityto protect public health and welfare inside buildings. It is common practice,for instance, to regulate construction and operation of public buildingsto ensure that adequate provisions are made for health and safety. Governmentinspectors routinely enforce building codes, health regulations, safetyrules, and fire ordinances. While government has an obligation to protectpublic health in indoor as well as outdoor environments, the justificationfor direct government intervention varies according to the characteristicsassociated with different types of indoor settings. Creation of a regulatory framework for protecting indoor environmentalquality poses special policy issues. Promulgation of indoor air qualitystandards and other regulations must acknowledge that individuals, especiallyin private residences, are already making decisions about their own airquality. Development of effective and reasonable policy requires an appreciationof the scope for private action, as well as consideration of the likelihoodthat public intervention will foster improved private choices. This is not to suggest that rules and regulations have no part to playin safeguarding indoor air quality. This form of intervention is, however,not necessarily optimal or even desirable in certain types of indoor environments.There are, of course, many different types of indoor environments--forexample, occupational settings, both industrial and nonindustrial; nonoccupationalsettings, including residential, commercial, institutional, and public;and transportation microenvironments, such as automobiles, airplanes, subways,and trains. The role of government varies according to the "publicness"of a particular space as well as the nature of air-pollution health risks,either voluntary or nonvoluntary. Understanding the diversity of nonindustrialindoor environments is an important step in the design and implementationof practical and cost-effective control strategies. The rationale for government regulation of outdoor air pollution isbased in part on a definition of outdoor air as a "public good"and on the realization that those who suffer the effects of such pollutionare neither compensated by, nor powerful in influencing, polluters. Thesituation is quite different for some indoor environments, especially privateresidences, for both the costs and benefits of pollution control are internalizedwith households. If occupants foul the air in their home, they are forced to breatheit. If they attempt to improve its quality by increasing ventilation orinstalling air-cleaning devices, they bear the costs and enjoy the benefits.For some contaminants, such as tobacco smoke, odorants, and water vapor,benefits are readily recognizable through improvements in perceptible airquality and reduction of corrosion, soiling, and molds. The closed-loop, cost-benefit cycle within residences suggests thatindividual decisions are important determinants of indoor air quality.However, unlike residential energy consumption, where monthly bills fromthe local utility company provide periodic feedback to consumers, indoorcontaminants may be below irritation or odor thresholds. Thus, althoughindividuals are certainly making decisions about their own air quality,it is not clear that these are "informed" decisions. Governmentactions aimed at improving personal decisions about indoor air qualitymay be preferable to rules and regulations (e.g., simple warning devices,product labeling, or information programs). It has been suggested that the Clean Air Act be amended to give EPAauthority to control indoor air pollution in much the same way that outdoorair pollution is currently controlled. However, setting and enforcing strictindoor air quality standards, similar to existing National Ambient AirQuality Standards, would be impractical because of the prohibitive monitoringcosts and the difficulty of enforcement within approximately 82 millionresidences in the United States. Perhaps the most serious impediment to implementing a regulatory approachis public antipathy towards this form of intervention inside the home.Restriction of indoor pollution sources, certification of "safe"indoor concentrations, product emission standards, disclosure of potentialsources upon transfer of ownership, and specification of minimum ventilationrequirements are examples of government actions that are likely to be lesscostly and more effective than indoor air quality standards. Not all buildings are residences, and not all residences are owner-occupied.The rationale for direct government intervention aimed at improving indoorair quality is much stronger in public, as opposed to private buildings.Air quality in large public buildings, for instance, displays many characteristicsof a public good. A person sensitive to tobacco smoke would not rationallypay the costs of cleaning the air in a large convention hall. The costswould greatly exceed any personal benefits an individual might derive fromsmoke-free air, and those who did not contribute could not be excludedfrom enjoying the benefits. In this situation, the rationale for regulationis similar to that for outdoor air pollution. There is also substantial justification for regulatory interventionin private and public buildings where occupants do not have control overtheir own environment--for example, modern high-rise office buildings.Typically, building managers are responsible for operation and maintenanceof heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Occupantsof the building, including both employers and employees, often have littleor no direct control of temperature, fresh air input, and ventilation rate.Because HVAC systems are normally operated to minimize energy costs, thehealth and comfort of tenants rarely become an issue unless a significantnumber of complaints are reported. Because health risks in this situation tend to be nonvoluntary, governmentmay have a responsibility to safeguard public health by defining what constitutesacceptable indoor air and taking steps to ensure that those criteria aremet. Examples of government actions that might be warranted include specificationof minimum ventilation rates necessary to achieve healthful indoor airquality, establishment of emission limitations for building materials,and development of indoor air quality guidelines or standards for importantcontaminants. As a practical matter, however, development of a comprehensive federalapproach to address problems of indoor air pollution awaits resolutionof important public policy and public health questions about the properrole of government in safeguarding the air quality inside public and privatespaces.

Auxiliary fans (ceiling fans, blower or oscillating fans) are veryhelpful and often essential. A nightly ozone blast is essential. A timer should be installed (linetimers are available at hardware stores) so the unit(s) can be left onhigh at night and turned off two to three hours before the first employeearrives.

It is important that you have a clear understanding of various processes that will comprise your treatment. The physicians in the practice are medical and reproductive endocrinologists, gynecologists and obstetricians, all dedicated to helping patients with problems achieving pregnancy. Our team is also comprised of nurses, ultrasonographers, embryologists, andrologists, medical technologists, physicians assistants and researchers, all with expertise in the field of infertility. Though our practice is well known for its dedication to the problem of infertility, we also treat other problems in reproductive endocrinolgy, e.g., women with no periods (amenorrhea) or women bleeding too much or having severe pain with menstruation (e.g., endometriosis) and menopause; along with other endocrine problems, e.g., thyroid, pituitary and adrenal (but not diabetes). We also treat excess hair on women and hair loss (for both women and men). Our practice now includes routine obstetrics and gynecology in Pennsylvania and Southern New Jersey. For the male we not only take care of subnormal semen specimens but also sexual problems related to hormonal disorders.WT02-B09-136IA057-000945-B043-3http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/locate.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054024 text/html 498HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:40:36 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html Locations Click on location for map and directions.

However, due to many factors which may impair fertility, one out of every six couples attempting to achieve a pregnancy will experience difficulty. Our objective is to provide the best medical evaluation and therapy available in order to achieve a pregnancy in a minimal amount of time. Cervical Factor Male Factor Mechanical Factor Endometriosis Unexplained Infertility Assisted Reproductive Techniques Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion Insurance Research Ovulation Disorders Ovulation disorders may be broken down into three distinct categories. The first, anovulation, is when a woman does not ovulate at all. ovulation inducing drugs, (also known as "fertility drugs") are used to correct anovulation. The most commonly prescribed are Clomid (clomiphene citrate) or Serophone, an orally administered coumpound used to stimulate the release of pituitary gonadotropins to mediate ovulation. We also use injectable medications comprised of lutenizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), also known as human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), prescribed as Pergonal and Humegon. A similar injectable drug, Metrodin, which is pure FSH minus the LH, is used in similar circumstances as hMG. Its clinical application is to stimulate ovarian follicle growth and maturation. The third fertility drug which would be prescribed, in cases where the serum prolactin level is elevated, would be bromocriptine. Another type of ovulatory problem is a luteal phase defect. There are two kinds of luteal phase defects, the first, referred to as a pure luteal phase defect, in which there is insufficient production of the hormone progesterone, but the follicle (the sac containing the egg) is mature. Progesterone is needed to build up the uterine lining, to enable the embryo to implant. To determine a progesterone deficiency an endometrial biopsy is performed, a simple procedure done in the office where a small sample of endometrial (uterine) tissue is obtained with a plastic pipette. Supplementation of progestrone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) may be given. Information regarding the benefits of progesterone and the options for treatment will be provided to patients in order that they may select the treatment option that best suits their physical comfort and financial affordability. Another type of luteal phase defect is known as immature follicles. This is determined by inadequate serum estradiol levels, less than 200 pg/mL, and or follicles size less than 18mm on ultrasound, both studies being performed at mid-cycle when follicular maturation occurs. Ovulation inducing drugs, as previously described, are used to correct these defects. The medication used tis chosen after careful monitoring with blood levels and ultrasound. Each drug has its advantages and disadvantages. Clomiphene citrate is a less expensive ovulation inducing drug, but may sometimes interfere with the production of cervical mucus (causing what is knwn as cervical factor-for a more detailed description see cervical factor below). Although more costly, hMG in some cases is more effective in promothing follicular maturation. The decision of which drug to employ is made after careful evaluation and consultation with your physician. Another ovulation disorder is known as premature luteinization, when the production of progesterone occurs prematurely, that is before ovulation has taken place. Referred to medically as the follicle undergoing "atresia", it cuases the egg to die and destroys the cervical mucus needed to aid tin transporting the sperm thoufhg the cervix. Once again, an ovulation inducing drug may be used to insure ovulation has taken place before the rise in progesterone. Frequently, this may be corrected by first blocking the woman's LH through the use of high-dose estrogen or a drug known as a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) which suppresses LH and FSH. Examples include leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or nafarelin (Synarel). These drugs would be followed by eiter Pergonal, Humegon or Metrodin. Cervical Factor Cervical factor, or inadequate quality or quanitity of cervical mucus is determined by perfoming a simple test known as the post-coital test (PCT). Male Factor It is important for couples to realize that fertility potential involves both partners. Therefore, it is beneficial when performing a complete work-up for infertility to evaluate both partners. Mechanical Factor To determine whehter or not the fallopian tubes are patent (open), one of two procedures is performed. Endometriosis Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue from the lining of the uterus implants itself on either the ovaries or other pelvic organs. Unexplained Infertility Unexplained infertility can be treated in several ways. If a male factor is supsected, either IUI or IVF may be performed. Assisted Reproductive Techniques Our in vitro fertilization (IVF) program began in 1988, then known as Endocrine Histology. After expanding our practice in November 1991 by opening an office in Marlton, N.J., in an effort to increase efficiency and avoid any duplication, the decision was made to merge our PA and NJ programs to one location, which is now known as the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization (located in our Marlton, NJ office). Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion We have found through many studies and in clinical practice that there is immense benefit in using progesterone to prevent habitual or recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) or miscarriages in most women. Insurance Various insurance plans are accepted by our practice. These include many major managed care plans and HMO plans, as well as indemnity (private) insurance plans. When calling for an appointment someone can advise you if your particular insurance plan is one our group participates in or accepts. There are differences in coverage, within the same insurance company, depending on the plan offered to you by your employer. For this reson you should contact your Employee Benefits Department of call Member Services at the insurance company. You would need to know what is covered and whether there are any time or cost limitations, and any or all exclusions. Our experienced and knowledgeable staff stands ready to assist you with your questions and claims. Our practice is committed to your clinical, emotional, and financial well being. Our fees compare most favorably to others who provide the same services. Research In addition to the clinical services described herein, we have established, within our practice, a research department whose staff is devoted to the collection and analysis of data, for the purpose of determining the most effective therapies and treatment modalities within our field. The research team, headed by Dr. Check, reports its scientific findings throughout the world via slide and poster presentations at international meetings and symposia, as well as publications in scientific books and journals. Most importantly, our findings are applied right here in our own practice so that we can offer the most effective approach and treatments for the various factors that play a role in establishing and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. In fact, our group has published over 300 manuscripts in peer review journals, mostly dealing with new methods of dianosing and treating infertility; thus, in addition to the teaching of medical students and OB/GYN residents at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Camden, our publications help physicians around the world to improve treatment of their patients. The department is comprised of a full-time staff of clinical and administrative personnel. Some of our physicians, nurses and technologists also contribute to the time consuming task of collecting and evaluating data. Our research is part of what makes us a unique center and contributes greatly to our ability to offer state of the art medicine. Because we like to provide our patients with as much information as possible, we do make available pamphlets and booklets from outside sources. However, we do not necessarily always agree with all the treatments and therapies described therein.WT02-B09-138IA057-000945-B043-40http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/article.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054051 text/html 1570HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:41:00 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html Article Listing Published Articles .

It is a hollow, muscular structure that is part of the female reproductive tract and is the source of a woman's menses. zona pellucida the outer covering of the ovum that the sperm must penetrate before fertiliztion can occur. zygote an embryo in early development stage. zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT) transfer of a zygote into a fallopian tube (usually done by a laparoscopy). homeWT02-B09-140IA057-000945-B043-86http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/ivf.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054107 text/html 1211HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:41:19 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html IVF Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization Patient Information Welcoming Information General Patient Information Preliminary testing Office hours and locations Explanation of technique Egg retrieval Embryo transfer Cryopreservation (freezing) Factors & Risks Associated with the IVF Procedure Special laboratory techniques Assisted hatching ICSI Donor sperm Reproductive Immunology Donor oocyte program Donor embryo program Out of town patients homeWT02-B09-141IA057-000945-B043-117http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/eggdonor.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054126 text/html 4013HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:41:36 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html Egg Donor Program Cooper Institute's Oocyte Donor Program The Donor Oocyte (egg) Program was established in 1988 with the intent and purpose of making the IVF procedure more affordable. Donation of oocytes is an option for those IVF participants in need of some financial assistance. By donating half of the recovered eggs during an IVF cycle, the donor has the opportunity to assist another infertile person or couple to achieve a pregnancy, as well as receive some financial assistance to cover the expense of IVF. The donor, in exchange for the sharing of her eggs, has the egg retrieval, the embryo transfer, and the necessary medications paid for by the recipient of the eggs. Those IVF patients wishing to donate eggs are selected anonymously by a patient who needs donor eggs, (a recipient). We cannot guarantee that all women wishing to be a donor will be selected. The IVF cycle includes the ultrasound guided transvaginal retrieval, incubation, fertilization, and development of embryo(s), and transfer of embryos(s). Both donor and recipient are responsible for their own preliminary IVF testing and bloodwork/ultrasounds for the cyle. If necessary, each party will be responsible for the cost of sperm washing, sperm donation, sperm freezing, cryopreservation of excess embryos and embryo storage costs. The total number of oocytes will be equally divided between the donor and the recipient at the time of retrieval. If an odd number of oocytes is obtained, the recipient will receive the extra egg. For instance, if fifteen oocytes are obtained, teh recipient will receive all of the eggs from that cycle. The recipient will then be financially responsible for another IVF cycle and medications for the donor. During the donor's then be financially responsible for another IVF cycle and medications for the donor. During the donor's next attempt at retrieval, the donor will retain the same number of oocytes as produced in her previous cycle where less than five oocytes were obtained. Any remaining oocytes will then be equally devided between the donor and the recipient, if requested by the recipient. A donor who has produced fewer eggs than expected has the right to keep all the eggs for herself. The recipient must be reimbursed for all of the medication costs. The donor cycle will be automatically cancelled if during the follicle stimulation process they fail to produce an adequate amount of estradiol. That level is defined as less than or equal to 120pg/ml on day five of Peronal/Metrodin/Humegon. The recipient will be notified by the IVF staff that the cycle is cancelled. The donor is obligated to return all unused medication to the recipient. In the event the egg donor experiences ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and must freeze all of the embryos, the egg recipient will be responsilbe for an additional $350.00 to cover the added expense of a frozen embryo transfer for the donor. In the event a donor refuses to donate her oocytes in accordance to the procedure set forth above, the donor will then be responsilbe for the payment of all costs relating to the donor cycle. This includes the retrieval, incubation and fertilization, transfer, any medication provided by the recipient, plus the recipient's medication costs for the cycle. This payment must be made prior to the retrieval of oocytes. The recipient is relieved of any further obligation to the donor if the donor refuses to donte.

Before the Egg Retrieval B. During the Egg Retrieval C. After the Egg Retrieval D. After the Embryo Transfer A. Before the Egg Retrieval What preliminary testing is needed for myself and partner? Refer to the IVF packet for a list of all needed tests. Please note that cultures need to be scheduled on weekdays only. It takes ten days to get the results. You should call the office where you had the testing done to make sure all of the testing is negative. Because I live a distance from the office, can I have my prelimary testing done at my docotrs office? We prefer that you have your reliminary testing done in the office the day you have the initial IVF consult and mock transfer, but other arrangements can be made if necessary. Is the male partner required to freeze a semen specimen and if so, can he do it with the inital semen analysis and cultures? It is strongly suggested that a semen specimen be frozen prior to the egg retrieval. If the male partner is ill on the day of the retrieval, the frozen specimen can be used to inseminate the eggs. A separate specimen of semen is needed to freeze and it should not be produced until the cultures have been cleared. You must schedule an appointment with the Andrology Lab for a semen freeze. If I had the Hysterosalpingogram (the X-Ray of the uterus and tubes) done before, do I need to repeat it? No, not unless the test was done many years prior or you had a surgical procedure since your last hysterosalpingogram. Ask the IVF nurse if there are any questions. How do I know which doctor will be doing my retrieval and transfer? The IVF docotrs rotate for a period of time. The rotation begins with Monday and ends with Sunday. How do I knwo what medication I will be taking and when to take it? During the IVF consult with the doctor, he/she will discuss with you the best medication stimulation protocol that you should be using. An instruction sheet and prescriptions will be given to you. What should I do if I get my period, (cycle day 1), at night or on a weekend? you should leave your name, date and phone number on our answering machine, (609)751-3570. If you need instructions or have questions, please ask us to return your call. We will call you back the next day. If you need immediate instructions, you should call (609) 751-5575 and leave a message with the service to have the doctor return you call. If I do not know how to take the injectable medication, what should I do? You need to schedule a consult with an IVF nurse. The person that will be giving you the medication should be present at the time of consult. Generally these consults are best done between 2:00PM and 5:00PM, depending on the IVF schedule. B. During the Egg Retrieval How long does the egg retrieval take? Depending on the number of follicles that are present, the time may vary from one to one and one half hours. You should plan on being at the IVF suite for a minimum of three hours. Is the egg retrieval a painful procedure? Generally, most patients are asleep during the procedure. We usually administer Fentanyl an dVersed intravenously during the procedure. These are very potent pain relievers and therefore most women tolerate the procedure with a minimum amount of discomfort. How will I feel after the egg retrieval? Usually patients compain of feeling sleepy. Occasionally they will experience some abdominal discomfort. The day after the egg retrieval some patients decide to return to work, which is fine if you feel well enough. If you can afford the time off from work, we would encourage you to stay at home because you may not feel quite up to par. When is my male partner required to produce the semen specimen? On the day of egg retrieval, the Embryologist will inform you when the time is proper for you to produce. We have private rooms available for your use. If you have a specific problem, i.e., time constraints or difficulty producing, you should discuss this with an embryologist in advance of the egg retrieval. Does every follicle contain an egg? No. In fact, sometimes if the estradiol is very high it is difficult to see every follicle, so we may get many more eggs at time of retrieval than number of follicles seen on ultrasound. Unfortunately, when the estradiol is low and only one or two follicles are present on ultrasound, there may not be an egg in the follicle. This is called empty follicle syndrome. We will prescan you prior to the egg retrieval if you have a small number of follicles present on ultrasound day of hCG. C. After the Egg Retrieval Will every egg fertilize? Our normal fertilization rate is approximately 65%. Some patients have a much higher rate of fertilization and occasionally a few patients will unfortunately have no ferilization. If you do not get 100% fertilization with the first day insemination, we will encourage the male partner to return to the IVF suite the next day to produce another semen specimen so that we may attempt to increase the number of fertilized oocytes (eggs). When are the embryos frozen? They can either be frozen the day after the egg retrieval, called the 2 Pronuclear stage, or the day of the ET or the day after that, if they appear normal. D. After the Embryo Transfer How long can embryos stay in frozen storage before being used? No one knows the exact answer to this question. In our program, several women have delivered healthy, normal babies when the embryos were stored for 5 years in our laboratory. After my transfer, will all of my remaining embryos be frozen? Not all embryos go through normal cell division. If the embryos do not appear normal, they will be discarded in the lab. The Embryologist will call you 2-3 days after your transfer to tell you the total number of embryos that were frozen. ALL EMBRYOS THAT LOOK NORMAL WILL BE FROZEN. When can I resume normal acitivities, i.e., driving, walking steps, going to work, etc.? 48 hours after the transfer you may resume normal acitivity, unless you have a very strenuous job. If your job is stenuous, you should discuss this with the doctor. When can I have sexual relations? There have not been any scientific studies done on this subject, but we think it is okay to resume normal sexual realtions after three days from transfer. What is the best position to stay in after the transfer? Lying flat in a bed or couch or reclining in a chair is best. You may lie on your side or back, whcihever is more comfortable for you. You should stay reclining except for using the bathroom and showering for 36 hours after the embryo transfer. On the drive home, must I lie flat? Because of the hazards of driving without a seat belt, we advise that you recline in the front seat, if possible, and put your seat belt on. If I live far away, should I stay in a hotel for two days after the transfer? If you live farther than two hours from the office, it would probably be best that you stay in a nearby hotel, at least the night of the embryo transfer. When can I resume strenuous exercise? You may resume strenuous exercise only with the consent of a physician and after you have had your pregnancy test. We hope that these questions and answers will be helpful to you. Or course, you should always call if you are unsure of the procedure. homeWT02-B09-143IA057-000945-B043-171http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/course.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054150 text/html 862HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:42:02 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html IVF Course Update IVF Orientation Classes This presentation is offered bimonthly, in the evening, for your convenience, from 6:30PM - 8:30PM.

You will find, herein, information concerning the In Vitro process: the required preliminary testing, a description of the procedure, the risks and responsibilities of participants, and the andrology/embryology protocol. Our program began in 1988 at our Melrose Park, PA office. In September 1990, we opened a new state of the art IVF laboratory in Marlton, New Jersey and in November of 1991, we merged our two In Vitro Fertilization programs to form the Cooper Institute for IVF in Marlton, New Jersey. In 1994, we reestablished the Program as the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization, P.C. We have been a member of The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, (SART), since 1989. This society is an affiliate of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. SART's function is to set guidelines and monitor the pregnancy rate of its members in this new and growing field of In Vitro Fertilization. We perform approximately 550 egg retrievals per year and are considered one fo the largest IVF programs in the United States. We are affiliated with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at Camden.

A brief overview of the IVF Program is described herein. Additional information will be provided at the time of consultation. In addition to explaining the IVF/ET (Embryo Transfer) technique, this document describes the major significant and foreseeable risks of the procedures, possible alternatives to IVF/ET, if any, and the responsibilities of couples who participate in our IVF program. Introduction In order for pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm. Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube. When this process cannot take place in the body, it can be accomplished in the laboratory by using the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) technique. The technique, as currently practiced, involves uniting an egg(s) collected from a woman's ovary with sperm collected from her partner under laboratory conditions. The resulting normal embryo(s) may be transferred to the uterus (womb) for continued growth. The benefit of IVF and ET is that it gives a couple who may be unable to achieve a pregnancy an opportunity to attempt to overcome their infertility. Who will benefit from IVF? IVF is of demonstrated value for patients with absence or blockage of the fallopian tubes. IVF is also recommended to those where corrective surgery has either failed and/or is deemed inadvisable. Couple with infertility related to severe male factor, e.g. lowered sperm counts or motility, antisperm antibodies, or hostile cervical mucus may also be assisted. Those who have other causes of infertility such as endometriosis, unruptured follicle syndrome or who have unexplained infertility may also receive benefit. Stages to IVF Preliminary testing Stimulation of mature oocytes (eggs) Oocyte retrieval Sperm collection Incubation and fertilization of eggs/embryos Fresh embryo transfer back into the uterus Cryopreservation (freezing) of extra embryosWT02-B09-151IA089-000958-B022-125http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/prelim.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054347 text/html 8158HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:43:55 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html Preliminary Testing Preliminary Testing This includes, but is not limited to, blood studies,cultures, IVF consult, mock transfer, hysterosalpingogram (HSG), baseline bloods, (day 2 or 3), nursing consult and financial consult. All testing (bloodwork and cultures) is usually completedprior to initiating an IVF cycle. If the results of any of thescreening procedures are not satisfactory, the patient may bedenied participation in the Program. This requirement is to maintainthe health and safety of the participants in the In Vitro Program.Please call the office, Marlton, NJ (609) 751-5575, Melrose Park,PA (215) 635-5518, Newark, DE (302) 633-0500 or Bayonne, NJ (201)858-4500 two weeks after the testing is done, to confirm the results.You should contact the office where the testing was performed.Blood studies and cultures must be repeated once a year. An appointment is necessary to have cultures, semen analysis, consults (Physicians and Nurses), hysterosalpingogram,and mock transfer. Finances can be discussed with Cindy Weisbeinat (215) 635-0877 or (800) 752-1086. Please refer to our Office Hours. Female Blood Studies HIV, HBsAG, HcAb, RPR, Blood Type-RH, Rubella, APTT,CBC, Anti-Sperm Antibody, Chlamydia Ab Male Blood Studies HIV, HBsAG, HcAb, RPR, Chlamydia Ab Cultures: Thesemay be done in any of our offices, Monday through Friday ONLY. Semen cultures need to be scheduled with the Andrology Department: Marlton, NJ (609) 751-5250, Melrose Park, PA (215) 635-4930or Newark, DE (302) 633-0500. Female Cervical Cultures Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia Male Semen Cultures Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Antisperm Antibodies (ASA) IVF Consult: The IVF doctor will complete a history and physical examination at the time of consultation. The IVF process and consent forms will be thoroughly reveiwed. It is helpful to bring copies of your old medical records and hysterosalpingography films, if available. Mock Transfer: A mock trnsfer should be done on a non-IVF cycle, days 1-9 of your cycle. For the mock transfer, the physician inserts a tiny plastic catheter into the uterus. This allows the physician to measure the depth and direction of your uterus. You may experience some cramping during the procedure. It is recommended that you take Ibuprofen (approximately 600 mgs) 1/2 hour prior to his procedure. This will reduce the cramping. if you cannot take Ibuprofen, take 2 Extra-Strenght Tylenol tablets instead. You may schedule to have this performed at the time of your IVF consult or along with having cervical cultures. Uterine Cavity and Fallopian Tube Evaluation: This can be accomplished by 1 of 3 methods: Hysterosalpingogram (x-ray), Hysteroscopy (endoscopy) or Sonohysterography (ultrasound). The Physician will determine which procedure is most appropriate for you. Depending on the results, you may need more than one type of testing. The IVF physician will instruct yuo as to when to schedule the procedure. if you have previously had a hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy the report and films should be reviewed by the physician. Baseline Bloods: Serum estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) are to be drawn either day 2 or 3 of your cycle. Leave your name and number for an IVF call back. These blood results are helpful to the physician so that hte best IVF stimulation protocol (medication) will be chosen for you to complete your IVF cycle. Semen Freezing: Once the semen cultures are negative, make an appointment with the Andrology Lab in one of our offices, for a semen freeze appointment. It is only necessary to freeze a specimen once before the first IVF cycle, unless we use it to inseminate your eggs and you choose to do another cycle. There is a one time charge of $125 to freeze and sotre a sperm specimen. This sample is used only as an emergency backup for the day of retrieval. We prefer to inseminate the eggs with fresh sperm, if possible. Sperm Processing Panel/ICSI Panel: After the emen analysis is performed, you will be told by the Andrology lab or a doctor, if the sperm count and/or motility are abnormally low. in this case, you will be advised to make an appointment to have a Pre-IVF Sperm Processing Panel/ICSI Panel at the Marlton office. This way, prior to the retrieval, we will have the opportunity to process the specimen and detemine the best method to use to obtain the maximum amount of motile sperm for inseminating the eggs. It is your responsibility to make this appointment. Please call the IVF or Andrology Labs if you have questions regarding the pre-IVF sperm processing panel. Nursing Consult: A consult with an IVF Nurse should be scheduled by those who need to learn how to administer the injectable medication for the IVF cycle. There is a fee associated with injection instructions. By day 1of the retrieval cycle, you should have all of your instructions and medications. If you do not, you need to call an IVF Nurse. The direct phone number to reach an IVF nurse is (609) 751-3570 or (215) 635-5518. Financial Consult: Please schedule a consult with the Billing Department Staff to discuss your financial obligations. A phone consult may be arranged at 1-(800)-752-1086 or (215)635-0877 for your convenience. Call Backs: IVF call backs will be made between 4:00PM - 7:00PM on weekdays and from 3:00PM - 6:00PM on Saturdays. If you will NOT be home, then you must have a telephone answering machine so that we may leave a message regarding your instructions. If you do not receive a call back by 7:00PM on weekdays or 6:00PM on Saturdays, please contact the answering service in the Marlton, NJ office at (609)751-5575 and ask to speak to the physician on call. A Personal Note: The process of In Vitro Fertilization can be psychologically stressful. Significan anxiety and disappointment may occur. A substantial commitment of time by the couple is needed. Some people have described the IVF experience as an emotional roller coaster. The IVF staff of physicians and nurses are well aware of the added stress and burden that the In Vitro process can sometimes create. We therefore, suggest that you consider joining a support group or participate in a therapy group to help you through this stressful period. If you would like more information about a group you could join, call LuAnn Vanaman, R.N., C. at the New Jersey office, (609)751-5575. Location: The IVF Program is located at: 8002E Greentree Commons, Marlton, NJ. The acutal egg retrievals and embryo transfers are done ONLY in the Marlton, NJ facility.

The female partner is positioned on a comfortable examination bed. A small intravenous (IV) catheter is inserted into her arm. An IV of dextrose, lactose and salt solution is then slowly infused. A speculum is placed in the vagina and both vagina and cervix are cleansed with sterile water. A vaginal ultrasound is performed to visualize the abdominal area. An injection site is made through the back of the vaginal wall to the ovary with a needle. The follicles are penetrated by the ultrasound-guided needle and suction applied to drain the follicular fluid. This fluid is examined via microscope by the embryologist who will inform the team members of the presence of an egg. The length of time for the procedure is influenced by the total number of follicles. Average time for the retrieval is one hour. Some discomfort may be experienced during the actual egg retrieval; however, most patients sleep through the procedure. Currently, we administer medications derived from the Morphine and Valium family of drugs by IV to achieve a "twilight sleep." We can arrange for a nurse anesthetist to administer anesthesia during the egg retrieval. There is an additional charge of $250.00. A check should be made payable to Cooper Anesthesia Associates. Payment is due the day of the retrieval. Patients with concerns or questions about using this service should discuss them with the IVF staff. The retrieval is considered an invasive procedure. There is a risk of infection, internal and/or vaginal bleeding, and possible damage to internal organs. The patient is monitored throughout the retrieval and recovery process and will be discharged after satisfactory evaluation by ultrasound examination. The duration of the recovery period is generally one to two hours. Prior to discharge, an antibiotic will be given as a preventative measure to decrease risk of infection. Instructions will also be given regarding progesterone supplementation. Intramuscular injections or oral capsules of the hormone progesterone will be started after the retrieval to aid in the implantation process. Sperm Collection and Insemination During the retrieval, the male partner will be notified by the embryologist to produce a fresh sperm sample by masturbation. The specimen will be processed in our laboratory and prepared for egg insemination. Only the identified partner�s sperm and/or the designated donor�s sperm will be used to inseminate the eggs obtained from the female partner. If you have a frozen semen specimen, (as previously recommended), then that sample will be utilized as a back up, in case of emergency. Incubation and Fertilization of Eggs The eggs and sperm will be placed together in a special culture fluid and kept in incubators in our laboratory. This process is called insemination. The eggs will be examined 16-20 hours after insemination for signs of fertilization. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs are now described as zygotes. When they divide to at least 2 cells they are called embryos. The laboratory environment is conducive for fertilization to occur, however, it cannot be guaranteed that fertilization will occur. Our average fertilization is 60% per cycle. This percentage may be higher or lower. You will be contacted by the embryology staff the morning after the retrieval. Information will be given regarding the status of the eggs, fertilization, and possible cryopreservation (freezing of embryos) at that time. The male partner may need to be available not only the day of the retrieval, but also the day following. A second sperm sample may be needed to reinseminate those eggs which have not fertilized as yet. homeWT02-B09-154IA089-000958-B022-238http://computerline.libertynet.org:80/endocrine/fac&risk.htm 204.170.205.49 19970208054505 text/html 2998HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Saturday, 08-Feb-97 05:45:15 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html Factors & Risks Factors & Risks Associated with the IVF Procedure Due to the nature of this procedure, which uses a metal needleto remove the egg(s), there is potential risk of injury to otherorgans: bladder, bowel, uterus, fallopian tube(s) or blood vessel(s).A minor problem or a serious complication may develop (such asinternal bleeding and / or infection) which may require hospitalizationand / or further surgical intervention to correct the problem(s)or to save life. This potential risk is less .1%. Pelvic scarring and / or technical problems may prevent recoveryof one or more eggs form the ovaries. There may be failure to recover an egg because ovulation hasoccurred before the time or retrieval. One or more eggs may not be recovered on attempted aspirationof the follicle. Laboratory conditions may arise which make it impossible orimpractical to proceed with in vitro fertilization at the timethat egg retrieval would otherwise be indicated. The eggs obtained may not be normal. The semen specimen produced may be of very poor quality, i.e.,low count and motility, or it may not be able to be produced. Appropriate laboratory processing of the sperm specimen maybe difficult or impossible. Fertilization of the eggs to form embryos may not occur. The embryos may not develop normally. If, in the physiciansbest judgment, this occurs, efforts to continue growth of theembryo(s) may be halted. When reasonably possible, this will takeplace only after previous consultation with the patient and herpartner. Eggs or embryos which have failed to develop and aretherefore not viable will not be transferred. Embryo transfer into the uterus may be technically difficultor impossible, due to unforeseen circumstances, or abnormal anatomy. If transfer is performed, implantation(s) may not result,(which is the most common cause). If implantation occurs, the embryo(s) may not grow or developnormally. Equipment failure, infection, and / or human error or otherunforeseen factors may result in loss or damage to eggs, spermsample, and / or embryos. Follicles containing mature eggs may not develop in the monitoredcycle. This may prevent obtaining eggs, or may result in obtainingimmature eggs which will not fertilize. Most infants who have been born following human in vitro fertilization have appeared normal at birth; animal offspring have usually been normal following in vitro fertilization and/or embryo transfer.

Thank you all for your help. To find out more about your rightsunder the new law, you may call 1-800-YES-4-215. This number will be operational soon. This page will be left up asan archive for awhile. On November 5, 1996, Californians will vote on a ballot initiative,Proposition 215, that would permit seriously and terminally ill patientsto use marijuana in their medical treatment. If the initiative passes,then patients, with a doctor�s approval, will be exempt from the state�scriminal marijuana laws. This initiative will affect thousands of peoplesuffering from cancer, glaucoma, AIDS and other diseases who do not findadequate relief from legally available medicines. Proposition 215 has similarprovisions to Senate Bill 1529, which passed the Assembly and Senate in1995. Unfortunately, Governor Wilson vetoed the bill, his third veto ofthe proposal in as many years. As Republicans we believe the government should not interfere withmedication decisions between a patient and his or her physician. It isa disgrace that thousands of people are denied the medication which theirdoctors feel is an essential part of their treatment. Proposition 215 takessuch decisions out of the hands of politicians and bureaucrats and leavesthem in the hands of the medical experts. Proposition 215 is supportedby the AmericanAcademy of Family Physicians, the AmericanPublic Health Association and the CaliforniaNurses Association.

Gunnison, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Pollster Mervin Field also reported that Proposition 215, which wouldlegalize medical use of marijuana, recovered from a slip in support earlierthis month and is now favored by 59 percent of likely voters; 35 percentoppose the measure, with 6 percent undecided. MEDICAL MARIJUANA With regard to Proposition 215, which would legalize use of marijuanafor medical purposes, Mark DiCamillo, managing editor of the poll, saidit appeals to two constituencies -- those who support use of marijuanaas an alternative drug and those who back legalization of any drugs. He noted that support had dipped from 62 percent in September to 56percent in early October, but had rebounded to 59 percent in the latestsurvey. ``It seems to have stabilized,'' DiCamillo said. The survey was conducted by telephone October 25-28 among 824 likelyvoters in the general election. Field said that 95 percent of the time,such a survey would have a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentagepoints, although that number could be larger for subgroups.

We believe licensed physicians arecompetent to employ marijuana, and patients have a right to obtain marijuanalegally, under medical supervision. The medical prohibition does not preventseriously ill patients from employing marijuana; it simply deprives themof medical supervision. Physicians are forced to choose between their ethicalresponsibilities to the patient and their legal liabilities to bureaucrats."(unquote) Who do you think said this? Some liberal? No. These are the wordsof Congressman Newt Gingrich in a letter he wrote in support of a billhe introduced in 1981 to legalize medical marijuana. I represent Republicans for Proposition 215, the medical marijuana measureon next Tuesday's ballot. Our supporters include former U.S. Secretaryof State George Schultz, Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman,National Review Senior Editor Richard Brookhiser, former gubernatorialcandidate Ron Unz, Chris Norby, the Mayor of Fullerton, and dozens of localRepublican clubs who support Proposition 215. We are Republicans in the tradition of Ronald Reagan. We support smallergovernment, lower taxes, and less government regulation of business andindividual rights. As Republicans, we do not believe that medical policiesshould be made by politicians and bureaucrats. Proposition 215 will not legalize marijuana. Only licensed physicians,as defined under state law, will be able to recommend marijuana to theirpatients. Prop. 215 is meant to be an interim measure. First, it callson the Congress and State Legislature to enact and institutionalize a systemfor providing marijuana for patients who have had it prescribed by theirdoctors. Until this happens, it prevents the prosecution of patients whouse and grow marijuana for their own medical use. It protects doctors frombeing prosecuted for advising their patients to use a drug they feel wouldbe the best treatment for their condition. A Harvard University study conducted of members of the American Societyof Clinical Oncology found that almost half of Oncologists, cancer specialists,have advised patients to use marijuana to counter the side effects of chemotherapy.The Drug Enforcement Administration's own Law Judge, Francis Young, ruledin 1988 that marijuana is an effective form of medicine for a variety ofailments and that it should be legalized for medical purposes. The bureaucratsat the DEA overruled Judge Young's decision. Proposition 215 is supported by medical organizations representing 38,000California doctors and nurses. The California Academy of Family Physicians,the American Public Health Association, the California Nurses Association,the California Nurses Alliance, the San Francisco Medical Society, andthe Los Angeles County AIDS Commission all endorse Proposition 215. Publichealth officials from counties and cities all over the state have endorsed215. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society of Northern California supportsProp. 215. Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest HMOs in the state, recentlyadded smoking marijuana to their list of recommended medications whichshould be administered to patients with AIDS wasting syndrome. Prop. 215 is supported by Senior Citizens. The Older Women's Leagueof California, the Congress of California Seniors, the California SeniorLegislature, and the California Legislative Council for Older Americansall support Prop. 215's passage November 5. Seniors support Proposition215 because they are the most frequent sufferers of glaucoma, cancer, andthe other diseases treated by medical marijuana. Proposition 215 is endorsed by all ten major Bay Area daily newspapers.And the first newspaper in the state to endorse Prop. 215, before it evenqualified for the ballot, was the Orange County Register, the flagshippaper of conservative Republicans in Southern California. Rebuttal If Prop. 215 passes, California would not become the first state toallow marijuana to be used by patients. Last year, Ohio passed a bill verysimilar to Prop. 215, allowing patients to grow and use marijuana on theadvice of their doctors. If arrested and prosecuted, patients could defendthemselves by proving medical need--the same provision as in Prop. 215.In addition, the Supreme Courts of Florida and Idaho recently ruled thatmedical marijuana-using patients are exempt from criminal penalties. Inthese three states, there has been no increase in marijuana use since thelaws have changed. Yet California continues to arrest thousands of peoplewho grow and use marijuana for their own medical purposes. It could be worse. In Oklahoma, paraplegic James Montgomery is currentlyserving a ten-year prison sentence for possession of two ounces of marijuanahe used to control seizures from his spinal cord injury. In Iowa, Jan Pleas,mother of two with glaucoma, faces five years in prison for possessionof her medicine. Or the cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy given aprescription for the huge, expensive, and often ineffective capsule knownas Marinol. These patients are so nauseous that they can't keep anythingdown, and too broke to afford the $30,000 a year the drug costs. The worstpart is, a cheaper and more effective alternative exists. Prop. 215 does not repeal any existing laws against the sale, use, orcultivation of marijuana for non-medical purposes. Selling or growing marijuana,driving under the influence of marijuana, or using marijuana for non-medicalpurposes would still be a crime. In fact, police would be free to arrestand prosecute anyone whom they feel is engaged in the improper use or distributionof marijuana. Prop. 215 would allow medical necessity as a defense in court,not against the power of police to conduct normal law enforcement duties.It would be up to the courts to decide in each case, whether medical necessityis a valid defense in that particular case. Prop. 215 calls upon Congressand the State Legislature to implement a rational system for allowing sickpeople to obtain the drug prescribed to them by their doctors. The opponents of Prop. 215 will tell you that no study has shown theefficacy of marijuana as medicine. This is simply not true. Scores of studieshave shown that marijuana is effective for a number of ailments, includingglaucoma, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and for counteracting the nauseacaused by chemotherapy for cancer and AIDS. Even studies done by opponentsto prove their point have produced the opposite results. For example, in1970, a study done at UCLA for the Los Angeles Police Department, intendingto show that marijuana damaged eyesight, instead showed that marijuanareduced pressure within the eyeball. This led to the discovery that marijuanais effective as a remedy for glaucoma. In 1975, Doctor Donald Tashkin at UCLA Medical Center did a double-blindscientific study on the effects of smoking marijuana to relieve acute bronchospasmin asthma patients. The results, published in the American Review of RespiratoryDisease, stated "the results appear to support the benefit ascribedto the use of cannabis in the last century for the treatment of bronchialasthma." Dr. Tashkin stated that unlike other medications which cantake 20 to 30 minutes to act, "one toke of marijuana relieves an asthmaattack immediately." In 1987, Republican Governor George Duekmejian appointed the CaliforniaResearch Advisory Panel to conduct the Cannabis Therapeutic Research Study.They performed rigorous testing with full scientific protocols and foundgreat benefit to chemotherapy patients smoking marijuana. Although thisstudy was funded by the state, the findings were suppressed. Had the Stateof California submitted this study to the FDA it could have been used togarner FDA approval for marijuana. But the politicians killed it, and thenew studies that need to get done are being stopped by political agendas.Just last month, the federal government denied permission to the Universityof California, San Francisco Medical Center to do a study on marijuanaand AIDS. In fact, the federal government has denied permission for everystudy on the medicinal effects of marijuana proposed in the last fifteenyears. For the opponents to say that no federally-approved studies supportthe proponents' arguments, while the federal government has refused tosanction any studies, is disingenuous and classic government Catch-22.It is typical bureaucratic double-speak.

Times Poll Support Increases Five Percent in Month From the Los Angeles Times -- October 25, 1996 Unlike Proposition 209, Proposition 215--the medical use of marijuanainitiative-is enjoying increasing support as the election draws near. Currently,when given the ballot description, 58% of likely voters support Proposition215 while 32% oppose it. In September, 53% of likely voters supported themeasure and 31% opposed it. The medical use of marijuana initiative enjoys electoral support thatis both wide and deep. Substantial majorities of almost all electoral groupsin the poll support the measure. Even California's oldest voters (65 yearsand older) and Republican voters support the measure by slim pluralities,while conservatives are evenly split over the initiative: 45% in favorand 46% opposed. This measure is also the most well-known of the propositions includedin the poll, with only 22% of voters saying they had not heard enough aboutthe initiative to express an initial opinion. The survey was conducted October 17th through 21st among 1,551 adultrespondents throughout the state, including 1,290 registered voters fromwhich 1,038 likely voters were determined.

The only reason I didn't vote for BarryGoldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. But I started writingfor National Review when I was fourteen. I am for Proposition 215because of my politics, not in spite of them. But I'm also for medicalmarijuana because I've had to use it. As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by electioncycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eveof Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforward-anoperation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapyis harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison intoyour bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousandsof malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the bodywants to get rid of it. That's why, chemotherapy causes nausea. To dealwith this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and Ialso did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked-up to a point.But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana. I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies.I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or beinghigh, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancerbecause marijuana gives people an appetite, and prevents people who arenauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York UniversityMedical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doingthis. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea,and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of themarijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free. There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this. Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patientswho have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetiteagain. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of theireyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis useit to relieve their symptoms. But any sick person who wants to use marijuanato help himself, has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite,so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plentyof them go to jail. There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana,all of them faulty. The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is availablein a legally prescribed pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive.Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjustingthe dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It all seems tocause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treatingnausea with a pill was not a bright idea. The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically.This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the LosAngeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilatedthe pupils. The researchers found that it actually contracted the pupils;they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball.This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma. But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is becausethe government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San FranciscoGeneral Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wantsto test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome.For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse for his experiments-to no avail. So doctors cannotprescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowedto do any tests. This is classic Catch-22. The third objection is that by legalizing medical use of marijuana.,we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs.In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphinein hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patientwith an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher. My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles,but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be foughtintelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick.I am for traditional values-I support the Christian Coalition, and I supportedthe Moral Majority. But if carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is notmoral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting governmentoff people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying tohelp themselves. My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone else shouldever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Letme assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if thatmoment comes to you, you will turn to medical marijuana. Please extendthat liberty to your fellow Californians by voting Yes on Proposition 215.

McNamara October 20, 1996 I SPENT 35 years as a police officer and always believed that the majorityof cops cared about people and saw their jobs as a way to protect citizensfrom harm and help them when they needed assistance. Thus, it saddens meto see some cops in a knee-jerk response oppose letting doctors prescribemedical marijuana for patients in agony from chemotherapy, glaucoma, ora number of other illnesses for which marijuana seems to help. Allowing doctors instead of cops to decide what is appropriate medicineis logical. Under the present law, sick people or their families are forcedto become criminals in order to get a drug that can help them. In somecases patients simply give up and lose the will to live. Recently, I met Steve Kubby. Twenty years ago, doctors told him he hadcancer and could expect to die within four or five months. But Steve Kubbyis a fighter. He went into intensive treatment only to find that it madehim desperately ill and sapped his desire to live. He then began smokingmarijuana and now at age 48 is a successful businessman with a zest forlife. He still has cancer but marijuana helps him cope with the side-effectsof treatment. There are many such people. If marijuana had not been made illegal in 1937, medical research couldhave been done to determine just how useful it can be as medicine. Because I became a policeman when I was 21, I never tried marijuanaand still haven't. But I see no reason to be hypocritical. It does notturn users into demons. Both President Clinton and Newt Gingrich tried marijuana without goingon to harder drugs and lives of crime. Indeed, most of the police officersI hired during my 18 years as police chief admitted in their pre-employmentinterviews that they had tried marijuana. It didn't keep them from becomingfine police officers. I do not advocate using marijuana, but it is not a drug that alwaysleads to violence or other crime. More than 70 million Americans have triedmarijuana and very few became habitual users or career criminals. Nor hasanyone ever died from using marijuana, unlike aspirin, alcohol, nicotineand many other legal drugs. Passage of Proposition 215 will not send a message leading more teenagersto use marijuana. In the Netherlands, marijuana is freely available, andthe per capita teenage use of the drug is less than it is in the UnitedStates. However, passing Proposition 215 will send a message that Californianscare about helping people cope with illnesses and don't want to turn theminto criminals because some police officer disapproves of their medicine. Joseph D. McNamara is the retired police chief of San Jose and a researchfellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

We deplore kids using illegal drugs, and urge them tostay clean. But Proposition 215 is not about playing with drugs. Itis a humane and commonsensical measure that would amend state law to allowsick people and caregivers to grow or possess marijuana only for medicaluse and only when recommended by their doctors. It would also prevent physicians from being punished forrecommending pot for medical purposes, just as they use other medicines,including such powerful and useful drugs as morphine, codeine, Valium,Librium and nitrous oxide, also known as ``laughing gas.'' By any sensible standard, marijuana should be a welcomeaddition to the pharmacopoeia of drugs used by California physicians, whoare trusted with all kinds of narcotics, sedatives and psychoactives thatcan also be dangerous if improperly used. Many doctors and patients say smoking marijuana is helpfulin the treatment of such ailments as AIDS, glaucoma, arthritis, migraineheadaches, multiple sclerosis and spasticity. It also relieves the painof cancer and nausea associated with chemotherapy, alleviates chronic painand helps ward off asthma attacks, according to patients who have usedit. This is not to say that pot is a risk-free substance. Like many medicines,marijuana has side effects, including the danger of lung disease from inhalinghot smoke loaded with impurities and chronic impairment of cognitive skillsin heavy pot users. However, doctors and their patients would certainly becapable of weighing the risks against the benefits and decide for themselvesif pot would be appropriate for the ailment to be treated. It is a sad commentary on our fatuous drug laws that,as a practical matter, the only people unable to obtain marijuana are houseboundpatients without an illegal drug connection and law-abiding citizens whoprefer to bear the pain and ravages of their illnesses rather than violatethe law. During two of the past three years, the state Legislature haspassed bills that would have allowed sick people to use marijuana as medicine.But in a victory of puritanical politics over humane medicine, GovernorWilson vetoed the bills each time. If marijuana eases the symptoms of disease and providessolace to the severely sick -- as so many patients and their doctors insist-- it should be legal to use as medicine. Vote yes on Proposition 215. It is a simple matter ofcompassion and common sense. © The Chronicle Publishing CompanyWT02-B09-171IA064-000379-B029-458http://www-211.webnexus.com:80/sjmerc.html 165.227.96.211 19970112102153 text/html 4275HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:21:55 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.2Content-type: text/html San Jose Mercury News September 18, 1996 Editorials Marijuana as medicine Why should it be different from other pain-relievingdrugs? Vote yes on Proposition 215 Look in the medicine cabinet of a person who suffers fromcancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spasticity or chronic pain: It's filled with dangerousdrugs. Doctors are allowed to prescribe these drugs -- including morphineand cocaine -- despite the risk of abuse. Sick people are allowed to takemind-altering drugs that would be illegal if used by the healthy. Except for marijuana. Californians should vote yes on Proposition 215, whichwould let doctors recommend marijuana without fear of criminal prosecution,and let sick people grow it and possess it, if recommended by a doctor. Many doctors believe marijuana is highly effective inrelieving nausea and stimulating appetite -- important for cancer and AIDSpatients -- and in relieving pressure that blinds glaucoma patients. Marijuanais also used to ease muscle spasms, and to help people manage chronic pain. The ban on medical marijuana is "scientifically,legally and morally wrong," argues Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a Harvardmedical professor. In 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrativelaw judge, Frank Young, recommended that doctors be allowed to prescribemarijuana: "It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious forthe DEA to continue to stand between sufferers and the benefit of thissubstance." Drug warriors persist in claiming that marijuana has nomedical value and they've blocked studies that might prove them wrong. Doctors can prescribe Marinol, a pill containing THC,the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. However, patients can't tailorthe dose to their needs, because the capsule contains a liquid, and can'tbe split. Because it's pure THC, Marinol can make patients so high theycan't function. For those with nausea, it's difficult to swallow a largeMarinol capsule, and keep it down. By contrast, patients can smoke as much or as little marijuanaas they need, getting the medical benefits with minimal psychoactive effects.Those who don't like to smoke can eat marijuana cookies or brownies. The only real argument against letting sick people usemarijuana is that it might sanction the use of marijuana by people whojust want to get high. It's not a persuasive argument. Criminalizing medical marijuana hasn't stopped kids fromgetting marijuana, or using it. Kids also abuse their parents' prescriptionsfor tranquilizers and anti- depressants, and their friends' prescriptionsfor Ritalin, but nobody's talking about making Prozac illegal because itmight be abused. Proposition 215 is on the ballot not because a few leftoverhippies from the '60s want to get high. It's there because thousands ofpeople with AIDS organized to fight for useful drugs. The initiative doesn't legalize marijuana use by healthypeople. It doesn't legalize "engaging in conduct that endangers others."Essentially, it lets law-abiding people seek relief from pain and illnesswithout feeling like criminals. Vote yes on Proposition 215.

However, the war they have declaredis not on drug dealers and criminals, but on terminally ill patients whouse the substance as medicine. Proposition 215 on the November ballot would take themedicinal use of marijuana out of the confusing gray zone that allows thepolitical and criminal exploitation of sick people. The proposition wouldallow seriously and terminally ill patients to use marijuana as a medicaltreatment. Patients with a doctor's approval would be exempt from the state'scriminal marijuana laws. We support Proposition 215 as a human measurethat clearly delineates medicinal and recreational use of the substance. Patients suffering from cancer, glaucoma, arthritis, AIDSand other debilitating illnesses have found relief from their pain whenthey smoke marijuana. Proposition 215 protects patients and doctors who currentlyrisk criminal prosecution for using, cultivating or prescribing the useof marijuana for medicinal purposes. Currently, there is no legal way for patients to get thesubstance. They are forced to break the law to get relief. The medicinal use of marijuana has received bipartisansupport in the state. In 1994 and 1995, both houses of the Legislaturepassed bills allowing patients to use the substance as a medicine. Thebills were vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson. If opponents are concerned the proposition would makerecreational use of marijuana easier, they can stop worrying. Proposition215 is even more narrowly defined than previous bills, focused only onpatients and their use of the substance. In fact, other states have already taken this compassionatestep. In Florida, the state legislature recognized the medicinal valueof marijuana; the state Supreme Court there ruled that patients shouldnot be jailed for its use. Last year, Ohio created a special exemptionfrom marijuana laws for patients using the substance under a doctor's order. Proposition 215 is a compassionate measure that will allowseriously and terminally ill patients to find some relief from their pain-undera doctor's order. It does not promote drug use or weaken the laws prohibitingit. Patients sick enough to need the substance should not have the additionalworry of being arrested or investigated by law enforcement. © 1996 The Oakland Tribune WT02-B09-173IA064-000379-B030-5http://www-211.webnexus.com:80/fairfax.html 165.227.96.211 19970112102210 text/html 1909HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:22:15 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.2Content-type: text/html Fairfax Police Chief Support Medical Marijuana Initiative Marin County Police Chief Supports Medical Marijuana Initiative February 14, 1996, Fairfax, CA: Jim Anderson, a long-time policechief for the town of Fairfax is one of the latest law enforcement officialsto speak out in favor of California's current medical marijuana initiative. "I believe there is adequate unbiased and scientific evidence thatmarijuana does have medicinal benefit. When we consider the associatedconsequences of other prescription drugs it seems illogical to excludemarijuana as another alternative available to physicians for prescription...." "... Even if there are no other benefits than relief of pain orstimulation of appetite, there appears to be a legitimate place for marijuanain the wide array of legally prescribed drugs. The legalization of marijuanafor medicinal purposes seems to strike a reasonable balance between theabuse and illegal use of the drug and its legitimate medicinal value thatcould be available through prescriptive use. "With the increased public attention on my own support of the medicinaluse of marijuana, I find that many other conservative persons share thisbelief. ...Marijuana is not the street degenerate that ravages society."

Provides that patients or defined caregivers, who possess or cultivatemarijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician, are exemptfrom general provisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivationof marijuana. Provides physicians shall not be punished or denied any rightor privilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.Declares that the measure not be construed to supersede prohibitions ofconduct endangering others nor to condone diversion of marijuana for nonmedicalpurposes. Contains severability clause. Summary of estimate by LegislativeAnalyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government:Because this measure restricts the use of marijuana to only those personsfor whom it is prescribed by a licensed physician, it would probably haveno significant state or local fiscal impact. To The Honorable Secretary Of State Of California: We, the undersigned, registered, qualified voters of California, residentsof __________________________County (or City and County), hereby proposean addition to the Health and Safety Code, relating to the compassionateuse of marijuana, and petition the Secretary of State to submit the sameto the voters of California for their adoption or rejection at the nextsucceeding general election or at any special statewide election held priorto that general election or otherwise provided by law. The proposed additionto the Health and Safety code shall read as follows: Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code,to read: 11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the CompassionateUse Act of 1996.

"Doctors should be given the latitude to prescribe this for anymedicinal uses to the patients who would benefit in their judgement,"Bilbray said. "We should not tie the hands of those who we chargewith healing and alleviating pain; if marijuana is the best prescriptionfor the seriously ill, doctors should be allowed to prescribe it." The legislation, H.R. 2618, reclassifies marijuana from a Schedule Ito a Schedule II substance under the Controlled Substance Act to recognizethe fact that there are valid and important medicinal uses of marijuana.Schedule I drugs are those which have "no currently accepted medicaluse in the treatment in the United States," while Schedule II drugshave a "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the UnitedStates." Many doctors have concluded that marijuana is the best treatment forthe alleviation of pain for people with cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spasticdisorders and other debilitating illnesses. The legislation sets up a strict regime for assuring both the availabilityof the legal marijuana for certain enumerated uses, and the existence ofstrong controls to minimize the abuse of the marijuana supply. However,pharmacies and physicians would be registered by the Federal Governmentand certified to distribute the marijuana for narrow permissible uses,and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would be responsiblefor the proper distribution of the marijuana itself. Further, HHS is directedto set a price for the marijuana which will pay for the production anddistribution of the marijuana. Dr. Lester Grinspoon, Harvard Medical School professor, said that "cannabisstands out among medicines as a safe and as an effective treatment fora wide range of symptoms. It appears to be the best drug available to treatthe nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, to controlthe nausea from AIDS or the drugs used to treat it. The list goes on. Marijuanais not a perfect drug in that it won't work for all patients, but it isa major step forward when doctors and patients can exercise the choiceto use marijuana, especially when nothing else in the pharmacopoeia works." Bilbray joins the 14 other co-sponsors of the legislation.

Buckley, Jr., Writes of His Sister's Cancer Chemotherapy and Her Need for Medical Marijuana In his syndicated column distributed on December 16, William F. Buckley,Jr., the conservative author and talk show host, writes about his youngersister's cancer and her need for medical access to marijuana "becauseshe is undergoing an agonizing jolt of chemotherapy." To the question,"How does she know cannabis would help her?" Buckley responds- "Dumb question. A) She knows, or knows of, people who have had relieffrom the wretchedness she suffers from, from a puff or two of marijuana;and B) so what if it did not work? ... What are we afraid of, that whilerecovering from cancer and taking a marijuana cigarette she will becomea crack addict?" One of the persons she knows who has written about his use of cannabisfor chemotherapy is Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor of Buckley's NationalReview magazine. As Buckley notes, Brookhiser found that it takes onlya one or two puffs on a marijuana cigarette to stop immediately-the nauseaof chemotherapy. It usually works, but if it does not, there are no sideeffects. In contrast, the very expensive anti-nausea pharmaceutical Zofrancauses headaches in as many as 40% of those who use it and can cause liverdamage, etc. Yet the narcocracy cites Zofran as the reason that there isno need for medical marijuana. Buckley also writes of his frustration in not knowing where to buy marijuanahimself in New York City ... where it is almost ubiquitous. This reflectsone of the sad ironies of people in his situation: the older a person is,the harder it is to find marijuana. The prohibition that is justified onthe grounds that it protects children actually makes it most difficultfor adults, and especially for the ill, to find marijuana when they needit most. In any other context it might be amusing to think of someone as recognizableas Buckley lurking around Washington Square trying to "score"a few dollars worth of pot. He makes light of this problem, but it reallyis not feasible for someone in his position to do what he otherwise woulddo. One assumes that at least after this column is published - the Buckleyswill eventually get marijuana, but what of the hundreds of thousands ofothers? He laments that "thinking on the subject is so far gone inputrefaction that the simplest questions go unanswered." Actually,most of the putrefaction starts here in Washington. Surveys show that theoverwhelming majority of the American people are in favor of medical accessto marijuana. Newt, please note. Buckley concludes his column by reporting that researchers in San Franciscohave been ready for two years to do a study of the use of marijuana "intreating the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS, but they cannot obtainthe necessary marijuana from the government." Buckley asks, "Ifsomebody discovered that marijuana would *cure* AIDS, would the narcs stillprowl the street for vendors?" Yes. Absolutely. NORML's experience suggests that the narcs would redoubletheir efforts. They know that the survival of the narcocracy depends onthe suppression of medical marijuana. This is no petty crime that the narcsare covering up ... as anyone who has endured chemotherapy, or AIDS, orso much other suffering, would tell us, if they did not have to live andoften die in fear.

Newt Gingrich (R-Ga, nowSpeaker of the House) in support of medical access to marijuana originallyappeared in the March 19, 1982 issue of the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association (JAMA). To the Editor, The American Medical Association's Council on ScientificAffairs should be commended for its report, "Marijuana: Its HealthHazards and Therapeutic Potential" (1981;246:1823). Not only doesthe report outline evidence of marijuana's potential harms, but it distinguishesthis concern from the legitimate issue of marijuana's important medicalbenefits. All too often the hysteria that attends public debate over marijuana'ssocial abuse compromises a clear appreciation for this critical distinction. Since 1978, 32 states have abandoned the federal prohibitionto recognize legislatively marijuana's important medical properties. Federallaw, however, continues to define marijuana as a drug "with no acceptedmedical use," and federal agencies continue to prohibit physician-patientaccess to marijuana. This outdated federal prohibition is corrupting theintent of the state laws and depriving thousands of glaucoma and cancerpatients of the medical care promised them by their state legislatures. On September 16, 1981, Representatives Stewart McKinneyand I introduced legislation designed to end bureaucratic interferencein the use of marijuana as a medicant. We believe licensed physicians are competent to enploymarijuana, and patients have a right to obtain marijuana legally, undermedical supervision, from a regulated source. The medical prohibition doesnot prevent seriously ill patients from employing marijuana; it simplydeprives them of medical supervision and denies them access to a regulatedmedical substance. Physicians are often forced to choose between theirethical responsibilities to the patient and their legal liabilities tofederal bureaucrats. Representative McKinney and I hope the Council willtake a close and careful look at this issue. Federal policies do not reflecta factual or balanced assessment of marijuana's use as a medicant. TheCouncil, by thoroughly investigating the available materials, might welldiscover that its own assessment of marijuana's therapeutic value has,in the past, been more than slightly shaded by federal policies that areless than neutral.

For those people who at this time do not agreewith that statement, maybe it would help for them to ask themselves thefollowing question: "If you had a loved one who was nauseous fromdosages of chemotherapy, or who had a loss of appetite form AIDS, or whosuffered from glaucoma, would you rather that his or her medication wasprescribed by a medical doctor or by a policeman?"

The bill, H. 2170, was carefullytailored by the legislature to address Governor Weld's objections to asimilar bill passed in late 1995, which Weld had refused to sign into law. Massachusetts activists diligently lobbied for a bill that would allowpatients arrested on marijuana charges to use the affirmative defense of"medical necessity" in court. Several state supreme courts haverecognized this defense, accepting that it is permitted under common law.Others, including Massachusetts, refuse to allow this defense. In 1991,the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the societal harm ofallowing the necessity defense would be greater than the harm done to apatient denied the opportunity to offer the defense. The 1995 bill would have rectified the matter by establishing the defensethrough legislation. However, the governor sent the bill back to the legislature,arguing that it was too broad and likely to be abused. The new law, therefore, is much more limited. It expands upon a lawsigned by Governor Weld in 1991 which provided for the creation of a medicinalmarijuana therapeutic research program. Such programs operated in severalstates in the late 1970s and early 1980s, providing marijuana to patientswho met certain medical criteria. Though officially "research"programs, data were seldom analyzed and published: The programs servedmainly as a compassionate way for a few state governments to circumventthe federal government's prohibition of medicinal marijuana. The new Massachusetts law would allow patients to use the necessitydefense, but only if they are "certified to participate" in thetherapeutic research program and possessed the marijuana "for personaluse pursuant to such program." This hardly establishes a meaningful necessity defense: First, it isunimaginable that a patient receiving marijuana as part of this programwould ever be arrested -- much less prosecuted and convicted -- for marijuanapossession, even without a codified medical necessity defense. Second,the state public health department failed to launch a program during thefive years since the research program law took effect! Presently, thereis no such program running in Massachusetts. Nevertheless, in addition to the message it sends that marijuana isa useful medicine for some people, the new law will be beneficial for tworeasons: It raises the possibility that the courts may accept a defense of medicalnecessity for a broader pool of patients -- for example, patients who meetthe criteria for the program but are not yet enrolled because the programhas not started running or because they did not know about it. It contains a provision mandating that, within 180 days, the state'spublic health department should establish the rules and regulations necessaryto get the program running. Within a year, hundreds of people sufferingfrom cancer, glaucoma, or asthma (but not AIDS or other unspecified ailments)may be legally using marijuana in Massachusetts. The department must also explore the various ways of obtaining a supplyof marijuana to provide the patients. There are four potential legal sources of marijuana for a state to usefor research purposes: importing it (from the Netherlands), receiving itfrom the National Institute on Drug Abuse, getting permission from thefederal government to grow its own, or using confiscated marijuana. Each of these options carries its own difficulties. During the nextfew months, the Marijuana Project Project will be advising Massachusettsofficials on how best to obtain a legal source of marijuana so that itsresearch program can start providing marijuana to patients in need.

Pete Wilson made a mistake when he vetoeda bill that would have allowed doctors to prescribe marijuana for patientssuffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and a few other diseases. This yearthe Assembly erred in failing to pass the same measure. Fortunately, voters will have a say on the matter becausean initiative is likely to be on the November ballot. The initiative does not legalize marijuana. It simplyallows medical doctors to use it to relieve suffering. Increasingly, physiciansare speaking out in favor of marijuana for numerous conditions. The drughelps AIDS patients avoid weight loss and eases vomiting and pain associatedwith chemotherapy. The California Medical Association has expressed supportfor the use of marijuana if controlled studies prove it works. However,such studies can take place only if the law allows them. Opponents of medical use of marijuana say it puts outa message that the drug is harmless. That's nonsense, not worthy of considerationby anyone interested in helping sick people. That's like concluding morphineis considered harmless because it is prescribed by physicians. But the arguments sounded good enough to Assemblyman RichardRainey, who changed his vote from yes to no on the marijuana bill. Let'shope the voters have more sense and allow doctors to use the drug whereand when it can do some good. © 1996 Contra Costa TimesWT02-B09-191IA064-000379-B031-179http://www-211.webnexus.com:80/sfchron1.html 165.227.96.211 19970112102712 text/html 2501HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:27:13 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.2Content-type: text/html EDITORIAL --  Busting the Cannabis Club Tuesday, August 6, 1996 � Page A18 © 1996 San Francisco Chronicle EDITORIAL -- Busting the Cannabis Club FOR THE PAST five years, the Cannabis Buyers' Club inSan Francisco has openly sold marijuana to people with serious illnessesand local law enforcement officials have averted their gaze, humanely allowingit to operate without harassment. In fact, this enlightened community has all but decriminalizedthe use of marijuana for medical purposes and does not want or need theheavy hand of state Attorney General Dan Lungren to enforce his puritanicalanti-drug notions that defy common sense. Nonetheless, Lungren on Sunday dispatched state drug enforcementagents for a high-profile bust of the Market Street pot emporium. The attorneygeneral's critics accuse him of making political hay by demonstrating histough anti-drug stance at the expense of some 11,000 club members. The issue is not about recreational drug use. The potclub was a place where sick people, without an illegal drug connection,were able to purchase the weed that they say provides relief from the agoniesof cancer, AIDS and many other diseases.

Medical Science Thursday, September 14, 1995 � Page A22 © 1996 San FranciscoChronicle EDITORIAL -- Puritanical Prejudice Vs. Medical Science FOR THE THIRD YEAR in a row, the state Legislature haspassed a humane bill that would allow seriously ill patients to use marijuanafor medicinal purposes. Unfortunately, Governor Wilson is expected to vetoit, also for the third time. By any reasonable standard, marijuana should be a welcomeaddition to the pharmacopoeia of drugs for treatment of such dreadful diseasesas glaucoma, cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis. After all, physiciansare allowed to prescribe morphine and scores of other narcotics to reducepain; they, too, can be abused if used improperly. The measure, authored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos,D-San Jose, provides a criminal defense for individuals who grow or possessmarijuana for medical purposes when approved in writing by a licensed physician. The response from Wilson's office was prompt. ``This billwill be vetoed by the governor,'' said spokesman Jesus Arredondo. ``TheClinton administration said in August marijuana should not be legalizedfor any purpose.'' Is this the sorry common ground, where Republican Wilsonand Democrat Clinton can agree to promote their anti-drug policies at theexpense of the painfully sick? Here is a clear example of puritanism and politics takingprecedence over sound medical practice and common sense. If medically prescribedpot provides comfort to terminal patients or relieves the agony of peoplein extreme pain -- and many users suffering from disease say it does --who can fairly deny them their solace? ``In a free society, people who are ill shouldn't be madecriminals to alleviate their pain. Wilson is engaging in the politics ofpain,'' said an angry Vasconcellos. Sadly, perhaps the only people whocan not obtain marijuana are housebound patients without an illegal drugconnection and good citizens who would rather bear the pain, discomfortand nausea of their illnesses rather than violate the law. Many physicians advise their patients to smoke marijuana,anyway. Dr. Lester Grinspoon, of Harvard Medical School, believesthat marijuana will someday be hailed as a safe, inexpensive and versatilemiracle drug. In his writings, Grinspoon reports that smoking marijuanacan relieve nausea associated with chemotherapy, prevent blindness inducedby glaucoma, serve as an appetite stimulant for wasting AIDS patients,act as an anti-epileptic, ward off asthma attacks and migraine headaches,alleviate chronic pain and reduce the muscle spasms that accompany somediseases. Until sanity and humanity prevail in Sacramento and Washington,law-abiding patients will be denied this drug that might relieve theirsuffering.

Others were awareof the helpful effects of pot and wanted to try it but could not bringthemselves to defy laws against marijuana use and possession. When boththe state Senate and Assembly approved the medicinal marijuana measureby Senator Milton Marks, D-S.F., both groups expressed gratitude. But their victory was short-lived. Despite its legislativeapproval after substantive hearings, Governor Wilson vetoed the bill. Let us hope that in this non-election year, compassionand good sense rule and that an identical measure, by Assemblyman JohnVasconcellos, D-San Jose, passes and, this time, is signed by Wilson. The Assembly did the right thing last week by approvingthe measure. Now it is up to the Senate and the governor to provide theopportunity for relief from suffering for many patients for whom marijuanacontrols nausea caused by anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs, lowers eye pressurecaused by glaucoma and reduces muscle spasms and pain related to multiplesclerosis. The measure is narrowly drawn and would not change lawsagainst marijuana possession and use for the general public. It simplywould allow suffering patients -- with doctor approval -- to possess orcultivate marijuana for personal use. Several medical studies have shown marijuana does easepain and nausea for many patients. Recognizing this, a number of communitieshave chosen to look the other way when known cancer -- and other -- patientsgrow pot. But neither the patients nor law enforcement should be forcedto disobey the law to provide medical relief. The patients' hopes were raised, then dashed, last year.A repeat of that cruel outcome is not acceptable. © The Chronicle Publishing Company WT02-B09-194IA064-000379-B032-7http://www-211.webnexus.com:80/infirm.html 165.227.96.211 19970112102900 text/html 5797HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:27:56 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.2Content-type: text/html Untitled Medical Marijuana: Aid to Infirm or Vague Loophole in Narcotics Laws? By MARK EVANS Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jim Scott's morning routine rarelyvaries. First, a cup of coffee. Next, a dose of lithium, to treat his manicdepression. Then a tightly rolled cigarette, packed with the cheapestmarijuana he can find. The 50-year-old San Franciscan repeats the ritual at noon,at dinner-time, and late at night, smoking three more joints, each preciselymeasured at 1 gram. He falls asleep stoned. ``This controls my anger,'' Scott says, gesturing withan unlit joint clasped in his left hand. ``It helps me keep my balance.'' The only variable in Scott's daily routine is the availabilityof his pot, which he's forced to find illegally, through friends or onthe streets. That's why he is actively campaigning for Proposition 215,a ballot measure which would permit people to grow and use the drug forcertain medical purposes. To its supporters, Proposition 215 is a long-overdue measurethat would help seriously ill people cope with pain and disease. But toopponents, it is a cleverly shrouded hoax that uses ailing people as pawnsin a broader battle to legalize a dangerous drug. ``The pro-marijuana lobby has made no bones about thefact they want to legalize marijuana. The way to do that, they have decided,is through medical marijuana,'' said Tom Gorman, spokesman for the CaliforniaNarcotics Officers Association. ``It's unfortunate they're using sick peopleto get what they want. It's exactly what they (the infirm) don't need.'' Gorman says the proposition provides no controls on qualityor dosage of marijuana. And, he notes, a synthetic form of marijuana knownas Marinol already is available by prescription. Moreover, Gorman says, under Proposition 215 a doctor's``prescription'' for marijuana could amount to no more than an informalverbal statement, making it difficult to track who legally is entitledto the drug. ``If I were a (marijuana) grower, I would get a doctor'spermission somehow. I'd say I have a headache or a backache. Or pick adoctor who was deceased. If I got busted, I could say I had permission,''Gorman says. Drug dealers are smart, he says, and will find ways toexploit every loophole in the initiative. Enforcing existing laws againstmarijuana would amount to ``an absolute mess,'' if the measure passes,he says. Despite Gorman's skepticism and a medical community thatremains divided on the issue, there are many who swear the drug helps them:Cancer patients say it has helped them fight the nausea that follows chemotherapytreatment. AIDS patients recount how it helps their appetite, allowingthem to stave off the ``wasting'' effects of the disease. Glaucoma patientssay it helps reduce pressure in the eyes. And then there are people like Scott, who claim four jointsa day help him wrestle with insanity. ``I know what I'm like without it,'' says Scott, whosemood swings have landed him in jail or mental hospitals dozens of times.``I'm down on Market Street, yelling uncontrollably, yelling very loudlyat the shopkeepers.'' The debate over medicinal marijuana is nothing new inCalifornia. State lawmakers approved similarly worded measures in 1994and 1995, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed both. ``This is probably our toughest fight,'' said Orange CountySheriff Brad Gates, a longtime opponent of efforts to legalize the drug.``It's on the ballot, and we have to deal with it. But I don't think itwill pass.'' Recent polls, however, show strong voter support. A LosAngeles Times survey last month showed voters favoring the initiative,53 percent to 31 percent. A Field Poll gave it a 2-to-1 margin of victory-althoughit found only half the voters were aware the measure was on the ballot. Opponents say the apparent support may simply come frompeople who don't completely understand the initiative. ``It's a scam,'' says Sharon Rose of Californians ForDrug-Free Youth. ``I read the initiative to people and they flip (theiropinion). The way it's written, it's deceptive.'' But Jeffrey Reed, a 40-year-old registered nurse, saysthe only deception is in anti-drug rhetoric which lumps marijuana togetherwith much more dangerous narcotics. ``We're talking about a herb that's been used to healsince time immemorial,'' Reed says. Reed, diagnosed with AIDS in 1988, says he discoveredthe drug's curative powers a couple years ago and has been spreading theword ever since. ``I think we're at a turning point,'' he says. ``Finally,we're getting to decide whether the attorney general and a bunch of policecan decide what's medicine-or whether to leave that decision to our doctors.''WT02-B09-195IA064-000379-B032-50http://www-211.webnexus.com:80/quad.html 165.227.96.211 19970112102911 text/html 5385HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:29:16 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.2Content-type: text/html SAVEgateway Document Delivery PATIENT'S FRIENDS PROTEST POT RAID SUPPORTERS: MARIJUANA COMFORTS QUADRIPLEGIC Published: Wednesday, August 7, 1996 Section: Local Page: 1B LEE QUARNSTROM column Friends of a Santa Cruz quadriplegic who says he uses marijuana to calmdebilitating muscle spasms protested a recent raid on his apartment duringTuesday's meeting of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors. ''You've got to protect him from the people you've given money to,''one speaker told supervisors, pointing to their financial support of marijuanaeradication operations of the sheriff's department. The speaker, who called herself ''No Guns,'' told board members thatquadriplegic Scott Hager ''was knocked off his wheelchair'' by a narcoticsagent who proceed ed ''to make fun of him'' during a raid at Hager's apartmentJuly 30. Not arrested Hager, 35, wheelchair-bound since breaking his neck in a diving accidentin 1982, was unable to attend the supervisors' meeting because, said hisfriends, of injuries he received during the raid. Hager, who has been active in the Santa Cruz medical marijuana movement,was not arrested after sheriff's deputies raided his apartment. A sheriff'sspokesman said the matter had been referred to the district attorney'soffice. But, said sheriff's Sgt. Rich Ross, 163 marijuana plants and what thedeputy described as ''a sophisticated growing system'' were confiscated. Medical remedy claims Hager, who contended almost 100 of the plants were marijuana seedsthat had only sprouted the morning of the raid, also said he grew the plantsfor his own use. He said he uses the illegal weed not only to stop hisconvulsive muscle spasms but also to stimulate his appetite and as a sleepingaid. He said he gives plants he doesn't use to the Santa Cruz CannabisBuyers Club or to other organizations that provide marijuana to patientsfor medicinal purposes. Major uses of marijuana for medical purposes include fighting the nauseaexperienced during chemotherapy and helping stop weight loss caused bycancer and AIDS. Hager said he was considering legal action against the sheriff's officerwhom he accused of knocking him ''out of my wheelchair, so that I endedup flat on my face and being mocked as I lay there.'' He said he doubted whether there was any connection between his caseand the recent raid on a medical marijuana supply operation in San Francisco. About 50 supporters of the use of marijuana for medicinal purposesattended Tuesday's board of supervisors meeting. Aside from protesting Hager's treatment, they urged supervisors tosupport Proposition 215, the medical marijuana initiative on the Novemberballot. A local initiative urging support for the use of the drug for medicinalpurposes was approved by 77 percent of Santa Cruz County voters a few yearsago. One speaker Tuesday, a 74-year-old woman who said she uses marijuanato calm her irritable bowel syndrome, told supervisors she was arrestedabout two weeks ago and charged with a felony for growing two marijuanaplants for her use. ''This is insane,'' she told the board. Medical marijuana activist Valerie Corral told the board that lastmonth five residents who use the drug as medicine were arrested by sheriff'sofficers. She called the arrests inexcusable, particularly in the faceof past comments by Sheriff Mark Tracy that such cases would have a lowpriority in his department. Activist Scott Imler said members of the local Cannabis Buyers Clubare assuming they will be arrested soon. ''Please inform the sheriff,''Imler said, ''that we are peaceful people. They need not come with guns;they need not come with clubs.'' Sheriff's Sgt. Ross said that while his department had received noformal complaints about Hager's treatment, an investigation was under way.He said another law enforcement agency, which he declined to identify,was conducting the probe. Ross said the July 30 raid was conducted by the Santa Cruz County NarcoticsEnforcement Team, which was at Hager's apartment complex to arrest anotherman. When agents mistakenly knocked on Hager's door, Ross said, they smelledmarijuana and saw some of the indoor-growing apparatus in the apartment. Sheriff's agents were then called, Ross said, and they conducted thesearch and the seizure of the 163 plants and the growing system. He said Hager was neither arrested nor cited.

Tel.: 212-269-4900; Fax: 212-344-4294; e-mail: postmaster@fmew.com Transactions Transactions usually entail one or both of the role of adviser and representative. Often, the Firm iscalled upon to give advice to structure, facilitate or evaluate a proposed transaction or one underwayor about to be consummated. Similarly, the Firm can be called upon to represent the client, such as bybeing its negotiator or emissary, in bringing a transaction about. Transactions demand an understanding of the business objectives sought to be attained, a realisticassessment of the legal issues and concomitant risks including the risks of future disputes, and afocused effort to attain those objectives while keeping the legal risks at an acceptable level. That ishow the Firm approaches transactions. Interposing objections that have no realistic application to thefacts, as well as "papering over" issues to make a deal happen when it should not or when thebusinessmen have not actually judged the risks worth taking, are things the Firm avoids.

Disputes Disputes -- with business associates, competitors and governmental representatives -- are part ofongoing commercial relationships. Responding to disputes starts with assessing, from a strategicperspective, the nature of the dispute and how to approach it. Some disputes represent honest disagreements over matters to which the parties gave little heedwhen embarking upon the transaction, or which arose as a result of significant economic or regulatorychange. Dealing with such disputes includes assessing the facts about which the parties disagree andtrying to develop alternative, convergent objectives which the client and the other party to the disputewill share. Other disputes comprise something quite different. The cause of the dispute may be onlyindirectly related to the issue seemingly in dispute -- a business war being fought on a battlefield ofopportunity. The battlefield of opportunity must, of course, be dealt with, but it alone may not end thedisagreement. Judgment in analyzing and addressing these kinds of disputes is the key to handlingthem. These kinds of disputes can by their nature invoke the Firm's role as an aggressive champion ofthe client. To find out more about the Firm's services in disputes, click here. Return to our home page . Prevention Preventive law, that is, anticipating areas of concern and minimizing in advance the risks they present,quintessentially calls into play the Firm's role as adviser. Preventive advice can be independent of any transaction or an adjunct to a transaction or representation in a dispute. In dealing with a dispute, the Firm also focuses on the prevention of future claims and disputes of similar type.

It has often been said that we can surf the countryand the world in a matter of seconds on theInternet. In a certain sense, this is no doubt true. Indeed,the Internet is changing not only theway we spend our leisure time -- but also the way we do businessas well. Of course, traditionalbusiness limitations still exist in some form; but these are moreand more easily overcome as thesophistication of computer hardware and software allows for theexchange of more and more ofwhat we do and what we buy through the Internet. The technology unfortunately -- or perhaps fortunately -- mayhave left traditional notions ofequity and justice behind. Hand in hand with these technologicalchanges will come changes inthe laws which govern us and the way that courts apply them. One of the most basic questions of any court system is andalways has been which court has the right to decide a disputebetween two people. With the advances in technology and theuse of cyberspace the question now sometimes comes down to "Whentwo people who use the Internet have a dispute relating to theiruse of the Internet, and the only connection between them hasbeen the Internet, what court decides the dispute?" The two ofthem can be hundreds or thousands of miles or even continentsapart and the court nearest one of them may be very far away fromand inconvenient for the other. If you do business over the Internet, do you think thatsomeone who disputes your rights cansue you where his or her (not your) Internet connection islocated? If you run a one-person storein Hawaii or Australia, do you expect to be sued in Ohio bysomeone in Ohio who encounteredyou over the Internet? Probably you have never thought aboutthis, and probably your initialanswer will be no, but if so you may be in for a surprise. At the end of July, 1996, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit determinedthat CompuServe could sue in Ohio an individual from Texas whoconducted what seems to havebeen a small, part-time business only through the Internet andinteracted with CompuServe viamodem. CompuServe has it corporate headquarters in Ohio. InCompuServe v.Patterson, 89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996), the Court dealt withthe question of whether or notCompuServe could sue one of its subscribers in Ohio -- eventhough the subscriber was anindividual (not a large business) from Texas and had neverphysically been to Ohio -- but hadvisited (so to speak) CompuServe in Ohio by using the Internet. The Court had to answer the question, did Ohio's courts havejurisdiction over the out-of-state subscriber? How do courts in the U.S. obtain "jurisdiction" over partieswho have a dispute, that is, which court has theright to decide a particular dispute between those particularparties? Most disputes occurbetween people located near one another in the same state or whoat least interacted with oneanother face-to-face generally in a particular locale, so that itseems fair to say the court in thatlocale should decide their dispute. But localized interactionbetween people is not the norm ofthe Internet. In the U.S., the Due Process Clause of theFourteenth Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution usually determines when and where anindividual may be subject to a civillawsuit in another state. The basic rule, announced by the U.S.Supreme Court in 1945 inInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310,requires examination of the facts ofthe case, to determine if the nonresident defendant hassufficient contacts with the state in whichthe suit was filed such that the exercise of jurisdiction by acourt in that state would comport with"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." Courts have gone to great lengths todetermine whether a person's activities in a state were enough sothat it would not offend thesetraditional notions to allow an aggrieved party tohaul that person into the courtsof a state where he is not a resident. The determination wasmade based upon (i) whether theperson purposefully availed himself of the privilege of acting inthe foreign state, (ii) whether thesubject of the suit arose from the person's actions in thatforeign state, and (iii) whether theperson's acts (or the consequences thereof) in the state aresufficient to make it "reasonable" tobring that person into the foreign court. But, how then do "traditional notions" apply to something likethe Internet? Let us return to the decision in CompuServe v.Patterson. CompuServe brought suit in its home state of Ohioagainst an individualwho lived and worked in Texas and developed shareware apparentlyas a side business. TheTexas software developer sold and marketed his shareware over theInternet via CompuServe'sshareware service. He used the CompuServe service by modem fromhis home computer inTexas and he subscribed to CompuServe via that modem connection. The Texas sharewaredeveloper also sent several messages to CompuServe throughe-mail, claiming that CompuServesoftware products infringed upon his rights. The e-mail messagesoriginated from the sharewaredeveloper's desk in Texas and ended up at CompuServe's Ohioheadquarters. Because the Texasdeveloper used the CompuServe shareware service, Internet surferswho downloaded hissoftware got it off a CompuServe server in Ohio. CompuServe, in what might be viewed as a preemptive strike,sued in Ohio for a declarationby the Ohio court that CompuServe did not violate the Texasdeveloper's rights. Obviously, forthe Texas shareware developer to assert those rights (or whateverrights he may have), he musteither prove his case in Ohio or convince the Ohio court that itlacks jurisdiction to decide theissue. Now that the Court has determined that suit in Ohio isproper, the Texas shareware developer must now find an Ohiolawyer andprobably also travel to Ohio in order to protect the rights heclaims to his software. Incidentally, the Texas shareware developer told the Ohiotrial court that he had never been to Ohio andthat the only connection he had at all to Ohio was the fact thatCompuServe happened to be there. Yet, the Court of Appeals found that his electronic visits toOhio subjected him to thejurisdiction of the Ohio courts. In announcing its decision, theCourt of Appeals stressed that theTexas shareware developer "consciously reached out from Texas toOhio to subscribe toCompuServe, and to use its service to market his computersoftware on the Internet." Further, itfound that he "originated and maintained contacts with Ohio" whenhe e-mailed CompuServe atits Ohio headquarters concerning his claims. Finally, the Courtadmitted that "it may beburdensome for [the Texas shareware developer] to defend a suitin Ohio, but he knew when heentered into [the agreement] with CompuServe that he was making aconnection with Ohio . . .." Obviously, the practical effects of the CompuServedecision still must playthemselves out. Courts no doubt will continue to grapple withsimilar jurisdictional questions asour cyber-"visits" from state to state and country to countrycontinue to grow exponentially. TheCompuServe decision tells those who use the Internet forbusiness (or foranything that could give rise to a legal claim) that they hadbetter very carefully consider thetransactions entered into over the Internet, because while theother side of the world may be onlya mouse-click away, defending an action in a foreign court is anentirely different matter.

By Ford Marrin Esposito Witmeyer & Gleser, L.L.P. New York, New York We start with the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996, acontroversial piece of legislation signed into law by President Clintonon February 8, 1996, and now under legal challenge by the AmericanCivil Liberties Union and others. The Communications Decency Act bansthe communication of "obscene or indecent" material via the Internet toanyone under 18 years of age. (Telecommunications Act of 1996,Section 502, 47 U.S.C. Section 223[a].) We all know that this new law resulted from a complex meshing ofpolitical forces in an election year during which family values willcontinue widely to be extolled. But, is this part of the new federallaw legal? All of us have heard of the First Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution. It states in pertinent part that "Congress shallmake no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . ." If thosewords are to be read literally, then the knee-jerk answer would be thatthis new law is illegal. But, the First Amendment, while historicallyread fairly broadly, has never been interpreted literally. Even ThomasJefferson, when he served as President, tried to prosecute conduct thathe viewed as seditious speech. The U.S. Supreme Court alsoconsistently has ruled that pornography and obscenity fall outside theFirst Amendment, along with a variety of other seeming "speech." At the same time, adult conduct which includes sexually orientedconduct that some (perhaps even arguably a majority) might considerimmoral has been considered protected by the First Amendment when ittakes place in a private setting. Perhaps the outmost reach of thattheory of constitutional "privacy" manifested itself in "Roe v. Wade"and the right to an abortion (itself now a controversial proposition).Surely, though, it can be said, Internet surfers who find "indecent"material (whatever that is) as a result of their inquiries from home(or the office) fall well within the outer reach that Roe demarcated?Or is that true? Then, we come to the question of "children," the stated objective ofthe new Congressional ban. Anyone who watches the news or readsnewspapers knows that the courts frequently hold that government canlegitimately try to protect the well-being of children. At the sametime, how parents rear their children has generally been left to theparents, although perhaps because of publicized parental lapses moregovernmental activism seems to exist in that arena too. But it seemsfair to say that few parents, irrespective of their political orreligious views, would agree that the federal government shouldintercede in how they raise their own children. In general, parentshave access to a wider variety of Internet access controls thancontrols over cable television or the movies. Additionally, mostchildren who live in environments in which their parent slack access toInternet protection likely also lack the resources to acquire computertechnology and Internet access. Is Congress intruding into theparental sphere in banning "indecent" Internet communications? Proceeding further, the courts have generally given the federalgovernment wide latitude to control what can be said or shown over thecommercial television "airways." We have all probably heard of theFCC's ban of "indecent" speech and the "seven dirty words" of GeorgeCarlin or the antics of Howard Stern. But, the commercial televisionairwaves flow almost inexorably into everyone's home, with little moreeffort than the flick of a dial. The Internet is something that mostof us must buy access to and which we then choose to surf on our own.And does the government really have the right to tell parents whatbooks and magazines they can let their children read at home or whattelevision programs or motion pictures they should let their childrenwatch? If the answer is, "yes," then how much stretching does it take toextend government control so as to encompass notions of social orphilosophical or religious tutelage? A complex legal and societal problem indeed! To recap, if the Internetis akin to commercial network television and if the government canconstitutionally restrict the menu of offerings there, then why not theInternet? But, the Internet is different, in lots of ways. And, whatdoes "indecent" mean anyway? "Pornography" and "obscenity" aredifficult enough concepts in their own right. Justice Potter Stewart ofthe United States Supreme Court wrote in 1964: "perhaps I could neversucceed in intelligibly" explaining what it is. "But I know it when Isee it". "Indecent," whatever that means (Congress itself did not define theterm) must surely be something less offensive than "obscenity." Isitjust, fair or even wise to penalize someone from making availableinformation which some would label "indecent" but which few of us caneven define? These are among the issues that the courts must decide in ruling on thelegality of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Only time willtell the outcome. At least, though, the courts are not quite asimmediately influenced by current political trends as legislators andtheir final decisions may be less emotionally passionate and moredeliberative.

If It's Not In Writing, It Doesn'tExist . . . . Or Does It??? By Edward M.Pinter and John J.Witmeyer III Ford Marrin Esposito Witmeyer & Gleser,L.L.P. In today's world of ever increasingtechnology, much of what had been the written word is now theCyberspace word. Much of what had been printed and transmittedby mail, or overnight delivery or facsimile, is now sent bye-mail or on-line group session. In short, messages that wouldhave required a few days or a few hours to prepare and deliverfive years ago, can now be transmitted electronically withinseconds. All well and good, but what does this have to do withthe law, you might ask? Perhaps the most important step in determining someone'srights or defenses in an actual or potential lawsuit isdetermining what the evidence will show if a case is brought totrial. One of the most compelling forms of evidence is thewritten word. Judges and juries can hold documents and read themfor themselves. When they look at contemporaneously prepareddocuments, they often conclude they do not necessarily need todecide whether the testimony (like from a live witness in Court)is truthful. Many times the fact that something appears in adocument, usually generated years prior to the trial, is enough. Interesting observation, you say, but what does this have to dowith technology or e-mail? When writers needed to put pen to paper (literally) or atleast had to type text (or have someone type it for them) andthen sign the document so that it could be physically delivered,they usually took a fair amount of care to make certain that theymeant what they wrote and were willing to abide by what theywrote. The very process of creating the document tended to makethe writer think about it, sometimes edit it, and in generalappreciate that the document might come back to "haunt" him if hedid not really mean what he wrote. Now, the fact is that many companies use electronic mail as ameans of allowing employees to communicate with each other, bothin the same office and around the country. In addition, many ofus have personal computers, laptops and notebooks that we use tocommunicate with the office while at home. Add to that thenumber of people who use e-mail on a more personal level over theInternet, and the number of people who participate in on-linetalk sessions (whether at work or through postings to Usenet or other newsgroups or in "chatrooms), and it soon becomes apparent that the Cyber "document"touches nearly everyone. Indeed, it is an extremely efficientmeans of communication. The problem with e-mail and on-line sessions is that manypeople believe or assume that those methods of communicationafford anonymity or at least represent an ephemeral exchangesimilar to the spoken word. (Anyone who has ever participated inan "I said versus you said" argument realizes that the merelyspoken word addressed to but one witness can be very difficult toreconstruct much less pin down.) This view about Cyberdocuments, that they are much likequarks -- fleeting at best -- comes partly from the "chat-group"and "screen name" culture born from the Internet and the newsgroups of the Usenet. Inmost cases this view is not well founded. In addition, manypeople believe or assume that an e-mail message exists only untilit is read and then erased by the recipient; then, they think,it's gone. For some reason, as a result of these factors, peopletransmit messages via e-mail, post messages to newsgroups or make remarks on-line that theywould never commit to writing (recall some of the e-mail messagesyou have seen or heard about). This is a huge mistake. Most e-mail systems do not afford anonymity. The same istrue of on-line sessions. And most office network systems thatlink office computers use some form of data backup, be it tape oroptical disk. The backup programs are designed to periodicallyback up all data on a system, until all of the backed-up data istransformed onto long term storage media. As a practical matterthis means that a large percentage of e-mail messages, whether ornot erased by the recipient after being read, are backed up andthen stored with all of the other computer data on disks andtapes. Even in the Usenet world, efforts are underway to devisemeans for archival study of years of prior sessions (one such approachbeing the Deja News search engine). Additionally, it is usually very easy to capture a screen orprint an e-mail. Someone who participated in the communicationprocess can generally do that legally. Indeed, while there aresome variations in different states, most of the "privacy"protection that the law affords deals only with "eavesdropping"type activity. And in a lawsuit, when the information becomesrelevant, the courts will often demand production of the materialeven if an eavesdropper gathered it or the party who sent itthought the information was "private" or "off the record." (Ofcourse, truly privileged material, such as privilegedcommunications with a lawyer or a clergyman, usually have adifferent legal analysis that applies to them) Good lawyers know this all too well. As a result, requestsfor copies of all stored or printed e-mail messages arefrequently made in divorce cases, business disputes,sex-harassment cases, product liability cases, and almost anyother type of case where what a person says is at issue. TheAmerican legal system has as one of its most fundamental tenetsthe search for truth. Judges therefore with increasing frequencyorder that these back-up and printed copy records be produced insuch litigations. Even the President of the United Statesconfronts this problem. The Reagan White House had, by Courtorder, to preserve e-mail backup files as part of the Iran-Contra investigation. President Clinton had to producecomputer back up in connection with the Whitewaterinvestigation. A good rule of thumb, and one that we advise our clients, isthis: If you would not put your message in a written letter onyour personal (or company) stationery, then you should nottransmit it via e-mail, or in most instances in any other form,especially in the workplace. It really comes down to theapplication of common sense . . . and the realization that, justbecause you didn't send it in a hard copy writing, that doesn't mean that it doesn'texist!

TECHNOLOGY Brings New Meaning to the Words "Sports Page" . . . and Brings Important, Unresolved Legal Issues Along With It! By David R. Crittenden, Edward M. Pinter and, John J. Witmeyer III Ford Marrin Esposito Witmeyer & Gleser, L.L.P. Near the beginning of this century, the fastest way to find out how your favorite sports team fared inthe big game--besides attending in person--was to catch the news report on the radio or in the nextmorning's newspaper. Now, as the twenty-first century approaches, such constraints simply no longerexist. Recent technology has provided avid sports fans with results, statistics, and other informationfrom almost any major sporting event--almost instantly! For example, nowadays, such television stations as CNN's Headline News provide continuous scoreupdates on a scrolling "screen crawler." Packages on such television systems as DirectTV allow fansto enjoy virtually any major sporting event through satellite technology. Additionally, numerousInternet websites provide instantaneous sports score and injury information with a quick click of amouse-button. Responding to the obvious demand from thousands of enthusiastic fans for immediate sportsinformation, STATS, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. have developed and marketed the latest technologicalgizmo--but not without prompting a great deal of legal controversy. Additionally, they put a jazzed-upversion on an Internet site, offering it as a service available from America Online. "SportsTrax" is a wireless paging device that provides up-to-the-minute information about varioussporting events in progress. STATS, Inc. has hired people from all around the country to watchtelevision broadcasts of particular games and enter the statistics and results on a computer as the gameis played. This data is then transmitted to a satellite that beams the information to anyone possessing aSportsTrax pager. With the touch of a button, the pager's liquid crystal display reveals suchinformation as a baseball game's score, the inning, who is on base, who is at bat; a basketball game'sscore, time remaining and ball possession information--it even shows a graphic rendition of abasketball court that illustrates the position of the ball during the game. The pager allows sports fansto "attend" any game when access to tickets, a television, or a radio is either inconvenient orunrealistic. The companion web site provides similar information online. The legal controversy stems from the fact that the paging system and Internet site were broadcast andmarketed without the authorization of the sports leagues, television stations, or radio stations that arein the business of conveying the broadcasts to the public. As a result, the National BasketballAssociation brought suit against STATS, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. in a New York federal court this pastyear. National Basketball Ass'n v. Sports Team Analysis & Tracking Systems, Inc., 939F. Supp. 1071 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Because STATS, Inc. does not pay to "publish" the sportsinformation to its customers, the NBA claimed that STATS, Inc. was liable for copyright infringementand commercial misappropriation. The NBA sought to recover damages it incurred as a result of thedevice as well as to force STATS, Inc. to cease all SportsTrax operations. The NBA's unfair competition claim was premised on "common law" (that is, the law that emergesfrom decisions made by judges in cases over the years, in this instance New York case law). TheNBA asserted that it possesses the exclusive right to use and license "NBA Intellectual Property" inconjunction with advertising, promotion, and other products and services in all forms of commerce andmedia. New York law, which is similar to laws in states around the U.S., forbids "taking the skill,expenditures, and labors of a competitor and misappropriat[ing] for the commercial advantage of oneperson . . . a benefit or property right belonging to another." Sometimes evenfactual information--if commercially valuable--is protectable under this law. The ability to control the dissemination of sports information is undoubtedly valuable to the sportsleagues. Consequently, the sports leagues employ various methods of limiting others' use of theirevents or broadcasts without permission. Nowadays, when a patron buys a ticket to an event, such asa basketball game, it is common for the back of the ticket to exhibit a warning. For example--"youagree that you will not transmit or aid in transmitting any description, account, picture, orreproduction of the event to which this ticket admits you." In an attempt to protect the value of its$750 million, four-year contract with NBC, televised NBA games are now broadcast along with awarning that "this program is authorized under the rights granted by the National BasketballAssociation," and that unauthorized use of "the pictures, descriptions or accounts" of the game isprohibited. According to papers filed in the lawsuit, the SportsTrax manufacturers originally sought alicense from the NBA to sell such information to the public via wireless communications, but thenegotiations eventually broke down and STATS, Inc. marketed the pager anyway. In its copyright claim, the NBA asserted that it owns the copyrights in all broadcasts and transmissionsin all media of NBA games, and that STATS, Inc. should be prohibited from using game informationfor commercial profit. Congress enacted our current copyright law, which gives authors exclusiverights to their "original works" for a finite period. The law endeavors to protect creative expression. Prohibiting others' use of factual information--which is in the public domain--is generallydisallowed as too broad under copyright law. Because copyright law does not allow an author toprohibit the reproduction of facts included in a copyrighted work, the NBA could not recover under acopyright rationale. Based on the "common law" of misappropriation, though, Judge Loretta Preska of the UnitedStates District Court in Manhattan granted an injunction against Motorola and STATS, Inc., rulingthat their nearly real-time dissemination of sports information constituted a misappropriation of theNBA's and its licensees' commercial interests in their intellectual property. Appeal of this ruling by STATS, Inc. has sparked the interest of many. In an attempt to overturn thecourt's decision, not only America Online, but also such entities as The New York Times, and theAssociated Press have filed "friend of the court" briefs arguing that STATS, Inc. has the right toproduce, market, sell, and operate its SportsTrax pager without consent of the NBA. Sportsorganizations such as the National Football League, National Hockey League, and Major LeagueBaseball, as well as the media network NBC, align themselves with the NBA on this issue. The lawsuit raises interesting questions about how the law should respond to this untestedtechnological invention. Are the continuous updates provided by the SportsTrax pager and companion web site really a re-creation or broadcast of a sporting event or are they merely the relay of factual news information? What is the appropriate level of control given to the sports leagues in preventing unauthorizedbroadcasting by third (nonpaying) parties of the factual information generated from their games? Surely the NBA cannot stop someone from telephoning a friend and telling him that the Knicks are upby 6 with 2:40 to play in the fourth quarter! The courts need to strike a balance between public and private interests. While we like to think of "sports" as more than mere, paid entertainment, the truth remains that professional athletics are performances of highly paid performers. Up-to-the-minute accounts ofgames certainly increase fan interest and, indeed, one would think that sports leagues would be eager tosee their games on new media. Instant sports information, however, is extremely valuable. While rapidly transmitted numerical and shorthand written descriptions lack much of the "color" of verbal and pictorial play-by-play reports, they may be sufficiently close approximations that it can be fairly argued that companies like Motorola and STATS, Inc. should be willing to pay reasonable sums for it, otherwise it may be unfair to let them reap where they have not sown. In response to its critics, STATS, Inc. maintains that SportsTrax does not attempt to rebroadcast theevent--it is merely a relay of scores and other factual information. It is unlikely that SportsTraxcompetes with a live game or television or even radio broadcast. No digital display can ever compareto actually watching the players on the court "setting a pick" or "ripping down" an offensive rebound. But how does this apply to a sport like baseball, where a detailed on-line play-by-play descriptionwould be very similar to what a radio broadcast could offer? At least one thing is clear: we have seen only the beginning of this new technology. With a touch of abutton (and a monthly fee), perhaps fans around the world will soon be able to watch still pictures andfilm-clips, or listen to sound, almost as the action unfolds live. In fact, during the 1996 U.S. Open tennis tournament, fans could access an Internet website that displayed a still photograph of a match in progress, updated every thirty seconds. Where does one draw the line betweenconveying factual information and providing a "portable ticket to the game" that eliminates thefinancial involvement of the sporting leagues or the contracted-for media broadcasts? As computer and information technology changes the way we distribute and receive information in thetwenty-first century, our courts will further attempt to wrestle with the necessity to adjust our lawsaccordingly. With advocates on either side of the SportsTrax issue endeavoring to persuade the courtof appeals, perhaps an upcoming court decision on these important concerns will help to clarify manyof the legal issues regarding the newly-explored world of computer and information technology.

Coded Communications On the Internet: Who Should Hold The Key? By Jennifer L. Stefanick, Edward M.Pinter and John J. Witmeyer III Ford Marrin Esposito Witmeyer & Gleser, L.L.P. Words like "encryption," "de-coder keys," and "scrambled data" probably bring to mind visions of national security, intelligence agents and international spies. But, recently, the concept of coded communications has become a hot topic for Internet users, politicians, privacy activists and law enforcement agents. The increased popularity of on-line communications, and the use of the Internet for financial transactions, has fueled the debate about technology that can prevent unauthorized access to electronically-transmitted material. Should such technology be highly restricted by the government, or should it be allowed to flourish in the American or global market? The answer depends on your perspective. The technology in question is called cryptography -- the use of mathematical formulas to encrypt electronic information so it is indecipherable without the proper digital "key." At one time, the average person had little interest in this arcane topic, then the domain of spies and large banking institutions. However, the need for and implications of encoding software grow with the number of people and businesses that use the Internet. International communications compound the problem. Both parties to coded Internet communications need cryptographic software that interfaces one with the other in order for the recipient to decode what the sender wants to say. Examples include credit card or bank account numbers in commercial transactions or electronically transmitted medical records or digitized medical images. Self-evidently, interception of such communications, or tampering with them, could cause significant harm. Some people further assert that they have the right to keep their communications secret from anyone else as a matter of personal privacy. Presently, though, the U.S. government has strict laws regarding this technology. The Secretary of State placed information security systems and equipment, including cryptographic software, on the U.S. Munitions List (see 22 C.F.R. Section 121.1, category XIII), which means it cannot be sent abroad without a State Department arms export license. The State Department grants licenses only for weak encryption software, that is, software that develops codes that are relatively easy to crack. Critics complain that this approach is causing the United States to fall behind in the worldwide electronic communications market. And Internet users, particularly those in the business community, are pushing for relaxed restrictions so that companies can feel more secure about transmitting sensitive business, financial and legal material. So why is the government holding back? Law enforcement officials warn that open access to advanced levels of this technology will give criminals a system through which they can use codes to communicate, secure in the knowledge that police will be unable to decipher their transmissions. And, intelligence agents fear that international spies will be able to use strong encrypting technology to pass on top-secret information to other countries and that terrorists will use the technology to hide the planning of terrorist activities. The debate has grown increasingly controversial, especially with the introduction of H.R. 3011, the Security and Freedom Through Encryption Act ("SAFE" Act), which would relax licensing and export restrictions. Those opposed to this effort have testified at length as to how increased levels of encryption technology would harm law enforcement efforts. According to Jamie S. Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, the harmful effects of cryptography have already begun to surface. (See, Hearing on H.R. 3011, The Security & Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act Before the House Judiciary Committee, 104th Congress (Sep't 25-26, 1996), Statement of Jamie S. Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General.) For example, Gorelick stated that Ramzi Yousef, who was recently convicted of conspiring to blow up ten U.S. airliners in the Far East, apparently stored information about his terrorist plot in an encrypted computer file in Manila, the Phillippines. Also, in a major international drug-trafficking case, the subject of a court ordered wiretap used a telephone encryption device to significantly hinder the surveillance. "Kiddie porn" dealers have even encrypted obscene and pornographic images of children over the Internet. Gorelick cautioned that stronger encryption products will increase to the point of denying law enforcement access to stored electronic evidence, resulting in an increased threat to public safety. On the other hand, supporters of SAFE argue that stronger encryption technology would ensure safe electronic commerce, protect individual privacy and boost the competitiveness of U.S. companies. Further, they point out that elaborate digital codes would actually hinder crime by providing better protection for top-secret information such as banking and telecommunications networks. So far, no one has come up with an approach that pleases all sides. At one time, some politicians supported the "trusted third party" approach whereby master "key" codes to the scrambled data would be placed in the hands of an escrow agent, such as a private party or a governmental entity. Law enforcement officials would then need to go through proper legal channels in order to obtain the keys for use in a particular situation. But, the idea of placing the codes with a third party negates the purpose of encryption, that is, keeping the coded information a secret. If the escrow agent, through neglect or otherwise, were to let the keys out, then things that should have remained secret could become vulnerable and a new set of master keys might need to be created, with a new set of encryption software written to use those keys. The escrow agent approach also concedes that the government should have the ability to decode anything, with limitations placed by law on the circumstances in which it may properly do so. Accepting that premise, a recent suggestion has been raised that may provide a compromise for dealing with the possibility that the escrow agent could lose the master keys. Eleven major information technology vendors and user organizations, including Apple Computer and IBM, have announced the formation of an alliance to develop an exportable worldwide approach to strong encryption. This approach has been labeled the "key recovery" system and would involve the development and distribution of technology that could permit the recovery of anyone's lost or damaged keys without the need to store or escrow the master key codes with a third party. Law enforcement agents could then gain access to the data after securing a court order that would allow them to recover the keys. This approach would seem to satisfy the concerns of everyone involved, except the most ardent advocates of privacy at all costs. In fact, Vice President Al Gore recently announced the White House's support for the "key recovery" system, suggesting that the Administration has abandoned the "escrow" approach. But, not all parties believe that "key recovery" is the way to go. Some U.S. companies, like Netscape, have said that the proposed system will not work and privacy activists have expressed similar doubts. As with most controversies, it will no doubt be difficult to come up with a solution that makes everybody happy. But the problem is one that will not go away. As use of the Internet increases, more and more people will be affected by the issue of encryption. The debate is likely to heat up before it cools down, particularly with the proposal that Congress enact the SAFE Act. Visit the web site. Visit the home page or the page.

Report filed 6.05pm (GMT) 7 October 1996. Related Sites Netscape Internet Explorer LONDON, UK—The announcement by Bill Gates� Microsoft Corporation that their new Internet Explorer 3.0 supports 128 bit secure encryption underlines advances in World Wide Web security. 100% Secure transactions are now a reality and consumer confidence is at an all time high. Throughout the development of the Internet, data integrity and security have been important issues. When an Internet client submits secret information, such as his or her credit card details to an online service, they need to be sure that a third party cannot gain access to the information as it travels through various computers on the way from the client�s computer to the service�s server. Customers rightfully feared that hackers might be able to get hold of their credit card details and use them in fraudulent transactions. Early on in the history of the World Wide Web, Netscape faced up to the challenge of providing secure transactions, introducing SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Security. The new system, which operates similarly to famous encryption software PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), for the first time meant that Internet users all around the world could be sure that none of their private information would get into the wrong hands. All of the newest browsers form Microsoft and Netscape support secure transactions, as well as several others manufactured by different software companies. SSL works by sending out its �public key� to browsers which request secure information. The browser returns its own instantaneously produced key. Like PGP, information sent from the server to the browser is encrypted so that only the expected recipient of any particular piece of information can understand it. Information sent from the Internet browser to the required server is also encrypted. Hackers can still listen to information as it is transmitted around the world wide web, but because of sophisticated cryptography, they cannot decipher what is actually contained within such data. The 128 bit security offered by Microsoft�s new browser has been available for Netscape 'Navigator' for some time. The move by the software giant illustrates a common desire that encryption should be as exacting as possible. John Ludwig, Vice president of the Internet platform and tools division at Microsoft commented, �A critical element to the ultimate success of the Internet is our ability as an industry to provide users a way to feel confident that they are shielded from the security issues involving the Internet.� Due to American export regulations concerning munitions, it is illegal to export 128 bit encryption software. Instead, international users have access to a 40 bit version of both Microsoft and Netscape�s World Wide Web navigators. Although 128 bit software has an advantage over the less secure international variation, 40 bit encryption is still immensely powerful. In a controlled experiment, it took more than a week for 10 super-computers to pull 2 or 3 credit card numbers out of a continuous stream of numbers in a test last year. At the time, a member of the consortium who carried out the tests which were intended to investigate security across the Internet, commented that it would have been far easier and much more profitable to search through a restaurant�s trash cans and find credit card receipts. The scientists who carried out the experiment with 40 bit encryption didn�t even waste their time trying to crack the more sophisticated 128 bit system. It seems very unlikely that a would-be hacker with less equipment would bother to gain information out of data encrypted with either type of security!

Report filed 1.41pm (CET) 2 December 1996. Related Sites InterLotto VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN — InterLotto draw hostess Caroline Burdett has been showing off some of her other talents recently. When she is not announcing the results from the World�s first online lottery service, Caroline takes to the mountains to practice her skills on the bobsleigh. She�s not done too badly so far. She�s a world champion in the women�s two-man competition. Caroline�s ambitions don�t end with a world championship title. Now she has her eye on an Olympic medal. Unfortunately for her, the Olympics don�t host a women�s two man bobsleigh competition. Undeterred, Caroline, 26, has opted to move to the �skeleton�, which is likely to become an Olympic sport in the next winter Olympics in 1998. As reported in �Schwizer Illustrierte� and �Sonntags Blick�, two German language publications, Caroline is going solo with her new sleigh. As well as changing allegiances in disciplines, the InterLotto hostess is also attempting to move from the Swiss to the Liechtenstein team. The small European state has been Caroline�s home for some time, but she has continued to compete for Switzerland�s team as she has Swiss nationality. Having lived and worked in Liechtenstein and presented the results from Liechtenstein�s state authorised lottery, Caroline now feels the time is right for her to represent the state in a fuller way.

The demand for Internet services has meant that many potential customers have up to now not had a chance to experience the facilities that the World Wide Web and other services have to offer. Various companies have started to introduce Internet terminals, which can be accessed by the general public without the expense of buying their own personal computer. �Cyber Cafes� have also been providing Internet access by making Internet-ready PCs available to the public. The most interesting of the new products is an Internet terminal, which is so simple that even the most non-computer literate users will find it easy to navigate their way around the World Wide Web, use email and keep up to date with newsgroups. InterPad is one solution to the global Internet shortage. Combining Windows 95 software and Intel Pentium technology with touch screen functionality, the InterPad gives instant access to the online world without even so much as a click of the mouse. Instead users can navigate their way with their fingers, by pushing buttons on the screen. InterPad makes it easier to access the Internet generally. Its particular advantage is that InterLotto (http://www.interlotto.li) the world�s only true Internet Lottery becomes much simpler to play. Special technology makes it possible to navigate all of InterLotto�s site quickly and easily, through pages that have been specially designed to work with the new machines. One difficulty with an interface which does not include a keyboard or mouse is to enter the user names and passwords necessary for many online service including InterLotto. The problem has been solved with the addition of a card swipe system. Customers can use their credit card or a special InterPad card to access to the services they are looking for. To enable the greatest number of people to access the new terminals, InterPad are planning to install them in public meeting places such as bars and restaurants, where people will have a chance to enjoy all that the Internet has to offer. To ensure that language is not a barrier to using the new machines, versions of the software are available in several widely spoken languages. With internet terminal technology, the world can seem like a small place, not only for those with computers at work or at home, but for those of all nationalities around the globe.

Report filed 6.14pm (CET) 17 October 1996. Related Sites International Gambling and Wagering Business InterLotto The magazine of the International Gaming and Wagering Business LAS VEGAS, USA—The World Gaming Congress and Expo '96 hosted by the International Gaming and Wagering Business (IGWB) took place in Las Vegas between 1 and 3 October. The central theme of the conference was Casinos and other varieties of profit-making gaming, but charitable gaming operations and lotteries were also discussed in detail, in the many workshops and seminars that took place during the three day seminar. The keynote speech for the conference was presented by �futurist� Frank Feather, author of �G Forces: The 35 Global Forces Restructuring our Future�. The world-renowned business strategist presented a thought-provoking forecast of trends most likely to impact the gaming industry in the year 2000 and beyond., considering a range of topics from socio-cultural issues to economics, environmentalism and advanced technology. Feather spoke of his vision of the future where companies are forced to reorganise global strategies in order to achieve success in the local marketplace. Included in the strategist's outlook for the future of gaming is greater involvement in the Internet, as a new medium for current gaming companies. His thoughts were echoed in many of the conference�s other speeches and workshops. Throughout the 3 day event, there was much talk about the possibilities that the Internet afforded over the next few years as well as discussions about current online gaming such as InterLotto who have set up an online lottery service. The consensus of discussions inside and outside of the conference were that companies wishing to offer gaming over the Internet had to display impeccable standards of service and prove to potential customers that they had the right credentials. Above all, legality was a major issue. If customers were not sure that they were playing on a legal system, it was believed that they would not be willing to spend their money. Several of the Internet gaming systems currently available have not been legally authenticated, unlike InterLotto which exists with the full cooperation of the government of the principality of Liechtenstein. The sponsors of the event, IGWB, produce a magazine read by many in the gaming community. The cover story on October�s issue joined Frank Feather in his interest in online gaming. The story �Lotto shows life on the Internet� discussed InterLotto�s performance since it was established in October 1995. The article in the respected publication by Patricia McQueen included an interview with James Tucker, InterLotto�s spokesman. The article soberly discussed InterLotto�s success rate and the possibilities for an online charitable lottery, as well as issues of legality and the types of games that are currently available on the pioneering lottery system. McQueen noted, �Instant tickets became InterLotto�s second offering in January, and they have rapidly become the most popular game. Recognition from the world wide gaming community is essential to the success of Inteenet gaming. Early signs indicate that more commercial groups are more than willing to embrace new technologies if they seem to be pertinent to future development and expansion within the industry as a whole. Watch this space for developments as they happen.

Report filed 5.05pm (GMT) 13 October 1996. Related Stories Spot the Ball released Related Sites InterLotto VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN—Pioneering International Lottery developer, InterLotto, have once again pushed back technological frontiers as they introduce two new games, which are destined to delight Internet users for many years to come, as more and more lottery players embrace global games played across the World Wide Web. �Lotto Shoot Out� and �Little Big One� were introduced to game players around the world on Thursday 24 October and both games have proved to be favorites with InterLotto players new and old. The new games fill a space between InterLotto�s weekly lottery and their range of instant games. Little Big One is drawn every day. Lotto Shoot Out�s draws take place every six hours. For years, Lotto players have been clamoring for an alternative to the traditional weekly lotteries that take place all over the world. InterLotto has filled the gap. Two great new games with frequent draws give lotto players an enjoyable alternative to traditional weekly big win competitions. Playing the new games is more fun, as the waiting time to find out whether you have been lucky is much shorter. �Little Big One� is run in the same way as InterLotto�s 6/40 weekly lottery, but there is a draw every day and the odds are significantly better as competitors need only match 5 balls out of 15. Like the weekly lottery, you can buy tickets in advance for future games and use a random generator to decide the numbers you enter to save on time. The lucky player who matches all 5 winning balls wins the entire accumulating jackpot. InterLotto�s other new game, �Lotto Shoot Out� works on a similar basis to common bingo games, but its certainly Bingo with an exciting difference. Bingo has seen a resurgence in popularity over the last few years, and is currently one of the most played games around the globe. Many casinos have even begun to offer bingo games in response to customer pressure. Users select six numbers, as they would if they were playing lotto. The difference comes when the draw begins. Rather than just drawing six balls, the draw goes on and more numbers are drawn until there is a winner. At least one player is guaranteed to win the entire jackpot every six hours. To add to the excitement of playing the new lotto games, players can watch the draw as it progresses. As more numbers are drawn your chances of winning accumulate. The more numbers that are drawn before a winner is found, the better your chances are. The Lotto News Network will give you up-to-date information on the jackpots and draws of both the new games, all day every day. Experience the fun of 'Lotto Shoot Out' and 'Little Big One' Now!

Drugs change the way we act, think and feel. Some drugs cause depression; some make users feel invincible and can give them a false sense of security; some drugs make users feel that they can do anything. These feelings are often unpredictable. The dangers of drug experimentation are: overdose physical illness use of impure or unknown drugs addiction impaired judgment Becoming dependent (getting hooked) on alcohol or drugs may happen immediately or gradually. Using drugs may kill you, especially when taken in excess or in the wrong combination. Drugs are very unpredictable and their effects on the body vary from person to person.Alcohol is the most abused drug in Canada. Alcohol is a depressant (downer). Alcohol affects parts of the brain and spinal cord in proportion to the amount of alcohol in bloodstream. Usual effects of small doses are euphoria, drowsiness, dizziness, flushing, and release of inhibitions and tensions. Larger doses produce slurred speech, staggering, double vision and stupor. Alcohol, even in fairly low doses, impairs driving. In combination with other drugs, a small dose of alcohol may produce exaggerated effects.Beginning 8 to 12 hours after consumption, excessive drinking may produce headache, nausea, shakiness and vomiting (hangover).Very large doses can cause death by blocking the brain's control over respiration. The effect of alcohol may include: disruptions of drinker's social, family and school life liver damage, brain damage blackouts (loss of memory) impotence, ulcers, disorders of the pancreas heart disease certain types of cancer Regular alcohol use induces tolerance, making increased doses necessary to produce the desired effect. Chronic users may drink steadily without appearing to get drunk. Their condition may go unrecognized, even by themselves, for some time. Chronic drinkers are likely to become physically and psychologically dependent. Withdrawal symptoms include jumpiness, sleeplessness, sweating and poor appetite, progressing to tremors, convulsions, hallucinations and even death. WARNING:Alcohol is a dangerous drug. Games such as "chugging," "card games" and "quarters" can kill you. WARNING:Drinking or using any drugs during pregnancy is extremely dangerous to the unborn baby. Pregnant women who drink excessively may have babies with abnormalities such as mental deficiencies, physical deformities or cardiac defects. WARNING:Drinking and driving don't mix. It is an offense to drive with a Blood Alcohol Level (BAL) of .08% or greater, or to drive while impaired, even if one's BAL is less than .08%. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome effects the unborn child. When a woman drinks alcohol during pregnancy, it can physically or mentally damage her unborn baby (fetus).The effects of alcohol on the unborn child may include; mental retardation low birth weight small head and small build poor co-ordination joint problems heart defects seizures behavioural problems short attention span WARNING:There is no safe amount of alcohol for a pregnant woman to drink. Even one drink a day may cause problems. Marijuana (pot, grass, weed, reefer, ganja, joint) and hashish (known as hash) are generally smoked or eaten. Getting high or stoned can make the user feel dull and sluggish for some time after. Concentration and short-term memory can be impaired. Physical effects include impaired coordination and balance, rapid heart beat, red eyes, dry mouth and throat, and drowsiness. THC, the active ingredient, has been detected in bodies of fatally injured drivers and pedestrians in Canada and the U.S.A.. The respiratory system can be damaged by smoking a single joint of marijuana as it yields twice as much tar as a strong cigarette. Studies suggest that normal growth of a baby can be adversely affected by use of marijuana during pregnancy. The effects of marijuana may include: loss of motivation and interest lung damage depression, anxiety, panic, terror, paranoia time distortion, short term memory loss impaired ability to drive Cocaine (C, coke, snow, nose candy) is snorted, injected or smoked. It acts as a stimulant (upper) of the central nervous system.The effects resemble those of amphetamines with shorter duration. User feels euphoric, energetic, alert; has rapid heart beat and breathing, high body temperature, dilated pupils, sweating, pallor, and a decreased appetite. Large doses can cause erratic or violent behaviour, tremors, incoordination, twitching, hallucinations, pain or pressure in the chest, nausea, blurred vision, fever, muscle spasms, convulsions and death. Users may experience insomnia and stuffy nose as a "hangover" from cocaine.Characteristic signs of chronic cocaine sniffing are stuffiness and runny nose, chapped nostrils, and perforation of nasal septum. The effects of cocaine may include: restlessness extreme excitability insomnia, paranoia hallucinations and delusions constipation, impotence, difficulty in urinating Crack is a form of cocaine which appears as small granules that are smoked in a glass pipe or tube. Because crack is more concentrated, its use can result in more severe consequences. WARNING:Even first time use of cocaine or crack can cause death. WARNING:Crack is highly addictive. A first time user may become addicted. WARNING:Freebasing cocaine can cause injury or death from fire or explosion. Inhalants "sniffing" glue, aerosols (hairspray, Pam), nail polish, cleaning fluids or gasoline can produce mind-altering effects. The effects of abusing these chemicals can cause unconsciousness and death. LSD (acid) is sold on the street as coloured drops on blotting paper, on gelatin sheets, and as tablets, capsules or liquid solutions.The effects are felt within an hour, lasting up to 12 hours. Thinking and concentration become difficult, and short-term memory is impaired. Extreme mood swings, including joy, inspiration, depression, anxiety, terror and aggression, are common. The drug can induce confusion which can cause accidental death. The effects of LSD may include: decreased motivation and interest prolonged depression and anxiety flashbacks (LSD) "high" may spontaneously recur days, weeks or even months later fetal abnormality PCP (angel dust, elephant, hog) comes in powder form, in crystals, liquid, tablet, capsule or paste. The effects last 3 to 18 hours. It produces a state of intoxication, a sense of separation from surroundings, perceptual distortions, and difficulty in concentrating and communicating. Users may become highly confused, paranoid, terrified, aggressive or passive. Overdose can cause convulsions, coma and death. Accidental death can result from drug-induced confusion. The effects of PCP may include: persistent speech problems depression, anxiety or more severe psychological problems Magic Mushrooms psilocybin (psilocin) is the active ingredient in several species of mushrooms and other fungi that grow throughout Canada. The effects are felt after about half an hour, and last several hours. Symptoms may include fatigue, separation from surroundings, or a sense of heaviness or lightness. The effects of Magic Mushrooms may include: perceptual distortions dizziness, abdominal discomfort numbness of the mouth nausea, shivering, flushing, sweating Heroin (H, horse, junk, smack) is fine white or brown powder, usually heavily diluted with powdered milk, sugar, quinine or other substances. It can be sniffed but is usually injected. It is a derivative of morphine, but proves to be more addictive and requires increased amounts to reach the same high. Newborn infants may suffer signs of withdrawal because of their mother's habit.The effects of heroin may include: user goes into stupor restlessness, nausea, vomiting severe constipation moodiness, menstrual irregularities insensitivity to pain, contraction of pupils cold, moist, bluish skin breathing may slow to complete stop,resulting in death Amphetamines (speed, bennies, ice) are uppers. These drugs cause hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Users may feel extremely anxious, fearful and suspicious. The effects of amphetamines may include: malnutrition mental illness similar to paranoia prone to violence Prescription drugs (sleeping pills, pain killers, cold remedies, tranquilizers) can cure illness and block pain, and sometimes their beneficial effects are needed.Prescription drugs can also cause dependency and side effects that interfere with life. Prescription drugs are not safe for use by anyone other than the person for whom they were prescribed. Tobacco (nicotine) is found in cigarettes, snuff and other tobacco products. A lighted cigarette generates 4000 different chemical compounds. Most smokers are physically and psychologically dependent on tobacco. Tar accumulates in the lungs. Inhaling smokers subject themselves and people around them to very high carbon monoxide levels. Those who quit smoking generally achieve the same health levels as non-smokers after a few years, although some damage may not be completely reversible. Cigarette smoke can be unhealthy and irritating to non-smokers, in particular people with allergies, children and people who already have heart or lung disease. Laws and regulations restricting use of tobacco in public places have been introduced across Canada. The effects of smoking may include: increased heart rate and blood pressure drop in skin temperature faster breathing cancer of the lungs, mouth and throat respiratory disease blockage of blood vessels stomach ulcers each cigarette cuts 5.5 minutes from smoker's lifespan The babies of women who smoke tend to weigh less at birth than those of non-smokers; the risk of prematurity, miscarriage and stillbirth is greater. Studies suggest that a mother's smoking can have a detrimental effect on a child's growth, intellectual development and behaviour.Caffeine is the world's most popular drug. It is found in coffee, tea, cocoa and cola drinks. It is also found in aspirin, non-prescription cough and cold remedies, diet pills and some street drugs. People who suddenly stop using caffeine after long term use experience withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms may include headaches, irritability and mood changes.

In the process of explaining those feelings, you can learn how to understand yourself better and how to make more knowledgeable decisions about your life. Sometimes friends and relatives who are good listeners can help you make decisions. Trust your feelings and find someone who makes you feel comfortable.If your problems seem too difficult or too personal to discuss with a friend or relative, then you may need to find a trained counsellor. Mental health centres and other agencies provide counselling on issues such as: loneliness difficulty with making friends drug or alcohol misuse/abuse sexuality peer pressure depression and anxiety confused thoughts, reality testing family problems Some agencies allow counsellors to see a teenager without parental permission. Call first to determine policies. Ask about special services for teens, fees and appointment times. Remember, don't let anything keep you from getting the help you deserve.

This unrealistic goal is reinforced by the fashion, fitness, mass media and tobacco industries in advertising their products. THERE IS IN FACT NO SINGLE IDEAL BODY SHAPE.Two eating disorders related to the pursuit of the "ideal" body are threatening the health and happiness of young people today. They are Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia. They can have devastatingeffects on sufferers and their families. They can be fatal. Anorexia Nervosa is a disorder characterized by an intense fear of becoming obese. Lack of self-esteem, depression and feeling fat in spite of noticeable thinness result in behaviours such as deliberate self-starvation, excessive exercising, "pickiness" in food choices and serious weight loss. Bulimia is also characterized by an excessive concern about body weight and shape. Bulimics engage in recurrent episodes of binge eating which result in fear of being overweight. This is followed by weight control methods such as self-induced vomiting, fasting, use of diuretics, purging with laxatives and excessive exercising. If you, a family member or a friend display any of these symptoms or conditions, you can get information and help by contacting: Anorexia Nervosa & Associated Disorders 684-2623 Overlynn Centre for Youth Health offer: BC Children's Hospital-Youth Clinic 291-6786 UBC Division of Adloescent Health 291-9228 Other resources: National Institute For Compulsive Eaters 873-6423 Eating Disorder Resource Centre of BC 631-5313WT02-B09-254IA047-000825-B025-256http://www.burnabyinfo.com:80/carbang.htm 204.174.16.208 19970119071653 text/html 2330HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 07:18:36 GMTLast-modified: Tuesday, 19-Sep-95 20:03:34 GMTContent-length: 2146Content-type: text/html Burnaby & New Westminster: Youth Pages 1995 The Youth Pages 1995:Burnaby & New Westminster Information Directory Car Accidents WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF A CAR ACCIDENT:DO NOT PANIC.

It is a deep-rooted attitude which influences the way people view the world and upon which they base their personal interactions. Racist ideas fall on a continuum starting with stereotypes and biases to fully developed theories of racist superiority which may be held unconsciously. The racism most of us encounter on a day-to-day basis is usually subtle. Our physical features and how people react to us heavily influences how we view ourselves. Subtle forms of racism, like racist jokes, insidiously attack a person's identity, eat at one's self esteem, invade one's dreams and can render a person helpless to self determine. Adults do not necessarily have a monopoly on racism. Youth who themselves are forming an identity and questioning the status quo in so many area can be cruel and heartless, unthinkingly perpetuating racial myths and racist behaviour. Do not minimize the importance of dealing with racism. If you feel you are subject to racism, you should speak to someone about it. Your close friends sometimes do not even understand how something which seems harmless to them can affect you negatively.A school counsellor, a teacher whom you trust, or a parent who can empathize may be able to help develop strategies to deal with racism. There are also community and provincial organizations which have expertise in this area and may be able to guide you.If you recognize racism in yourself, you too need help. It is not healthy to find your own identity and power by ridiculing or destroying someone else's. Speak about it with someone who can help.

It can be anything from unwanted touching to rape. It is an act of violence and abuse of power, not just the result of an uncontrollable sex urge. While anyone can commit a sexual assault, over half of all sexual assaults occur between people who know each other. Rapists choose victims who are vulnerable. Victims are often vulnerable because they know and trust their assailants. However, be sensible and avoid isolated places. Date Violence:  Understand that men and women have a right to set personal sexual limits  and that "NO" means "NO"; don't assume that flirtatious behaviour is a signal for sex clearly communicate your limits, "ESP" does not work do not confuse "scoring" with having a successful social encounter do not respond to pressured sex as a means of developing a relationship be aware of vulnerable situations and have alternatives, react negatively to unwanted physical and sexual pressure TRUST YOUR INSTINCTSAvoid drugs and alcohol - 75% of males and 55% of females who were involved in acquaintance rapes had been drinking or taking drugs just before the sexual attack.

If someone talks to you about suicide, take it seriously. People need to talk to someone if they can't cope with life. A friend may tell you about suicidal feelings and ask you to keep it a secret. Being a good friend means that YOU WILL NOT KEEP THIS A SECRET. You must tell someone you can trust (parent, teacher, member of the clergy or counsellor). Suicide threats are cries for help from people who don't realize that they have other choices. Mentioning suicide does not give people the idea or push them over the edge. Talking frankly permits people to discuss painful feelings and can prevent them from committing suicide. This period of crisis usually lasts a short time. With help, people can get past their crisis period and start to work through the feelings and problems that are bothering them.Anyone has the potential to commit suicide. Here are a few ways to help someone who is feeling suicidal: be willing to listen don't make the person feel guilty about his/her feelings get help by encouraging the person to call a suicide prevention crisis line or to seek professional counselling If you have any questions about suicide, or are experiencing a crisis in your life that seems too difficult to handle, you can call these numbers for help: Crisis Intervention: Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention Centre of Greater Vancouver 872-3311 Fraserside Suicide Prevention and Counselling Services 522-3722 Counselling Services: Suicide Attempt Counselling Service (SAFER) 879-9251 SFU Nightline 688-5198WT02-B09-261IA047-000825-B026-118http://www.burnabyinfo.com:80/social.htm 204.174.16.208 19970119071849 text/html 5990HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 07:20:38 GMTLast-modified: Tuesday, 19-Sep-95 20:12:22 GMTContent-length: 5806Content-type: text/html Burnaby & New Westminster: Youth Pages 1995 The Youth Pages 1995:Burnaby & New Westminster Information Directory 	 Social Activities It is important to put aside some time for yourself.

We are skilled practitioners of the art of multimedia writing and storytelling, and experts at the craft of combining text, images, sound, and animation to create rich, interactive experiences that aim to be as satisfying as the best print journalism, as substantial as literature, and as captivating as cinema. During the last four years, PreText has produced high-quality written content for a number of the world's best-known creators of CD-ROM titles and Web, including Microsoft, Starwave, and Amazon.com. We are also exploring the boundaries of interactive storytelling by developing original interactive programming, including the serial comedy Silicon Fusion. Multimedia is a uniquely collaborative medium that requires the contributions of skilled, creative people with expertise and experience in a wide range of areas. To that end, we have developed strategic relationships with some of the most talented people in the field and created a virtual multimedia studio that we believe is a model for this new, rapidly evolving medium.

And now, to the business at hand . . . When we last checked in, a bad week was taking an ugly turn for Silicon Fusion president Hunter Highbridge. With make-or-break Internet security product No!Wear way behind schedule, and the company's financial backers threatening to pull the plug, Highbridge arranged a company productivity pep rally that ended in chaos when he was attacked by a pair of Dobermans. If that wasn't bad enough, Silicon Fusion had just received notice of a Justice Department investigation into possible illegal transfers of military technology to insurgents in Central Asia. The week ended with a horde of federal agents swarming through the halls of Silicon Fusion, looking for evidence that someone in Silicon Fusion is an agent of a sinister group of culinary guerrillas . . .

That was 130 years ago. With the birth of multimedia, the book Alice longed for has arrived. At its best, multimedia combines words, video, sound, photographs, images, and animation to provide a sumptuous, interactive banquet of ideas and information for the mind and the senses. But it is a medium still very much in its infancy. Much of what is produced focuses too much on technical wizardry for its own sake. Too often forgotten is the fact that at its best, multimedia is still a storytelling medium. Even in the "nuggetized" world of Web sites where information is often conveyed in short chunks, narrative flow and dramatic momentum are crucial. At PreText we have been exploring multimedia as a narrative art form for four years. We are experts in the alchemical process of combining storytelling and technology to create compelling and engaging entertainment created specifically for the multimedia environment.

Below is a brief synopsis of the main characters who people the halls of Silicon Fusion, Inc. We encourage you to check back occasionally. Silicon Fusion's Human Resources Department is assembling dossiers on the company's employees. Soon, you'll find all the usual detritus that makes up a typical personnel file--resumes, commendations, reprimands, performance reports and the other flotsam and jetsam of corporate life. Hunter Highbridge: President and CEO. What he lacks in height, he more than makes up for in historionics. But without that Napoleon Complex, he wouldn't be where he is today. Ravenna Furlong: Administrative Assistant to the President. A bright young recent college graduate with a penchant for retro fashions, pierced body parts and unambitious boyfriends. Candy Meents: Vice President of Strategy, Synergy and Supplies. Underneath the stern exterior, a kind, sensitive human being is struggling to get out . . . of the high-tech industry. Victor Gooseggi: Vice President of Technology. A recent immigrant from one of the smaller of the breakaway republics of the former U.S.S.R., this brilliant computer expert is often baffled by the subtleties of American culture. Roscoe Fouzard: Director of Marketing and Company Picnics. A mixed up mess of middle-aged neuroses and trendy behavior philosophies. Thinks a ponytail and a sports car are the keys to everlasting youth. Has mistaken the phrase "you're as young as you feel " as license to act like a baby. Dede Thibedeau: Head of Overseas Operations. Based in Beijing. Hates Beijing. A frequent visitor to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hates those places, too. An ugly American with a Southern drawl. Chris: Programming Specialist. An engineering genius with a razor sharp mind and a tenuous connection to reality as we know it. Works mysterious hours. Leaves strange messes.

I was stunned that the prosecutor requested bail of $5 million. I must say you didn't do yourself any favors when you locked yourself in your office during the search. Although now I know why you didn't want them to have access to your hard drive. Some of the files might be in violation of the Interstate Electronic Transmission of Smutty Images Act. Here is the status of the case: Apparently, each of your previous three products contains hidden lines of code pertaining to the latest developments in a variety of esoteric scientific fields. In SumWare, for example, a user who knows the proper sequence of keyboard commands can access hidden functions that solve complex equations in bio-thermoplastics. (Strange, given that the original release of SumWare randomly converted decimal points to commas and added three zeros, making it difficult even to balance a checkbook.) According to my sources, CIA operatives have found that an anti-government group in Hoezbagistan (see attached) is using these codes to develop sophisticated missiles for use against Western businesses, specifically targeting fast-food establishments. Most of the materials seized last week will be returned tomorrow, except 1) records of Dede Thibodeau's trip through Central Asia last year; 2) all of the correspondence and technical work for the last two years from Victor Gooseggi and an employee named "Chris" (do you have any idea what Chris's last name is?); and 3) your hard drive. Sometime in the next month, the FBI will want to speak with Victor and Chris. Prosecutors may request that Dede return to this country for questioning. In the meantime, you might want to see what you can find out about the hidden functionality in your products. And I'd suggest you confine your Internet surfing to sports and travel. Very Truly Yours, OWEN, CASH & MOORE by JoEllen Moore P.S. Now that you're out, I assume you and your lovely wife will be joining us for our annual Christmas eve bash, no?

Authors: H. Conrad Raver, III Citation: Wire Service Story, December 14 1996 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Subjects: Breakaway Republics, Internecine Conflict In One More Another Tiny Country You've Never Heard Of Cuisine, Foods of Central Asia Reference #: G2984u52958717912975 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Beifdzhurki, Hoezbagistan -- Insurgent rebels conducted a surprise pre-dawn attack on a cluster of Western fast-food establishments in this capital city today, according to an unnamed spokesman in the State Department. No one was hurt in the raid but breakfast was an hour late. There were unconfirmed reports of widespread looting in the city's onion-ring district. "This place is chaos," said an anonymous junior attache attache at the embassy in Beifdzhurki. "Believe me, this is not what I in mind when I took the Foreign Service exam." A rebel group called the Hoezbagi Insurgent Faction Against the Colonial Hegemonist's Odious Waste (HIFAT CHOW) claimed responsibility for the attack in a letter to the BASS News Agency. Hoezbagistan is yet another country created by the breakup of the former Soviet Union. U.S. officials seeking closer economic ties with the fledgling republic are encouraging fast-food restaurants to establish a commercial beachhead in hopes of averting an election-year junta. But as Walter Walhenstan, a professor of Hoezbagistan studies at the University of Rural Wyoming, said, "We don't like corndogs here. What makes you think they'll go for 'em over there?" In a written communiqué, rebel leader Suliman Gooseggi said the guerrillas are fighting to restore and preserve the country's culinary heritage against Hoezbagi modernists who favor Western cooking. "Besides," the Stanford-educated Gooseggi added, "corndogs make me sick!" Western diplomats report that a "grease-seeking" missile scored a direct hit on the deep-fat fryer in use at Porkfinger, one of the restaurants involved. It is believed that HIFAT CHOW may have illegally obtained the lipid-locating technology from an American company. According to sources at the Justice Department, an investigation of that company may soon lead to arrests. They declined to name the company, however. Officials also declined to say whether drugs or Pat Sajak were involved. Meanwhile, a U.S. Congressman campaigning in Vermont blamed pregnant poor people for the attack. . . .

I am rolling a cigarette now. After consulting with my colleague, Hiram Rabinowitz, I have decided to take on your case. How sorry I was to hear of the disappearance of your son, Randy, into the clutches of the Anka-Right Society. How terrible for you this must be. I am now shaping the cigarette into a fine cylinder with my slender, manicured fingers. My research into this cult shows that they exhibit a deranged fascination with the famous pop singer of the 1970s, Paul Anka. They believe that the lyrics to Anka's hit tunes, such as "Havin' My Baby," "One Man Woman, One Woman Man," and "Lonely Boy," contain certain keys to successful living that only those with the proper awareness can decode. I am now lighting the cigarette with my engraved platinum Zippo. The smoke curls mysteriously above my glossy, razor-cut hairstyle. I think, Candace--may I call you that?--that we can find your son. Discreet inquiries have traced the Anka cult to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. Luckily my colleague, Hiram, has close ties with the San Francisco P.D. vice squad. I am exhaling through my sculpted nostrils. We are now commencing this inquiry. As you know, our fees are $200 per day plus expenses. We will let you know when we have achieved results in this important investigation. Warmest salutations, Henry Woo .

Today Candy Mentz, one of the VPs around here, asked me to sit in on a meeting for this new product called No!Ware. Granted, she only wanted me to take notes, but the prospect was a lot more interesting than making coffee, which is what I mostly did until the FBI confiscated the coffee maker. Anyway, during the meeting, Victor Gooseggi--a brilliant developer who's from Hoezbagistan (sorry Dad, I know you don't like to be reminded about bailing me out of jail at 3 in the morning)--pointed at me and said, "We need perspective of spring chicken to this place. Which road is No!Ware going in your mind?" You would have been proud of me!! I told them Silicon Fusion has a corporate responsibility to ensure that in the new information age, people aren't polarized into haves and have nots. Candy looked displeased, but Victor said I had "hit the pail with the bread," which I took as a compliment. He also put me in charge of what he called the "Disadvantaged Outreachment for Differently Unabled Usability Testing and Enfranchisement of All the World's Peoples Committee." I'm still a little unclear on what he has in mind, but I'm excited anyway. Not too much else to report. I haven't heard from Clive in weeks. I hate to say it Mom, but maybe you were right about him. Hope you both are doing well! Write soon--and since I don't get my first check for a couple of weeks, any extra $$ you could send would be appreciated!! Love ya!! xxoo --R .

To: ravennaf@hyperlink.com Dear Ms. Furlong: I'm pleased to inform you that the Temptress agency has secured a temporary full-time position for you. The job is with Silicon Fusion, a leading high-tech firm. You are to act as administrative assistant to Hunter Highbridge, president of Silicon Fusion. He requested someone who is bright and motivated with strong interpersonal, communication and organizational skills, a solid background in word processing, and some marketing experience. But everyone wants caviar at cat food prices, don't they? Your part-time jobs at Clothed Minds and Chai High Café during the 18 months since you graduated from Swale College didn't precisely qualify you, but we were able to convince Mr. Highbridge of your suitability for this position. The fact that you were editor of the Swale Daily Mudraker seemed to satisfy them on the communications skills front. I was able to make your senior project (Breaking the Frame: Images of Ritual Abuse and Patriarchal Domination in the Paintings of Norman Rockwell) sound like a level-headed exploration of American art history. I managed to gloss over your arrest outside the embassy of that former Soviet republic last spring. (Which one was it? Kohlrabistan? Rutabagastan?) Mr. Highbridge has indicated that there is no dress code at Silicon Fusion, but I would suggest that you not change your hair color too often early on. You are to start on Monday. Please call me to confirm your acceptance of the offer. --Zelda Marcos .

Date: 96-12-06 23:51:17 EST From: pearlfurl@eldernet.com (Pearl Furlong) To: ravennaf@hyperlink.com Dear Ravenna: How nice to get an "e-mail letter" from you. It was so good of you and your brother to show us how to go "on-line." It makes your father and I feel so "with-it" and "wired." It sure is great, honey, that you found a "real job!" I just knew that if you kept at it, something real good would come along. I know I shouldn't "nag" but I just wanted to remind you how important it is to "make a good impression" at your new job. I know that all the kids are "doing it" these days, but I just don't think it's such a good idea for you to wear that ring through your nose. It just gives people the "wrong impression." That's all for now. Your father says to say "hello." Love, Mom  .

This is unacceptable. I don't need to remind any of you that our last two products, SumWare and FlatWare, weren't exactly category killers. This time, we've got the right product at the right time. If we ship our new Internet security application No!Ware soon, we can leverage our positioning and maximize the potential upside to seize the strategic high ground and establish dominance in this critical space in the marketplace. If not . . . well let's just say that some of you are going to be looking for jobs before I go crawling back to my in-laws for yet another infusion of capital. It's time we rededicated ourselves to the value of a good 18-hour work day. If we're going to meet this deadline, we're going to have to maximize the work ethic around here. I'd like everyone to spend a little less time cheering on the company Ultimate Frisbee team and a little more time making the Ultimate Sacrifice; a little less hacky-sacking in the hallways and a little more hacking at the computer terminals. Got it? To kick things off, I'm scheduling a company-wide meeting for next Wednesday. I want this to be part rally, part harangue. Time to put a little fear back in the workplace. Like I always say, "Meaningful Threats + Empty Promises = Improved Productivity." Here's my outline for the meeting. Opening Remarks--Candy: Digital Convergence Means War. Introduce me. Cue Music : "Nowhere Man" (Roscoe: Find some third-rate rock group to record the first few lines with the last word changed: "He's a real No!Ware man. Sitting in his No!Ware land. Making all his No!Ware plans. For EVERYONE.") I take the stage dressed in commando black. Either A) I get lowered from the rafters with a knife between my teeth, or B) I come out with three Dobermans straining at the leash. Flash pots might be good, too. Life-sized dummy of the chairman of our arch rival MindWarp tossed on stage. Dogs rip it to shreds. (Smear it with hamburger first?) I give speech. (Roscoe: Find me a copy of the movie Patton.) Candy tears off blazer and blouse to reveal "We're going No!Ware. Fast!" T-shirt. Roscoe, Victor toss No!Ware Fast T-shirts to crowd. Closing chant: "Where are we going?" "No!Ware" "When are we going?" "Now!"  .

Do you know anything about the person in the corner cubicle on the second floor near Roscoe, the one with the nameplate that says "Chris" with no last name? From the piles empty soda cans and the stack of empty pizza boxes, it looks occupied, but I've never actually seen this alleged "Chris" character there.

Attached is a copy of a document I received today. Apparently, the Justice Department is instituting legal action against you and Silicon Fusion for supplying restricted technology to a rebel group in one of the former Soviet republics. As best as I can make out, this rebel group is waging holy war against the spread of Western fast food into their country, and somehow, they're using Silicon Fusion technology to further their cause. I'm assuming that this is some kind of misunderstanding. Given your company's history of "technological innovations," it's hard to imagine what this rebel group has that could possibly be a threat to anyone but themselves. Still, I advise you to treat this with the utmost seriousness. If convicted, you could face up to 30 years in prison. The fines could wipe out Silicon Fusion and take a big chunk out of your wife's trust fund as well. I pulled some strings at the Justice Department to forestall your arrest and the summary closure of Silicon Fusion. In the meantime, you better do some digging to find out what this is all about. By the way, where the hell is Hoezbagistan? Very Truly Yours, OWEN, CASH & MOORE by JoEllen Moore P.S. Dinner was nice. You're welcome to borrow my Dobermans for the meeting. .

Date: 96-12-13 23:51:17 EST From: ravennaf@hyperlink.com (Ravenna) To: clive@slacker.com Clive: You better answer my e-mail one of these days, or I'll find myself another bass player. Well . . . Another 45 minutes and I will have survived Week 1 at my new job. There was a big company meeting on Wednesday, like some sort of fascist pep rally or something. Highbridge (I told you about him . . . small man, big ego) strides onstage dressed like Rambo. One of the vice presidents followed close behind with a pack of Dobermans foaming at the mouth. A dummy was tossed on stage and the VP let the dogs loose. But they went after Highbridge instead of the dummy. (Maybe someone said "get the dummy," and they got confused!) Apparently, Highbridge had rubbed hamburger on the dummy, but forgot to wash his hands. Fortunately, the doctors were able to re-attach his pinky. I like the technology guy, Victor Gooseggi. He's one of those brilliant �migr�s from the former Soviet Union. Hoezbagistan, in fact. Remember, I got arrested at the demonstration outside the Hoezbagistan Embassy last year? Anyway, he has this charming habit of butchering Americanisms. I asked him why he looked so glum the other day and he said. "Oh it is to nothing. Is only I wake up on wrong side of dread." So when are you coming back? You said that Land Mine's "World" tour of the Upper Midwest was only going to last three weeks and you've been gone for almost two months. If you're not back soon, I'm going to shave off the rest of my hair. Hold on, there seems to be some kind of commotion in the lobby . . . I'll be right back. . . . whoa . . . gotta run. There are about 20 federal agents in the lobby and they've got a search warrant. Something about a violation of the transfer of military technologies act or something. More later . . . Much love, Ravenna  .

What are the clinical signs of Cushing's disease? Laboratory Diagnostic Evaluation How Does ANIPRYL® Work? What is the Dosage? What are the Benefits? Package Insert (Canada) Material Safety Data Sheet What is ANIPRYL®? A revolutionary new treatment for an age old problem; firstline therapy for canine Cushing's disease, approved by theCanadian Bureau of Veterinary Drugs. A New Animal DrugApplication (NADA) is pending at the U.S. FDA. ANIPRYL® (l-Selegilinehydrochloride / l-Deprenyl hydrochloride) a new, first line treatment for canine Cushing's disease (PDH) safe and effective, as demonstrated by the amelioration of clinical signs and improved low dose dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) test results (Canadian Regulatory Approval 9/95) convenient once-a-day dosage available exclusively through Canadian veterinarians Clinical Signs of Cushing'sDisease, Often Attributed to Simple Aging reduced activity decreased interaction with owner changes in sleep/wake patterns excessive panting altered appetite polyuria loss of house training increased thirst/polydipsia obesity "pot bellied" appearance skin thinning and reduced elasticity alopecia pyoderma poor hair growth Back to top Diagnostic Evaluation of the Dogwith Clinical Signs Indicative of Hyperadrenocorticism If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected in a patient based onhistory, physical examination, and clinical signs, initiallaboratory tests should be performed to aid in differentiation ofother concurrent disease processes. Once a presumptive diagnosis is made, screening tests shouldbe performed in order to establish a diagnosis ofhyperadrenocorticism. If, based on screening tests, the diagnosisis established, additional diagnostic tests are performed inorder to aid in the differentiation of dogs withpituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) fromdogs with functional adrenal tumors. Note: Patients with a history of recent or repetitiveexogenous corticosteroid administration and clinical signs andlaboratory abnormalities consistent with hyperadrenocorticismshould be tapered from corticosteroids for a period of two weeks,and then remain off of corticosteroids for a period of six weeksprior to performing screening tests. The ACTH stimulation testcan be used to differentiate iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism fromthe naturally occurring disease. Treatment for dogs diagnosed ashaving iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism involves tapering anddiscontinuation of medications containing corticosteroids. Initial Laboratory Tests Abnormal findings* Complete blood count Neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia. Mild erythrocytosis may be seen. Serum chemistries Elevated alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and cholesterol. Blood urea nitrogen may be decreased. Fasting blood glucose may be elevated. Urinalysis Low urine specific gravity; urinary tract infection (note: urine sediment exam may not reveal evidence of inflammation). Screening Tests* Abnormal findings** Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test Resting plasma cortisol concentration may be normal or elevated; 8 hour post dexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration is >1.5 ug/dl (reference ranges vary, consult your laboratory). ACTH Stimulation test Resting plasma cortisol concentration may be normal or elevated; 2 hr post ACTH stimulation plasma cortisol concentration is >20 ug/dl (reference ranges vary, consult your laboratory). Urine cortisol: creatinine ratio *** Ratio is elevated. Consult your laboratory for reference range. *Diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism should not be based solelyon evaluation of a resting plasma cortisol concentration. **Consult your reference laboratory for sample requirements,testing protocols, availability of testing agents, and referenceranges. ***The UCCR test is not highly specific, therefore a positiveresult requires further confirmation, and it should not be usedalone as a screening test. The test is, however, highlysensitive, therefore, a normal result makes the presence ofhyperadrenocorticism unlikely. Discrimination Tests Abnormal results** Endogenous ACTH concentration A value of >40 pg/ml, concurrently with hypercortisolemia (i.e. a screening test must be confirmatory for hyperadrenocorticism) is indicative of PDH. A value of <20 pg/ml; concurrently with hypercortisolemia is indicative of a functional adrenal tumor (note that dogs with iatrogenic disease may also have a value <20 pg/ml, but the ACTH stimulation test should reveal the underlying problem). Values >20 pg/ml but <40 pg/ml are non-diagnostic, and the value should be rechecked. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test Resting plasma cortisol concentration may be normal or elevated. An 8 hour post high dose dexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration <50 % of the resting value is indicative of PDH (e.g., the baseline value is 2.2 ug/dl and the 8 hr post value is 1.0 ug/dl). An 8 hour post high dose dexamethasone plasma cortisol concentration >50% of the resting value is inconclusive (e.g. the baseline value is 2.2 ug/dl and the 8 hr post value is 1.4 ug/dl). Failure of suppression is typical of patients with adrenal neoplasia, however, approximately 30% of dogs with PDH will not exhibit suppression after high-dose dexamethasone administration. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test Additional samples obtained during this test at 4 and 6 hours post low-dose dexamethasone administration may serve as both a screening test and a discriminatory test. Approximately 30% of dogs with PDH will exhibit cortisol suppression at the 4 or 6 hr time points, and rise above suppression levels at the 8 hr time point. However, failure to exhibit this "escape" pattern is not diagnostic of an adrenal tumor. Abdominal ultrasonography Abdominal ultrasonography has been shown to be an effective method of discriminating between dogs with PDH and dogs with adrenal tumors. The evaluation should be performed by an experienced ultrasonographer. **Consult your reference laboratory for sample requirements,testing protocols, availability of testing agents, and referenceranges. Additional Evaluation: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging areavailable at some university hospitals, veterinary referralinstitutions, and human hospitals. The morphology of the adrenalglands and the pituitary gland can be evaluated. References: Feldman, E.C.; Nelson, R.W.: Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing'sSyndrome).

ANIPRYL®works to restore brain dopamine metabolism. Research indicates that with aging monoamine oxidase type B(MAOB), an enzyme which degrades dopamine, increases and thus,dopamine levels decrease. ANIPRYL®is an irreversible inhibitor of MAOB. Hypothalamic dopamine depletion and dysregulation of the HPA axis Cushing's disease Pathophysiology depletion of hypothalamic dopamine (Note: Thin dark arrow) dysregulation of HPA axis excessive secretion of ACTH over-stimulation of adrenal glands (bilateral enlargement) overproduction of cortisol development of clinical signs progressive, may be fatal ANIPRYL® therapy promotes normalization of dopamine metabolism and HPA axis regulation Treatment with ANIPRYL® promotes normalization of dopamine metabolism improved regulation of HPA and cortisol secretion amelioration of clinical signs no evidence of adrenal insufficiency excellent safety profile Back to top What is the Dosage? ANIPRYL'S® One Tablet Per Day Dosage System ANIPRYL® tablets are packaged in blister cards of 30. ANIPRYL® is available in 5 tablet strengths to maximize convenience and dosage compliance. This facilitates easy one tablet per day administration for most dogs. Back to top What are the Benefits?

PHARMACOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION: Monoamine oxidase Type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. STRUCTURAL FORMULA AND CHEMISTRY: Selegiline hydrochloride is (R)-(-)-N,2-proprinylphenylethylamine hydrochloride. Molecular Formula: C13 H17NHC1 Molecular Weight: 223.75 DESCRIPTION: ANIPRYL® (selegiline hydrochloride) 2 mg, 5 mg, 10mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets are almost white, flat tabletscontaining 2, 5 10, 15 or 30 mg of the 1-isomer of selegiline HC1(1-deprenyl HC1). The inactive ingredients are Lactose, Starch,Povidone, Magnesium Stearate, and Talc. ACTION: ANIPRYL® has been shown to be effective treatmentfor pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs asdemonstrated by amelioration of clinical signs and improvedregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Ineach of three clinical trials there was a progressive improvementin endocrine function, as documented by results of low dosedexamethasone suppression (LDDS) tests (1,2). Significantclinical improvement was also demonstrated (1,2). Typicalclinical signs of PDH include polydipsia, polyuria, increasedfrequency of urination and loss of housetraining, panting,reduced activity, changes in sleep patterns, altered appetite,obesity, alopecia, abdominal distention, reduced skin elasticity,thin skin, and poor hair growth (1-3). In clinical trials, dogswith PDH treated with ANIPRYL® exhibited decreased bodyweight and improved body conformation determined by measurement,as well as amelioration of dermatologic signs (skin thickness andelasticity, alopecia, pyoderma), and regrowth of hair (1,2).Quality of life/general health was significantly improved basedon increased behavioral and cognitive responses such as higheractivity level, increased interaction with and responsiveness tothe owner, decreased polydipsia and panting, improvedhousetraining habits and sleep patterns (1,2). The LDDS test is used to confirm dysregulation of the HPAaxis, and to monitor endocrinologic response to therapy withANIPRYL® (1,2,4). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)secretion from the pars intermedia of the canine pituitary gland,and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) mediated ACTH releasefrom the pars distalis are tonically inhibited by central nervoussystem dopamine levels (5-7). Loss of this tonic inhibitionresults in increased secretion of ACTH, which results in adrenalhyperplasia and increased production of cortisol (7).Hypothalamic dopamine concentrations are decreased in dogs withPDH (8). Selegiline helps restore depleted central dopaminelevels and facilitates dopaminergic transmission by severalmechanisms, especially potent selective, irreversible inhibitionof MAOB (1,9). Selegiline also increases the synthesis andrelease of dopamine into the synapse, and inhibits dopaminereuptake (9). Selegiline or its metabolites may enhance releaseof other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (9). In the clinical trials noted above, dogs treated withANIPRYL® exhibited progressive improvement in neuroendocrinefunction, as demonstrated by improvement (normalization in somepatients) of LDDS test results (1,2). The precise mechanism forthis continued improvement is unknown, but may involveneuroprotection or nerve rescue, in addition to the mechanismsnoted above. Experiments in laboratory animals demonstrated thatselegiline enhanced the survival of neurons after nerve trauma orexposure to neurotoxins (10,11). Canine PDH is a neuroendocrine disease which shares numerousfeatures in common with several neurodegenerative disorders(2,12). For example, behavioral signs and cognitive impairment insubjects with HPA axis dysregulation may resemble some of thebehavioral and cognitive impairments in people with Parkinson'sor Alzheimer' s disease (12,13). Clinical trials in people withthese disorders have demonstrated that selegiline improvescognitive and other CNS functions (14,15). Studies in laboratoryand pet dogs have also revealed age associated cognitivedysfunction which is responsive to selegiline therapy (13,16,17). Some neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson'sdisease, may represent abnormally rapid brain aging (18).Parkinsonian patients treated with selegiline lived longer thanthose not receiving the drug (19). Furthermore, laboratoryanimals treated with selegiline exhibited significantly longerlife compared to placebo treated animals (20). TOXICITY: Selegiline hydrochloride was administered orally tobeagle dogs once daily for one year at doses of 0, 1, 4 or 16mg/kg. The no effect level was found to be 1 mg/kg. The followingclinical signs were noted in some dogs at higher doses:salivation, panting, repetitive movements, decreased weight gainand changes in activity level. INDICATIONS: ANIPRYL® tablets are indicated for the treatment ofuncomplicated canine pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism.They are not indicated for treatment of other forms of Cushing'ssyndrome. PRECAUTIONS: Endocrine function testing to confirm pituitarydependent hyperadrenocorticism should be performed by a licensedveterinarian prior to initiation of therapy. If complications ofPDH are evident at the time of diagnosis or emerge duringANIPRYL® therapy the patient should be evaluated and, ifwarranted, alternative therapy considered. Concurrent use ofANIPRYL® in conjunction with other therapy of canine PDH hasnot been reported. ANIPRYL® should not be administered atdoses exceeding those recommended. REPRODUCTION: The effect of ANIPRYL® on reproduction in the bitchhas not been determined. CONTRAINDICATIONS: ANIPRYL® is contraindicated in patients with knownhypersensitivity to this drug. Controlled studies to determinethe interaction of selegiline when administered with other drugshave not been conducted in dogs. To date, patients enrolled inclinical trials have not been reported to exhibit adverse druginteractions with heartworm prophylaxis, a variety ofantimicrobials, anthelmenthics and analgesics. Concurrent use ofselegiline with other MAO inhibitors, such as Amitraz, is notrecommended. In humans, selegiline is contraindicated for usewith meperidine and this contraindication is often extended toother opioids. Further experience in humans has revealed adverseinteractions between nonspecific MAO inhibitors and tricyclicantidepressants such as fluoxetine. Although to date no suchinteraction has been reported for selegiline in any nonhumanspecies, it seems prudent to avoid such combinations in dogs. SIDE EFFECTS: During clinical trials eighty seven dogs treated withANIPRYL® for as long as 2 years were monitored for theoccurrence of adverse events. No serious adverse events thoughtto be related to ANIPRYL® therapy were reported and noadverse drug interactions were reported. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: After confirmation of the diagnosis of PDH,ANIPRYL® is recommended orally once daily at an initial doseof 1 mg/kg (0.45 mg/lb) body weight. During the first two monthsof therapy, the patient should be re-evaluated periodically forclinical response by history and physical examination. If noimprovement in clinical signs or physical examination findings isevident by 2 months the dose can be increased to a maximum of 2mg/kg once daily, and the dog re-evaluated in similar fashion onemonth later. If there is still no improvement or if at any timeclinical signs progress, the patient should be evaluated for thepresence of concurrent disorders, including performance ofappropriate laboratory tests or other studies as warranted. Indogs whose clinical signs of PDH progress despite ANIPRYL®therapy in the absence of concurrent disease, alternative therapyshould be considered. AVAILABILITY: Five tablet sizes are available in blister packages of30's: 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. STORAGE: Store at or below 25_C.
