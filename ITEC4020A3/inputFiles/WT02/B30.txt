Sounds excellent, if you have the time and means to sort it allout. Most people don't have the time, and will gladly pay a sales charge to utilize the knowledgeand direction of a professional investment advisor. Almost two-thirds of all mutual fundassets have been sold through investment advisors.1 Unfortunately, media "financial experts" portray smart investors as only those who buy no-load,"no-help" funds. So are the majority of mutual fund investors inept? No, they simply realize thevalue of the advice provided by a professional investment advisor. Here are some reasons you should consider using the services of a financial advisor: Daily monitoring of investment markets In-depth analysis of your investment needs and strategy to obtain them Retirement planning College planning Specialized investment research Familiar voice to express your interests and concerns regarding your investments What source would you rather consult for critical investment decisions which could have an impact on both your present and future financial positions? Large stacks of nice glossy brochures, charts, and graphs. A seasoned investment professional dedicated to servicing your investment needs. 1 DALBAR Financial ServicesInc., 1996.

How Should You Receive Your Money When You Leave a Company? Whether you are retiring, taking a job with another company, or leaving your company for some other reason, there are extremely important decisions for you to make. One of the most important involves the retirement plan money that is yours to take when you leave your company. This sum of money is called a distribution, and may be the single largest sum you will ever receive at one time. The choices you make now regarding that money will affect not only your current and future income, but your income tax obligations as well. What you do with this money may determine your financial well-being, now, and well into the future. There are two major decisions you have to make regarding this distribution: How should you take your money from your employer? What should you do with it then? Both of these decisions are very important and somewhat complex. This section of the Web site was written to help you work through the first question so that you have information to help you make a decision that is right for you. Of course you should also consult your tax advisor. Answers to the second question are explored in: Basic Investing Concepts.

The amount of benefitreceived,usuallyupon retirement, is based solely on the amount contributed to the plan, plus orminus theinvestmentperformance of the fund(s) selected. Examples of these plans include: 401(k) Plans Profit Sharing Plans Money Purchase Plans. Other similar programs where the retirement benefit is based on the amountcontributed andtheinvestment performance are: Individual Retirement Accounts Simplified Employee Pension Plans Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plans Tax-Sheltered Annuities. Defined Benefit Plan This is a plan that is designed to provide employees with a defined benefit atretirement(i.e.: a monthly benefit of 20% of compensation upon attaining age 65). Contributions under the planaredetermined bythe amount of benefits to be provided, not on the basis of a percentage ofcompensation. The Social Security Forecast One of the hot political topics today is the overhaul of many health and welfareprograms,including theSocial Security system. Reports throughout the media have indicated that unlesssomething isdone tocorrect the situation, there is a real possibility that Social Security benefitsmay not beavailable in thefuture. As Americans live longer, and there are more individuals receiving benefitsthanthosecontributing, the risk of impending financial problems increases. Even with a thriving Social Security system, Americans still need to subsidizetheirretirement incomethrough personal savings, investments, and participation in an employer sponsoredretirementplan. The Advantages Of Tax Deferral One of the many benefits retirement plans can offer is tax-deferred accumulation ofcontributionsandearnings. Because participants pay no Federal income tax until the funds arewithdrawn and,in mostlocations, no state income tax either, the accounts can accumulate much faster than anafter-taxinvestment.For example: if an employee is in a 25% tax bracket and can contribute $100before-tax vs.$75 after tax,the earnings potential on the before-tax contribution is greater. Please note that withdrawalsprior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to an additional 10% IRS penalty. Dollar Cost Averaging The automatic savings feature of retirement plans, where employees set aside aspecificamount eachpay period, helps participants weather market changes through dollar costaveraging. Dollar cost averaging is the systematic investment of the same amount of money atregularintervals,regardless of market conditions. Over time, the average amount one pays for sharesis likelyto belower than the average share price. The secret of this system is that the samedollar amountbuys moreshares when the price is low, and fewer when the price is high.

For some, it may be a cozycondo on the ninthhole of theirfavorite golf course, traveling throughout the world, or helping a lovedone with the cost ofpaying for acollege education. Each day, more and more people are coming to therealization that unlessthey savefor retirement, their dreams of enjoying the good things in life will notbe realized. Whatcan you do? In today's competitive business environment, retirement benefits arecritical to attractand retainquality people, build loyalty and morale, and help your employeesenjoy a securefuture. To justmaintain their current standard of living, your employees will need tosubsidize their SocialSecurityincome with savings, investments, and perhaps most importantly, anemployer pension plan.Buildinga reserve of assets through a pension plan is a way to ensure that themoney set aside todaywill payfor what is needed at retirement. Consider the following trends: Americans are living healthier and longer. The average working American will need between 70-80% ofpre-retirement income tomaintaintheir present standard of living. Adequate retirement planning could meanthe differencebetweenthriving and merely surviving during retirement years. The savings rate in the United States is shrinking. The FederalReserve System indicatesthat thesavings rate of disposable income in 1973 was 9.4%, versus 3% today. Thisindicates that manyAmericans face the possibility of insufficient income in the future. Thisis compounded whenweconsider that the rate of inflation is expected to continue growing. Although debated for many years, we are coming to the realization thatSocialSecuritybenefits may not be available for many. By the year 2011, America'slargest presentgeneration, the 75million baby boomers, will start to retire. With less workers puttingmoney in, and moreretirees gettingpaid, the promise that Social Security benefits will be available is notguaranteed.

However, between 70% and 80% of all working Americans will beeligible to deduct all ora portion of their IRA contributions. The following chart shows the tax savings and the real cost of an IRA investment toinvestors who haveearned income of at least $2,000 and qualify for the full tax deduction. Single Married Filing Jointly Tax Bracket 15% 28% 15% 28% Contribution $2,000 $2,000 $2,000 $4,000 Tax Savings $300 $560 $300 $1,120 Real Cost Of IRA $1,700 $1,440 $1,700 $2,880 The above tax brackets are for illustrative purposes only andmay be subject tochange. Let's look at this tax savings another way. The money you save will help toward achild's education, buya major household appliance, or can be used as a downpayment on a car... all ofthis, while you arestill providing for your retirement. The Benefits of Tax-Deferred Accumulation Even if you cannot fully deduct your contributions, you may still be way ahead witha MainStay IRA. Thesecret is the potential for tax-deferred accumulation. Because you pay no incometax onthe earnings of yourIRA contributions until you withdraw them at retirement, your account can grow muchfaster than ataxable investment, such as a traditional savings account. Let's look at thischart to see how thisworks. Years IRA Taxable Plan 15 $53,776 $45,469 20 $87,730 $69,159 25 $135,353 $100,820 30 $202,146 $140,537 This hypothetical example assumes an annual $2,000 IRA contribution earning 7.0%compoundedmonthly. After 30 years, the IRA is worth $202,146. This illustration does notreflect the taxes due whenfunds are withdrawn from the IRA. However, a taxable investment, such as atraditional savingsaccount, is worth only $140,537 for an individual in the 28% tax bracket. As youcan see, the IRA isworth $61,609 more than the savings account -- all because of tax-deferredaccumulation!The potential fortax-deferred accumulation is what makes an IRA such a powerful method ofaccumulatingretirement assets. However, unlike a traditional savings account, the investment return and principalvalue of the Fund willfluctuate with changes in market conditions. You should realize that this chart isfor illustrativepurposes only, and is not intended to predict nor guarantee the actual results thatwill be realized fromany particular IRA investment.

More and more organizations are offering a series of differentplans to fit the needs andlifestyles of the many different segments of their employeepopulation. But, to beeffective, benefits managers must examine how changing attitudestoward life and worksituations have caused employees and prospective recruits tothink differently aboutthemselves and their futures. To gain insight into these issues, NYLCare recently examined someof the most significantdemographic trends that have emerged in recent years, andinformally surveyed some insuranceprofessionals on how they are helping benefits managers cope withthis fast-changingenvironment. We discovered three trends in particular that willhave a profound impact onthe workplace of tomorrow: the changing family unit, a better educated workforce, and an increase in the number of working women.

The health care benefit dilemma of the 1990s: At the very time employers are being squeezed on all sides to reduce costs, there's a growing demand on the part of employees to maintain - in fact, increase - their health care options. Health care benefits can be expensive. On average, medical costs have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation in recent years. In response, some businesses have reduced benefits or gone to more restrictive plans. The risk is that this can hurt morale and in turn negatively impact productivity. The real question: How can you control your company's health care costs without sacrificing plan benefits and flexibility? The real answer: A NYLCare managed health care plan that can "blend" the features of an HMO or other managed care plans with traditional health insurance. The result can be a cost effective package, which combines the advantages of both types of coverages. What does a managed care plan look like? That depends totally and completely on your company's needs. NYLCare, which works with more than 16,000 employer groups nationwide, offers a full spectrum of health plan designs: Managed Indemnity Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Multi-Option Point-of-Service (POS) HMO Definitions of these different health care arrangements can be found in the Health Care Terms Glossary. The options are nearly unlimited. Under a multi-option plan, for example, a variety of different plans can be combined, such as a PPO plan and an HMO or an HMO with a POS plan. The advantages of adopting a managed care plan through NYLCare include: Built-in plan design flexibility: The plan you implement will be designed and tailored to reflect the unique benefit needs of your business. You can also select the type of plan and amount of benefits your employees will receive. Cost controls and predictability: A plan will be designed that is affordable and, just as important, enables you to budget and manage your health care costs. NYLCare will work with your business to help keep your health care costs predictable and, therefore, manageable. With a managed care option from NYLCare, for instance, you can select the option that is best suited to your budget. Options for enhanced benefits.

In the 1980s, Americanscreated 16 percent more newhouseholds, yet the population rose just 10 percent. That meansthe average family size isdown 5 percent. The fastest growing household segments from 1990 to 2000 will bemarried couples with nochildren, single father households, and non-traditionalhouseholds. The traditional familyunit still makes up 71 percent of American households, but thenumber is shrinking. Conversely, household income will rise 40 percent in the 1990scompared with the previousdecade. These changes have prompted employers to push their insuranceproviders to move beyond theestablished system of offering just single or family rates. Despite the cost benefit in aparent and child or husband and wife rate versus a family rate,it is not simply a financialissue. Beyond the cost issue, these trends infer changes in the Americansocial structure. Non-traditional households, such as grandparents raisingchildren, common-law or same sexcouples, are seeking social credibility, which may take form independent benefits that werepreviously unavailable to them. While it's still not common, the decision by companies to offerbenefits to same sex coupleshas not proven to be a major problem, despite what some industryobservers originallypredicted. To understand how these demographic shifts are playing out in themarketplace, we askedseveral insurance producers for their perspective. SherriGorelick, of Progressive PlanAdministrators, New York, says employers find parent and child orhusband and wife rateseasier to sell to employees who ask why they should subsidize thecost of insuring anotheremployee's family with four children. Richard Bass, of The Kaye Group, New York, notes that there wasat first wild speculationabout how same sex couples would affect benefits and insurancecosts. Now it's largely moot. Costs of coverage for these couples, when offered, are easilyabsorbed into the pricing of abenefits plan.

Our partner in the projectis acompanycalled Stuart Disease Management Services, based in Wilmington, Delaware. What is Disease Management? The idea behind disease management is simple. There are a number of chronicdiseasesthatdoctors know a lot about, have experience treating and for which effectivemedicines exist.Disease management adds patient education and close monitoring of the disease towhatdoctorsalready know. Patients are told about their condition and receive instruction abouttakingmedication and keeping a close eye on their own health. About Congestive Heart Failure In the case of congestive heart failure, doctors have learned that the disease isbesttreated with lifestyle changes and medication. The lifestyle changes may includecuttingbackon salt, getting more rest and restricting activities that bring on symptoms of thedisease. Congestive heart failure refers to a range of conditions which impair thefunction of theheart. It results in shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles, fatigue, and, atits mostextreme, fluid in the lungs. The condition may develop over a period of weeks,months oryears. Congestive heart failure affects between 2.3 and 3 million people in the U.S., with400,000new cases diagnosed each year. It is one of the most frequent causes forhospitalizingpeople aged 65 and older. Currently, treating patients with congestive heartfailure costs anestimated billion each year in the United States. The congestive heart failurediseasemanagement program includes: strategies for disease prevention and early intervention. physician and patient education programs. ensuring patients adhere to their doctor's treatment program. identifying the drugs that work best. measuring the effectiveness of various treatments. How We Started - Where We're Going The program started with a pilot CHF management program at participating primarycarefacilities in Long Island, New York, where CHF admissions represented 40% of thehospitalizations for NYLCare 65 members. Expansion into the rest of New York State,NewJersey, Texas and Washington, D.C. will follow. By the end of 1996, the diseasemanagementprogram will be available to more than one million members of NYLCare. The relationship with Stuart Disease Management has produced an excellent programforthemanagement of congestive heart failure in a cost-conscious manner. The goal for patients in the Congestive Heart Failure Disease Management Program istoreceive the ultimate benefit for anyone suffering from a chronic disease--animprovedqualityof life.

By the year 2000, more thanhalf of all adults in the U.S. will have some college education,compared to about 30 percentin 1970; 45 percent of all college students will be over age 25and more than half of allcollege degrees will be awarded to women. This will mean satisfying a more talented and competitive workforce. Surveys indicate thatthis group is concerned with both control and quality towardshome, work, and entertainmentissues. One way employers are offering more control is by increaseduse of the triple optionproduct. Triple option is a single-priced product that givesindividual employees theoption to use indemnity, HMO or PPO coverage when they seekmedical care. With it, companiescan provide flexibility while still paying only one premium.

Health experts expect last year's measles rate to come close to the all-time low of 312reported nationally in 1993 (The 1995 figures are still being tallied by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, or CDC). "I think we're beginning to see real progress in our efforts to increase vaccination of children in thiscountry," says Russell Steele, M.D., a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee onInfectious Diseases. In 1995, three out of four two-year-olds were properly immunized against polio, measles and whoopingcough, up from two out of three in the mid-1980s, according to the CDC. On the downside, warns Dr. Steele, one in four of the nation's two-year-olds still isn't getting theshots needed to fend off killer diseases. Dr. Steele is a national leader in the federal government's Vaccines for Children campaign to reduce thenon-compliance rate for childhood vaccinations to only 10 percent by the end of 1996. Several factorshave contributed to the recent gains. According to Dr. Steele: day-care centers are making sure that two-year-olds have had all their immunizations. compliance by age 5 is now virtually 100 percent, as school systems continue to do a good job atmonitoring required inoculations for entering students. increased public attention helped to boost vaccinations after First Lady Hillary Rodham Clintonlaunched her campaign to improve America's lagging vaccination rate. Dr. Steele won't be satisfied with 90 percent compliance. "Our goal should be perfection," he says. "Wewant tohave 100 percent of our children out there adequately immunized, even if our actual target for '96 is 90percent". What Shots Does Your Child Need? These days, immunizations are offered for 10 different diseases: Hepatitis B Haemophilius b influenza Tetanus Measles Rubella (German Measles) Polio Diptheria Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Mumps Chicken Pox In most cases today, the diptheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccinations are combined in a shot known asDPT. The measles, mumps and rubella immunizations are blended together in the single-shot, MMR. Thepolio immunization is administered by an oral dose that is contained in a droplet placed on the baby'stongue. Children 6 to 12 years old who have not had chicken pox or the vaccination are given a singledose. Those 13 and older who have no history of the illness or VZV vaccinaton are given two doses fourto eight weeks apart. You should follow the schedule recommended by your Primary Care Physician. DTP Polio MMR Hib HBV (Hepatitis B) VZV (Chicken Pox) 2 mths. 4 mths. 6 mths. 12-15 mths. 15 mths. 4-6 yrs. 6-12 yrs.

Large companies have the infrastructure tomanage a wide range of productoptions that gives them a competitive advantage over smallerfirms. Bigger firms can presstheir advantage with plans that set an expenditure cap for theyear, but offer flexibilitywithin that limit, so employees may use those dollars formedical, dental, or even dependentcare. Other attractive employee-funded benefits can includevoluntary life insurance andshort-term disability coverage. There are also some profound regional differences that bearwatching. Larry Kachler, ofKachler Corporation, Houston, Texas, points out that largeremployers in Texas are stillquite cautious about giving additional benefits. This is largely due tothe difficult experience oftaking benefits away to reduce costs during the downturn in theoil and gas industry severalyears ago. In businesses like engineering, where the supply ofexperienced people is quitelimited, many firms in Texas offer better benefit packages as atool to attract and keepemployees. But, in general, employers are more apt to offervoluntary, employee-paidprograms to supplement their benefit packages. This can often bedone on a pre-tax basis tothe employee.

At first glance, your choices may read like alphabet soup. Should you select an HMO or aPPO? Or is aPOS plan best for you? The best-choice plan will address your individual health care needs and situation, and canpossiblysave you money. As an informed consumer, the first step is to make sense of the "alphabet soup". Here are the most common options: HMO: A Health Maintenance Organization A Health Maintenance Organization delivers routine andmedically necessary care through plan-affiliated physicians and hospitals. That care isoften providedor coordinated by a primary care physician. If you use non-affiliated providers, benefitsmay not be paid without prior approval. An HMO may be best for you if. . . you need to keep your out-of-pocket expenses to a minimum. you want the option of unlimited doctor visits at little additional costs. you like the convenience of no claims forms. Indemnity Plans These are traditional fee-for-service plans. Afterastipulated deductible, all or a portion (coinsurance) of covered services are paid by theplan. These plans give you complete control over provider selection. However, yourout-of-pocket expenses can be high. An indemnity plan may be best for you if. . . you are financially able to cover out-of-pocket costs. you want complete control over your choice of physician and other providers. POS: Point-of-Service Plans Point-of-Service Plans combine features of an HMO and atraditionalindemnity plan. To obtain higher in-network benefits, you use the provider servicesexactlylike an HMO member. If you do not follow HMO procedures, your benefits resemble those ofanindemnity plan, with deductibles and co-payments. A POS may be best for you if. . . you like all the benefits of an HMO for yourself for most services. you have a family member away from home, in college, perhaps, who is bestserved with an indemnity option. you require unrestricted freedom to select a provider when necessary withouttheneed for prior approval. you are willing to accept additional out-of-pocket costs. PPO: Preferred Provider Organizations Preferred Provider Organizations list "preferred" doctors andhospitals that plan members are encouraged to use. The plan then reimburses a percentage ofthe cost (such as 90%). If you elect to use other providers, reimbursement is typicallyless(such as 70%). A PPO may be best for you if. . . you are comfortable with the preferred providers available through the plan formost services. you require the flexibility to go outside the plan when necessary without theneed for prior approval. Which option is best for you? That is a personal decision. It will depend on your age, specific health needs, your familystatus and your financial responsibilities. The NYLCare Advantage: Whichever NYLCARE plan you select, you can know that you will receive a quality benefit,backed by New York Life, one of the oldest and most respected insurers in the UnitedStates. For more information, speak to your employer regarding the benefits available to you.

After implementing the respiratory wellness program,developedby AccuLab Diagnostics, there was an extraordinary improvement for the group. Herearethehighlights of the program: Some Key Results In the six months prior to introducing the respiratory wellness program, there hadbeen 59emergency room visits. In the six months after the program was introduced, therewere only4ER visits--a 93% reduction. In the six months before the program began, school-age members missed 51 daysofschool;in the six months since, only 2 days of school were missed-a 96% reduction. Average medical cost per asthma patient over a six-month period declined from$5,875.86to $27.59. How did they do it? It turns out that the AccuLab staff is comprised of licensedrespiratorytherapists who visit NYLCare members in their homes. "You can tell a whole lot about possible triggers when you go to a person's home,"saysMichele Smith, RN, Manager of Utilization Management and Case Management at NYLCareof theSouthwest. "And the respiratory therapists have a lot of specific, practicaladvice toimpart. For instance, dog owners are advised to rinse their pets with distilledwater aftershampooing to lower the animal's impact on the owner's airways." Smith says that sometimes a primary care physician will "inherit" a patient withasthma,decide the patient has the condition under control, and continue prescribing amedicine thepatient has been taking in the past. In the respiratory wellness program, therespiratorytherapist, working closely with a physician, can go back to square one in assessingthepatient's condition and treatment options. Together, they often find ways to helpthe patientmanage the disease better. "It's very satisfying to achieve these kinds of resultsfor ourmembers," Smith concludes. The chart to the right shows the sharp decline in the number of school days and work daysmissedduetoasthma after the respiratory wellness program was introduced.

Today, 58 percent of womenare either working or looking for work, compared with 76 percentof men. Ten years from now,the number of women in the workforce is projected to increase tobetween 61 and 65percent. A number of managed care organizations have responded by offering"expectant mother" and"well baby" programs. These have proven popular with busyworking mothers who find the riskscreening, the ongoing education and the preventive care builtinto these programsattractive. Benefits managers like the positive feedbackwellness programs get fromemployees, as well as the cost-benefits early diagnosis andtreatment provide. There is no question that benefits managers need to play a keyrole in helping theirorganizations compete effectively for talent and keep their bestemployees. But how willthey achieve this objective? One of the real keys is the ability to offer, and effectivelycommunicate, flexible benefitsplans. Benefits managers must also learn their employees' needsfirst-hand. We see more andmore mid-sized and small companies doing satisfaction studies,which is critically importantin making the right plan design choices. Then, once the harddecisions have been made, theyare focusing on clearly communicating the information employeesneed to make informed choicesabout their plan and the costs involved. Larger corporations, regarded as less attractive employers todaydue to waves of downsizing,must pay particular attention to benefits in order to keep andrecruit talent. From 1987 to1992, 5.6 million workers with more than three years ofexperience were laid off. Half ofthem were white collar employees. Today, the Fortune 500companies employ just 10 percent ofAmerica's workforce, down from 20 percent in 1970.
