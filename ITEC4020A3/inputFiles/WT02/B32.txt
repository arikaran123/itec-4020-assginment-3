The University is part of two EU schemes, Leonardo and Socrates, which support the exchange of staff and students between participating institutions. There are occasional opportunities for training outside Europe. The Department arranges the placements taking into account the students' preferences. Normally students are paid a salary by the company with whom they are training. Most companies appoint a member of their staff to supervise the student during the placement. Normally a member of the academic staff of the University Department will visit each student during each placement. Reports on the training are made by the student, the company and the visiting academic and on the basis of these reports the student's performance is assessed and this assessment is taken into account at the end of the course when decisions regarding the class of degree to be awarded are being made. Further information about industrial training is available from our Industrial Training Office. The time spent in the University is organised into three parts and the subjects are grouped into modules. An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows: Part 1 (two terms) modules include: Chemistry Computing and Mathematics Cell Biochemistry Physical Aspects of Biological Systems Molecular Biology Introductory Food Technology and Biotechnology Microbiology These modules in Part 1 are taken in common with students following the courses in Food Science and Food Technology. Part 2 (three terms) modules include: Process Engineering Biological Chemistry Process Control Physical Chemistry Bioreactor Design Molecular Biology Enzyme Technology Microbiology Plus additional optional subjects such as: Industrial Management and a language. Part 3 (four terms) modules include: Biotechnological Processes Biochemical Engineering Process Design for Biotechnology Applied Genetics and Cell Culture Project Plus additional optional subjects such as Food Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology and further Industrial Management. The options available may change from year to year. Project Each student undertakes a project in Part 3. This involves carrying out experimental work, either in the Departmental laboratories, another research institute or in industry, under the supervision of a member of academic staff, and an outside expert if appropriate. The student then writes a report on this work. Both the student's performance and the report are assessed. Teaching Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars. These activities are supported by practical work in the science and processing laboratories. Assessment There is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1. Students must pass this in order to progress through the rest of the course. In the event of failurein the first attempt each subject may be retaken once. There is no formal written examination at the end of Part 2. Modules are assessed throughout Part 2. Students who do not perform satisfactorily in these modular assessments may be required to take a written examination. Modules are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course. There is a formal written examination at the end of the course. The class of degree awarded to each student will be based on consideration of the student's modular assessment throughout Parts 2 and 3, the resultsof the final examination, and the assessment of the student's performance in the project and in industrial training. Prizes There are a number of prizes awarded to students who perform very well in different aspects of the course and at different stages of it. Entry requirements Two, preferably three, A-level passes (or AS equivalents) in science subjects or mathematics. GCSE/O-level mathematics is also required. Theminimum grades required are CDD. Good attainments in other courses such as the International Baccalaureate, BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered. Career opportunities Biotechnology is one of the world's fastest growing industrial sectors. Biotechnologists find employment not just in the new biotechnology industries butalso in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, food and waste treatment industries. The multi-disciplinary nature of the subject means that biotechnologists occupy a range of roles within industry, from research and development to production and management. It also provides an excellent opportunity to undertake research for a higher degree in a wide range of subjects. The emphasis on practical ability and problem solving also means thatour graduates can find employment in a range of unrelated industries.

In particular, a student will learn about the chemistry, microbiology, nutritional value and sensory properties of selected foods, as well as the effects of different types of processing on those properties. An element of specialisation is encouraged within the context of project work but, overall, a multi-disciplinary approach is adopted so as to provide graduates with a background that is suitable for a whole range of careers. Although various higher degrees involving research or more specialised training, e.g. Nutrition or Dietetics, are popular options for food scientists, many graduates prefer a career within the food industry. Two schemes are run by the Department to help students in making the correct choice of career. In the first place, the Department assists all students to obtain an eight-week placement in the food industry during one of the long vacations, and this element of the course is compulsory. However, students do have the option to spend a year in industry between the second and final years of the course, so that those seeking a career in research and development, quality assurance or production management have an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge within a working environment; placements within Europe are encouraged. The course is of three years duration (excluding an optional year in industry), and is organised into three parts with the subjects grouped into modules. An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows: Part 1 (two terms) modules include: Chemistry Computing and Mathematics Cell Biochemistry Physical Aspects of Biological Systems Molecular Biology Introductory Food Technology and Biotechnology Microbiology These modules in Part 1 are taken in common with students following the courses in Biotechnology, and Food Technology.Part 2 (three terms) modules include: Biological Chemistry Food Microbiology Food and Nutrition Chemistry Statistics Instrumental Analysis Principles of Food Processing Nutrition Plus additional optional subjects such as: Industrial Management and a language. Part 3 (4 terms) modules include: Food Chemistry Quality Assurance Sensory Analysis Nutrition Food Microbiology Project Work Plus additional optional subjects such as : Advanced Food Microbiology and Nutrition, Food Biotechnology and a language. Project work Each student undertakes a project in Part 3. This consists of two stages: (I) the student prepares a critical review of an agreed topic and submits a report: (ii) the student carries out experimental work in one of the laboratories, under the supervision of a member of the academic staff, and writes a report on this work. Both stages of the project are assessed. Teaching Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars. These activities are supported by practical work in the science and processing laboratories. Assessment There is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1. Students must pass in this to progress through the rest of the course. In the event of failure at the first attempt each subject may be retaken once. There is no formal examination at the end of Part 2. Modules are assessed throughout Part 2. Students who do not perform satisfactorily in these assessments may be required to take a written examination. Modules are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course. There is a formal written examination at the end of the course. The class of degree awarded to each student will be based on consideration of the results of the modular assessments in Parts 2 and 3, the results of the final examination and the assessment of the student�s performance in the project. Sponsorship and prizes A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking this course. This may commence at the start of the course or at a later stage. There are a number of prizes awarded to students who perform well in different aspects of the course. Entry requirements Two, preferably three, A-level passes in science subjects or mathematics, or AS equivalents, and our standard offer is for grades CDD. Good attainments in other courses, such as International Baccalaureate, BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered. Career opportunities Over one million people are employed in food and drink manufacture, distribution and sales. A recent survey has shown that career opportunities for graduates in that industry, both in terms of salary and promotion prospects, are among the best of all professional groups. Opportunities arise in the manufacturing sector in research and development, production management, quality assurance, buying, marketing and sales. Many of the large retail companies employ our graduates to liaise with suppliers on the quality of their products, the conditions under which they are produced and in the development of new products. Other opportunities occur in government research establishments, with local authorities and in teaching. Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate studies here at Reading or in other UK or overseas Universities. Other courses The Department offers undergraduate courses in Biotechnology ( 4 yrs), Chemistry and Food Science (3 yrs), Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing (4 yrs), Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing (3 yrs) and in Food Technology (4 yrs). It also offers taught MSc courses in Food and Agricultural Biotechnology, Food Science and Food Technology as well as research courses leading to MPhil and PhD degrees.

From its origins over 100 years ago, the University of Reading has had major interests in agriculture and food. These have developed to form the present Faculty of Agriculture and Food which is the largest in the UK and provides a unique breadth and wealth of experience in: agriculture and horticulture; crops and animals; rural studies; soil science; agriculture and food economics and marketing; food science, technology and biotechnology. For the latter group of courses the facilities in the Food Studies Building are second to none. The Bsc Honours Degree in Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing took its first students in the mid-1970s, and has produced some 200 graduates. It is designed to permit the simultaneous study of the scientific, economic and marketing aspects of food in a single integrated degree course without compromising the standards of either. The degree is approved by the Institute of Food Science and Technology (the professional qualifying body for food scientists and technologists in the UK) as acceptable for graduate membership of the Institute, and by the Chartered Institute of Marketing for the Certificate in Marketing and entry onto the Diploma in Marketing programme. The Taught Course Students are expected to attend lectures and practical sessions, and to participate in tutorials and seminars. Everyone has a tutor in both Departments. Your three year course at Reading is organised into three Parts; Part 1 (Terms 1-3); Part 2 (terms 3-5) and Part 3 (terms 6-9). In each Part the constituent subjects are grouped into modules. Part 1 (two terms) modules will be: Modules taken in common with the other courses in the Department of Food Science and Technology, which provide the science foundation on which the subsequent food science modules will be built: Food and Biotechnology Cell Biochemistry Chemistry 1 and 2 Molecular Biology Physical Aspects of Biological Systems Modules taken with students following other courses in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Management which provide the basis for subsequent marketing, policy and applied economics modules. Development of the Food Industry Economics 1,2 and 3 Quantitative Methods I - 1 and 2 Part 2 (three terms): The 18 modules in Part 2 will encompass the following topics: Introduction to Food Microbiology Intermediate Microeconomics Principles in Food Processing Competition and theory of Firm Food Processing Practical Quantitative Methods II Biological Chemistry Introduction to Marketing Nutrition Business Management Instrumental Analysis Welfare Economics Food Chemistry Theory of Food Consumption Introduction to Food Policy Analysis Part 3 (four terms) modules include: The final part of the course further increases the student-centered learning in the three taught terms prior to finals. Two optional modules may be chosen in addition to the core modules covering: Quality Assurance Consumer Behaviour and Food Marketing External Visits Food Marketing Sensory Analysis Advanced Marketing Consumer Attitudes to Food Quality Food Retailing Microbial Ecology Food Industry Analysis Current Issues in Food Marketing Marketing Research Methods Students undertake a special study on a topic by them and their essay supervisor. this study is allocated one module in each of terms 6-8, and is presented in the form of an essay (of not more that 10,000 words) by the last day of term 8. Assessment Throughout the course, modules are assessed and students will be kept informed of their progress. These is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1, which students must pass in order to progress through the rest of the coursed. In the event of failure at the first attempt, each subject may be resat once. There is normally no formal examination at the end of Part 2, but students must perform satisfactorily in the modular assessments, otherwise a special examination may be required. In term 9 there will be final written examinations. The class of degree awarded will be based on a consideration of the student�s overall performance, including results of modular assessments in Parts 2 7 3, the final examination and the extended essay. Sponsorship and Prizes A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking this degree. There are prizes awarded to the student with the best overall performance at various stages of the degree. Entry Requirement Two, preferably three, A-level passes (or AS equivalents) one of which must be in a science subject (preferably Chemistry). Normal entry requirements are grades CDD. A pass in GCSE (or equivalent) mathematics is also required. Good attainments in BTEC, Access, International Baccalaureate or any other qualifications are acceptable in appropriate subjects. Career Opportunities The course is designed to prepare graduates for a wide range of careers in the food sector, government and non-government organisations. While areas such as marketing, buying, selling, product development and quality assurance seem most obvious, in practice graduates have entered most areas of management in food manufacturing, retailing and distribution, commodity trading, and in non-food industry and commerce. Others have entered government (eg Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) and local authorities (eg environmental Health), market research and stock broking companies, Trade association, journalism, dietetics and teaching. some have continues their studies with higher degrees in the UK or abroad.

The course syllabus has been kept under constant review and updated to keep in line with developments in the food and related industries. The syllabus summarised below is the result of a very recent review. This course is of four years duration with a structure as shown in the following table. Students spend a minimum of three periods training in industry as part of the course. ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Autumn Term    Lent Term    Summer Term    Summer Vacation----------------------------------------------------------------------Year 1     U             U             U             IYear 2     U             U             I             IYear 3     I             I             U             I (optional)Year 4     U             U             U----------------------------------------------------------------------U indicates time spent in the University and I time spent in industry.---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial placements may be anywhere in the UK and also in many other European countries. The University is part of two EU schemes, Leonardo and Socrates, which support the exchange of staff and students between participating institutions. There are occasional opportunities for training outside Europe. The Department arranges the placements taking into account the students'preferences. Normally students are paid a salary by the company with whom they are training. Most companies appoint a member of their staff to supervise the student during the placement. Normally a member of the academic staff of the University Department will visit each student during each placement. Reports on the training are made by the student, the company and the visiting academic and on the basis of these reports the student's performance is assessed and this assessment is taken into account at the end of the coursewhen decisions regarding the class of degree to be awarded are being made. Further information about industrial training is available from our Industrial Training Office. The time spent in the University is organised into three parts and the subjects are grouped into modules. An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows: Part 1 (two terms) modules include: Chemistry Computing and Mathematics Cell Biochemistry Physical Aspects of Biological Systems Molecular Biology Introductory Food Technology and Biotechnology Microbiology These modules in Part 1 are taken in common with students following the courses in Biotechnology and Food Science. Part 2 (three terms) modules include: Biological Chemistry Food Microbiology Food Chemistry Statistics Instrumental Analysis Process Mathematics Nutrition Process Engineering Plus additional optional subjects such as: Industrial Management, Food and Nutrition Chemistry and a language. Part 3 (four terms) modules include: Quality Assurance Food Engineering Sensory Analysis Developments in Food Science and Technology Food Microbiology Project Plus additional optional subjects such as: further Industrial Management, Advanced Food Microbiology and Nutrition and a language. The options available may change from year to year. Project Each student undertakes a project in Part 3. This involves carrying out experimental work in one of the laboratories, under the supervision of a member of the academic staff, and writing a report on that work. Both the student�s performance and the report are assessed. Teaching Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars. These activities are supported by practical work in the science and processing laboratories. Assessment There is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1. Students must pass in this in order to progress through the rest of the course. In the event of failure in the first attempt each subject may be retaken once. There is no formal written examination at the end of Part 2. Modules are assessed throughout Part 2. Students who do not perform satisfactorily in these modular assessments may be required to take a written examination . Modules are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course. There is a formal written examination at the end of the course. The class of degree awarded to each student will be based on a consideration of the results of the modular assessments in Part 2 and 3, the results of the final examination, the assessment of the student�s performance in the project and in industrial training. Sponsorship and prizes A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking this course. This may commence at the start of the course or at a later stage, often after a successful training placement. There are a number of prizes awarded to students who perform very well in different aspects of the course and at different stages in it. Entry requirements Two, preferably three, A-Level passes (or AS equivalents) in science subjects or mathematics. GCSE/ O-Level mathematics is also required. The minimum grades required are CDD. Good attainments in other courses such as International Baccalaureate, BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered. Career opportunities Over one million people are employed in food and drink manufacture, distribution and sales. A recent survey has shown that career opportunities for graduates in that industry, both in terms of salary and promotion prospects, are among the highest of all professional groups. Opportunities arise in the manufacturing sector in research and development, production management, quality assurance, buying, marketing and sales . Many of the large retailing companies employ our graduates to liaise with suppliers on the quality of their products, the conditions under which they are produced and in the development of new products. Some graduates are employed by companies supplying the food industry with ingredients, equipment and packaging. Other opportunities occur in government establishments, with local authorities and in teaching. Food Technology is a very useful discipline in developing countries and some of our graduates have worked for international aid organisations and charities. Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate courses either in this University or in other UK or overseas Universities. Other courses The Department offers undergraduate courses in Biotechnology (4 yrs), Chemistry and Food Science (3 yrs), Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing (4 yrs), Food Science (3 yrs), Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing (3 yrs).

This document is intended to give some background information about the industrial trainingelement of our three sandwich course degrees (BSc Biotechnology,BSc Food Technology and BSc Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing). Although this information is primarily aimed at potential providers ofindustrial training placements, it should also be of interest to anyone else seeking generalinformation about these courses. WHY SANDWICH COURSES? How will organisations offering placements benefit? Students can provide a fresh approach to the company and often throw new light on familiar problems. Students can carry out short, but important, investigations or projects which the company has no other means of resourcing. Companies can assess students as potential employees. Industry is able to make a positive impact on the education of its future employees. Placements can lead to contact with academic staff of the University to the mutual benefit of both parties. How do students benefit from Industrial Training? The opportunity to apply principles taught at University to real industrial situations and problems. The opportunity to broaden their experience and knowledge and to develop practical skills in a working environment. The opportunity to develop inter-personal and communication skills. The opportunity to appreciate the organisation of industry including the interaction between technological, social and economic factors. The opportunity to gain experience in different sectors of the industry and different functions within it. The opportunity to make informed career choices on graduation. WHAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE ARE THE STUDENTS LOOKING FOR? A large variety of functional areas are suitable for industrial training. It is the natureof the experience that is important, and not necessarily the nature, or even size, of theemploying organisation. The industrial training should contribute to the development of thestudent by providing responsibility commensurate with their level of experience, potentialand degree of maturity. A well designed programme will develop the students personal skillsas well as their technical competence. The Department currently runs three sandwich course degrees and students on each of thesecourses will possibly require different kinds of experience. The Department will be veryhappy to discuss the objectives of the placement for each group and also to provide examplesof typical training programmes. WHAT SUPPORT WILL THE UNIVERSITY GIVE? The Department ensures the smooth running of student placements in several ways: Students are given careful pre-placement guidance to create a high level of awareness of what is expected of them in industry. The Department will nominate students to companies for their consideration. Members of the Industrial Training Office will help companies design suitable training programmes for the student. Students will be visited during their placement by their academic tutor. The tutor can be seen as a resource to help design and evaluate any project work in which the student is involved. Counselling ands support is available for the student throughout the period through the academic tutor or the Industrial Training team. Students are advised that as employees of the host company, they will be subject to the regulations and practices of their workplace. Students are reminded they are ambassadors of the University. The placements are an integral part of the course and they will be expected to bring high levels of commitment and performance to their host company. If students are involved in matters which the host company considers sensitive, confidentiality will be observed and discretion maintained. The Department provides three members of staff to support the placement scheme who are available to answer any queries. WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THE EMPLOYER? Prepare an agreed training programme for the student which should be made available to the University before the start of the placement. Appoint an industrial mentor to supervise and monitor the progress of the student and the training programme. Pay the student an agreed wage which should be sufficient for the student to meet all their expenses during industrial training. Where possible assist the student in finding suitable accommodation . The industrial mentor, and any other relevant people, should be available to report on the students progress to the student�s academic tutor when the tutor visits the student on placement. The tutor should also have the opportunity of speaking to the student on their own and also have the opportunity to see the areas where the student has been working. Provide a written report on the students progress at the end of the training period. WHEN ARE STUDENTS AVAILABLE? Students on the sandwich courses carry out a minimum of three and potentially four industrial training placements. The diagram below shows when students are available for placement. INTERESTED? WHAT NEXT? If you would like more information please contact our Industrial Training Office. We can be contacted via electronic mail at the following address: industrial.training@afnovell.reading.ac.uk If your WWW browser supports mail forms you can click on the address above to send a message now. If you are an employer and decide to offer training we will advertise your opportunity to the relevant group of students and arrange to send you CVs (or completed application forms if you prefer). You may then select those students you wish to interview. Interviews can be held either at your company or in the Department if this is more convenient. Some companies give short presentations to the sandwich course students describing their company and the placements and graduate opportunities that are available and invite applications from interested students. These presentations usually take place early in the Autumn Term and we would be happy to arrange one for you if you think this would be of benefit.

Robinson This Group is concerned with: (a) fundamental and applied aspects of thebeneficial uses of micro-organisms in food production; and (b) the survivalof pathogenic organisms when exposed to processing stresses Current research on food fermentations includes studies of synergistic orantagonistic interactions in mixed microbial populations, as well as therelationships between microbes and substrates in a variety of soya, cassavaand rice-based fermented foods. The major objective is to understand andrestrict the growth of pathogenic and/or spoilage organisms, to modify thetaste, texture and nutritional value of selected substrates. The influence of lactic acid bacteria, including probiotic species likeLactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, on theorganoleptic and nutritional properties of cheeses and fermented milks ofMiddle Eastern origin is the focus of an additional group of projects. The behaviour of food-borne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli,Listeria and Salmonella , in foods during processing and storageis examined with a view to understanding the nature of cell injury and repairat the molecular level, and developing appropriate detection/enumerationprocedures. The impact of environmental influences on the proliferation ofpathogenic organisms and the release of toxins within food systems is alsounder investigation.

These include enzymes for protein modification, the modificationand breakdown of pectins and yeast cell wall components and phenol oxidation.Work is in progress on free and immobilised enzymes and on behaviour of enzymesin solvents, in multiliquid systems, and in high-viscosity environments. Amongst novel potential applications for enzymes under examination are the useof phenol oxidase in new biotransformations such as L-dopa synthesis, and theuse of lytic glucanase for permeabilisation of yeast cell walls. Enzyme reactordesign studies include modelling of a fluidized bed reactor system for carryingout enzyme reactions in organic solvents. Downstream processing and Separation Processes This is an area of great challenge in biotechnology, and is a central area ofspecialisation. The work includes fundamental and applied aspects of a rangeof processses. Amongst current topics of interest are the mechanisms oftransport in liquid membranes and separation processes using "supported" liquidmembranes for the separation of organic acids and aqueous two-phase systems forthe separation of proteins. The effect of protein charge and hydrophobicity onthe partitioning of proteins in aqueous two-phase systems is being investigatedin order to develop mathematical correlations to predict partitioningbehaviour. Mass transfer and kinetic studies are also being carried out. Lytic enzyme systems for the controlled lysis of yeast cells are beinginvestigated as a means of obtaining the selective release of cell products,such as enzymes, intracellular recombinant proteins, and/or the fractionationof cellular substructures, such a glucan polymers and mitochondria. Also being examined is the separation of proteins using reverse micelles. Acomparative investigation of protein surface hydrophobicity in chromatography(HIC, RP-HPLC), precipitation and aqueous two-phase systems is being carriedout. Other areas of study are concerned with the comparative thermodynamics andeconomics of alternative separation processes and with the overall synthesisand design of protein separation schemes using expert systems. A database onphysico-chemical properties of proteins as well as mathematical correlationsfor separation operations is being generated to be used in the rational designof protein separation sequences. Bioprocess engineering including bioreactors and process modelling The design, control and optimisation of biochemical reactors entails anunderstanding of both the biochemistry and kinetics of the reactions and thephysical processes, such as mixing and mass transfer. Work on characterisingthe microenvironment that occurs in bioreactors, on the effects of mixing andon novel reactor designs and novel solid substrate systems is in progress.Biochemical studies include the control of the microbial synthesis ofbiodegradable thermoplastic polymers, the control of multi-productfermentations and the differentiation of plant cells in relation to theregeneration of whole plants from cells in submerged culture. The applicationof modern control theory and methods to optimise on-line control is of greatcurrent interest. Maximization of enzyme synthesis and production usingoptimized fed-batch cultures is being investigated. Research on themathematical modelling and microprocessor-based control of bioreactors anddownstream separations such as continuous adsorption recycle extraction isunderway. Amongst the studies on bioprocess modelling are included the sterilisation ofmulti-phase systems by the passage of electric currents (i.e. "ohmic heating"),which is being evaluated as an alternative to conventional heat treatmentprocesses, the behaviour of new pilot scale counter-current solid/liquidextractor and bioreactor, and selected membrane separation processes.

This can be achieved by developing newprocesses, or combining minimal processes. Current research is organised intotwo main themes: i Combination processes including irradiation are used to provideenhanced effects on shelf-life or microbiological safety while minimisingquality changes in the food. Projects include the study of the effects onlethality and survival of microorganisms in model systems and poultry meat, andthe effects of combination processing on the texture and flavour of fruit. ii Physical separation processes (e.g. membranes) can be used to replaceconventional chemical or high temperature methods. Research projects includethe utilisation of dairy fluids and the processing of legumes. Food Microbial Interactions Section (Coordinator: Dr J D Owens) This section is concerned with the beneficial uses of microorganisms in foodfermentations and in novel applications of microorganisms in foods. Thesection has two main interests, one dealing with the kinetics of microbialgrowth and the biochemical changes in solid substrate food fermentations andthe other with the basic physiology of lactic acid bacteria, particularly inrelation to their possible use as natural preservatives in non-fermentedfoods. The studies on traditional food fermentations aim to elucidate themicrobiological and biochemical changes in order to improve the traditionaltechnologies and develop new or modified products or processes. Currently weare working on tape (Indonesian, mildly alcoholic, soured and sweetened rice orcassava), tempe (moulded soyabeans) and the applications of the tempe processto African legumes, maize fermentation (Mexican pozol, African kenkey andmunkoyo). The work on lactic acid bacteria is investigating ways of using naturalfermentations or their products to restrict growth of pathogens and spoilageorganisms in foods. Our studies are concentrating on ways of directing themetabolism of lactic acid bacteria towards the production of inhibitorymetabolites and on ways of exploiting interaction between fermentation productsand normal food components in order to produce safer foods. Currently we have financial support from MAFF and NRI. Two research studentsare supported by their respective Indonesian and Mexican governments. Thermal Processing Section (Coordinator: Dr M J Lewis) The main thrust of this section is heat treatment and drying, the emphasisbeing on safety and quality. Heat treatment is concerned with the use of hightemperature short time processes for sterilisation, pasteurisation and cooking.A variety of well instrumented heat exchangers are available in the FoodStudies Building: plate, tubular, scraped surface, direct systems and anextruder. The quality aspects studied include flavour changes - volatileformation and losses and sensory characteristics. Other aspects are flowcharacteristics, residence time measurements, fouling behaviour, includingrapid tests for predicting fouling behaviour and on-line measurement offouling. The stability of UHT concentrates and the effects of composition,processing conditions and storage are being evaluated. Viscous materials arebeing studied on an HTST pasteuriser and emulsion stability on a scrapedsurface heat exchanger. On-line monitoring of quality aspects is also beinginvestigated. Studies in dehydration include mechanisms of heat and mass transfer inconvective drying and modelling for the prediction of drying time. A spoutedbed drier for liquids is being developed and evaluated. A novel toroidal bed drier is also under scrutiny and model systemsusing enzymes and vitamins to quantify the severity of drying processes arebeing developed. The latter project is financially supported by the EC FLAIRprogramme. Modelling and Control Section (Coordinator: Dr K Niranjan) As the food processing industries adopt modern technologies to meet increasingconsumer demands, there is a widely accepted need to develop mathematicalmodels which describe the effect of processing on food quality and safety.These models may be incorporated into computer software and used to design newprocesses which maximise safety and minimise quality loss. Alternatively,these models can also be used to control the operating variables of a runningprocess, and restrict their variation to within acceptable limits. Unlike the chemical industries which have benefitted enormously from modellingand computer aided design and control, these methodologies have not yet beenintensively applied to the food industries. The Modelling and Control Sectionof this research group is actively involved in developing computer models for(i) thermal processes (in-container as well as continuous aseptic) (ii)freezing and (iii) drying/dehydration, using fundamental principles of momentumheat and mass trasnfer. The research group has access to the University's mainframe computer system, SUN workstation, as well as users of several advancedsimulation software, for example ANSY(TM) and SPEED-UP(TM) (in collaboration withthe Biotechnology Research Group).

The consequences of food intake, including nutritional benefit andwholesomeness from both a microbiological and toxicological perspective isstudied. Food Acceptance Psychology The object is to investigate the determinants of consumer food choice behaviourby (i) identifying the principal context of use of a particular food and thendetermining the combination of product attributes and sensory characteristicsthat render it appropriate for use in thesse specific contexts. This involvesthe development of specialised psychological methods and mathematical modellingprocedures. In this respect, present research concentrates on the applicationof the repertory grid method for eliciting descriptions from consumers ofproduct-use contexts and attributes, on weighted hierachical modelling ofproduct attributes within contexts to predict brand product choices, and, as anadjunct to this, on the applications of behaviourally relevant criteria forsegmenting consumer populations. Sensory characteristics are primarilyresponsible for the pleasure derived from food at the point of consumption andhence are heavily implicated in food choice. For this reason, research is alsofocussed on the development and refinement of appropriate sensory methodologyand its application to food systems relevant to the overall researchprogramme. Physico-chemical determinants of sensory quality Since the sensory characteristics perceived when a food is consumed depend onboth food and consumer, physico-chemical investigation of the determinants ofsensory quality forms an intrinsic part of the food quality research programme.In heated foods the main flavour-forming reactions are the Maillard reactionbetween reducing sugars and amino compounds, and the thermal degradation oflipids. These reactions follow complex pathways, producing volatile andnon-volatile reactive intermediates. Thus an important aspect of the currentresearch programme involves investigation of the sensory characteristics ofaromas produced by the interaction of lipids with Maillard reaction products inselected model systems resembling fatty foods. The formation of colorants insuch systems is being studied in parallel. Attention is also focussed on thephysico-chemical properties of molecules which confer taste characteristics,particularly sweetness. Many recent studies have shown that texturalcharacteristics are important determinants of sensory quality. Since complexrelationships exist between the rheological propertites of foods and perceivedtexture, a new multidimensional approach has been implemented to study them. Wholesomeness and Safety This research programme aims to promote wholesomeness and safety in foodsthrough microbiological and toxicological control, through improving thenutritional quality of the diet, through consumer education, and through foodlaw. Microbiological research into the survival of food pathogens duringprocessing stress, seeks to understand the nature of injury and repair at themolecular level and develope appropriate isolation procedures. Research isalso directed towards environmental influences on the proliferation ofpathogenic organisms and the production of toxins in food systems.Toxicological research is aimed at the detection and quantification ofpesticide, herbicide and packaging residues in foods. Social nutritionresearch concentrates on developing procedures for determining the level ofconsumers' nutritional knowledge and, from this, deriving specially tailoredand targetted educational messages. Biochemical work aims to identifyparticular foods that could improve the nutritional quality of the diet.Special emphasis is placed on the influence of legumes (particularly bakedbeans) in lowering blood cholesterol levels. Research is also being undertakenon the formulation, implementation and influence of food law in the UK andEC. Go to FS&T home page.

The varied programme of courses and seminars were all well received by delegates and have helped FITR to rapidly establish a leading reputation in the field of food industry training. Our recent BSE seminar highlighted FITR's commitment to providing topical and timely seminars and illustrates the pace at which FITR can respond to industry needs (see page 3). Established courses such as A Practical Approach to HACCP and Getting Started in Sensory Evaluation were still extremely popular with high numbers of registered delegates, while our Hazards course had its best attendance to date. New courses including the UHT workshop ran with the maximum number of delegates and Auditing Quality and Safety Systems proved especially useful to those people who have set up HACCP systems. New courses are being developed at a rapid rate with input from our large number of client companies. A new three day course entitled An Introduction to Food Technology was held in April which provided delegates with a valuable insight into modern food technology. FITR is now registered by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene for basic food hygiene training and we expect to announce a series of such courses at both beginner and advanced levels later this year. To complement food hygiene training we are also developing a comprehensive range of food microbiology courses. Watch this space for further details. Other courses such as Marketing for Technical Managers (24-26 September 1996) will provide a unique opportunity for technical managers to get to grips with marketing. This course is the first which is designed to improve the Marketing / Technical interface within companies. If you would like to contribute to FITR's development programme please let us have your comments and ideas for new courses on the enclosed reply card. FITR aims to be industry reactive and to run courses not already routinely offered. News of these and regular updates will continue to appear in future issues of On Course. To make sure of regular updates on FITR courses, call our Training Centre Manager, Karen Masters on 0118 9318217, or via email at FITR@afnovell.reading.ac.uk An Introduction to HACCP - The fast way to learn HACCP HACCP has become such an important part of modern food manufacturing that a large proportion of technical personnel need to have a general understanding of the system, even if they are not directly responsible for HACCP implementation within their company. This course provides the ideal, intensive one day introduction to HACCP that delegates need if they are, for example, involved in quality or production. Participative exercises are used to illustrate the activities necessary to complete a HACCP study and the course gives an overview of the expertise required by HACCP team members. Delegates attending this course will also receive a course manual containing essential reference material. To complement FITR's choice of HACCP courses we are also offering a new video which will assist in-house HACCP training to the whole workforce. HACCP - How the System Works is a new and authoritative video which explains the principles of HACCP in an accessible and stimulating format while illustrating its role in the safe manufacture of food products. Aimed at managers and shop floor workers, the video is designed to provide a general understanding of HACCP and to emphasise the individual's role in the food manufacturing process. For further details, please contact RSSL's Customer Service Desk on 0800 243482. FITR Training Sponsorship FITR's sponsorship has helped Bernadette Baigrie to attend a two week training session recently in Canada. Bernadette is one of the UK's most promising young gymnasts and is a member of the under-12 national gymnastics squad. Overseas training is essential to the development of successful, world class gymnasts and FITRis delighted she was able to attend this important training programme. Bernadette recently competed in the Swansea International, a major event attracting senior gymnasts of the highest calibre. During May she will compete in the under-12 Camberley International and in June will represent Southern Region in an international competition in Italy. On Course will keep you informed of her progress. Seminar Updates on BSE Over 100 delegates attended a seminar on BSE run by FITR on February 29th. The seminar was held at a critical time for the meat industry, as subsequent events have proved. The latest information on the disease was presented by a panel of expert speakers, in a meeting chaired by Prof. Jeff Almond and Prof. David Ledward. A wealth of data was presented which indicated that beef is safe to eat, and that the risk of humans becoming infected by BSE is very very low. This remains the position despite the scare that followed in March. Commencing the meeting, Ray Bradley, formerly BSE Coordinator at the Central Veterinary Laboratory described the epidemiology of BSE, and presented the encouraging news that the epidemic is declining in response to the controls put in place. The main control has prohibited the use of ruminant protein in ruminant feeds. The ban on specified bovine offals was originally put in place to protect human health and extended in 1990 to protect all species of animal and bird. On the human health side, protection is additionally given by the compulsory slaughter and destruction of all cattle clinically suspected to have BSE. Describing the wider issues for the food industry, Mr Bradley told the meeting that the industry needed to be aware of the epidemiology of the disease and to know enough to be able to interpret data issued by MAFF. This will help processors to educate customers and address concerns. The industry needs to know the rules put in place to control BSE and follow them. Finally, the industry should not seek competitive advantage by making false or misleading statements about the safety of beef from different herds. All beef is equally safe, regardless of its source. However it is never possible to say all beef is entirely safe, just as it is never possible to give 100% guarantees about the safety of anything. Dr Chris Bostock of the Institute for Animal Health Compton then outlined the current understanding of the BSE agent. All spongiform encephalopathies are associated with an accumulation of an abnormal form of PrP protein. The normal form of the PrP protein is present in all mammalian species but little is known about its function in healthy animals. When abnormal PrP is purified from infected animals it has infectivity associated with it, leading to the idea that the abnormal protein on its own can interact with normal PrP to induce it to change to the abnormal form. This goes against conventional ideas of infectious agents and more research is needed to confirm or disprove the hypothesis. The gene coding for PrP has been identified in several species. In man (in which Creutzfeldt Jakobs Disease occurs) and sheep (in which scrapie occurs) mutations in the PrP gene are associated with differences in disease incidence and progression. No link has been found between changes in the gene and susceptibility or resistance to BSE in cattle. Knowledge of the PrP gene/scrapie relationship in sheep has led to the possibility of breeding for scrapie resistance in sheep. Dr David Taylor of the Institute for Animal Health's Neuropathogenesis Unit, Edinburgh described the resistance of the BSE agent to inactivation. Neither the BSE nor the scrapie agents are completely inactivated following treatment with sodium hydroxide. Sodium hypochlorite is the only chemical treatment known to be suitable for both. Autoclaving at conventional temperatures and pressure will not totally inactivate the BSE agent and it appears to be more thermostable than the scrapie agent. Neither is it completely inactivated by some standard rendering procedures. Ultimately avoidance of contamination is of prime importance, and where there is any chance that infected material is being handled, it is advisable to use disposable equipment where possible. Despite the results of scientific research indicating that BSE presents very little risk to human health, there is still widespread concern about the disease within the scientific and lay communities. Dr Tom Toomey of Ventress Technical Services Ltd presented some reasons for this, dealing in particular with the practicalities of handling beef carcasses. He also referred to the wide suspicion that exists of governmental agencies, the food industry, and the difficulty the general population has in interpreting scientific data. These factors, and generally poor communication of the actual risks associated with the disease, had all contributed to the mistrust. The fact that BSE appears to be infectious in a way unlike conventional infectious diseases also increases the alarm. Keith Anderson then gave an update on the position statement of the IFST. This is generally regarded as offering an accurate and independent account of the known facts about BSE. Using the latest available data, Mike Sloyan of the Meat and Livestock Commission described the impact that BSE had had on the market. Prior to Christmas 1995, adverse publicity resulted in a drop in beef sales, especially in retail markets. Retail sales fell by 15-17% compared with the previous year. By mid January, the market was showing signs of recovery, but was still down 12% on last year. Nonetheless these figures demonstrated that the vast majority of consumers had always accepted the safety of beef and there were signs that those who had not were returning to the market. This concluded the seminar. Whilst the the latest scare has knocked beef sales again, the recovery seen during January might offer some hope to the beef industry that market confidence can recover once more. Profile Tracey Sanderson is responsible for RSSL's Sensory Evaluation services and has developed a series of very successful sensory evaluation courses for FITR.

Tracey has a first class honours degree in Food Science and Technology from the University of Reading and worked for the Leatherhead Food Research Association before joining RSSL in 1990. New courses Making Sense of Marketing Marketing is no longer a term that is used to describe a company's promotional activity but has become a core part of business strategy within the food industry. It covers nearly all aspects of a company's business and, to be effective, should involve everyone in an organisation. A better understanding of marketing improves communication throughout a company and helps to ensure that everyone has common aims and objectives. Technical personnel, in particular, have the difficult role of interfacing effectively with marketing departments and implementing the reality of strategic plans. Developing and launching successful products in the food industry has never been easy and often depends on effective team work between technical departments and marketing personnel. This course is designed to bridge the gap between marketing and technical functions so that ultimately companies can be more productive and effective in the highly competitive food market. This intensive three day course provides an authoritative introduction to the marketing of fast- moving consumer goods. It covers all aspects of the marketing mix including product strategy, branding and promotion as well as looking at the increasingly important roles of packaging, distribution and retailing. Combined with practical case studies, this course provides an essential training package in marketing which will benefit all layers of management. An introduction to marketing provides: an introduction to marketing principles a guide to better understanding between technical and marketing professionals an overview of marketing tools and strategy an insight into branding, pricing and packaging practical case study exercises understanding of distribution and retailing If you would like further details please contact Karen Masters on 0118 931 8217 or return the reply envelope for a course leaflet. Customer Complaints - A food industry perspective Customer complaint management has progressed at a rapid pace over the last five years. This seminar looks at some of these changes and presents the latest developments in complaint management. Vince-Wayne Mitchell, a leading researcher in the field, will discuss findings from his extensive survey into complaints in the food industry. He will also examine the psychology of customer complaining. A retailers perspective will provide an overview of their procedures and systems for dealing with complaints.

Noble, M., J. and Varley, J. Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Group, Department of Food Science and Technology, The University of Reading, Whiteknights, PO BOX 226, Reading. RG6 6AP. Abstract. Colloidal gas Aphrons (CGA's) are suspensions of micron sized bubbles, 10-100mm in diameter created by rapid stirring of a surfactant solution. They are composed of a gaseous inner core, surrounded by a shell of surfactant molecules. It is thought that the inner surfactant shell of the aphron surrounds the gaseous phase, and a second, outer surfactant shell, encapsulates the inner shell with a water phase. That phase is separate from the bulk phase water. The aphrons have a high degree of stability conferred upon them by these shells, also, because of their small size, they also have a large surface to volume ratio. Creation of aphrons is achieved by stirring a surfactant solution at speeds of 5000-10000 rpm using a Silverson homogenizer with a high shear rate impeller. The disk is surrounded by a rigid baffles which serves to redirect waves, created by the spinning disk, into the water, creating small bubbles. Once rotating above the minimum speed, the CGA bubbles are produced very rapidly. CGA�s can be used for the purification of proteins by mixing of the aphron solution with a protein solution . Ionic interactions occur between charged groups on the protein, and charges on the surfactant molecules within the aphrons. These interactions can be optimized by adjusting the pH of the protein solution, which will alter the charge on the protein molecules, and by varying the type of surfactant used, e.g. anionic or cationic surfactants. The use of ionic surfactants for purification of proteins in this manner may lead to damage or denaturation of the protein, and therefore may not be suitable for the purification of active peptides, and therefore a non-ionic surfactants (Tween and Tergitol) are used for protein purification. Non-Ionic surfactants interact with the protein mainly by hydrophobic interactions, and it is therefore hoped that purification of active proteins can be achieved in this way. Preliminary results will be presented for protein purification using this method.

Following postdoctoralstudies at both the Universities of London and Reading, she was a Lecturer atSouth Bank Polytechnic, London, before returning to Reading as a Lecturer in1987. She is currently a Reader in the Department. Research Interests Research deals with the chemistry underlying flavour and colour development infoods, especially the Maillard reaction, and the effects of processing andsubsequent storage on flavour and colour development. Major highlights are asfollows. The Maillard reaction The Maillard reaction takes place when food components like reducing sugars andamino acids react together and occurs in most foods on heating. Research dealswith factors affecting the reaction and how it may be optimised andcontrolled. Read about bout the 6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE MAILLARD REACTION Colour Studies on the coloured reaction products are supported by the BBSRC. Work onaqueous systems has revealed major differences in the reaction product profileon heating with and without pH control. Several compounds have been isolatedand analysed. Work on systems of intermediate moisture content heated byextrusion cooking or in a reaction cell (which mimics most of the conditionsencountered during extrusion cooking and which was specially designed for theproject), has shown that decreasing moisture content and increasingtemperature, time or pH all increase colour development. Flavour Research on flavour is supported by MAFF, a Teaching Company Scheme and thefood industry. Recent studies on Maillard flavour compounds have shown theimportant role played by pH in affecting the profile of volatile reactionproducts. The implications of modifying food processing conditions or usingnovel food processes, such as high pressure processing and microwave heating,are of particular interest. Meat flavour Work has involved the study of model systems, especially those based onthiamine, and real meat. At the moment, a project on lamb flavour is beingcompleted. Interest lies in establishing the compounds responsible for specificmeaty notes and how levels of these compounds can be optimised by, e.g.,cooking conditions. Flavour of fruits and vegetables The flavour compounds of various less common fruits and vegetables have beenstudied, e.g. starfruit, scorzonera, celeriac and okra. The effects ofprocessing on flavour are of interest. Flavour of fermented foods The study of fermentation as a method for preserving various foods is animportant area for the Department and this is another area of involvement. All my research deals with the chemistry underlying flavour andcolour development in foods, especially the Maillard reaction. I showoutstanding dedication to my own research and to that of my research team whichnumbers 12 members (3 postdoctoral research) Teaching Acitivities The Maillard reaction and caramelisation; minor food components, instrumentalanalysis.

This list provides a guide to some important and useful references on various aspects of the topic. It is not intended to be comprehensive, only an introduction to some of the main sources of information. The list contains the following headings: United Kingdom European Aspects International Aspects Food Additives Miscellaneous (including other countries) Many books on specific aspects of food science and technology include chapters on legal aspects and can be useful sources of more detailed information. However, students should realise that legislation is constantly being modified and therefore always check the date of publication of a book or paper. In addition to books, journals can be useful sources of current thinking. For the UK and some aspects of the EC, students should consult the 'British Food Journal' which contains major articles and shorter news items of interest. For the USA, 'Food Technology' usually contains articles and information. Other useful journals are 'Food Policy' and 'Food Control'.

It was adopted by the Council on 9/10 December but has not yet been published in the OJ. However MAFF wishes to amend the UK Regulations as rapidly as possible and is therefore pressing ahead with formal consultation. The Regulations take into account recent technical developments in the sweeteners market by extending the use of sweeteners already permitted to certain additional categories of food. Certain technical provisions are also added to bring the controls more into line with the controls on colours and miscellaneous additives. They also have replaced the food category �vitamins and dietary preparations� by the title: �Food supplement/diet integrators based on vitamins and/or mineral elements, syrup-type or chewable� which, state MAFF will reflect more closely the needs of the market. The Guidance Notes produced by MAFF will also be revised to take account of the changes and a draft will be circulated. MAFF have requested comments on the draft regulations by 28 February 1997. 15 January 1997 Scottish Outbreak of E. coli 0157: Statement by the Secretary of State for Scotland House of Commons - on the "Interim Report and Priority Recommendations" made by the "Pennington Group" The following is an extract from the Statement made in the House of Commons on 15 January 1997. The Pennington Group (Chaired by Professor Pennington) is conducting a review of various issues following the outbreak of E. coli 0157 in Scotland which has resulted in 17 deaths (as at 16.1.97). They have published an Interim report. The following extract from the statement is that part which relates directly to the legislative provisions. The whole statement and the Interim Report are available on the Scottish Office WWW pages. "On enforcement, Professor Pennington makes several recommendations. Existing arrangements on food hygiene are based on EU Directives, brought into force by Regulations under the Food Safety Act 1990. The Codes of Practice under the Act were widely consulted upon and laid before this House. Professor Pennington recommends urgent consideration of the legislation and action through licensing to ensure that equivalent standards of hygiene apply to premises principally selling to the final consumer as to those premises subject to the Meat Products (Hygiene) Regulations. He also recommends urgent action to ensure the physical separation of raw and cooked meat products using separate counters, refrigerated equipment and separate staff. Pending the outcome of consideration of the legislation he recommends that the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food should be asked to review its guidance on cross contamination. I have asked them to do so. These recommendations have far reaching implications. I have instructed my officials to examine the practical implications of these recommendations and in doing so to consult consumers, health professionals, environmental health officers, processors and retailers. It would be helpful to Professor Pennington to have more detailed information on the practical aspects. With this in mind, I have therefore asked the Meat and Livestock Commission - the Government's statutory advisers on the industry - to carry out an urgent study of these issues, so that Professor Pennington can take this into account in his final report. Professor Pennington makes three recommendations in respect of the Codes of Practice under the Food Safety Act 1990, all of which my colleagues and I are accepting. First they recommend a review of Code of Practice 16 which relates to the Food Hazard Warning System. This system, operated by the Government, is to warn Environmental Health Departments of possible or actual food hazards on the basis of information from other areas. Professor Pennington concludes that the difficulty here for the food authority is setting the balance between dealing with routine matters at local level, and advising central Government of emerging problems. As Code of Practice 16 is presently written, the decision to notify central Government is a judgement made locally. He suggests it may be better to define an 'isolated incident' as one which is contained within the boundaries of the food authority. It should however be incumbent upon that authority to notify central Government the moment they have evidence that food distribution is beyond the local authority boundary. It would also be essential to retain the 'major local incident' provision so that central Government is informed immediately even if the problem is contained within the authority's area, but involves a significant number of people; or an organism such as E.coli 0157 or a problem such as botulism is involved. Allied to this is a recommendation that the code should place greater emphasis on risk and the assessment of all factors relevant to the protection of public health. This key addition would cover such matters as the virulence of the organism, the extent of distribution of the food, the vulnerability of the consumer group and the confidence which could be attached to product recall. The revision would make clear that careful assessment of the risk involved is fundamental to informing decisions on the ground. Professor Pennington also recommends a review of Code of Practice No.9 which relates to food hygiene inspections, to ensure better targeting of resources on high risk premises. I accept all of these recommendations. Good lines of communication from local to central Government and timely release by local outbreak control teams of information to the public are crucial, as the paramount consideration must always be the protection of public health. Similarly I agree that there should be careful targeting of resources on the high risk premises. This guidance for enforcement officers will be reflected in the revised Codes of Practice which will go out to consultation shortly. Professor Pennington makes observations on the potential for cross-contamination in slaughterhouses focusing specifically on the slaughtering of cattle in a clean condition. My Department is pursuing this issue with the Meat Hygiene Service who are well advanced in preparing practical guidance on the definition of acceptable standards of cleanliness in animals presented for slaughter. Hazard Analysis improves food safety by focusing on critical points in the preparation and handling of food. Professor Pennington therefore recommends that the implementation of these requirements be accelerated particularly for high risk premises which handle raw and cooked foods. I agree. My Department will urge Environmental Health Departments to take early action on it, so that Hazard Analysis covers all high risk premises in their area as soon as possible. Finally on enforcement, Professor Pennington recommends, in the longer term, a review of the health risk condition contained in the Food Safety Act 1990, which governs among other matters the actions taken by Environmental Health Officers in emergencies. The key question is whether the present position unreasonably inhibits Environmental Health Officers for example in taking decisions under the emergency prohibition provisions in Section 12 of the Act, to close down premises merely on suspicion of connection with an outbreak. I have asked my officials to examine the practical operation of the emergency powers available to EHOs as a matter of urgency and in doing so to consult with consumers, health professionals, environmental health officers, processors and retailers." MAFF Press Release, 14 January 1997 Clearance for Riboflavin Produced from GMO The Government has accepted the advice of the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) that food safety clearance should be given to riboflavin derived from genetically modified (GM) Bacillus subtilis using fermentation technology. The B. subtilis was modified using both classical genetics to deregulate the synthesis of riboflavin and genetic modification techniques to change the regulatory sequences for the genes that code for the enzymes involved in the synthesis of riboflavin. in order to increase the yield of the vitamin. The riboflavin (vitamin B2) which is identical to that produced by traditional chemical means, will be used to fortify processed foods such as breakfast cereals and soft drinks. Copies of the full ACNFP report on riboflavin derived from genetically modifed (GM) Bacillus subtilis using fermentation technology are available free of charge from the ACNFP Administrative Secretariat, Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, Room 239c, Ergon House c/o Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3JR. DHSS Letter (NI), 9 January 1997 Review of the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984 The Ministry (MAFF) has issued a discussion paper on the review of the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984. The declared aim of the review is to slim down and simplify the Regulations as far as possible retaining only those provisions which are considered essential to ensure consumer protection and to allow the consumer to make a free but informed choice wherever possible. This is part of the Government's commitment to review the Regulations as contained in the Government's Food Law Deregulation Plan (Autumn 1993) which initiated a process of revision, simplification and consolidation of food law to remove unnecessary burdens on business, improve competitiveness and increase consumer choice. The discussion paper is 16 pages long and the following are the main points mentioned: Objectives: It is stated that: "The Government is anxious that compositional regulations should not contain too much detail or be unnecessarily prescriptive and is particularly concerned to avoid overlap or duplication with other legislation, for example on matters already covered by horizontal EC Directives (e.g. on labelling, including the new 'QUID' provisions, and on colours or additives). The Government therefore wishes to retain only such simplified provisions as are essential to ensure consumers are not defrauded or put at risk, or which may significantly help prevent public anxiety and confusion in relation to meat and meat products." Spreadable fish products: " ... in the absence of a clear need for specific regulations to cover these products, the Government proposes, in the interest of simplification and deregulation, to revoke those parts of the 1984 Regulations concerned with spreadable fish products." Definition of meat content: The paper discusses whether a revised definition of meat is needed. It then proposes the following revised definition "'meat' means striated muscle tissue, and may include the fat, skin, rind, gristle and sinew in amounts naturally attached to and closely associated with, or part of, the muscle used, of any animal or bird which is normally used for human consumption, and which includes any part of the carcase specified in Part 1 of Schedule 2 which is obtained from such animal or bird, but does not include any other part of the carcase." Declaration of Meat Content: The present requirement is likely to be retained although amended since they specify calculating meat content as a fraction of the final product weight, rather than on the basis of the inputs at the "mixing bowl" stage as required under 'QUID'. Added Water: The discussion paper appears to suggest that sufficient information will be available to consumers as a result of 'QUID'. It states "The Government would only wish to consider retaining a simplified requirement for added water declaration if the consumer would not be provided with adequate information by some other means." Lean Meat: The 1984 Regulations have a definition of "lean meat content". The Government has not yet come to a final view about the need to retain such a concept but three options are presented. Reserved Descriptions: The paper indicates that the Government is minded to revoke all but 3 of the present 20 reserved descriptions. The 3 remaining would be for "burger", "sausage" and "pie" but in all cases there would be a simplification of the requirements. Mechanically Recovered Meat (MRM): MRM is regarded as meat but it is already agreed that it should be separately declared in an ingredients list. A definition of MRM is proposed for inclusion in the revised Regulations: mechanically recovered meat means meat which has been obtained by mechanical means and had been passed through a fine mesh such that its cellular structure has been broken down and as such it flows in puree form. The paper is for discussion but it indicates that new legislative proposals will be prepared for consultation in the first half of 1997 with a view to implementation by 1 January 1998. Scottish Office Letter, 8 January 1997 Revision of "Use By" Guidance Notes As previously noted (See 20 September 1996), the Ministry had been revising the "Use By" Guidance Notes following the updating of the Food Labelling Regulations in July 1996. A final version of the guidance notes has now been prepared and is available. The letter notes that the changes, as a result of comments: clarify the text and improve its presentation; clarify when a "use by" date expires (midnight on the date given in the use by date, not midnight of the day before); give additional guidance on when "use by" dates can be altered or removed; give additional information about the range of foods exempt from date marking; and explain the advisory role of local authorities. Apparently during the consultation exercise, some respondents sought specific definitions for terms such as "highly perishable", "immediate danger" and "short period of time". The letter comments that these terms are used without definition in the Food Labelling Directive (79/112/EC) and it would be difficult and inappropriate to insert such definitions in the guidance notes. Copies of the guidance notes can be obtained from the Ministry (MAFF, Food Labelling and Standards Division, Room 325d, Ergon House, c/o Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3JR). MAFF Letter, 16 December 1996 Functional Foods and Health Claims - FAC Preliminary Conclusions The Food Advisory Committee has been considering functional foods and health claims and has reached some preliminary conclusions on which it would welcome further comments. The preliminary conclusions are given below but were circulate with some "Draft Guidelines on Health Claims on Foodstuffs". A copy of these can be obtained from the Ministry (Contact the Ministry on 0171-238 6281). The FAC has concluded: The market for functional foods in the UK is at present very small in the overall context of food sales, although it may be becoming significant in the yoghurt sector. Many of the health claims being made are unspecific "feel good" statements; some are linked to official recommendations and others are based on data exclusively held by those making the claims; some contain references to disease and may be misleading the consumer. Evidence of how consumers react to such claims is needed and some quantitative data will be available in the New Year. The approaches of other countries to regulation in this area are varied but it is noteworthy that most EU member states rely on the same legislative controls as already pertain in the UK supplemented in a few countries with guidelines. The FAC wishes to have further views on whether the UK should follow a similar route on the basis of draft guidelines or whether the main elements of the draft guidelines should be incorporated into further statutory rules o health claims. There also appears to be a need for advice to be available to companies and enforcement officers on health claims and the FAC suggests that these needs are met by trade associations and LACOTS establishing advisory services for their members, as is already done by ASA, PAGB and other bodies. The FAC invites comments on other options for assessing health claims The FAC has seen no convincing evidence for the need for pre-market approval of functional foods beyond the controls which already exist or will be implemented shortly on novel foods and additives. The Ministry has invited comments on these preliminary conclusions and on the draft guidelines on health claims. Comments are requested before 31 March 1997. MAFF Information Bulletin No 80, 1 December 1996 Food Contact Materials The Plastic Materials and Articles in Contact with Food (Amendment)(No 2) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2817) were laid before Parliament on 18 November and will come into force on 1 January 1997. These Regulations, which are made under the Food Safety Act 1990, implement Directive 96/11/EC. The Regulations amend the positive and "temporarily approved" lists of substances which can be used in the manufacture of food contact plastics. MAFF Letter, 3 December 1996 Draft "Foods Intended for Use in Energy Restricted Diets for Weight Reduction Regulations 1997" Following the adoption by the European Community of Commission Directive 96/8 on energy restricted diets for weight reduction, the Ministry has now issued draft regulations to implement the Directive. Implementation has to be by 30 September 1997 with a transition until 31 March 1999. The Draft Regulations contain: A definition of "relevant food" - specially formulated food intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction, being food which complies with the compositional requirements in Schedule 1 and which, when used as instructed by the manufacturer, replaces: (a) the whole of the total daily diet; or (b) one or more meals of the daily diet. Restrictions on the name of the food and compositional requirements - No person shall sell any relevant food under any name other than "total diet replacement for weight control" or "meal replacement for weight control" as appropriate. No person shall sell any food using the names in a) unless it is a "relevant food". Labelling requirements - The Regulations specify the information which has to be given on the label. Weight loss claim - No person shall sell any relevant food the labelling, advertising or presentation of which refers to the rate or amount of weight loss which may result from its use or to a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety. Packaging - All components of a relevant food intended as a replacement for the whole of the daily diet must be contained in the same package. Transitional Defence - It is a defence to prove that an act contrary to the requirements of the Regulations was committed before 31 March 1999 There are 2 Schedules relating to composition: Schedule 1 indicates the "Essential Composition of Relevant Foods" including energy, protein, fat, dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals. Schedule 2 provides the "Amino Acid Requirement Pattern" and is referred to in Schedule 1 under protein. The Ministry has asked for comments by 28 February 1997 MAFF Letter, 3 December 1996 Draft "Processed Cereal-Based Foods and Baby Foods for Infants and Young Children Regulations 1997" Following the adoption by the European Community of Commission Directive 96/5 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children, the Ministry has now issued draft regulations to implement the Directive. Implementation has to be by 30 September 1997 with a transition until 31 March 1999. The Draft Regulations contain: Definitions - Baby foods: foods for particular nutritional use fulfilling the particular requirements of infants and young children in good health and intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food other than processed cereal-based foods. Processed cereal-based foods: foods for particular nutritional use with the categories in part 1 of Schedule 1 [see below] fulfilling the particular requirements of infants and young children in good health and intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food. Other definitions are as in the Directive - this will include "infants" as being children under the age of 12 months and "young children" as being aged between 1 and 3 years Exemptions: The Regulations do not apply to any food which is a milk intended for young children Labelling: The Regulations specify the requirement for labelling of processed cereal-based food and baby food Manufacture and composition: No person shall manufacture any processed cereal-based food or baby food: from any ingredient other than one whose suitability for particular nutritional use by infants and young children has been established by generally accepted scientific data; which does not comply with the compositional requirements specified in the schedules; which contains any added nutritional substance other than a nutritional substance listed in Schedule 4; which contains any substance in such quantity as to endanger the health of infants or young children. Transitional Defence - It is a defence to prove that an act contrary to the requirements of the Regulations was committed before 31 March 1999. There are 5 Schedules relating to composition: Schedule 1 relates to cereal-based foods for infants and young children. It includes the categories of such foods: simple cereals which are or have to be reconstituted with milk or other appropriate nutritious liquids. cereals with an added high protein food which are or have to be reconstituted with water or other protein-free liquid. pastas which are to be used after cooking in boiling water or other appropriate liquids. rusks and biscuits which are to be used either directly or after pulverisation with the addition of water or other suitable liquids. It also includes the essential composition of the foods relating to cereal content, protein, carbohydrates, fat, minerals and vitamins Schedule 2 provides the essential composition of Baby Foods relating to protein, fat, sodium and vitamins Schedule 3 provides reference data on the amino acid of casein (to be used in conjunction with Schedule 1) Schedule 4 lists nutritional substances permitted for addition to the controlled foods Schedule 5 provides "Reference values for nutrition labelling for food intended for infants and young children" and relates to vitamins and minerals The Ministry has asked for comments by 28 February 1997.

The following are examples of court cases involving food. It is based on information available to David Jukes from a number of different sources. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE. THEY ARE NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT IMPORTANT CASES. The items are listed on the basis of the piece of legislation concerned in the case. The following headings are given below Food Safety Act 1990 Section 7 Section 8 Section 14 Section 15 Trade Descriptions Act 1968 Section 1 Food Safety Act 1990 - Section 7 7 (1) Any person who renders any food injurious to health by means of any of the following operations, namely - (a) adding any article or substance to the food; (b) using any article or substance as an ingredient in the preparation of the food; (c) abstracting any constituent from the food; and (d) subjecting the food to any other process or treatment, with intent that it shall be sold for human consumption, shall be guilty of an offence. No cases are known which have used Section 7. It is difficult to bring prosecutions and in nearly every case where it might be used, it is much simpler for a case to be brought under Regulations rather than the general power of Section 7. Return to top of page Food Safety Act 1990 - Section 8 8 (1) Any person who - (a) sells for human consumption, or offers, exposes or advertises for sale for such consumption, or has in his possession for the purpose of such sale or of preparation for such sale; or (b) deposits with, or consigns to, any other person for the purposes of such sale or of preapration for such sale, any food whcih fails to comply with food safety requirements shall be guilty of an offence. 8 (2) For the purposes of this Part food fails to comply with food safety requirements if - (a) it has been rendered injurious to health by means of any of the operations mentioned in Section 7(1) above; (b) it is unfit for human consumption; or (c) it is so contaminated (whether by extraneous matter or otherwise) that it would not be reasonable to expect it to be used for human consumption in that state; and references to such requirements or to food complying with such requirments shall be construed accordingly. Listeria in Lanark Blue Cheese The Food Safety Act 1990 contains the requirement that food must comply with food safety requirements (Section 8(1)). The definition of food safety requirements is then given (in Section 8(2)) and includes the requirement that food must not be "unfit for human consumption" (Section 8(2)(b)). If food is considered unfit, then it fails to satisfy the food safety requirements and a prosecution can then result. Section 9 contains the provisions which allow for inspection and seizure of food. In Section 9(1) inspection is permitted and if, as a result of the inspection, it appears that the food fails to comply with food safety requirements, additional actions are permitted. Section 9(3) allows the seizure of the food and Section 9(6) provides for the inspectors to apply to a court for an order for the food to be condemned and disposed of if the court is convinced that the food does not satisfy the food safety requirements. If the court refuses to condemn the food, under Section 9(7) compensation shall be paid for the depreciation in the value of the food. This case related to an application for a condemnation order following finding of listeria in Lanark Blue Cheese. Initial concern arose when, as a result of a survey of soft cheeses by Edinburgh District Council some contamination was found. The Council informed the Scottish Office Department of Agriculture and Fisheries who subsequently informed Clydesdale District Council since the cheese is manufactured in their District. The cheese is made from unpasteurised ewes' milk by Mr Errington trading as H J Errington and Co. Further samples were then taken by both Edinburgh and Clydesdale District Councils and results indicated that 24 out of 25 samples contained Listeria monocytogenes with high colony counts. Clydesdale District Council discussed the results with Mr Errington who initially agreed to voluntarily withdraw the product because of the contamination. The Council then issued a press release and the Scottish Office issued a food hazard warning relating to the cheese in December 1994. In January 1995, Mr Errington withdrew his voluntary agreement and the Council then instituted formal proceedings. On the 6th February 1995, 50 samples were taken and sent for analysis at the Scottish Agricultural College. On the basis of the results, the Council applied for the cheese to be condemned since, in their view the results indicated high levels of Listeria monocytogenes which rendered the food unfit for human consumption. The initial application to a Justice of the Peace led to an order for the cheese to be condemned. A subsequent Judicial Review hearing held that Mr Errington had been denied natural justice at the hearing and ordered that the matter be taken before a Sheriff. The Application was therefore held before the Sheriff of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway, J Douglas Allan, at the Court in Lanark. Evidence was heard over a period of 19 days between 14th August and 31 October 1995 with judgment being given on the 5 December. The Sheriff refused to grant the order and ruled that the 44 batches of Lanark Blue cheese did not fail to comply with food safety requirements. During the case, 26 witnesses were called and 253 productions (documents, etc) were provided to the Court. To avoid a detailed argument on the drafting of the legislation, Counsel for both parties in the case, Clydesdale District Council (the Applicants) and Mr Errington (the Respondents), came to an understanding. They agreed that for the purposes of the application, food is "unfit for human consumption" within the meaning of Section 8 of the Food Safety Act 1990 if it is, or is likely to be, injurious to health. Two main issues arose during the hearing: 1) Were the results upon which the Council based its application correct? and 2) Were the actual levels of Listeria monocytogenes in the cheese such as to make the food injurious to health? 1) The Test Results The Council had sent samples to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) where these were analysed in February 1995. All 50 samples were analysed and Listeria monocytogenes was detected in all samples, with counts ranging from 10/g to 5.1 million /g. Four of the staff of the SAC gave evidence on behalf of the applicants. The Respondents submitted samples to a different laboratory (Analytical Services Centre (Food Park) Ltd). Their results were significantly lower with, in some cases nil/g being found and, in several others, less that 100/g. In his ruling, the Sheriff listed several points which led him to conclude that the results from the Scottish Agricultural College were not credible and therefore could not be relied upon. These included the following: a) Evidence from a French cheesemaker that if Listeria monocytogenes was present in the unpasteurised ewes' milk which was subject to Mr Errington's processes, one could expect only the presence or survival of the organism, but no multiplication. Thus the very high counts would have come from milk with high counts. At the levels detected in the cheese, the Sheriff concluded that there would have been signs of problems in the flock and/or the milk - he was satisfied that there were no such signs. b) The apparent very great inconsistency of the results for the Lanark Blue cheese from the SAC which the Sheriff decided could not be explained on the basis of the raw material and the manufacturing process. Mr Errington also produces another cheese (Dunsyre Blue) from cows' milk in the same processing area. Contact between cheeses and transfer of some cheese material was considered inevitable. However, Listeria monocytogenes had not been found in the Dunsyre Blue cheeses. The Sheriff considered that, if there had been high levels of Listeria monocytogenes in the Lanark Blue cheese, then it would have affected the Dunsyre Blue. c) Some problems with the procedures used at the SAC including the lack of a positive control through the spiral plater machine immediately before the tests, the lack of a negative control after the tests, and certain doubts relating to the adequacy of the sterilisation of the spiral plater machine between samples. d) Conflict between the reported finding that all suspect colonies which were seen during the SAC tests proved to be Listeria monocytogenes whereas evidence from Analytical Services Centre indicated that other species were present (in one case Listeria monocytogenes represented only 61%). Although the Applicants in cross-examination attempted to cast doubt on the Analytical Services Centre results, the Sheriff concluded that all of their results which were referred to in evidence were reliable and accurate. b) Is the Cheese Injurious to Health? The question before the Court was to decide if the eating of Lanark Blue cheese is, or is likely to be, injurious to health. The Sheriff indicated that this really led to the question as to whether all strains of Listeria monocytogenes are pathogenic or must be regarded as pathogenic. In the final submission to the Court by the Applicants, it was accepted that not all strains of Listeria monocytogenes are pathogenic. However, the evidence presented to the Court concerned the secondary issue of whether all strains of Listeria monocytogenes must be regarded as pathogenic. The Sheriff stated that "this was the subject of much evidence, some of which was speculative and indeed contradictory". The Applicants called Dr McLauchlin (clinical scientist and Head of Food Hygiene Reference Unit at Public Health Laboratory Service) as their main witness relating to this issue. The Sheriff however was not convinced by the evidence he provided. In his judgment, the Sheriff noted that the witness was not able to say and did not attempt to say that the consumption of Lanark Blue cheese is likely to cause illness. The Sheriff pointed to 3 reasons mentioned by Dr McLauchlin as to why all strains of Listeria monocytogenes should be regarded as potentially dangerous: a) It was indicated that all serovars (except one) have been implicated in cases of human listeriosis. However, the Sheriff also heard evidence indicating that the use of serovars to classify different forms of the micro-organism had been largely superseded by alternative methods which indicated that basing conclusions on serovars was an unsatisfactory means of assessing pathogenicity. b) It was indicated that the risk of death in patients infected by different serovars is the same regardless of serovar. The Sheriff dismissed this reason when he concluded that the data upon which the statement was made related to serovars and not strains and that the statistical data was therefore insufficient to be able to say anything of significance. c) It was indicated that the majority of strains of Listeria monocytogenes were virulent. This the Sheriff discounted since there was conflicting evidence as to how many strains of the micro-organism actually exist. Dr McLauchlin in Court suggested 50-100 strains, in a report he had written he had indicated more than 500, in a report of a single experiment reference was made to 125 different strains in that experiment alone, and that an expert called by the Respondents suggested that there must be thousands of identified strains and hundreds of phage types. The definition of strain was therefore important but the Sheriff was unclear as to the definition used by Dr McLauchlin - he hence found it difficult to accept the contention by Dr McLauchlin that the majority of strains were virulent. The Sheriff also noted that the experiments used by Dr McLauchlin to support his view were not actually conducted to assess virulence of all strains but had been based on a selected set of strains. It could not therefore be determined what the result would have been if all strains had been tested. The Sheriff noted that "pathogenicity" required three components: transmissibility from one host to another, infectivity where the organism overcomes the new host's defences, and virulence whereby the organism harms the host. The Sheriff was not satisfied with the suggestion that the strain of Listeria monocytogenes in the cheese was potentially pathogenic since it produced a certain toxin. Although the Sheriff accepted that the production of the toxin was necessary for pathogenicity other factors were also necessary. Other evidence relating to pathogenicity often failed to take all factors into account and could not therefore be relied upon to indicate true pathogenicity for humans In summary therefore the Sheriff did not accept that the evidence was sufficient to take a decision on whether the consumption of the strains of Listeria monocytogenes found in Lanark Blue would , if eaten, cause harm. He stated that "the evidence does not support the claim that all strains of Listeria monocytogenes should be regarded as potentially dangerous - and hence likely to be injurious to health." Finally, in support of this conclusion, the Sheriff considered the epidemiological evidence. There was no evidence that any person had suffered any illness related to the consumption of Lanark Blue. It was thought that 63,000 portions of the cheese must have been consumed and that no illness had been reported despite the publicity given to it. Although the Applicants suggested that the sample size was insufficient, no evidence was presented to the Sheriff to indicate that this was the case and he therefore reject the submission which he stated "seems to be contrary to common sense". Other Issues The Sheriff considered the context in which the judgement had to be made. He noted that some witnesses had advocated a policy which was close to a zero tolerance (as imposed by the United States of America and Switzerland). However this had not been incorporated by the Government in the Food Safety Act 1990 Indeed, the Chief Medical Officer had in February 1989 and December 1992 issued letters indicating that the risks of consuming Listeria monocytogenes could be addressed adequately from the public health point of view by warning those considered to be at risk. No attempt was made to ban the product concerned. He also noted that Government policy requires that "Enforcement actions should be based on risk assessment and public health judgements, not on end product testing alone." No evidence suggested that the Applicants had conducted a risk assessment. However the Respondents had asked Dr North (a self-employed food safety advisor) to conduct such an assessment and he had concluded that there was no evidence which reliably confirmed that the Lanark Blue cheese sampled would be harmful to humans if consumed, and was therefore unfit for human consumption. The Sheriff therefore concluded that the application for condemnation should be granted. He noted that this would permit the provisions relating to compensation to apply and that he was satisfied that none of the batches of cheese could be sold given the time the case had taken - they were therefore of no value. Arising from the judgement, the Clydesdale District Council were satisfied that their officers took the correct action and had initially attempted a voluntary approach and that the case had only be taken as a last resort. No further legal action will be taken on the case. Return to top of page Food Safety Act 1990 - Section 14 14(1) Any person who sells to the purchaser's prejudice any food which is not of the nature or substance or quality demanded by the purchaser shall be guilty of an offence. Earwig in Bottle of Milk Lord Rayleigh's Dairy of Hatfield Peveral, Essex pleaded guilty at Colchester Magistrate's Court on 15th April 1996 to a charge of selling milk to the prejudice of the purchaser which was not of the substance demanded, in that it contained an earwig, contrary to Section 14 of the Food Safety Act. The earwig was found by a consumer in Colchester who reported it to Colchester Borough Council Environmental and Community Services Department. The dairy bottles about 140,000 pints per day and is regarded as one of the most modern in Europe having been built in 1990. Officers from the council were sent a copy of the diary's HACCP plan for examination. They subsequently visited the dairy. However, on their visit the Quality Control Manager produced a different version and there was confusion over which version of the plan was actually in place. The earwig had not been through the pasteurisation process so officers investigated the bottle-filling area. Neither HACCP plan had anything to say about the possibility of foreign matter getting into bottles after the bottle-scanners. When the officers looked at this area of the dairy they found a length of conveyor between the scanners and the filler on which empty bottles were often stationary for several minutes. This length of line was not covered and was directly underneath a large extractor fan in the roof, through which foreign matter on the roof could be blown. During the case, counsel for the Council said that dirt and insects could be blown into the filling section from outside and from two cross-beams in the roof. Examination of the pest control records showed that the presence of earwigs had been noted previously and that some recommendations on preventative measures had not been actioned. The firm admitted the offence. In mitigation the company regretted the incident saying that it was the first time an insect of this sort has fallen in. The company is now taking up Colchester Council's recommendations. The company supplies most major retailers and it was stated that "There is someone from one or other of the stores there almost every week. Never before has the problem of the bottling area been brought to the company's attention. The company was fined �700 with costs of �300. Health Food Firm Fined A Brighton health food firm was fined �4,000 in the Brighton Magistrates' Court on 9 November 1995 for selling products with misleading labels. Rio Trading Company (Health) of Nile Street, supplied a snack called a Buzz Bar to health food shops, which the packaging stated was covered in chocolate. But the 75p bar, which contained a natural stimulant called Guarana, was simply covered in a chocolate flavoured coating. For this, the firm was prosecuted under Section 14 of the Food Safety Act 1990 in that they sold a cereal bar not the nature demanded in that it was not covered with chocolate as stated on the label. The firm was fined �2,500 for this offence. The firm also sold Guarana capsules, costing �3.99 for a box of 20, falsely labelled as a natural and potent nutrient. Brighton magistrates heard that Guarana was derived from a South American ground-nut seed and is not a nutrient. As a result, the company was prosecuted under Section 15 of the Food Safety Act in that they sold Guarana Capsules which bore a label that falsely described guaramine as a nutrient when, in fact, it is not so. For this offence they were fined �1,500. East Sussex Trading Standards officer Claire Attridge told the court that her Department had given the company advice, but changes were not made to the labels of the two products. Graeme Lewis, the managing director of the company admitted the offences. The company, which was founded in 1987 and has a �1.2 million turnover, was also ordered to pay �160 costs for the two cases. Return to top of page Food Safety Act 1990 - Section 15 15 (1) Any person who gives with any food sold by him, or displays with any food offered or exposed by him for sale or in his possession for the purpose of sale, a label, whether or not attached to or printed on the wrapper or container, which - (a) falsely describes the food, or (b) is likely to mislead as to the nature or substance or quality of the food, shall be guilty of an offence.

Return to top of page Trade Descriptions Act 1968 - Section 1 Smoked Trout Served up as Salmon The perseverance of officers of Somerset Trading Standards Department led to the conviction of Grants Smoked Foods, a smoked fish producer with an annual turnover of �10 million. The company from Cumbria were charged under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 with supplying Scottish Oak Smoked Salmon to which a false trade description had been applied contrary to Sections 1(1)(a) and 1(1)(b) and Section 23. The cost to the company was �17,000 in court fines and prosecution costs. The case took three years to come before the courts and the trial, at Taunton Crown Court before Judge Jones, lasted 4 days. Trading Standards were first called to the restaurant of the Carnarvon Arms in the West Country during December 1992 when the chef became suspicious over a supply of fish. Formal samples were taken from the same area and the Government Analyst, using DNA genetic fingerprinting technology, confirmed that the fish was rainbow trout. During the period up to the hearing on 21 March 1996, the company appeared to do everything possible to delay the case from coming before the courts. They first entered a plea of 'not guilty' and embarked on a number of procedures which led to delay. They insisted that the Government Chemist should examine the fish; they requested that a portion of the fish should be sent to their own specialists in America and Europe; they frequently changed the company who would represent them in court. During the hearing (from the 21st to 26th March) they maintained that they had exercised all due diligence; that the filleter should have spotted the difference; and that their system of quality control met the requirements of the industry. However, this was not the first time prosecution under the Trades descriptions Act had been brought against the company. The defence also argued on a technical point that rainbow trout belonged to the genus Onichorynchus - the same as the Pacific Salmon - but they began to lose the case when the Judge pointed out that the ingredients list stated "Atlantic Salmon". The defence then made a submission admitting the charges, but they attempted to accuse the filleter and prove due diligence. The jury found the prosecution's case proved and the Judge criticised the quality of the defence evidence and the time wasted by the company. He ordered full costs of �13.311 to the Trading Standards Department. Following the prosecution, the Chairman of the Scottish Salmon Smokers' Association thanked the Department and praised the exemplary diligence and persistence of the staff in bringing the case before the courts. He indicated that considerable damage was being done to the reputation of the genuine quality food industry by the activities of what he described as food fraudsters and called for a strong independent quality system for the food industry similar to the French 'Appelation Controllee' for wine.

Details of the inspection statistics for the UK have now been releasd by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF). The statistics have been compiled for submission to the EU Commission as required by the Directive on the Official Control of Foodstuffs. The data has been published by country (England, Wales, Scotland and Norther Ireland) in addition to the combined data for the whole of the UK. It is this last set which has been used to provide the data presented below. The statistics are derived from data submitted to MAFF by all 589 food enforcement authorities in the UK for the period January - December 1995. In the accompanying notes provided by MAFF, it is emphasiszed that official food control does not consist only of inspections, sampling and prosecutions. There are other activities which enforcement authorites carry out which are not covered by the data. These include: the operation of the home authority principle whereby the enforcement authority in whose area the headquarters of a national and international company is based provides advice on all aspects of compliance with food law and acts as liaison and advisory point for other enforcement authroities who may have problems arising from the marketing of the Company's products in their area; this will fall more heavily on some authorities than others; provision of advice to locally based businesses on compliance with all aspects of the food law; advice to consumers on the opeation and enforcement of official controls and the application of food law; operation of scheme to provide for the training of food handlers in food hygiene; and remedial action on infringemnts which fall short of prosecution, including written warnings and the issue of formal cautions (a formal legal proceeding under which the defendent agrees that there has been an infringement of the law and thus the circumstances can be kept on record for the future). The statistics also exclude: meat hygiene inspections carried out under EC Veterinary Legislation; milk hygiene inspections of production holdings inspections carried out by the Wine Standards Board under EC wine legislation inspections of Marketing(Grading) Standards in the fisheries and horticultural areas; pesticide residue sampling for which a separate return is required under Driective 90/642; food surveillance work carried out by Central Government (e.g. radioactive contamination monitoring) The data were published on four forms (Forms A-D): Form A - Inspection Form B - Prosecutions Form C - Official Sampling Form D - Informal Sampling Some additional notes are provided by the Ministry to assist in the inerpretation of the data - contact the Ministry Library for details. Comments on the data Data from Form A shows that the number of establishments subject to inspection remains at a very consistent level (1995, 616,522; 1994, 617,144; 1993, 617,820). The number of prosecutions has dropped further and represents only 35% of the number taken in 1992. The conviction rate has declined to 72% (based on prosecutions), having risen to 90% in 1994, and is the lowest of the 4 years of complete records. This data is presented graphically in Figure 1. Figure 1 The use of the improvement notice has also declined further (to 5679) and represents only 14% of the number issued in 1992 (see Figure 2). The use of written warnings has this year shown a slight drop. Figure 2 Data from Form B reflects the decline in prosecutions with drops in all the main categories. The largest drop was for prosecutions relating to extraneous matter where the 1995 figure of 115 represents only 65% of the figure for 1994. Hygiene prosecutions at 291 now represent only 27% of that reported in 1992 (1087). The relative proportion of each type of prosecution (based on the total number for 1995) is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 Data from Form C shows a slight drop in the number of formal samples (1995, 63,726; 1994, 65,162) taking it to the lowest level of the four years of data available. Although the number of unsatisfactory samples has again risen (to 21,642), the number of resulting prosecutions has declined further to 323 (from a high of 1056 in 1992). Overall this represents a prosecution rate of about 1.5%. The figure depends upon the type of the problem as is indicated in Figure 4. It will be seen that there are declines in all the categories except for microbioligcal where a slight rise was recorded. Figure 4 Data from Form D indicates a further slight rise in the level of informal sampling (1995, 183,327; 1994, 181,202). This page was first provided by David Jukes on 6th September 1996.

The following is adapted from draft material to be published in the revised edition of "Food Legislation of the UK", (Authour: David Jukes) to be published in early 1997. It is provided for information only and is a summary of the requirements. Any one needing an accurate statement of the legal requirements should consult the Regulations. Food Labelling Regulations 1996 (Statutory Instrument No 1996/1499) The following headings are used: Notes A. Food to be delivered to the ultimate consumer or caterer 1. Name of food 2. List of ingredients 3. Special emphasis 4. Appropriate durability indication 5. Omission of certain particulars 6. Additional requirements 7. Manner of marking or labelling B. Claims C. Prescribed nutrition labelling D. Misleading descriptions Notes: The MAFF have issued some "Notes For Guidance' to help in the interpretation of these Regulations. However they have no status in law and the details that follow have made no reference to them. It is recommended though that people needing to operate these Regulations should obtain a copy of the latest issue of the notes. The following foods are not subject to the Regulations: drinks bottled before 1/1/1983 having an alcoholic strength greater than 1.2% (vol.) and meeting the labelling requirements in force at the time of bottling; any food prepared on domestic pemises for sale for the benefit of the person preparing it by a registered society; any food not prepared in the course of a business by the person preparing it.

All food to be marked with: a) the name of the food; b) a list of ingredients; c) the appropriate durability indication: (i) for food which, from a microbiological point of view, is highly perishable and in consequence likely after a short period of time to constitute an immediate danger to human health, a "use by' date, (ii) for other foods, the minimum durability; d) any special storage conditions or conditions of use; e) the name and address of the manufacturer or packer, or a seller established with the EC;f) particulars of the place of origin if necessary to avoid misleading the purchaser to a material degree; g) instructions for use if necessary. 1) Name of food If a name prescribed by law exists, it shall be used, and may be qualified by other words which make it more precise. (For fish, Schedule 1 of the Regulations should be consulted; for melons and potatoes sold as such, the variety must be included; for vitamins, the name should be that used in the table given below [See Table of Vitamins below] except that folacin may be called "folic acid" and viatmin K shall be called "vitamin K"). If no name prescribed by law exists, a customary name may be used. If no name prescribed by law nor a customary name, a name sufficiently precise to inform a purchaser of the true nature of the food and to enable the food to be distinguished from products with which it could be confused and, if necessary, shall include description of its use. The name may consist of a name and/or a description (and may contain more than one word).Trade marks, brand names, or fancy names shall not be substituted. If the purchaser could be misled without such information, the name should include an indication a) that a food is powdered or in any other physical condition, or b) that a food has been dried, freeze-dried, frozen, concetrated or smoked or subjected to any other treatment. In addition, the following indications are required: a) for meat treated with proteolytic enzymes: "tenderised', b) for food which has been irradiated: "irradiated' or "treated with ionising radiation'. 2) List of ingredients Heading: The list of ingredients should be headed or preceded by "ingredients" (or a heading which includes the word "ingredients"). Order of ingredients: Ingredients to be listed in weight descending order determined as at the time of their use in the preparation of the food, except for the following: a) water and volatile products used as ingredients shall be listed in order of their weight in the finished product. The weight of water is calculated by subtracting from the weight of the finished product the total weight of the other ingredients used; b) if an ingredient is reconstituted from concentrated or dehydrated form during preparation of the food, it may be positioned according to its weight before concentration or dehydration; c) if a food is to be reconstituted during use by the addition of water, its ingredients may be listed in order after reconstitution provided there is a statement "ingredients of the reconstituted product" or "ingredients of the ready to use product" or similar indication; d) if a product consists of mixed fruit, nuts, vegetables, spices or herbs and no particular one of these ingredients predominates significantly by weight, the ingredients may be listed in any order provided that for foods consisting entirely of such a mixture the heading includes "in variable proportion' or other words indicating method of listing and for other such foods the relevant ingredients are accompanied by such a statement. Names of ingredients: The name of an ingredient shall be a) the name which would be used if the ingredient were sold as a food, including, if appropriate, either "irradiated" or "treated with ionising radiation" (other appropriate indications must be given if a consumer could be misled by its omission); or b) the generic name given in the following table and meeting the specified conditions: Table of Generic Names c) a flavouring shall be identificed by the word "flavouring" or "flavourings" or a more specific name or description of the flavouring; it may be supplemented by the word "natural" (or similar) only where the flavouring componenet(s) of the ingredient consist(s) exclusively of a flavouring substance obtained by physical (including distillation and solvent extraction), enzymatic or microbiological processes, from material of vegetable or animal origin which material is either raw or has only been subjected to a process normally used in preparing food (including drying, torrefaction and fermentation), and/or, a flavouring preparation(s); in addition, if the name refers to a vegetable or animal nature or origin, the word "natural" (or similar), it must be derived solely or almost solely from that vegetable or animal source. d) an additive shall be listed by either the principal function it serves, as given in the following table, followed by its name and/or serial number (subject to the notes in the table) or where the function is not given in the table, its name: Compound ingredients: The names of the ingredients of a compound ingredient may be given either instead of the compound ingredient or in addition (and immediately following the name of the compound ingredient); except only the name of the compound ingredient need be given if the compound ingredient: a) need not bear an ingredients' list if it were being sold, b) is identified by a generic name, or c) is less than 25% of the finished product, but in this case, any additives used and needing to be named must be listed immediately following the name of the compound ingredient. Water: Added water to be declared unless: a) it is used solely for reconstitution of an ingredient which is in concentrated or dehydrated form, b) it is used as, or as part of, a medium which is not normally consumed, c) it does not exceed 5% of the finished product, d) it is permitted under EEC frozen or quick-frozen poultry Regulations. Ingredients not needing to be named: a) constituents which are temporarily separated and later re-introduced (in the original proportions), b) additives which were in an ingredient and which serve no significant technological function in the finished product, c) any additive used solely as a processing aid, d) any substance (other than water) used as a solvent or carrier of an additive (and used only at level which is strictly necessary). Foods which need not bear a list of ingredients: a) fresh fruit and vegetables which have not been peeled or cut into pieces, b) carbonated water (consisting of water and carbon dioxide only, and the name indicates that the water is carbonated), c) vinegar derived by fermentation (from a single basic product) with no added ingredients, d) cheese, butter, fermented milk and fermented cream to which only lactic products, enzymes and micro-organism cultures essential to manufacture have been added, or, in the case of cheese (except fresh curd cheese and processed cheese), any salt required for its manufacture, e) any food consisting of a single component (including flour containing only legally required nutritional additives), f) any drink with an alcoholic strength by volume over 1.2%. For c) and d), if other ingredients are included only those other added ingredients need be listed if the list is headed "added ingredients" or similar. 3) Special emphasis Where a food is characterised by the presence of a particular ingredient, and special emphasis is given to it on the label, it must include a declaration of the minimum percentage of the ingredient. Similarly, for the low content of a particular ingredient, the maximum percentage should be given. The % to be calculated on the quantity used and to appear by the name of the food or in the ingredients' list. (Neither reference to an ingredient in the name of the food nor to a flavouring on the label shall of itself constitute special emphasis). 4) Appropriate durability indication General requirements: Minimum durability: To be indicated by "best before" followed by the date up to and including which the food can reasonably be expected to retain its specific properties if properly stored, and details of the storage conditions necessary for the properties to be retained until that date. Date to be in the form day/month/year except day/month only required if date is within 3 months, or "best before end" and month/year if date is from 3 to 18 months, or "best before end" and month/year or year if date is more than 18 months. Either the date only or the date and storage conditions may be elsewhere on the packet if reference is made to the position after the "best before" statement. "Use by" date: To be indicated by "use by" followed by the date (expressed in day/month or day/month/year) up to and including which the food, if properly stored, is recommended for use. Details of any necessary storage conditions must also be given. Either the date only or the date and storage conditions may be elsewhere on the packet if reference is made to the position after the "use by" statement. Foods exempted from stating an appropriate durability indication: a) fresh fruit and vegetables (including potatoes but not including sprouting seeds, legume sprouts and similar products) which have not been peeled or cut into pieces, b) wine, liqueur wine, sparkling wine, aromatised wine and any similar drink obtained from fruit other than grapes and certain other drinks made from grapes or grape musts (see Regulations), c) any drink with an alcoholic strength by volume of 10% or more, d) any soft drink, fruit juice or fruit nectar or alcoholic drink sold in a container of more than 5l (intended for catering), e) flour confectionery and bread normally consumed within 24 hours of preparation, f) vinegar, g) cooking and table salt, h) solid sugar and products consisting almost solely of flavoured or coloured sugars, i) chewing gums and similar products, j) edible ices in individual portions. 5) Omission of certain particulars a) Food which is not prepacked and fancy confectionery products (includes food which is prepacked for direct sale, flour confectionery packed in crimp case or transparent packaging unmarked or marked only with price and lot mark and no other label is attached or details given, and individually wrapped fancy confectionery products not enclosed in any further packaging and intended for sale as single items.): i) Subject to ii), food which is not prepacked need not be marked with any of the above requirements (or the additional labelling requirements x) - xx) below) except the name of the food.

In the case of any raw milk which is not prepacked and is sold at a catering establishment, the words "Milk supplied in this establishment has not been heat-treated and may thereofre contain organisms harmful to health" shall appear on a label attached to the container of milk or on a ticket or notice visible to the purchaser. d) Products containing skimmed milk together with non-milk fat: For a product which i) consists of skimmed milk together with non-milk fat, ii) is capable of being used as a substitute for milk, and iii) is neither an infant formula or a follow-on formula, nor a product specially formulated for infants or young children for medical pruposes, it shall be prominently marked with a warning that the product is unfit or not to be used for babies. e) Foods packaged in certain gases: If the durability of a food has been extended by being packaged in a permitted packaging gas, it shall be marked "packaged in a protective atmosphere". f) Foods containing sweeteners: For a food containing: i) a permitted sweetener, the name shall be accompanied by "with sweetener". ii) both added sugar(s) and sweetener(s), the name shall be accompanied by "with sugar(s) and sweetener(s)". iii) aspartame, the food shall be marked "contains a source of phenylalanine". iv) more than 10% added polyols, the food shall be marked "excessive consumption may produce laxative effects". 7) Manner of marking or labelling General: a) When sold to the ultimate consumer, the required markings shall be either on the packaging or on a label attached to the packaging or on a label visible through the packaging. If sold otherwise than to the ultimate consumer, as an alternative, the details may be on relevant trade documents (except that the name of the food, its appropriate durability indication and the name and address of manufacturer, packer or seller must appear on the outermost packaging). b) For those products which may omit certain details (food which is not prepacked and fancy confectionery products and certain food sold at catering establishments as detailed above in 6) a) and e)) are sold to the ultimate consumer, the details which are required shall appear on a label attached to the food or on a menu, notice, ticket or label discernable to the purchaser at place where he chooses the food. Where the information is given on a menu, etc., if the food contains (or may contain) irradiated ingredients this shall be indicated using the words "irradiated" or "treated with ionising radiation" accompanying the reference to the ingredient. In the case where irradiated dried substances normally used for seasoning are used in a catering establishment, an indication that food sold in the establishment contains (or may contain) those irradiated ingredients is sufficient. c) For food which is not prepacked and fancy confectionery products (as detailed above in 6) a) above) are sold otherwise than to the ultimate consumer, the details which are required shall appear on a label attached to the food or on a menu, notice, ticket or label discernable to the purchaser at place where he chooses the food, or in commercial documents which accompany the food (or were sent before or at the time of delivery of the food).

The requirements of b), c) and f) do not apply to foods falling within the section on small packages and certain bottles above (see 5) d) above). B. Claims The following claims in the labelling or advertising of a food are prohibited: 1) A claim that a food has tonic properties (except that the use of the word tonic in the description "Indian tonic water" or quinnine tonic water" shall not of itself constitute this claim). 2) A claim that a food has the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease or any reference to such a property (except that the use of the claim described below under "claims relating to foods for particular nutritional uses" shall not of itself constitute this claim). The following claims in the labelling or advertising of a food are only permitted where the conditions specified in the Regulations are met (only summaries of the conditions are given here and the Regulations should be consulted for full details). When considering whether a claim is being made, a reference to a substance in an ingredients' list or in any nutrition labelling shall not constitute a claim. 1) Claims relating to foods for particular nutritional uses (i.e. a claim that a food is suitable, or has been specially made, for a particular nutritional purpose which includes requirements either of people whose digestive process or metabolism is disturbed, or of people who, because of special physiological conditions obtain special benefit from the controlled consumption of certain substances, or of infants (0 - 12 months) or young children (1 - 3 years) in good health): the food must fulfil the claim; the label must indicate the aspects of compostion or process which give the food its particular nutritional characteristics; the label must give the prescribed nutrition labelling and may have additional relevnat information; when sold to the ultimate consumer, the food must be prepacked and completely enclosed by its packaging. 2) Reduced or low energy value claims (i.e. a claim that a food has a reduced or low energy value except that the presence of the words "low calorie" for a soft drink and in accordance with the requirements below on misleading descriptions does not constitute such a claim): foods claimed to have a reduced energy value must have energy no more than three-quarters of a similar food with no such claim (unless the food is an intense sweetener either on its own or mixed with another food but still significantly sweeter than sucrose ); foods claimed to have a low energy value should usually have a maximum energy of 167 kJ (40 kcal) per 100 g (or 100 ml) and per normal serving (unless the food is an intense sweetener either on its own or mixed with another food but still significantly sweeter than sucrose ); in the case of an uncooked food, the claim must be in the form "a low energy or calorie or Joule food". 3) Protein claims (i.e. a claim that a food, other than one intended for babies or young children which satisfies the conditions for 1) above, is a source of protein): a reasonable daily consumption of the food must contribute at least 12 g of protein; foods claimed to be a rich or excellent source of protein must have at least 20% of their energy value provided by protein and in other cases at least 12%; the label must give the prescribed nutrition labelling. 4) Vitamin / mineral claims (i.e. a claim that a food, other than one intended for babies or young children which satisfies the conditions of 1) above, is a source of vitamins/minerals; a claim is not made when a name includes the name of one or more viatamins/minerals and the food consists solely of vitamins and/or minerals and certain other substances and when mineral claims are made relating to a low or reduced level of minerals): claims may only be made with respect to vitamins or minerals in the following table (using the name in the table); where a) the claim is not confined to named vitamins or minerals then, if the food is claimed to be a rich or excellent source of vitamins or minerals, it must contain at least one half of the recommended daily amount (RDA) of two or more of the vitamins or minerals listed in the quantity reasonably expected to be consumed in one day or, otherwise, at least one-sixth; where b) the claim is confined to named vitamins or minerals, the conditions of a) must apply to each named vitamin or mineral; for foods to which nutrition labelling relates, the label must carry a statement of the % RDA of any vitamin or mineral involved in the claim in a quantified serving of the food or per portion (if number of portions in pack is stated); for food supplements or waters other than natural mineral waters, the label must carry a statement of the % RDA of any vitamin or mineral involved in the claim in either a quantified serving of the food or, if prepacked, per portion, and, if prepacked, the number of portions in the pack is to be stated); 5) Cholesterol claims (i.e. a claim relating to the presence or absence of cholesterol): the food must have a maximum of 0.005% cholesterol except that if it is higher than this figure a claim may be made if the claim relates to the removal of cholesterol from, or its reduction in, the food if the claim is made a) as part of an indication of the true nature of the the food, b) as part of an indication of the treatment of the food, within the list of ingredients, or d) as a footnote in respect of a prescribed nutrition labelling; the claim must not include any suggestion of benefit to health because of its level of cholesterol; the food shall be marked with the prescribed nutrition labelling. 6) Nutrition claims (i.e. a claim not dealt with under items 1) - 5) above): the food must be capable of fulfilling the claim; the food shall be marked with the prescribed nutrition labelling. 7) Claims which depend on another food (i.e. a claim that a food has a particular value or confers a particular benefit): the value or benefit must not be derived wholly or partly from another food intended to be consumed with the food. C. Prescribed nutrition labelling Presentation: It shall be presented together in one conspicuous place in tabular form with numbers aligned or, if there is insufficient space for this, in linear form. When required or permitted to be given, the following order and manner of listing shall be used: Where it is required to give additional information relating to any substance which belongs to, or is a componenet of, one of the items listed, it shall appear as follows: All amounts: a) to be given per 100g or 100 ml; b) may, in addition, be given per quantified serving or per portion (if number of portions in pack is stated); c) to be the amount contained in the food as sold except that, where detailed preparation instructions are given, they may be the amounts after such preaparation (and this must be expressly indicated); d) to be averages (taking into account seasonal variation, patterns of consumption, etc.) based on i) the manufacturer's analysis of the food, ii) a calcualtion from the actual average values of the ingredients used in the preparation of the food, and/or iii) a calculation from generally established and acepted data In calculating the energy value the following conversion factors shall be used: 1 g carbohydrate (excluding polyols) = 17 kJ (4 kcal) 1 g polyols = 10 kJ (2.4 kcal) 1 g protein = 17 kJ (4kcal) 1 g fat = 37 kJ (9 kcal) 1 g ethanol = 29 kJ (7 kcal) 1 g organic acid = 13 kJ (3 kcal) Contents 1) Except where 2) applies, prescribed nutrition labelling shall give the following: a) it shall include either: i) energy, protein, carbohydrates and fat, or ii) energy, protein, carbohydrates, sugars, fat, saturates, fibre and sodium; b) if a claim is made for any of sugars, saturates, fibre or sodium, then it shall be given according to a) ii); c) where a nutrition claim is made relating to polyols, starch, mono-unsaturates, polyunsaturates, cholesterol, vitamins or minerals, the relevant amount shall be given except that, in the case of vitamins or minerals, the amount present must be a significant amount (15% of the RDA - see Table above); d) the items in c) may be given even if no claim is made but the restriction relating to vitamins or minerals also applies; e) if the labelling is presented in the form a) i) above, but includes mono-unsaturates, polyunsaturates, and/or cholesterol, the amount of saturates must also be given; f) where a nutrtion claim is made relating to any substance which belongs to, or is a component of, one of the nutrients already required (or permitted) to be included, the name and amount of that substance shall be given. 2) For food which is not prepacked and which is either sold to the ultimate consumer other than at a catering establishment, to the ultimate consumer from a vending machine, or to a catering establishment, prescribed nutrition labelling shall give any the data relevant to any nutrtiion claim which is made and may include shown above under presentation. D. Misleading descriptions 1) General: The following words and descriptions may only be used in the labelling or advertising of the foods indicated in the following table if the foods satisfy the conditions stated: 2) Cheese: The following names may not be used in the labelling of any cheese unless the cheese has at least 48% milk fat (dry matter basis) and the cheese has no more than the following specified water contents: 3) Cream: The following names may not be used in the labelling of any cream unless the specified requirements are met, except that the milk fat requirement need not be met if the name contains qualifying words indicating that the milk fat content of the cream is greater or less than that specified. 4) "Wine' used in a composite name: The use of the word "wine" is restricted by EC Regulations. However, it may be used in a composite name in the following cases (so long as no confusion is caused) a) "Non-alcoholic wine" may only be used for a drink derived from unfermented grape juice intended exclusively for communion or sacramental use (and labelled as such). b) When the word "wine" is used in a composite name for a drink which is derived from fruit other than grapes, that drink shall be obtained by an alcoholic fermentation of that fruit.

The following is an example of a food hazard warning notice issued by the Department of Health and includes information given to enforcement officers. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Press Release: 96/382 Friday 6th December 1996 FOOD HAZARD WARNING - HYDALE BRAND CHICKEN CURRY SOLD AT ALDI STORES The Department of Health today issued a Food Hazard Warning on the 'Hydale' brand of canned chicken curry, sold exclusively at Aldi supermarkets. The warning states that visible pieces of glass may have entered the tinned curry during production at Glenbrook Foods Limited, of Portadown, Co Armagh, Northern Ireland. The 392g cans that may have been affected carry the codes 6239, 6240 and 6241. Glenbrook Foods Limited issued a product recall in national press advertisements yesterday for their own branded chicken curry, 'Glenbrook Chicken Curry' in 368g tins. Aldi stores plan to display warning notices to customers in their stores from 9 December. The Food Hazard Warning has been issued today so that local environmental health officers can monitor action taken by each Aldi store. NOTES FOR EDITORS 1. The attached Food Hazard Warning Ref: 16/96 has been sent to all Chief Environmental Health Officers. [ENDS] FOOD HAZARD WARNING TO BE PASSED WITHOUT DELAY TO THE CHIEF OR DEPUTY CHIEF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OFFICER Ref: 16/96Date: 6 December 1996 NOTE: THIS IS BEING SENT DIRECT TO ALL AUTHORITIES AND THERE IS NO NEED TO CASCADE ON To: Chief Environmental Health Officers (cc by BT Gold: CCDCs/MOEHs, RDPHs, Health Authority Managers, FHSAs) Please copy to all Officers with a possible interest This Food Hazard Warning is issued in two parts. Part 1 is for information only, Part 2 suggests the need for action from selected local authorities. Part 1: Food Hazard Warning - For Information Only Environmental Health Departments may be aware that Glenbrook Foods Limited issued a "Customer Care Announcement" in the national press yesterday concerning their recall of Chicken Curry. (beginning of trade press release:) Customer Care Announcement Glenbrook Foods Limited Recall of Chicken Curry We have detected that in a very limited number of instances, pieces of glass visible to the human eye may have entered some tinned product. This affects the following product only: GLENBROOK CHICKEN CURRY IN 368g TINS Batch codes 6240 and 6241 only. These batch codes are located on the lids of the tins together with a Best Before End date of Aug 99*. We have already arranged withdrawal from stores but we are concerned that consumers may still have tins with these codes at home. If this is the case, please do not consume the product, but return the tin(s) to the stores at which you purchased for a full refund. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. We stress that only the above codes need to be returned and that no other Glenbrook Foods products are affected. Any queries in relation to this notice should be directed to our freephone information line on: 0800 24 24 28. This will be open from 8 am until 8 pm from 5th December 1996 onwards. [end of press release] * This information in the press advertisement was contained in pictorial format which cannot be re-produced in this hazard warning notice. Part 2 - Food Hazard Warning - For Suggested Action Hydale brand Chicken Curry Glenbrook Foods Ltd also produced the Chicken Curry under contract for Aldi Stores Ltd. There is therefore a possibility of a similar problem in 392g cans of "Hydale" brand Chicken Curry, which were manufactured by Glenbrook Foods Limited for Aldi Stores during the same production runs. The cans have the codes 6239, 6240 and 6241. Aldi Stores are not proposing at present to issue a public warning in the national press similar to that issued by Glenbrook Foods although we are advised that notices will be displayed in Aldi Stores on Monday 9 December. Local authorities with an Aldi Store in their area will wish to visit the Store and satisfy themselves about the effectiveness of the trade withdrawal and the display of warning notices to customers who may have purchased cans with the at risk codes before its withdrawal. DH are providing a copy of this Food Hazard Warning to the National Media. Return to top of page This page was first provided on 6th January 1997.

Conference Report This additional page provides a report of the 5th EU Food Law Conference 25th/26th June 1996 (organised by Agra Euorpe) Note: This report has been prepared for publication in the British Food Journal. For copyright reasons, access is restricted to within the Department. This page contains information from 1 October 1996 to the present. Earlier material is avaialable: March - June 1996 July - September 1996 The following are items of news relating to the development of food law in the EU. It is based on information available to David Jukes from a number of different sources - IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE COMPREHENSIVE. The date used below relates to the date of the meeting, letter, press release etc - not the date the item was added to the list. To assist regular visitors, the is used to mark the 6 most recent additions. The following items are listed on this page in reverse chronological order: 17 January 1997 ADDITIVES - Amendment to Sweeteners Directive Adopted 16 January 1997 ADDITIVES - Progress on Amending the Miscellaneous Additives Directive 16 January 1997 ADMINISTRATION - Commission Statement on BSE and Food Safety Reforms 16 January 1997 NOVEL FOODS - Final Agreement Reached on EC Novel Foods Regulation 15 January 1997 CONTAMINANTS - Regulation for Nitrate in Lettuce and Spinach 30 December 1996 ADDITIVES - Decision adopted on "traditional foods" 19 December 1996 NOVEL FOODS - Genetically Modified Maize 19 December 1996 PARTICULAR NUTRITIONAL USES - Amendment to Directive 89/398 on Foods for Particular Nutritional Uses 18 December 1996 ORIGIN MARKING - Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origins 17 December 1996 NATURAL MINERAL WATERS - Amending Directive Published 17 December 1996 ADDITIVES - Miscellaneous Additives Amendment 2 December 1996 NOVEL FOODS - Progress on Regulation 14 November 1996 ORIGIN MARKING - Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origins 14 November 1996 NOVEL FOODS - Genetically modified maize. 12 November 1996 CONTAMINANTS - Proposed Limits for Lead and Cadmium in Foodstuffs 21 October 1996 LABELLING - Quantitative Ingredient Declaration 10 October 1996 BEEF - Labelling of Beef and Beef Products 2 October 1996 FLAVOURINGS - Draft Directive on Food Additives for Use in Flavourings MAFF Letter, 16 January 1997 Progress on Amending the Miscellaneous Additives Directive There have been further discussions on the proposed amendment to the Directive 95/2 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners. The MAFF letter reports discussions held on 9 and 13 January. Over the two days all aspects of the proposal were discussed, together with various requests for additional entries put forward by the Member States and the Commission. In many cases the discussion was inconclusive and a further meeting of the Working Group is planned for 30 January. The intention is to reach an agreed Common Position at the Internal Market Council on 13 March, subject to prior receipt of the European Parliament's first reading opinion. The letter records the main points of the discussion - mainly specific requests for new or extended uses of additives. Details will not be given here and MAFF should be contacted for further information. One point is worth noting - the Commission tabled additional proposed entries for two new additives: E459 beta-cyclodextrine and E425 Konjac (i) Konjac gum, (ii) Konjac glucomannane.. MAFF Letter, 17 January 1997 Amendment to Sweeteners Directive Adopted At the Environment Council meeting on the 9/10 December 1996, the proposal to amend the Sweeteners Directive (94/35/EC) was finally adopted unamended {See earlier item on Common Position, 27 June 1996). The amending directive adds further foods to those which may contain specified sweeteners. It also makes a number of technical changes: adding a definition of "quantum satis"; introducing an Article relating to compound foods; and, amending the category "vitamin and dietary preparations to "Food supplements/diet integrators based on vitamins and/or mineral elements, syrup-type or chewable". The Directive must be implemented within 12 months of its adoption and products not conforming must be prohibited within 18 months (except that those already marked or labelled may be sold until stocks are exhausted). The Week In Europe, 16 January 1997 Commission Statement on BSE and Food Safety Reforms An independent agency is needed to monitor the implementation of EU food safety and health measures, Commission President Jacques Santer stressed yesterday. The Commission had proposed the creation of such an agency in May 1996, he told the European Parliament's committee of inquiry on BSE, and if the proposal continued to make little progress in the Council, the Commission would bring the existing office responsible for inspections from Directorate General VI (agriculture) to DG XXIV (consumer policy). The scientific committees should also be strengthened, perhaps also oving to DG XXIV, Santer said, to separate more clearly their role of providing the best scientific advice from the development of legislation by the Commission. MAFF Press Release, 16 January 1997 Final Agreement Reached on EC Novel Foods Regulation Food Minister Angela Browning welcomed the final agreement of the EC novel foods regulation by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament [See previous item]. The regulation provides for a statutory pre-market safety assessment based on the approach that the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes already follows. The regulation will lead to special labelling when a novel food is judged, on the basis of a scientific assessment, not to be equivalent to an existing food. Foods will also require labelling if there are any special ethical concerns or if it contains a live genetically modified organism. Speaking in London today Mrs Browning said: "This Regulation is a very good result for UK consumers and industry. It provides the safeguards that consumers expect and deserve while at the same time providing a climate of greater certainty for industry. The Regulation contains extensive labelling provisions, which most importantly from the consumers points of view, are enforceable. I look forward to the early implementation of this regulation and I am confident that the UK will continue to have an influential role in the safety assessment of novel foods". The Regulation is finalised and will come into force 90 days after publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This is expected to be in the first half of 1997. Scottish Office letter, 15 January 1997 Regulation for Nitrate in Lettuce and Spinach The Commission proposal to set limits for nitrate in lettuce and spinach was considered at the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs on December 1996. The proposal was agreed by a majority decision and the resulting Regulation will apply from 15 February 1997. The letter indicates that, whilst maintaining its long-standing opposition to the principle of this legislation, the UK voted in favour of the Regulation as it now represents the best compromise achievable that safeguards the interests of both our growers and consumers. The Regulation includes provision for a derogation which exempts crops grown for domestic consumption for a transitional period, provided that growers follow Good Agricultural Practice. It is noted that the UK intends to apply this derogation for lettuce and fresh spinach. The nitrate limits included in the Regulation are: 3,500 mg/kg for lettuce harvested in summer; 4,500 mg/kg for lettuce harvested in winter; 2,500 mg/kg for outdoor grown lettuce (May to August) 2,500 mg/kg for spinach harvested in summer 3,000 mg/kg for spinach harvested in winter 2,000 mg/kg for preserved or frozen spinach It is indicated that recent concerns raised by the UK that some domestically produced(summer) spinach and imports from other EU countries in the winter would have difficulty in meeting the limits received no support from the other Member States. The UK will continue to press for this issue to be resolved at the earliest opportunity (probably when the limits are reviewed in 1998) Scottish Office Letter, 30 December 1996 Adoption of Decision on National Laws Prohibiting Food Additives in Certain Foodstuffs As previously described (see 11 July 1996), the Community has been developing a Decision which would permit the maintenance of national laws prohibiting additives in certain foods. The Common Position was adopted on the 18 June 1996. It was formally adopted at the Environment Council held on the 9/10 December. No changes to the Common Position text were proposed by the European Parliament during its second reading of the proposal. The text of the adopted Decision therefore contains a list of 15 traditional foods (as listed in item of 11 July 1996) for which certain Member States may maintain national bans on specific additive use on their territory. None are UK products. The Week in Europe, 19 December 1996 Genetically Modified Maize The following is an extract from The Week in Europe. No other details are yet available to me (but see earlier item 14 November 1996). "The Commission has decided to authorize the placing on the market of genetically modified maize, notified by Ciba-Geigy. This follows extensive consideration by the Council and Commission, and reports by three scientific panels; the scientific basis for the decision is far better than a few months ago, Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said." MAFF Letter, 19 December 1996 Amendment to Directive 89/398 on Foods for Particular Nutritional Uses Discussions on an amendment to Directive 89/398 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses have been underway for some time. A proposal was published in December 1994 and a Common Position was reached in June 1996. The proposal was adopted at the Environment Council on 8/9 December. The Directive reference number is not yet known. The only amendment relates to the temporary placing on the market of products not complying with the legal requirements. The following paragraph is added to the Directive (in Article 4): "To enable foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses and resulting from scientific and technological progress to be placed on the market rapidly, the Commission may, after consulting the Scientific Committee for Food and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13, authorize for a two-year period the placing on the market of foodstuffs which does not comply with the rules as to composition laid down by the specific directives referred to in Annex 1. "If necessary, the Commission may add in the authorization decision labelling rules relating to the change in composition." Scottish Office Letter, 18 December 1996 Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin It is understood that at a Regulatory meeting of Member States on the 11 December 1996, the third draft list of names was approved. The only additional item for the UK which was on the list was "Whitstable Oysters" which is granted a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). [For more informations see 14 November 1996] A 4th list is currently being prepared for discussion in early February. MAFF Letter 17 December 1996 Natural Mineral Waters The Directive amending Council Directive 80/777 on Natural Mineral Waters (adopted 23 July 1996) has been published in the Official Journal as Directive 96/70. It can be found in OJ L299, 23.11.96, p 26-28. The Directive entered into force on 13 December 1996. Member States have until 28 October 1998 to prohibit trade in products not complying with the Directive. The Commission has now commenced work on a Commission Directive laying down detailed rules in connection with 96/70. It is intended that this will concentrate on four items (from amended Article 11.1 or 80.777): limits for levels of constituents, labelling of high levels of constituents, conditions of use of ozone-enriched air and labelling of treatments. Other matters, such as methods of analysis and sampling procedures will be dealt with in a subsequent directive. The discussion on the use of ozone-enriched air follows an opinion given by the Scientific Committee for Food which suggests that usage should be restricted to carbonated waters with a pH saturation value below 7.2, in closed systems, for a certain duration. MAFF Letter, 17 December 1996 Miscellaneous Additives Amendment As previously noted [see 2 July 1996], a Common Position for an amendment to Directive 95/2 was adopted on the 25 June 1996. The amending Directive was formally adopted at the Environment Council on 9/10 December. It provides for the addition to Annex I of "E407a Processed Eucheuma Seaweed" at quantum satis (good manufacturing practice level). The text will be published in the Official Journal in due course. The amendment has to be implemented by Member States - probably by 25 September 1997 (although the version circulated by MAFF states "1996"). 2 December 1996 Progress on Novel Food Regulation A regulation on novel foods and food ingredients has been under development for several years. However, although the Council of Ministers had reached agreement on the text (the Common Position), it was subject to a second reading in the European Parliament. The Parliament proposed several changes which were not acceptable to the Council of Ministers. In this situation a Conciliation Committee is established between the 2 Institutions to reach agreement. Agreement has now been reached. The major outstanding issue related to labelling. The section dealing with labelling is Article 8 which now reads as follows: 1. Without prejudice to other requirements of the Community law concerning the labelling o foodstuffs, the following additional specific labelling requirements shall apply to foodstuffs in order to ensure that the final consumer is informed of: (a) any characteristic or food property such as: - composition - nutritional value or nutritional effects - intended use of the food which renders a novel food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. (b) the presence in the noel food or food ingredient of material which is not present in an existing equivalent food stuff, and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population; (c) the presence in the novel food or food ingredient of material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff, and which may give rise to ethical concerns; (d) the presence of an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification, the non-exhaustive list of which is laid down in Annex IA, Part I of Directive 90/220/EEC 2. In the absence of an existing equivalent food or food ingredient, appropriate provisions shall be adopted where necessary in order to ensure that consumers are adequately informed of the nature of the food or food ingredient. 3. Any detailed rules for implementing this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 [the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs procedure]. Additional changes include: a provision which requires that those substances exempted from the controls (food additives controlled by Directive 89/107, flavourings controlled by Directive 88/338 and extraction solvents controlled by Directive 88/344) by Article 2 are exempted only so long as the safety levels laid down in the Directives corresponds to the safety level of this Regulation. a provision which requires the Commission, in addition to a review in 5 years, to monitor the application of the Regulation and its impact on health, consumer protection, consumer information and the functioning of the internal market and, if necessary, to bring forward proposals the addition of a Commission statement which states that: "The Commission confirms that should it appear, in the light of experience that there are gaps in the system of protection of public health provided for by the existing legal framework, in particular in respect of processing aids, it will formulate appropriate proposals in order to fill those gaps." The text is now subject to formal adoption by the Council and the European Parliament. Scottish Office Letter - 14 November 1996 Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origins Regulation 2081/92 provides for the registration of protected names and geographical origins for agricultural products and foodstuffs. The Commission has previously circulated two lists under this Regulation which have been adopted (See earlier item on Origin Marking 12 June/1 July 1996). A further short list has now been received. The new proposed registrations include: Germany - meat-based products (3), cheeses (3) and bakery product (1) Austria - cheese (1) Italy - olive oil (1) Greece - cherries (1), table olives (1), gums and resins (2) and essential oils (1) Finland - potato (1) United Kingdom - fish and fish products (1) The United Kingdom item relates to the protection of geographical indication for "Whitstable Oysters". The letter invites comments on the listed names by early December. Commission - The Week in Europe, 14 November 1996 Genetically Modified Maize. The Commission has postponed a decision on authorisation for the placing on the market of genetically modified maize until three scientific committees have delivered their opinions. It now expects to deal with the issue in December, after it has received the opinions of the Scientific Committees on Food, on Animal Nutrition, and for Pesticides. Any decision needs to be taken on the best basis for assessing the effects on health and the environment, and to be widely acceptable, Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said. Scottish Office Letter, 12 November 1996 Proposed EC Limits for Lead and Cadmium in Foodstuffs Discussions on this issue have been progressing for some time. The latest development was that the Commission circulated a revised draft in late September and a Commission Working Group was held in Brussels on 30 September and 1 October. The latest draft includes a number of changes to previous drafts. Infant foods, for instance are now excluded from the proposal and distinctions have been made between fish in general and those species with naturally higher lead and cadmium levels. Comments made at the Working Group are to be considered by the Commission for incorporation into a revised draft of the proposal with any forthcoming comments received from Member States or from industry. The next meeting of the Working Group is planned for early 1997, at which the revised text will be discussed. The Commission has also announced its intention to have the revised text ready for presentation at the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs (StCF) following the Working Group meeting. The StCF is the forum where agreement on this issue will be reached. MAFF Letter, 21 October 1996 Quantitative Ingredient Declaration A "Common Position" on an amendment to the EC Food Labelling Directive had been adopted on the 15 June 1995. This would introduce more specific rules relating to quantitative ingredient declarations (QUID). The European Parliament subsequently proposed certain amendments which the Council were unwilling to accept. The proposal therefore went to a Conciliation Committee. The Committee eventually agreed to the necessary changes to the common position and these were formally agreed at a meeting of the Committee on 16 October 1996. The agreed text was not available at the time the circulation of the MAFF letter. It is expected that the proposal will now be formally adopted by the end of the year for implementation during 1997. MAFF Letter, 10 October 1996 Labelling of Beef and Beef Products The Commission has published proposals for two new Regulations to help restore confidence in beef and beef products following the difficulties arising from BSE. The first covers the identification and registration of cattle and the second is on the labelling of beef and beef products. Only summary details of the second are given here. In addition to the requirements on labelling already existing, if an operator or organization wishes to label beef or beef products in a detailed manner at the point of sale, it must meet the requirements of the Regulation.Each operator or organization shall submit a specification for approval to the competent authority of each Member State in which production or sale of the beef or beef products in question takes place. The specification shall indicate the information to be included on the label, the measures to be taken to ensure the accuracy of the information, the control system to be applied. Any specification which does not ensure a link being made between identification of the carcase, quarter, pieces of meat and meat products and the individual animal, or in the case of pieces of meat and meat products the animals concerned, shall be refused. Where a specification is approved, the operator or organization shall be entitled to label beef and beef products, provided that the label contains its name or logo. Provision is made for approval in different Member States and for products from third countries. Details are given as to the type of information which can be included on beef and beef products. Detailed rules may be developed regarding this information. The proposals are due for early discussion as a matter of urgency. MAFF Letter, 2 October 1996 Food Additives for Use in Flavourings - Draft Directive The Commission has published for comment a draft directive which would lay down those additives which may be used in flavourings. It is very brief and specifies the following: Only food additives mentioned in Directive 95/2 with the exception of those mentioned in the Annex may be used in flavourings Only colours mentioned in Part 1 of Annex V of Directive 94/36 may be used in flavourings sold to the end consumer. Without prejudice to the Directives 94/35. 94/36 and 95/2, food additives shall be used in accordance with good manufacturing practice, and at a level no higher than is necessary to achieve the intended purpose for storage and use of flavourings. The Annex lists the following additives, mentioned in Directive 95/2, as being not permitted for use in flavourings: E230, E231, E232, E233, E234, E235, E239, E242, E249, E250, E251, E252, E280, E281, E282, E283, E284, E285, E311, E312, E315, E316, E353, E476, E479b, E483, E520, E521, E522, E523, E535, E536, E538, E579, E620, E621, E622, E623, E624, E625, E626, E627, E628, E629, E630, E631, E632, E633, E634, E635, E912, E914, E927, E950, E957, E1105. Discussion is expected to start in late November with adoption planned for spring 1997.

This page gives a brief introduction to food additive legislation in Europe and contains a complete listing of E-numbers.

As part of the moves to create the Internal Market, the Community agreed that the control of food additives should be harmonised throughout the Community. Earlier attempts had only be partially successful and for the purposes of the Internal Market, full agreement was needed. In late 1988 (but published in 1989), the Community adopted a framework directive which set out the criteria by which additives would be assessed and provided for the adoption of more specific technical directives establishing the list of additives which could be used, the foods in which they could be used and any maximum levels. The Directive is: Council Directive of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption (89/107/EEC). This Directive requires that all permitted food additives are assessed by the European Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) for their safety against the criteria which are stated in the Annex to the Directive. The specific Directives were eventually adopted. 3 Directives now provide the requirements for additive legislation within the whole of the European Community. They are: Colours: European Parliament and Council Directive of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs (94/36/EC) Sweeteners: European Parliament and Council Directive of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs (94/35/EC) Food additives other than colours and sweeteners: European Parliament and Council Directive of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners (95/2/EC) The framework Directive was amended in 1994 by: European Parliament and Council Directive of 30 June 1994 amending Directive 89/107/EEC on the approximation of the laws of Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption (94/34/EC) The amendment provided that countries can nominate certain foods which have traditional characteristics and which, in the territory of the Member State, have not been permitted to contain certain additives. If it is subsequently agreed, the Member States concerned can continue to restrict the use of additives in these foods within their territory. Discussion on the list of these foods is now almost complete. In addition, there are amending directives under discussion which will make minor adjustments to the 3 specific Directives. One amendment was adopted in December 1996 adding E407a to the list. Work has progressed on defining specific purity criteria for the additives. These are adopted by additional Directives: Commission Directive of 26 July 1995 laying down specific purity criteria concerning colours for use in foodstuffs (95/45/EC) Commission Directive of 5 July 1995 laying down specific criteria of purity concerning sweeteners for use in foodstuffs (95/31/EC) For the United Kingdom, the Directives have been implemented into UK legislation by the following Regulations which came into effect on the 1st January 1996 Colours in Food Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No 3124) Sweeteners in Food Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No 3123) Miscellaneous Food Additives Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No 3187) The list below gives the reference number (the "E number") and the English name of all those additives listed in the 3 specific directives. It should be noted that some additives are restricted to a very limited number of foods whereas others may be permitted at the level necessary to achieve the desired technical effect ("quantum satis") with no numerical limit stated. The Directives or the implementing legislation in the Member States should be consulted for actual details. The numbering system is being adapted for international use by the Codex Alimentarius Commission who are developing an International Numbering System (INS). This will largely use the same numbers (but without the E).

The following are edited extracts from course material prepared by Dr David Jukes and given to students following courses in Food Law in the Department. They are not designed to provide an introduction to the topic without attending the related lectures. Treaty of Rome (as amended): Article 2: The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market and an economic and monetary union and by implementing the common policies or activities referred to in Articles 3 and 3a, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious and balance development of economic activities, sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment, a high degree of convergence of economic performance, a high level of employment and of social protection, the raising of the standard of living and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States. Article 3a: For the purposes set out in Article 2, the activities of the Community shall include, as provided in this Treaty and in accordance with the timetable set out therein: a) the elimination as between Member States of customs duties and quantitative restriction on the import and export of goods, and all other measures having equivalent effect; ..... c) an internal market characterized by the abolition, as between Member States, of obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital; ..... h) the approximation of the laws of Member States to the extent required for the functioning of the common market; ..... o) a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection; ..... s) a contribution to the strengthening of consumer protection; ..... Article 4: The tasks entrusted to the Community shall be carried out by the following institutions: a European Parliament a Council a Commission a Court of Justice a Court of Auditors Article 189: In order to carry out their task the Council and Commission shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, make regulations, issue directives, take decisions, make recommendations or deliver opinions A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. A directive shall be binding as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. Vertical vs Horizontal Legislation Vertical: Deal with particular foods (e.g. jams; cocoa and chocolate; sugars) and lay down standards which control all aspects of the food (e.g. raw materials; manufacturing process; ingredients; labelling) Horizontal: Deal with a particular aspect which is applicable to all foods or a group of foods (e.g. labelling; additives; packaging; hygiene) European Developments 1957 Treaty Establishing the European Economic Community ("Treaty of Rome") Abolition of tariff barriers 1963 Early Directives: Work on non-tariff barriers 1969 Harmonisation Programmes: Foodstuffs directives agreed using Article 100 1978 European Court Decisions: Belief that Article 30 would enable free trade 1985 Single European Act - providing for the Internal Market Programme: New impetus to harmonisation; new approach; Article 100A 1992 Treaty on European Union ("Maastricht Treaty") Modified procedures 1993 - ? Completion of Internal Market: Work continues Early Directives 1962 Colouring Matter 1964 Preservatives Specified permitted colours/preservatives but did not control levels or foods in which they could be used 1964 Fresh Meat Specified supervision by an official veterinarian Harmonisation Programmes 1969 Programme for the Elimination of the Technical Obstacles to Trade 43 areas including butter, pasta, ice-cream, soft drinks, beer, cheese, etc 1973 Industrial Policy Programme 41 areas similar to 1969 programme 1976 Withdrawal of Certain Proposals Treaty of Rome (as amended) Article 30 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall, without prejudice to the following provisions, be prohibited between Member States Article 36 The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of .... the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants;..... Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discriminations or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States The "Cassis de Dijon" Case In the absence if common rules, obstacles to movement within the Community resulting from disparities between the national laws relating to the marketing of a product must be accepted in so far as those provisions may be recognised as being necessary in order to satisfy mandatory requirements relating in particular to the effectiveness of fiscal supervision, the protection of public health, the fairness of commercial transactions and the defence of the consumer. There is therefore no valid reason why, provided they have been lawfully produced and marketed in one Member State, alcoholic beverages should not be introduced into any other Member State. Treaty of Rome (as amended): Article 7a The Community shall adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992, in accordance with the provisions of this Article and of Articles ..... and without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty. The internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty. Article 100a By way of derogation from Article 100 and save where otherwise provided in this Treaty, the following provisions shall apply for the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 7a. The Council shall, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b [co-decision] and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, adopt the measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulations or administrative action in Member States which have as their objective the establishment or functioning of the internal market. Article 148 (2) Where the Council is required to act by qualified majority, the votes of its members shall be weighted as follows: Austria 4 Belgium 5 Denmark 3 Finland 3 France 10 Germany 10 Greece 5 Ireland 3 Italy 10 Luxembourg 2 Netherlands 5 Portugal 5 Spain 8 Sweden 4 United Kingdom 10 For their adoption, acts of the Council shall require at least 62 votes in favour Internal Market - Foodstuffs Commission White Paper (1985) :In future foodstuffs proposals would be " .. limited to provisions justified by the need to protect public health provide consumers with information and protection in matters other than health ensure fair trading provide for the necessary public controls." 5 "Framework" Directives: Food Additives Food Labelling Foods for Particular Nutritional Uses Contact Materials Official Control Food Additives Framework Directive Agreed - Dec 1988 (89/107/EEC OJ L40, 11/02/89, p.27 and amended by 94/34 OJ L237, 10/9/94, p.1) Required adoption of specific directives to cover permitted additives permitted foods permitted levels To cover 24 categories including colours (94/36/EC OJ L237, 10/9/94, p.13) sweeteners (94/35/EC OJ L237, 10/9/94, p.3) preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, etc (95/2/EC OJ L61, 18/3/95, p.1) Food Labelling Directive Agreed - June 1989 (89/395/EEC OJ L186, 30/6/89, p.17)Removed national derogations in previous labelling directive Included (for UK) extension of date marking to frozen foods and long-life foods removal of "sell by" date coding and introduction of "use by" date) Nutrition Labelling was agreed in 1990 (90/496/EEC OJ L276, 6/10/90, p.40) Work continues on quantitative ingredient declaration (QUID) Official Control Directive Agreed - June 1989 (89/397/EEC OJ L186, 30/6/89, p.23)Provides minimum standards of control; gives guidance on What?

They amend an error in the Sweeteners in Food Regulations 1995. 24 June 1996 - Press Release - Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP 14/96) Two Novel Foods Cleared Two further novel foods have been cleared for sale in Great Britain. The foods are green tea extract for inclusion in tabletop sweeteners and guarana as an ingredient in "ready-to-consume" soft drinks, and as an infusate Green Tea Extract: Green tea extract (GTE), which is derived from the unfermented, dried leaves of the tea plant Camellia sinesis, is incorporated into a wide range of foods in Japan where claims are made that it reduces tooth decay. The application to the ACNFP was for its use at low level (0.1%) in tabletop artificial sweeteners. The Committee was satisfied as to its safety in this application Guarana: Guarana, which is obtained from the seeds of the South American plant Paullinia cupana, is used in small amounts as a flavouring substance in certain ready-to-consume soft drinks, as well as being sold as an infusate. The increasing use of products containing guarana in the UK in the early 1990s led to the ACNFPs evaluation of the safety of this novel food ingredient. Initial consideration focused on claims that some products were caffeine free. Such claims were not however substantiated by a MAFF survey and have since been withdrawn. The ACNFP concluded that guarana was safe for human consumption but advised that caffeine levels should be kept below the advisory levels of 125 mg/l recommended by the Committee on Toxicity and the Food Advisory Committee. DH letter, 14 June 1996 Proposed New Imported Food Regulations to replace the Imported Food Regulations 1984 The Government proposes to replace the general provisions of the Imported Food Regulations 1984 and the Imported Food (Scotland) Regulations 1985 with a new set of provisions for the whole of Great Britain which will cover all imports of foodstuffs from third countries other than foodstuffs of animal origin. The letter indicates that the proposed regulations are deregulatory in their intention. The provisions of the proposed new Regulations are broadly similar to those in the Imported Food Regulations 1984 in so far as they continue to provide for public health inspections, at ports and airports, of imports from outside the European Community of foodstuffs other than those covered by the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1992. Schedule 1 of the draft Regulations lists the products of animal origin exempt for the new Regulations. The single offence contained within the Regulations is that "No person shall import into Great Britain from a third country any food which is intended for sale for human consumption and which fails to comply with food safety requirements". It should be noted that this means that the offence in the present Regulations (relating to "unsound and unwholesome" food) has been dropped. Consideration is still be given to whether foods containing pesticide residues above the MRL would be covered by the new offence. Schedule 2 of the Regulations implements a change to the Transport Chapter IV para 2.2 of the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995 following a recently agreed amendment to the General Hygiene Directive 93/43. It provides a derogation for oils and fats transported in bulk in sea going vessels from the original requirement for dedicated transport for the bulk transport of foods in liquid. powder and granulate form. MAFF Letter - 12th June 1996 BSE CONTROLS - Proposed Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) Regulations 1996 When the present BSE scare erupted in late March (as a result of the revised advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee) the Government issued the Beef (Emergency Control) Order 1996, effective from the 29th March. It prohibited the sale for human consumption of meat from bovine animals which, at the time of slaughter, had more than one pair of permanent incisors. The aim was to exclude from the food chain meat from cattle more than 30 months old. The Order was a temporary measure under Section 13 of the Food Safety Act 1990. There were plans to replace it with a de-boning scheme. However, the plan is now to retain the controls but replace them with new Regulations using Section 16 of the Act. The controls would retain the main substance of the first Order but they will provide for additional flexibility when the proposed beef assurance scheme (BAS) becomes operational. The controls do extend the prohibition to possession for sale and offering or exposing for sale as well as sale itself. The proposed Regulations contain an Annex of countries (free of BSE) from where meat from bovine animals can be obtained and sold as an exception to the prohibition. The countries listed are: Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Mauritius, Namibia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay, USA, Zimbabwe. 4th June 1996 New Pesticide Residue Regulations The controls on pesticides in Great Britain have been modified following the making of the Pesticide (Maximum Residue Levels in Crops, Food and Feeding Stuffs)(Amendment) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 1487) They implement into Great Britain the requirements of Directives 95/38, 95/39 and 95/61. The first 2 of these set Community maximum residue levels for the pesticide concerned for the first time and Directive 95/61 sets Community maximum residue levels in substitution for levels (known as open positions) which were set for the pesticides concerned by Directive 93/58. The Regulations make certain additional changes including add spices to the list of groups of products to which Community maximum residue levels apply. 23 May 1996 - Department of Health Letter REVIEW OF THE FOOD PREMISES (REGISTRATION) REGULATIONS 1991 The Department of Health has been reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Food Premises (Registration) Regulations 1991 with a view to removing unnecessary burdens on business while maintaining appropriate safeguards on public health. As a result of the review, two proposals have been made: (i) the removal of the requirement on food businesses to register at least 28 days before starting to operate; (ii) to exempt the domestic premises of members of the Women's Institute (WI) who produce food for sale in WI markets from the requirements to register. Attached to the letter is a short paper explaining the proposals. With regard to (i), it indicates that the Department believes that the requirement to give 28 days notice deters some self-employed people from taking the opportunity to start up, particularly when the work may only be short-term, and tends to impact unfavourably on the small business operator. The new control would only require a business to make an application to register before starting to trade. Registration by a local authority would have to be completed "as soon as is practicable". With regard to (ii), at present WI members who produce food on a regular basis for sale in WI markets are required to register with the local authority. The paper indicates that this is unnecessary since: - the food is usually microbiologically of relatively low risk (for example, jam); and - the WI markets from which the food is sold will themselves be registered with the local authority. May 1996 ACNFP Report: Use of Interesterified Fats/Oils in Yellow Fat Spreads FOOD SAFETY CLEARANCE - Enzymic Interesterification Process The Government has accepted advice from the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP). It has extended the scope of food safety clearance already given for the use of an enzymic interesterification process to allow the production of fats and oils for use in yellow fat spreads. The previous application had resulted in the approval for the use of fats/oils produced by a novel enzymic interesterification process, in chocolate and confectionery fats and as an ingredient at up to 20% in frying fats. The manufacturer (Unilever) had sought permission to use fats/oils produced by the process in yellow fat spreads. Enzymically modified vegetable oil is produced by using enzymes to restructure the fats present in an oil, this is followed by conventional refining techniques. The enzymes intended for use in this process are currently being considered by the Food Advisory Committee (FAC) and the Committee on Toxicity (COT) During its considerations, the ACNFP noted that the basic principles of the process were the same as those considered previously, the only difference being the that the starting materials were adjusted to obtain fats/oils suitable for use in yellow fat spreads. The Committee reviewed data which suggested that the use of these fats/oils in margarine and spreads would have a beneficial nutritional effect in that it would reduce the amount of saturated, trans fatty acids in such spreads and hence reduce the intake from theses sources. Copies of the report are available from the Ministry. 3 May 1996 - MAFF Letter Proposed Eggs (Marketing Standards)(Amendment) Regulations 1996 These proposals will implement the Eggs (Marketing Standards) Regulations 1995. They will provide national authorities with enforcement powers foe the latest amendment to the Commission Regulation, No 2401/95. this allows the use of the term "eggs from caged hens" as a labelling option on egg packs or the term "cage production" to be stamped on eggs, subject to the criteria laid down in the EC Regulation. In addition, the Regulations will be amended to incorporate a definition of the term "sale" to clarity an issue with regard to the original Regulations and to supplement existing references to certain Articles contained in the Commission rules on egg marketing which require the use of the official mark. It is intended to introduce the amending Regulations in July 1996. The Regulations are enforced by the MAFF Egg Marketing Inspectorate. 1 May 1996 - MAFF Letter DEFINITION AND DETERMINATION OF DIETARY FIBRE Following continuing discussions (and controversy) about how to define dietary fire for labelling purposes, MAFF has issued draft amended guidance to take into account developments in food products and at an EC level. UK practice has been to require data on the fibre content of foods to be declared on the basis of "non starch polysaccharides (NSP) as measured by the technique of Englyst". This definition was used by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy to recommend a daily fibre intake of 18g (the Dietary Reference Value - DRV). Subsequently, the Food Advisory Committee gave guidance on the use of claims based on this figure. However most other EC countries use the AOAC method for the determination of fibre. The draft guidance will now permit the use of alternative techniques but recommends that, when data is not based on the UK method, then the label should include a statement clarifying the basis of any declaration and the method of analysis used. Similarly, if claims about fibre are made on the basis of definitions and methods of measurement recommended in other countries, the claims cannot be related to the UK's DRV of 18g per day. Additional information will be needed relating the claim to an appropriate DRV. The MAFF letter requests comments by 17 June 1996. 30th April 1996 - PSD Letter Updating of UK Regulations on Pesticides and European Legislation on Plant Protection Products The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) has circulated proposed changes to these controls. Three draft Regulations were circulated: 1) Draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations. The proposed amendments are described as being minor amendments to the Control of Pesticide Regulations 1986. They amend the scope of the controls, they amend aspects relating to the recover of products in the event of a breach f the Regulations, to access to information by the public and changes to the Consents provided by the Regulations. 2) Draft Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations. These would be new controls introducing requirements similar to those applied to pesticides. 3) Plant Protection Products (Amendment) Regulations. These implement certain Commission Directives into UK legislation and make adjustments to take into account item 2) Comments were requested by 13th June. 15th March 1996 - MAFF Letter DRAFT DAIRY PRODUCTS (HYGIENE) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS The Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 implement EC Directive 92/46, as amended, which harmonises EC hygiene rules on productions and trade in milk and milk products. Provisions include structural requirements, hygiene and microbiological standards. The Regulations apply to England and Wales. The purpose of the amending Regulations is to implement: (1) EC Decision 95/165 laying down uniform criteria for small businesses processing milk based products that wish to benefit from derogations from certain structural and equipment requirements of the Directive. The Decision: increases the upper limit on the amount of milk that can be processed annually by small businesses benefitting from these derogations. This has already been implemented administratively in the UK; requires benefitting businesses to keep records that will enable enforcement officers to ascertain that the business complies with the upper limit; requires new applicants wishing to benefit from the derogations to apply in writing and to provide information in support of that request; requires that derogations should only be given if they do not adversely affect hygieneic conditions of production. (2) EC Decision 95/340 establishing the list of third countries approved for the export of milk and milk based products to the Euorpean Union. (3) certain other requirements of Directive 92/46, as amended, relating to the levels of somatic cell counts in raw buffaloes' milk for processing into milk products (reflecting EC Corrigenda) and plate counts in pasteurised milk prior to a second heat treatment(ommitted in error from the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations). Comments were required by 30th April with the plan to implement amending Regulations during June 1996 14 March 1996 - DH letter DH GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS: re �FOOD HANDLERS: FITNESS TO WORK� In August 1995, the Department of Health publish a Document Entitled �Food Handlers - Fitness to Work�. It was directed at food businesses, enfrocement officers and health professionals. It provided detailed information upon which to base decisions on how to assess the employment of people who may have suffered illness which could be tranmitted to other people via food which they are handling. It is available for �2.50 from the Department of Helath, PO Box 410, Wetherby, LS23 7LN, UK. The Deprtment has now published simplified guidance for both food business managers and for food handlers. The first contains relevant sections of the full document. The second is a four page leaflet giving key responsibities for food handlers relating to when to wash hands and when you should �tell your boss�. Both these documents are available free from the Department of Health at the address in the first paragraph. 26th February 1996 - Press Release ACNFP 5/96 GOVERNMENT GIVES FOOD SAFETY CLEARANCE TO NOVEL STARTER CULTURE The Government has accepted advice from the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) and has given food safety clearance to a novel starter culture for use in cultured milk produced by MD Foods. The novel starter culture (Enterococcus faecium strain K77D) is the second starter culture to be considered by the ACNFP, and has been approved in Denmark since 1993. In assessing the safety of this starter culture, the Committee was aware of increasing numbers of cases of infection in hospitals with strains of E. faecium that are resistant to antibiotics, especially vancomycin. However, the Committee was satisfied that the particular strain is non-pathogenic, and sensitive to a range of antibiotics including vancomycin. The Committee's safety evaluation concentrated particularly on the history and identification of this particular strain, and the specification and quality control criteria used to ensure a consistent product.

The Ministry has produced guidance on the use of this mark to ensure a uniform approach by industry and to avoid consumer confusion. The notes were last revised in 1993. The latest draft takes into account the provisions of the Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations 1995. The Ministry has asked for comments on the draft revised notes by 1st November 1996. Scottish Office Letter, 22 August 1996 Proposed Amendments to the Plastic Materials and Articles in Contact with Food Regulations 1992 Following the adoption of a further EC Directive (96/11) on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (which amends the earlier Directive (90/128)), proposals have been issued for its implementation into UK legislation. The main effects of the amendments are: to add to the incomplete list of additives to amend the list of monomers and other starting substances to extend the life of some list B monomers and other starting substances until 1 January 2002, and to amend the prohibition from "trade in and use" to "manufacture and importation into the Community" to take into account long life plastics made with list B substances It is proposed to issue amendment Regulations late in 1996 to come into effect on the 1 January 1997. British Retail Consortium Letter, 21 August 1996 Draft Retail Industry Guide to Good Hygiene Practice The 1995 Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations allow for the issuing of Codes of Good Hygiene Practice which are recognised by the Ministers as providing guidance on the action to be taken to comply with the requirements of the Regulations. This type of document is based on provisions in Article 5 off the Directive on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs (EEC/93/43). A Draft Retail Industry Guide to Good Hygiene Practice has now been circulated for comment. It has been prepared by a Working Party consisting of the British Retail Consortium, National Association of Master Bakers, Scottish Grocers Federation with input from LACOTS and the Department of Health. The draft is based on a "template" for such Codes produced by the Department of Health. In addition to providing guidance on the General Food Hygiene Regulations, it also provides guidance on compliance with the 1995 Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations. The British Retail Consortium is leading the Working Group and copies of the draft are available from them at Bedford House, 69/79 Fulham High Street, London SW6 3JW. The consultation period ends on 29 November 1996. 14 August 1996 Proposed Meat Products (Hygiene)(Amendment) Regulations 1996 The Ministry is proposing to issue Regulations which would amend the Meat Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1994. Many of the proposed amendments result from the adoption of Directive 95/68 agreed in December 1995 and which amended Directive 77/99. The Ministry letter indicates that there are 4 main aspects to the proposed changes: Some deregulatory measures (e.g. a provision to allow the disinfection of transport vehicles at a site away from the meat products premises, and a derogation from requiring offices to be provided in plants where the enforcement officer is not required to be permanently present). Measures which have already been introduced on an administrative basis by guidance etc. (e.g. allowing unwrapped/packaged products which are sold in bulk to bear the health mark on the bulk container and the accompanying documentation). Other measures (e.g. acceptance that in areas where dry mixing of products is performed cleaning and disinfection processes need not make use of water,) Corrections (e.g. correction of a typographical error and the removal of references to the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984). The consultation period ends on the 25 September with Regulations expected later in the year. 5 August 1996 Enforcement Codes of Practice Two new enforcement Codes of Practice (numbers 19 and 20) have been issued under Section 40 of the Food Safety Act and a revised version of Code number 8. Code of Practice No. 19: Qualifications and Experience of Authorised Officers and Experts. This Code sets out the obligations on food authorities which are necessary to meet the requirements of the Additional Food Control Measures Directive (93/99) which supplemented the controls contained in the Official Control of Foodstuffs Directive (89/397). Article 2 of the Directive 93/99 states: "Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have, or have access to, a sufficient number of suitably qualified and experienced staff, in particular in areas such as chemistry, food chemistry, veterinary medicine, medicine, food microbiology, food hygiene, food technology and law so that the controls referred to in Article 5 of Directive 89/397/EEC can be adequately carried out." The Code requires the authorities to ensure that all officers are qualified and experienced and then goes on to indicate which qualifications are considered appropriate. It also points out that officers need to have a sound knowledge of the general principles in criminal law and enforcement practice which would include the due diligence/reasonable precautions defences and the rules which relate to interviewing persons. Guidance is given on the continued employment of officers who do not have the specified qualifications. Code of Practice No 20: Exchange of Information between Member States of the EU on Routine Food Control Matters As with Code 19 above, this Code arises out of the requirements of Directive 93/99. Article 6 of the Directive requires Member States to provide assistance in the supervision of food law and in all proceeding for infringements of food law. It also requires the appointment of a single liaison body which will assist and co-ordinate communication. LACOTS has been designated as the UK liaison body but central government will maintain a supervisory role and will be responsible for action for certain matters. Information is given on the action to be taken by a food authority when they receive a request for assistance and when they require assistance from another Member State. The Code indicates the important procedures to be followed when obtaining information which could be used as evidence in court proceedings. In these cases, the provisions of the "European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters" apply (with the exception of Ireland) and consent must be obtained via the UK Central Authority which is part of the Judicial Co-operation Unit of the Home Office. Code of Practice No 8 (Revised): Food Standards Inspections This revised Code emphasises the role of enforcement officers in advising food businesses on how to comply with the law; sates the need to ensure that such officers are properly qualified; and the co-ordinating role of bodies such as LACOTS and local authority liaison groups. It includes an "inspection rating scheme" which is considered appropriate for allocating a risk to premises and, based on the risk, it indicates a minimum frequency of inspection. For the purposes of this code, "food standards" means legal requirements covering the quality, composition, labelling, presentation and advertising of food and of materials or articles in contact with food. MAFF Letter, 30 July 1996 Proposed Amendment to the Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulations 1995 The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/77) implemented the EC Directive on the subject (91/321/EEC). An amendment to the Directive was adopted in early 1996 (96/4/EC) and the consultation letter contains details of how the amendment will be implemented into UK legislation. It is proposed to issue Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula (Amendment) Regulations later this year to be effective from 1 January 1997. The main changes are: changes to the labelling changes to compositional criteria new reference values for nutrition labelling for foods intended for infants and young children There is intended to be a transitional period until 31 March 1999 during which time infant formula and follow-on formula which met the requirements of the Regulations before amendment, can still be sold. MAFF Press Release, 24 July 1996 BSE - Government Statement Relating to Sheep Douglas Hogg, Minister of Agriculture at MAFF made the following statement on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's) to Parliament today. "Scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of sheep and goats, has been known for over 200 years. There is no evidence that it is linked to Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (CJD) in humans. CJD occurs at approximately the same level in countries with and without scrapie. "I have recently received advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) that BSE could, theoretically, become established in the sheep flock. They note that in experiments (the results of which have been published) one out of six sheep experimentally challenged orally with BSE brain material succumbed to an encephalopathy; and that when their brain material was tested in mice the same strain type as BSE was found. They note also the possibility that some sheep could have been exposed to feed contaminated with the BSE agent before the ruminant feed ban was introduced in 1988. "The Committee point out that there is no evidence of BSE occurring naturally in the sheep flock. However the SEAC concern is, whilst there is no evidence to this effect, scrapie might be masking BSE in the sheep flock. On the basis of present knowledge SEAC have made three recommendations. "Firstly, that the Government should consider this issue further with EU partners. We have started that process. We are keeping in close contact with the French Government, whose scientific committee equivalent to SEAC has made certain recommendations on the basis of the laboratory evidence about BSE in sheep, and of concerns about scrapie. At the Agriculture Council on 22 July Commissioner Fischler announced that the Commission intends to formulate proposals for the removal of certain offals of sheep, goats and deer from the human and animal food chain. These proposals are to be considered initially by the Standing Veterinary Committee in early August, and then by other EU expert committees. "SEAC's second recommendation was that the Government should give early consideration to removing the brains of sheep, whatever their source, over six months, from the human food chain. The agriculture departments are today issuing for consultation a proposal for the heads of all sheep and goats to be removed and destroyed in the same way as specified bovine material. This measure would go rather further than SEAC suggested, taking into account the practical difficulty of distinguishing the age of sheep at slaughter. It should not have a major economic impact as the vast majority of sheep's heads are already destroyed. It is worth noting that sheepmeat for human consumption comes predominantly from young lambs under 12 months. "We intend to reach a final decision in the light of responses to this consultation and to progress of EU discussion. Action on this issue at EU level would be preferable, but it is desirable that these measures are put in place promptly. There is no direct threat to human health; the action now being proposed is precautionary, to respond to what appears no more than a theoretical risk. "SEAC's third recommendation is that further research should be done to establish the levels of scrapie occurring naturally in sheep and to further investigate the risks of BSE transmission to the UK sheep flock. We accept this. Some relevant research has already begun. I emphasise that these steps are being taken out of an abundant of caution. There is no direct threat to human health. With the exception of the consumption of brains, there is absolutely no reason for anybody to change their eating habits. I repeat: there is no evidence at all that in field conditions BSE has got into the national flock; but as that possibility cannot be wholly excluded we are proposing to take these precautionary measures. A copy of the press release (including the full text of the SEAC advice) is available on the Web at: http://www.coi.gov.uk/coi/depts/GMF/coi0850c.ok Press Release, 18 July 1996 MEAT HYGIENE SERVICE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 1995/96 The Meat Hygiene Service's Annual Report and Accounts for 1995/96 have been published. This is the Agency's first Annual Report. It includes a factual account of the functions, activities and achievements of the Agency during its first year of operation, summarises future plans and includes fully audited Accounts. Mr Johnston McNeill, Chief Executive of the Meat Hygiene Service said "The Meat Hygiene Service has been in existence for just over a year. The Annual Report and Accounts documents the tremendous progress made by the Agency during this first year of operation. The successes of the first year, and the laying of a sound foundation for the future, are a reflection of the quality of the Agency's staff ". Exceptionally, the Annual Report also includes a section on BSE which describes the enforcement role of the Agency. The State Veterinary Service (SVS) carries out frequent, unannounced visits to all beef plants to monitor the work of the MHS in ensuring that Specified Bovine Material (SBM) controls are rigorously enforced. This section documents the failures, many of which are of a relatively minor nature, identified by the State Veterinary Service in the enforcement of SBM controls since September 1995. In view of its front-line position in enforcing BSE controls in licensed premises, the MHS wishes to keep all its customers informed of the actions it has taken to ensure rigorous enforcement of the controls in beef slaughterhouses. Background Notes The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS), an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), was launched on 1 April 1995. It took over from some 300 local authorities responsibility for enforcing meat hygiene, inspection and animal welfare at slaughter legislation in 1,875 licensed fresh meat premises in England, Scotland and Wales. Public health and animal welfare are safeguarded in plants by Official Veterinary Surgeons and Meat Inspectors working as inspection teams. The MHS headquarters is based in York and there are six Regional Offices located at Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Taunton, Wolverhampton and York. The MHS is also responsible for enforcing BSE controls, notably the enhanced specified bovine material (SBM) controls in licensed beef plants, and supervision of the Over Thirty Month and Calf Processing schemes. The State Veterinary Service (SVS) carries out frequent, unannounced visits to all beef plants to monitor the work of the MHS in ensuring that SBM controls are rigorously enforced. These audits have identified a number of failures. Many are of a relatively minor nature and relate to problems with staining or with record keeping. As such they would not present a direct risk to public or animal health. There has been a dramatic and sustained reduction in the number of unsatisfactory SVS visits to inspect SBM controls in beef plants since September 1995. Copies of the MHS's Annual Report and Accounts 1995/96 may be purchased from branches of HMSO. Scottish Office Letter, 9 July 1996 Amendments to Bread and Flour Regulations The Government has issued the Bread and Flour (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 1501). They amend the Bread and Flour Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No 3202) so as to remove the controls on the use of enzyme preparations in the manufacture of bread. MAFF Letter 4 July 1996 Deregulation (Improvement of Enforcement Procedures)(Food Safety Act 1990) Order 1996 Using powers contained in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 (DCOA), the Government has issued an Order which requires enforcement authorities to issue a "Notice Prior to Service of an Improvement Notice" before issuing an Improvement Notice. This notice will give food business proprietors a period, specified in the notice (a minimum of 14 days has been suggested , but is not stated in the Order), in which they will have the right to make either written or oral representations to the enforcement authority about the proposed enforcement action before an improvement notice can be served. If the proprietor wishes to make oral representation, he or she will need to contact the enforcement authority within a fixed period of days (a minimum of 7 days has been suggested) to arrange the necessary meeting. The Ministry letter states that "the Order formalizes good enforcement principles which are already recognized by many local authorities and serves to make these a legal obligation. It also reflects the Government's policy to extend the provisions of the DCOA to all enforcement areas, bringing food safety into line with arrangements already made in other areas such as the Health and Safety at Work Act." The Order comes into force on the 19 July 1996. DH Letter 3 July 1996 Consultation on Draft Guidance on Information about Infant Feeding The Department of Health has issued a draft of a booklet which will offer guidance on two issues arising from the adoption of the EC Directive 91/321/EEC on Infant Formulae and Follow-on Formulae which was implemented in the UK by the Infant Formulae and Follow-on Formulae Regulations 1995 (SI No 77). The Directive requires that "Member States shall ensure that objective and consistent information is provided on infant and young child feeding for use by families and those involved in the field of infant and young child nutrition". The booklet will provided detailed guidance on how this should happen in the UK. Regulation 21 of the UK Regulations includes reference to "guidelines drawn up the Secretary of State" on the donation of equipment and/or informational and educational materials by manufacturers and distributors of infant formula. The booklet will set out the circumstances under which such donations can be made. The Department has asked that comments on the Guidance should be made by September 10th. MAFF Press Release, 1 July 1996 Amendments to Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 Regulations to amend the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 were laid before Parliament 1 July 1996. They are intended to come into force on 22 July. The main features of the regulations (the Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Amendment) Regulations) are: an upper limit of 2 million litres per year for businesses benefiting from structural and equipment derogations in the Regulations; introduction of certain conditions (such as keeping of records) for businesses benefiting from these derogations; introduction of the EC list of third countries approved for the export of milk and milk based products to the European Union The Regulations implement EC Commission Decisions 95/165 and 95/340. They also make minor corrections to the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations. 1 July 1996 New Lot Marking Regulations 1996 New Food (Lot Marking) Regulations 1996 come into force on the 1 July 1996 (SI 1996 No 1502). The Regulations revoke and replace the Food (Lot Marking) Regulations 1992. The new Regulations implement Directive 89/396 as amended. They continue the requirements that food which has been produced, prepared or packaged as part of a lot is marked or labelled so as to enable the lot to be identified. The Regulations have been made with a view to simplifying the 1992 Regulations. 1 July 1996 New Food Labelling Regulations 1996 New Food Labelling Regulations (SI 1996 No 1499) have been issued and came into effect on the 1 July 1996. They consolidate and replace: the Food Labelling Regulations 1984 the Food Labelling (Scotland) Regulations 1984 the Milk Labelling (Scotland) Regulations 1983. The main purpose of the Regulations is to implement Council Directive 79/112/EEC but they also incorporate the requirements of : Commission Directive 87/250/EEC on the indication of alcoholic strength by volume in the labelling of alcoholic beverages for sale to the ultimate consumer, Council Directive 89/398/EEC relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses, Council Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs, and Commission Directive 94/54/EC concerning the compulsory indication on the labeling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other that those provided for in Council Directive 79/112/EEC Since the new Regulations also contain reserved descriptions for some cheeses and creams which had been contained in the Cheese and Cream Regulations 1995, the latter are repealed from the 1 July 1996. The Ministry has also issued some additional information as "Food Labelling Regulations 1996: Guidance Notes".

The following items are described on this page in reverse chronological order: 27 June 1996 ADDITIVES - Common Position for Sweeteners' Amendment 27 June 1996 Commission Weekly Information (BSE and beef) 26 June 1996 ADDITIVES - Amended proposal on "traditional" foods 25 June 1996 EGG SIZE GRADES - Revised Proposal 25 June 1996 FLAVOURINGS - Adoption of Regulation Laying Down a Community Procedure for Flavouring Substances 20 June 1996 Commission Weekly Information (BSE, beef and Britain) 18 June 1996 EGG SIZE GRADES - Amending Regulation Withdrawn 12 June 1996 EGG SIZE GRADES - Amending Regulation 11 June 1996 BSE - Relaxation of controls of UK beef derivatives 12 June 1996 / 1 July 1996 ORIGNIN MARKING - Adoption of Registered Protected Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin 10 June 1996 ORIGIN MARKING - EC Regulation (2081/92) - Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin June 1996 OFFICIAL CONTROL - EU Food Sampling Programme 1996 3 June 1996 CONTAMINANTS - Mycotoxins - EC Permitted Levels 30 May 1996 Commission Weekly Information (BST) 21 May 1996 PESTICIDE RESIDUES - Amendments adopted 19 April 1996 HYGIENE - Moves towards consolidation 29 March 1996 LABELLING - Directive amending Directive 94/54/EC concerning labelling of certain foodstuffs MAFF Letter 27 June 1996 Sweeteners - Common Position adopted for Sweeteners' Amending Directive Political agreement had been reached on the Common Position for a Directive amending the Sweeteners Directive (94/35) at the Internal Market Council on 28 May. Formal adoption took place at the Environment Council on 25 June. The Common Position will now be referred to the European Parliament for a second reading before being returned, with any proposals for amendment, to the Council to be considered for formal adoption. The amendments are designed to update the Directive to take into account a number of technical developments in the field of sweeteners since the original Directive and to improve the text (e.g. there is a definition of quantum satis which was missing from the original Directive). Commission Weekly News - 27 June 1996 BSE and Beef There were further discussions at the European Council meeting in Florence on this topic. The European Council welcomed the Commission's framework for the eradication of BSE in cattle in the UK and for the restoration of the single market in beef. This framework sets out the further action that the UK is taking, which, when in place, will enable the step-by-step relaxation of current restrictions on UK exports of bovine products. The British plan for measures to eliminate BSE was approved by the Standing Veterinary Committee last week. The European Council invited the Commission to present the appropriate decisions when it considers that the necessary conditions, based on scientific and technical advice, have been fulfilled. Such decisions are to be taken exclusively on the basis of public health and objective scientific criteria, in accordance with existing procedures. 26 June 1996 Revised Proposal for Decision on the maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain foods The Commission had adopted on the 19 April 1995 a proposed decision on maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain foods. The aim would be to allow Member States to retain national prohibitions for food which had traditionally been produced without certain additives. The proposal was required since certain Member States wish to retain prohibitions even though the new Community food additives directives would allow their use. The following foods were listed by the Commission following requests from Member States with an indication of what additives would be prohibited: Germany - beer - all except propellant gas Greece - 'feta' cheese - all France - 'traditional French bread' - all France - preserved truffles - all France - preserved snails - all France - goose, duck and turkey preserves ('confit') - all except preservatives Austria - 'Bergkase' - all except preservatives Finland - 'Mammi' - all except preservatives The proposal was given a first reading in the European Parliament on 16 January 1996. The Commission has now amended its proposal to take into account the Parliament's comments. The amendments were adopted on 6 May 1996 and published in the Official Journal on 26 June 1996. The amendment makes it clear that the foodstuffs are those which are prepared using traditional methods. The list now reads: Germany - beer brewed following German tradition - all except propellant gas Greece - 'feta' following Greek tradition - all France - 'traditional French bread' - all France - preserved truffles following French tradition - all France - preserved snails following French tradition - all France - goose, duck and turkey preserves ('confit') following French tradition - all except preservatives Austria - 'Bergkase' following Austrian tradition - all except preservatives Finland - 'Mammi' following Finnish tradition - all except preservatives The proposal will now be considered by the Council. MAFF Letter 25 June 1996 Egg Size Grades The Commission has prepared a revised draft proposal (See earlier items on Egg Size Grades) which will be put to the Eggs and Poultry Management Committee on 16 July. The following grades would be defined: XL - VERY LARGE: 73g and more L - LARGE: from 63g up to 73g M - MEDIUM: from 53g up to 63g S - SMALL: under 53g On packs, the weight grading would be indicated by the respective letter as indicated above, which may be supplemented by the corresponding terms and weight ranges. The revised date of application would be 1 August 1996 with the same transition period. MAFF Letter 2 July 1996 Adoption of EU Regulation Laying Down a Community Procedure for Flavouring Substances Used or Intended for Use In or On Foodstuffs (Regulation ***/96) At the Environment Council Meeting on 25 June 1996, the above Regulation was formally adopted. The Regulation provides for a programme which will ultimately lead to the positive listing of substances used in or on foods as flavourings. It therefore provides rules for the implementation of the requirements of Directive 88/388/EEC on "the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production". The Regulation contains an Annex listing general use criteria which must be met by all flavouring substances Member States must notify the Commission (within one year) a list of the flavouring substances which may be used in or on foodstuffs marketed in their territory. Certain specified information must be supplied at the time of notification. Following scrutiny, the Commission will publish a register of the substances the legal use of which in one Member State must be recognized by the other Member States. The register will then be formally adopted (within one year of the notification period). A provision allows for modification of the register if new information relating to public health arises. A programme to check whether the substances on the register meet the general use criteria will be adopted (within 10 months of the adoption of the register). This will be completed within 5 years so as to provide a list of flavouring substances the use of which is authorized to the exclusion of all others. Commission Weekly News - 20 June 1996 BSE, Beef and Britain Protecting human health is the overriding principle for the Commission in relation to measures to eradicate BSE, Commission President Jacques Santer said yesterday [19 June 1996]. The Commission will maintain this position regardless of political pressure, Santer told the European Parliament, using the best and most up-to-date scientific knowledge as the basis for decision-making. A position paper prepared by the Commission for the Florence European Council this weekend outlines the procedures that it believes are necessary to enable agreement on the gradual lifting of the export ban on UK beef. These include a package of thorough measures to eliminate BSE, to protect human health by preventing exposure to the BSE agent, and to restore consumer confidence. Any decisions at EU level would have to be taken up by Community inspections to verify effective implementation. The Commission expects the UK to end its non-cooperation policy towards the EU, without which there can be no agreement at Florence, Santer said. A Multi-disciplinary Committee on BSE is being established, to ensure that the scientific advice given to the Commission takes into account the widest possible range of expertise. A steering group has been nominated to set up the committee. MAFF Letter 18 June 1996 Egg Size Grades A further letter from MAFF now indicates that the proposed amendments described previously have been withdrawn by the Commission. This is because the proposed use of the term JUMBO (for eggs of 73g and more) would create a legal problem in Germany where the term 'Jumbo' has apparently been registered as a trade mark. The proposal will therefore be represented at the next Management Committee with an alternative term denoting the largest eggs. At the moment MAFF indicate that the Commission seem to prefer 'Very Large' which is easily translated into each of the Member State languages and cannot be confused with any quality indication as suggested by the terms 'extra' or 'super'. MAFF Letter - 12 June 1996 Egg Size Grades: Regulation No ***/96 amending Regulation No 1274/91 introducing detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation No 1907/90 on certain marketing standards for eggs. Agreement has been reached on 11th June at the Eggs and Poultry Meat Management Committee to this new Regulation. Minor changes are being made to the formal text and it will then be published in the Official Journal. It will introduce revised categories for different sizes of eggs. The new provision (by amending Article 8 of Regulation 1274/91) will require the use of the following terms for Grade A eggs: JUMBO: 73g and more LARGE: from 63g up to 73g MEDIUM: from 53g up to 63g SMALL: under 53g Provision is made for equivalent terms for large packs of eggs (by amendment to Article 33). Certain additional changes are made so as to incorporate Swedish language terms. The Regulation is expected to be effective from 1st July 1996 but a transitional period will be allowed until 31 December 1997. 11 June 1996 BSE Controls The Commission adopted (11th June 1996) a Decision (96/362) specifying the processing techniques to be used in the production of beef-derived gelatine and tallow in the UK. The Decision amends Decision 96/239 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). After these requirements have been met and checked, the Commission will consult the Standing Veterinary Committee to fix a date on which exports of gelatine and tallow can be resumed. In the case of semen, the export ban can be lifted without any preconditions or controls. 12 June 1996 / 1 July 1996 Protected Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin On the 12 June 1996 the Commission adopted Regulation 1107/96 which lists those geographical indication and designations of origin which have been registered and protected under Regulation 2081/92. An additional supplementary list was subsequently adopted on the 1 July 1996. The use of these geographical indications and designations of origin will be confined to producers in a limited area who comply with closely defined rules of production. The Commission has also proposed a five-year transitional period, during which Member States may allow the continued use of registered names, on certain conditions, for products that do not meet the criteria for listed food products. For the United Kingdom, the following are given protection: Orkney beef Orkney lamb Scottish beef Scottish lamb Shetland lamb White Stilton cheese/Blue Stilton cheese West Country farmhouse Cheddar cheese Beacon Fell traditional Lancashire cheese Swaledale cheese/Swaledale ewes' cheese Bonchester cheese Buxton blue Dovedale cheese Single Gloucester Jersey Royal potatoes Herefordshire cider/perry Worcestershire cider/perry Gloucestershire cider/perry Newcastle brown ale Kentish ale and Kentish strong ale Rutland bitter Scottish Office Letter - 10th June 1996 EC Regulation (2081/92) - Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin Following a request from the French delegation, the Commission has asked Member States to consider extending the scope of this Regulation so as to apply it to additional agricultural products and foodstuffs. The additional suggestions are: salt, pasta other processed foods cochineal cork At present the Regulation can be used for the following: A. Products for human consumption fresh meat (and offal); meat-based products (cooked, salted, smoked, etc.); cheeses; other products of animal origin (eggs, honey, milk products excluding butter, etc.)oils and fats (butter, margarine, oils, etc.); fruits, vegetables, cereals, whether or not processed; fish, molluscs, fresh crustaceans and ...-based products; other Annex II products (spices, etc.). B. Foodstuffs listed in Annex I to Regulation 2081/92 beer; natural mineral waters and spring waters; beverages made from plant extracts; bread, pastry, cakes, confectionery, biscuits and other baker's wares; natural gums and resins. C Agricultural Products listed in Annex II to Regulation 2081/92 hay; essential oils. EU Food Sampling Programme 1996 : Commission Recommendation of 17th April 1996 Concerning a Coordinated Programme for the Official Control of Foodstuffs for 1996 (96/290/EC) (OJ L109/24, 3.5.96) The Commission has published its requirements for the 1996 coordinated sampling programme as provided for by the Official Control of Foodstuffs Directive (89/397/EEC). For 1996, the Commission is requesting Member States to sample the following. Suggestions are made for the methods of sampling and analysis. Although sampling rates have not been set Member States are recommended to ensure that the number of samples taken is sufficient to provide an overview of the subject under consideration in each Member State. Example record sheets are provided in the Official Journal to ease comparability of the results Microbiological assessment of dried and fermented ready-to-eat meats and meat products. These products are to be sampled at the point of retail sale. The samples are to be subjected to microbiological examination for the presence of Salmonellae, E.coli 0157:H7 and enumeration of Staphlococcus aureus. The products pH and water activity are to be noted. The results are to be recorded in 3 categories: dry and semi-dry sausage, undried sausage and raw (country-style) hams. Migration of Plasticizers. Limits on the amount of plasticizers (substances added to plastic to enhance their suppleness) permitted to migrate to foods are specified in Directive 90/128/EEC. They contribute a high level to the overall migration of substances from plasticized plastics into foods. These samples will assess compliance with the legal limits. Temperature control of chilled foods on sale to the final consumer. The Directive on the hygiene of foodstuffs (93/43/EEC) requires foods which are likely to support the growth of pathogenic micro-organisms or the formation of toxins to be kept at temperatures which would not result in a risk to health. The programme is to look at 4 categories of foods to assess their temperatures at the point of sale. The categories are: chilled cooked foods to be eaten without further reheating; chilled cooked foods requiring reheating only (not a full cooking process) prior to consumption; raw prepared foods to be eaten after a full heat process; raw preepared foods to be eaten raw. Benzo(a)pyrene in smoked pork products. The Directive on flavourings (88/388/EEC) has set maximum limits on the levels of the smoked aroma substance 3,4 benzo-pyrene in foodstuffs. Checks are to be conducted to assess the levels of the substance in smoked port products. 3 June 1996 - MAFF Letter Mycotoxins - EC Permitted Levels The EC Commission has been having discussions for some time with regard to setting limits for mycotoxins for certain foods. The letter reported on continuing discussions, particularly resulting from a meeting on the 28 May 1996 when a revised working document was discussed. The document assumes �ideal sampling and optimal methods of analysis, to be agreed at a later date� which caused the UK delegation some concern that values were being discussed in isolation from these issues. Aflatoxins: levels are being proposed in the working document for groundnuts, cereals, dried fruits and milk. Dried fruits may be listed separately; spices may be added. Ochratoxin A: cereals and cereal products and raw coffee are presently listed but this may be modified to cereals, raw coffee and processed coffee. Patulin: A limit is proposed for the following apple products - apple juice, cider, puree. Most Member States appear to favour these controls and do not have the reservations which the UK have with regard to the practical and financial consequences of an excessively regulatory approach. Discussions will continue as the Commission further develops the proposal. EC Weekly Information - Issued 30th May 1996 BST The use of bovine somatotropin (BST), a growth hormone that increases milk production by cows, remains illegal in the EU, following a decision taken by the Commission last week. The Commission rejected a request by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly to include BST in the list of substances that can be used in veterinary medical products administered to food-producing animals. In December 1994 the Council of Ministers agreed a ban on the placing on the market of BST until 31 December 1999. 21 May 1996 Pesticide Residues - Amendments adopted On the 21 May 1996, the Council adopted amendments to two directives that set the maximum residues limits for pesticides in fruit and vegetables, cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin. The amendments adjust the controls to take into account new compounds and new data and to extend the controls to certain additional foods. Directive 96/32 amends Annex II to Directive 76/895 (relating to fruits and vegetables) and Annex II to Directive 90/642 (relating to certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables). Directive 96/33 amends the Annexes to Directives 86/362 (relating to cereals) and Directive 86/363 (relating to foodstuffs of animal origin). Both Directives should be implemented by Member States by the 30 April 1997. 19 April 1996 Hygiene Measures - Progress Towards Consolidation Anyone who has had to grapple with the complexity of the European hygiene controls on products of animal origin will appreciate that greater coherence and transparency is this area is long overdue. On 19 April 1996, the Agriculture Directorate-General (DGVI) produced a document (of about 150 pages) described as "A Guide to certain rules governing production, marketing and importation of products of animal origin intended for human consumption". This has been described as "an aid to reading existing legislation and to reflection on how to improve it". It is however written in a form which could be used as a consolidating directive. It would replace and repeal 13 directives covering hygiene of such foods as fresh meat, poultry meat, dairy products, eggs, snails, etc. Although the concept of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is presently only included in the Directives on fish and milk, the Guide indicates that it could become a key part of the total control system for all these products areas. It does not incorporate any aspects of the General Food Hygiene Directive (93/43). The Commission is hloding discussions with key gropus of interested parties and has invited comments on the document. 29 March 1996 Council Directive No 96/21 amending Commission Directive 94/54/EC concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112. The Directive was adopted on the 29 March 1996 and supplements the labelling requirements for foods containing sweeteners so as to provide consumers with more specific information about the presence and effect of sweeteners in a food. In particular: (a) foods containing sweeteners (as permitted by Directive 94/35) shall be labelled "with sweetener(s)" with the name of the food; (b) foods containing both added sugar and sweeteners shall be labelled "with sugar(s) and sweeteners" with the name of the food; (c) foods containing aspartame shall include on the label the statement "contains a source of phenylalanine" (d) foods containing more than 10% added polyols shall include on the label the statement "excessive consumption may produce laxative effects". The directive should be fully implemented by 1 July 1987 This page was last amended on 15 October 1996. Go to FS&T home page; About this server.

It has been circulated by MAFF for comment. The proposal takes on board various points agreed at the Commission Working Group (5th March) and incorporates certain industry requests not included in an earlier draft. The Ministry letter comments on the following: Flour treatment agents are not included in the proposal. The UK has asked for these to be dealt with separately at a later stage and MAFF have suggested that a timetable for legislation should be agreed. A definitive opinion from the EC's SCF on requests which have been made for additional additives in foods for infants and young children not in good health is unlikely to be available until later in the year. The Commission is therefore unable to made a formal proposal for associated amendments to 95/2. A number of specific amendments relating to certain additives and certain foods have been proposed - the proposal (or the letter from MAFF) should be consulted for full details. No date has been given for discussion on the proposal at a Council Working Group. MAFF Letter, 17 September 1996 Proposed revision to Directive on Extraction Solvents The Commission has published proposals to amend Directive 88/344 on Extraction Solvents used in the Production of Food stuffs and Food Ingredients. The proposed text would make the following amendments to the Directive: provide for the amendment of the conditions of use and maximum residue levels for permitted extraction solvents to be made by the Commission following the procedure laid down in Article 6 of the Directive (i.e. involving the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs); remove butyl acetate and methyl-propanol-1 from the list of permitted extraction solvents; allow the use of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluroethane for the preparation of flavourings from natural flavouring materials; reduce the maximum residue level for hexane resulting from its use in the production or fractionation of fats and oils and production of cocoa butter (from 5 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg) The proposal is based on Article 100a of the Treaty and subject to the co-decision procedure. The Commission hopes to reach a Common Position by December 1996. MAFF Letter, 2 August 1996 Amendment to the Natural Mineral Waters Directive A proposal to amend the Directive relating to natural mineral waters (Directive 80/777) was published by the Commission in November 1994. A Common Position was adopted in December 1995 and two further amendments were adopted by the European Parliament at Second Reading on 22 May 1996. The amended proposal, including the two European Parliament amendments, was adopted by qualified majority on 23 July 1996. The main objectives of the amending Directive are to take account of technical and scientific progress since 1980 and to rationalise the provisions of the Directive to bring them into line with other provisions of Community food law. The changes include: extending the period of recognition for natural mineral waters originating from third countries in order to simplify the administrative process; clarifying the circumstances under which the use of ozone-enriched air may be permitted in order to separate unstable elements from natural mineral waters under conditions which will ensure that the composition of the water as regards its essential constituents is not affected; making the inclusion of the statement of the analytical composition of a natural mineral water on the label compulsory; laying down certain provisions on spring waters; introducing procedures to allow for coordinated action between Member States in urgent situations which may present a risk to public health; providing for a committee procedure for the adoption of certain additional technical provisions. Member States must permit trade in products complying with the new provisions within 12 months and prohibit trade in products not complying with them within 24 months (although products labelled before that time may continue to be sold). MAFF Letter, 1 August 1996 Eggs Sizes - Publication of Amending Regulation (1511/96) As previously described (see 17 July 1996), the Commission has adopted a Regulation which amends Regulation 1274/91 which itself introduced detailed rules for implementing Regulation 1907/90 on certain marketing standards for eggs. The new Regulation is No 1511/96, published in the Official Journal No L189, 30.7.96, p91. The letter points out that as well as introducing new eggs sizes, the Regulation allows for supplementary indications on the type of farming. The Commission indicates that this is aiming "to authorize supplementary indications to the terms laid down for the various types of farming, which refer to the particular characteristics of the respective type of farming but not to authorize other terms or general statements." MAFF may circulate additional advice on this aspect. Extract from Commission Weekly Bulletin - 1 August 1996 Organic Livestock Farming Livestock farmers would be able to market their produce in the EU in line with recognised organic standards, under a Regulation proposed by the Commission this week. It also includes strict labelling and qualilty rules to avoid abuse of the term "organic" and to increase consumer confidence. The measures would cover the main apsects of the animal production process for cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and bees. It is assumed that the proposal would supplement the measures already in place which largely cover crops other than animals. More details will be provided when available. MAFF Letter, 17 July 1996 Egg Sizes - Further Discussions The Commission's revised draft proposal (See earlier items on Egg Size Grades 25 June 1996) was considered by the Eggs and Poultry Management Committee on 16 July. The following grades would be defined: XL - VERY LARGE: 73g and more L - LARGE: from 63g up to 73g M - MEDIUM: from 53g up to 63g S - SMALL: under 53g To avoid ambiguity, an amendment to the original revised proposal was made and it now states "On packs, the weight grading would be indicated by the respective letter or by the respective terms .... or by a combination of both, which may be supplemented by the corresponding weight ranges." The text was voted on. The MAFF letter states: "The vote resulted in the Committee failing to deliver an opinion as two countries abstained and two countries opposed. This is not a negative opinion nor is it a favourable one. The procedure will be that the Commission submit the text to internal written procedure and providing there are no objections to the text it will be published as law in the Official Journal. If there are no objections this will be before the intended effective date of 1 August 1996." The main transition period will last until 30 June 1997. MAFF Letter, 16 July 1996 Simplifcation of EU Veterinary Legislation MAFF has responded to the Commission on the issue of the simplification of the animal and public health (hygiene) directives. In response to the Commissions consultative document issued in April 1996 [see earlier item dated 19 April 1996], the UK Government has submitted comments to Brussels. The Government has welcomed the DGVI initiative which it believes should result in better legislation to secure effective public health protection, and better regulation for a competitive business environment. Certain general observations have been made and the following are some of the points made: General: "We favour a risk based approach to hygiene controls and their enforcement, and believe such an approach should facilitate significant simplification of hygiene directives and lead to the removal of prescriptive requirements wherever possible. We believe it should be possible to consolidate hygiene legislation into a single instrument, keeping in view that legislation should be shown to be necessary, proportionate to risk and take account of SME interests." Scope: "The Guide makes no mention of the interrelationship between the general and the product specific hygiene rules. In order to achieve a successful continuum of legislation from "farm to fork", we would suggest the common provisions be aligned with the general food hygiene directive. This would be more efficient and reassuring for consumers in public health terms because there would be greater transparency, consistency and user-friendliness in the legislation. It would also help industry and enforcement agencies to have a clear understanding of their respective roles in ensuring safe food." Own Checks: "We welcome the greater emphasis on own checks, based on the principles of HACCP, which correctly places more responsibility on producers to control and monitor hygiene and safety within establishments. It should therefore be possible to remove some of the more prescriptive requirements in the text, or at least to introduce greater flexibility in the need to follow them absolutely. On this basis, we believe that structural and equipment requirements could be further rationalised. "Own checks provisions should be flexibly cast to reflect more closely the Codex approach - which recognises that full documentation may not always be necessary for smaller businesses. Documentation should be available at the time of inspection - there is no need for it to be submitted to the authorities." Official Checks: "The greater emphasis on own checks should be accompanied by a reappraisal of inspection procedures. Where risk based control systems are in place the focus of any check should be on the control system. A main purpose of visual or physical examination should be to confirm that critical points have been correctly identified and that controls are in place. We welcome the recognition that the frequency of official checks should be related to risk, and believe that better focused, more risk related enforcement, which takes account of the controls that exist within the establishment, will provide more effective public health protection." Copies of the complete comments may be obtained from the Ministry. MAFF Letter, 15 July 1996 Mycotoxins - EC Permitted Levels The Commission held a further meeting on mycotoxins on 12 July 1996 (See earlier item 3 June 1996). It now seems likely that the Commission will only press ahead at this stage with limits for aflatoxins and not including ochratoxin A and patulin. These last two may be subject to a further Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) review before regulatory action is again considered. The Commission is still considering levels based on "ideal sampling and optimal methods of analysis", to be agreed at a later date, which caused the UK delegation some concern that values were being discussed in isolation from these issues. Aflatoxin levels (in micrograms per kg) are now being proposed in the working document for: Groundnuts shelled and peeled (may be redrafted to simply "groundnuts") with sub-divisions. Proposed levels are B1 - 5, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 10 where further treatment will take place and B1 - 2, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 4 when prepared for consumption. Nuts (including coconut); pistachios; dried fruit (figs, plums, apricots) intended for consumption without modification. Proposed levels are B1 - 2, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 4. Cereals (including maize) (may be redrafted to be "(including buckwheat)"). Proposed levels are B1 - 2, B1/B2/G1/G2 - 4 Milk. Proposed level is M1 - 0.05. It is also likely that spices may be added following a German proposal. The next meeting might be in September with a formal proposal for Regulation "some time later". Extract from Commission Weekly Information - 11 July 1996 Drinking Water Standards The Commission is taking the UK to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for not fully implementing the drinking water Directive. The reasons are, first, that some of the drinking water standards, which came mandatory in 1985, are still not being met in the UK, and second, that the system of water company "undertaking", used where standards are not being met, are not compatible with the Directive, the Commission believes. The undertakings cannot be enforce by individuals who may be affected by drinking water that does not meet the standards. The main problem in meeting the standards relates to the pesticides parameter, particularly in drinking water supplied to the population in the Greater London area. The Commission has been trying to reach a settlement with the UK government since it first opened the case in 1991. However, last month the UK government informed the Commission that it could not accept the Commission's proposals for ending the dispute. The Commission has spared no efforts to reach a settlement, Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said, but it is unacceptable that the UK is unwilling to ensure the legally enforceable rights for its citizens to drinking water of a quality that meets EU standards, eleven years after the Directive came into force. Scottish Office letter, 11 July 1996 Common Position for Decision on the maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain foods A Common Position was adopted on the 18th June [See related item on 26 June 1996 for more background]. The Annex containing a listing of foods for which Member States may continue to restrict additives has been extended and modified by the addition of a further 7 foods. The Annex lists the Member States concerned, the specified foodstuffs and the categories of additives which may continue to be banned. It now reads: Germany - Traditional German beer ("Bier nach deutschem Reinheitsgebot gebraut") - all except propellant gas Greece - "Feta" cheese - all France - Traditional French bread - all France - Traditional French preserved truffles - all France - Traditional French preserved snails - all France - Traditional French goose and duck preserves ("confit") - all except preservatives Austria - Traditional Austrian "Bergkase" - all except preservatives Finland - Traditional Finnish "Mammi" - all except preservatives Sweden/Finland - Traditional Swedish and Finnish fruit syrups - colours Denmark - Traditional Danish "Kodboller" - preservatives and colours Denmark - Traditional Danish "Leverpostej" - preservatives (other than sorbic acid) and colours Spain - Traditional Spanish "Lomo embuchado" - All except preservatives and antioxidants Italy - Traditional Italian "Salame cacciatore" - All except preservatives, antioxidants, flavour enhancers and packaging gas Italy - Traditional Italian "Mortadella" - All except preservatives, antioxidants, pH-adjusting agents, flavour enhancers, stabilizers and packaging gas Italy - Traditional Italian "Cotechino e zampone" - All except preservatives, antioxidants, pH-adjusting agents, flavour enhancers, stabilizers and packaging gas The Common Position now returns to the European Parliament for a second reading. DHSS(NI) Letter, 9 July 1996 EU Poultry Meat Marketing Standards The letter provides limited information on a recent change to the detailed rules contained in Regulation 1538/91 (which introduces detailed rules for implementing Regulation 1906/90 on certain marketing standards for poultry). Following French concerns that there were poor quality capons being marketed in France, the definition of "capon" has been amended. It previously stated: "male fowl castrated surgically before having reached sexual maturity". Following the adoption of Regulation 1000/96 (published on 5 June 1996), it now reads: "male fowl castrated surgically before reaching sexual maturity and slaughtered at a minimum age of 140 days; after castration the capons must be fattened for at least 77 days". Regulation 1000/96 also makes some related changes to the references to capons in Annex IV of 1538/91, which specifies the production criteria that must be met in order to make use of certain marketing terms (e.g. free range). Scottish Office Letter, 5 July 1996 Proposed Amendment to EC Regulation (2081/92) - Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin Following the adoption by the Commission of a list of protected names under Regulation 2081/92 on the 12 June, the Commission has also published a related proposal to amend Regulation 2081/92. The Regulation contains a provision allowing for a 5 year transitional period during which foods using a protected name can continue to use the name even though not meeting the requirements of the protected name. However the period specified in the original Regulation was to run from the date of publication of the Regulation (24 July 1992). This only leaves about 12 months from the time of registration. The amendment would alter Regulation 2081/92 so as to make the transitional period run from the time of registration of a name. MAFF Letter, 2 July 1996 Review of 7 Vertical Directives - Chocolate, Sugars, Honey, Fruit Juices, Preserved Milk, Coffee, Jams The Commission has formally issued proposals to simplify 7 Directives which specify compositional and labelling requirements for certain foods. The Directives were all originally agreed between 1973 and 1980. This was before the full development of the "horizontal" labelling controls contained in Directive 79/112 and before the adoption of the "new approach" to Community food law which was incorporated into the Internal Market programme. The seven proposals are based on a common structure consisting of an operative part followed by an Annex. The operative part contains provisions on the scope of the Directive, labelling and the committee procedure. The Annex contains the definitions and designations of the products and details of their composition. The following point can be noted with regard to chocolate and cocoa - the most controversial issue. The main difficulty here was the present position whereby certain countries have used a provision allowing them to incorporate the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter during chocolate production (up to 5% by weight). At present this practice is permitted by UK, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Finland and Sweden, but such products can not be sold in the other Member States. In the proposal, this practice will continue to be permitted but, under mutual recognition, their sale would be permitted throughout the Community subject to "a clear, neutral and objective indication of the presence of such substances". Products not including the cocoa butter substitutes could include a reference on the labelling to the fact that vegetable fats have not been used in their manufacture. The formal adoption of the proposed Directives is complicated since 2 (chocolate and coffee) were originally adopted using Article 100a of the Treaty of Rome whilst the others used Article 43. This means that different procedures are required for their adoption. The proposals will now be considered by the European Parliament. MAFF Letter 2 July 1996 Common Position on Amendment to the Miscellaneous Additives Directive (95/2/EC) A Common Position was adopted at the Environment Council held on 25 June for a proposed directive to amend Directive 95/2/EC on Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners. The aim of the amendment is to add the new food additive known as "E407a Processed Eucheuma Seaweed" into Annex I of the Directive for use at quantum satis level. The substance had previously been given the name "alternatively refined carrageenan" but this was not acceptable to the European Parliament. The Common Position now returns to the European Parliament for a second reading. To go to earlier material (March - June 1996), click here Go to FS&T home page; About this server.

He was formerly head of the Flavour and AnalyticalSection at the AFRC Meat Research Institute, Bristol. In 1988 joined theUniversity of Reading where he is Reader in Food Chemistry. His currentinterests include flavour chemistry, methods for flavour analysis, flavourbinding and release, the occurrence of taints in food. He is chairman of the UKUniversities' Research Flavour Consortium. Research interests These are mainly in the area of flavours, their analysis, and the factorsaffecting their formation and retention in foods and beverages. The objectiveis to provide means of enhancing or improving flavour in food. Flavour formation during cooking During heating of food, flavour develops from the Maillard reaction betweenamino acids and sugars and also from the oxidation of lipids. Current researchis aimed at understanding these complex reactions and the routes by which theintermediates from both types can interact to give aroma and flavour compounds.Work involves the study of model systems as well as investigations in foodproducts such as meat and extruded cereals. Analysis of flavour in foods Both sensory evaluation and chemical analysis of volatile aroma compounds areused to study the nature of flavour in foods and beverages. The techniques areapplied to both desirable and undesirable flavours and rely heavily on gaschromatography and mass spectrometry. Current Projects Flavour generation in extruded cereals.

Whilst these enzymes are useful catalysts for the preparation of novel and bioactive oligosaccharides, they are not without problems. In order for them to become useful catalysts, problems of regioselectivity and yield must be addressed. We currently have two projects under way attempting to address these problems: Development of efficient reactors for the synthesis of derivatives and analogues of trehalose and sucrose. This BBSRC funded project is being carried out by Nigel Smith who is developing enzyme reactors to perform equilibrium synthesis of oligosaccharides. One advantage of using glycosidases is that, whilst the equilibrium yield may not be high, the unused substrates can be separated and reutilised. The synthetic reactions have been optimised and various reactor configurations are now being investigated. Specificity and selectivity in glycosidase-catalysed synthesis reactions This investigation is evaluating the use of linkage-specific glycosidases to produce oligosaccharides with high regioselectivity. Early results with a specific alpha-mannosidase have been encouraging. Studies are now continuing with specific fucosidases and galactosidases. This project is funded by the Asian Development Bank in association with the British Council and is being carried out by Sony Suwasono. Go to FS&T home page.

Chemical modification studies on glycosidases Chemical modification studies are under way to gain mechanistic information on Jack bean alpha-mannosidase and Trichoderma longibrachiatum xylanase. These investigations are providing useful mechanistic information in support of more projects investigating applications of these enzymes. Protein engineering of Jack bean alpha-mannosidase The aim of this project, funded by the University of Reading Research Endowment Fund, is to use site-directed mutagenesis techniques to investigate the structural basis of specificity. A long-term aim is to re-engineer the specificity of the enzyme to produce a more technologically useful catalyst. The research is being carried out by Heidi Burrows and is in collaboration with Prof. M. James Crabbe, School of Animal and Microbial Sciences, University of Reading. Crystallisation of alpha-mannosidase enzymes The enzyme from Jack bean is currently under investigation and work is about to commence on the alpha-1,2-specific enzyme from Aspergillus phoenicis. It is hoped that a comparative study of the structures of these enzymes will give an insight into the structural basis of specificity. This is essential information to support our protein engineering work. The research is being carried out by Heidi Burrows in collaboration with the Institute of Food Research. Go to FS&T home page.

What are the emerging industries of the new economy? What is the importance of the baby boom to Canada? Richard Worzel is a Canadian futurist whose recently published book, "Facing the Future", charts a course to a future that is both exciting and scary. He will answer these questions, and many others that have to do with Canada's future. An expert futurist's forecasts are not guesses - they are based on hard facts and years of research. And Richard Worzel is an expert. Twenty years ago, he predicted that the economy in the 90's would be a global one. He wrote about the enormous impact that the baby boomers would have on the economy. He predicted the widespread use of voice-activated mechanisms and pen-operated computers. Worzel answers the questions that will be crucial to your future. There are seven principal forces at work in the world that are shaping our lives and futures: the global economy; population; technology; environmentalism and the earth's ecology; greater human longevity; the decline of the nation - state; and the shattering of society, and the isolation of the individual. The near future is going to be very different from the recent past, and those who are unprepared for it are courting disaster. In this keynote presentation, Richard Worzel outlines the major forces that are shaping your world, your job, and your daily life. He knows what the future holds in store for Canadians. And by keeping up with this information, you will gain the edge needed to thrive in the new century. Money Concepts Newmarket presents futurist Richard Worzel on Saturday, February 1, 1997. Time - 2:00 pm. Location: Glenway Golf and Country Club Newmarket. For your free tickets or further information please call our office at (905) 853-6196 or 1-800-479-6576.

Q Am I better off holding an international equity fund in U.S. dollars rather than Canadian dollars? A.L. of River Drive Park A Generally an investor will not find any marked difference in his return over a period of time by investing in U.S. currency rather than Canadian. It is a choice of convenience rather than of investment to buy an account in U.S. dollars; for example, the unitholder has a U.S. bank account already or spends part of their year in the United States.

As RRSP season quickly approaches, many are wondering what to do with this years contribution with GIC rates at the lowest point in several decades. Others have GIC's coming due shortly and don't want to simply roll them over at these low rates. What to do...what to do? There are excellent alternatives to low rate GIC's, but which one is for you? If you took a poll of everyone who every purchased a GIC and asked them the purpose for which they invested that money you could divide their responses into two categories. Those who bought them to save for longer-term goals such as retirement and those who bought them to produce immediate income. First, if you're setting this money aside for the long term (5 years or more) GIC's have not historically been the best place to put your money. Far from it. If you invested $1,000 each year for the last ten years in 5 year GIC's (and reinvested the money in new 5 year GIC's as they matured) you would have averaged approximately 8.60% (as at the end of November 1996). Remember also that we had double digit rates in the late 80's (a far cry from today's low single digit rates). If instead you invested that same $1,000 each year in the TSE 300 Index you would have averaged 12.47%. Yes, the TSE had it's ups and downs over that time, but remember you're investing for the long term. The point is, choose a well balanced portfolio of investments that match your ultimate objective. Stay focused on that objective and don't allow yourself to be distracted! You can build a moderately conservative portfolio and still achieve significantly higher returns than GIC's can offer. If instead you invested in GIC's to provide you with an income (perhaps your retired) you have several options. Ultimately, we are concerned with how much money we have in our pocket to spend. There are two factors which affect this. One is our nominal rate of return and the other is how much of this return the tax man graciously allows us to share with him. One option is to consider dividend mutual funds. These invest predominately in shares of large blue chip companies, such as the banks, that have a solid record for paying dividends. The advantage of dividend income over the interest income that GIC's earn is that you pay far less tax. Below is a table that illustrates the marginal rate of tax paid on different types of income by an Ontario residents. Taxable Income Interest Dividends Capital Gains $6,750-$29,590 27.4% 7.4% 20.5% $29,591-$50,937 41.9% 25.5% 31.4% $50,938-$59,180 44.9% 27.3% 33.7% $59,181-$62,194 50.1% 33.8% 37.5% $62,195-$66,651 51.5% 34.8% 38.6% $66,652- & over 53.2% 35.9% 39.9% Another option to consider is investing in a growth oriented portfolio and then set up a systematic withdrawal plan to provide you with the money you need. Such a portfolio would consist significantly of growth equity mutual funds and balanced funds. Although these types of investments would produce primarily capital gains on which the marginal tax rate is slightly higher than on dividends (but still far below that on interest) you can expect that over time your rate of return will be significantly higher than on a dividend fund thus more than compensating you for the slightly higher amount of tax. This approach is most suited to those situations where the income will need to continue for quite some time (e.g. you've retired early and are in good health) because it offers you the best protection against inflation. Trimark Mutual Funds has illustrated this approach using their Canadian Fund. They assumed you invested $100,000 on Sept. 1, 1981 and withdrew $825 each month to Sept. 30, 1996. Over that time you would have withdrawn a total of $148,500 and your remaining investment in the Trimark Canadian Fund would still be worth over $233,000. The preceding has touched on several alternatives to low rate GIC's. Speak with your financial advisor to discuss which approach best meets your individual needs.

The following is a list of other features about RRSP's you may not be as familiar with: The current RRSP limit is 18% of earned income from 1995 (less your PA number if you are a pension member) to a maximum of $13,500 (down from $14,500 last year). However, you can contribute prior years unused limit on top of the above yearly number. If you filed your 1995 tax return this information is detailed on the return assessment notice. You can contribute up to your maximum limit either in your own name or your spouse's name, or both. If married, the spouse in the higher tax bracket should purchase his or her RRSP up to the maximum, but the owner should be the spouse expected to be receiving the least amount of money from other sources. Spouses should strive for equal income in retirement to decrease taxes and possibly increase tax credits. RRSP's must now be converted to RRIF's or annuities by December 31st of the year in which you turn 69 (was 71). There are phase in rules for individuals turning 69 or 70 this year. Check with your advisor if you are in this situation. Labour Sponsored Funds have been significantly altered and are not as attractive as last year. The four key changes affecting potential purchases: (A) the credit has been reduced to 30% (was 40%); (B) the special exemption for seniors or retirees has been eliminated; (C) the limit for the credit is reduced to $3,500 (was $5,000); (D) you must leave the money in the venture fund for 8 years (was 5) or you must pay the credit back. The LSIF's have less broad appeal than before but they may still make sense, especially for people with substantial unused RRSP room. Someone in the top tax bracket can purchase a $3,500 LSIF for only $595. It may make sense to try to save an extra $595 to add $3,500 to your RRSP portfolio, on top of what you usually plan to do. Normally the maximum RRSP foreign content is 20%. However, this can be increased if you hold qualifying small business property (SBP) inside your RRSP; defined as 3 times amount invested in SBP's to a maximum of 20%. This is in addition to the 20% normal foreign content allowed, effectively raising the limit to 40% if you have enough SBP. LSIF's mentioned above qualify as part of this. Working out the arithmetic you can increase your foreign content to $40% by having 6.67% of your RRSP cost base in SBP's. You must however, wait until the end of the fourth month after purchasing a SBP to make the change. January and February can be a great time of the year to do some creative tax planning using RRSP's for income averaging. If for example you are going to have a much lower income in 1997 (recently lost your job, etc.) you can effectively transfer income from 1996 to 1997 by purchasing RRSP's to be applied against 1996 and if the money is needed, cash it in. If done in the first two months of 1997, you are effectively moving income from 1996 to 1997. Note that you will be using up some of your RRSP room by doing this.

If you care for your family proper coverage must be taken. For a relatively modest premium you can insure yourself and have peace of mind your family won't experience financial hardship if anything happens to you prematurely. Life insurance however has other very interesting applications. For example, a couple regularly maximizing their RRSP contributions and still having some savings left for investment. In this situation you are experiencing two tax related problems. One is on-going, the other one is a one time tax liability after the last spouse dies. Income on non-registered investments is usually taxable. Therefore your after tax return is considerably lower than your before tax return. Since you are contributing your maximum RRSP limit each year your registered investments will most likely accumulate to more than one million dollars after retirement and will likely increase in value even after retirement for another 10-15 years. Therefore your tax liability may be in the neighborhood of one million dollars. That means your heirs will receive only half of the money accumulated in your RRSP's. Buying life insurance may solve both of the above problems. If you purchase a universal life insurance policy a large part of your premium may be invested in non-segregated funds (very similar investment to mutual funds). Income on investments within your life insurance policy is tax exempt, therefore your money will compound tax free. The insurance coverage may be set up so that the death benefit is the sum of your initial life insurance coverage plus the accumulated investment value within the policy. Since life insurance death benefits are non-taxable your heirs will receive a very substantial sum which in most cases will be more than sufficient to cover the tax liability from your RRSP investments. On the other hand accumulated investments may also be used to provide additional retirement income in addition to your income from registered investments. Careful selection of timing and size of your retirement income from your life insurance ensures that you maintain sufficient coverage and investment within your policy. For the above application of life insurance a so called Joint Last To Die policy is recommended. This type of policy pays at the second death, precisely at the time when the tax liability is payable on your registered investments. Also since the chance of two people dying is much lower than the chance of one person passing away the cost of Joint Last To Die policies are much lower than that on single life policies. The attached table illustrates this use of life insurance. It assumes that a 40 year old couple invests $8,000 a year for the next 14 years in their Joint Last To Die life insurance policy. They start to withdraw about $72,000 after tax (approximately $36,000 in today's dollars assuming 2% inflation per year ) from their policy starting from the age of 75 and ending at the age of 95. Also shown are investment values assuming the same size of investments in a non-registered portfolio without life insurance. After reviewing the table it is clear that using life insurance enables you to maintain sufficient life insurance coverage while providing significant retirement income. The regular investment runs out at the age of 88 without providing any tax liability coverage at all. Note that in both examples the exact same amount of savings is used. The rate of return in both cases is assumed to be 10% annually. Taxes are calculated based on current capital gain tax calculations using 47.8% marginal tax rate. Selection of proper life insurance coverage is a complicated process. Professional advice and guidance is needed. If you want to look at this investment in more details give us a call.

The markets are overheated right now, should I wait? Bonds are low but will they come back togive us good returns? As financial advisors we are asked these questions every day -- especially atthis present time because mutual funds, in particular the equity funds, havehad a good performing year to date. The answer is that the best time to investis whenever one has the money. In the long term it matters very little whetheryou try to time the market or not. Sound diversification of funds and the length of time invested for compounding are the keys to successful investing. Templeton International has actually proven the point by conducting the following analysis: they compared the performance if you invested $5,000 for a year for each of the past 25 years on the day the Dow Jones was at the highest point versus investing $5,000 a year when the Dow Jones was at the lowest point. The results are quite astounding: if you guessed correctly (which one never could), by investing at the market low every single year, the annual compound rate of return would be 17.8%. However, if you were always wrong and picked the highest point each year (also unlikely) you would have yielded an annual compound rate of return of 17.1%. You might argue: that was then, what about now? There are so many problems in the world currently, however if you review the last 25 years there have always been problems, double digit interest rates, very low interest rates, the Gulf War, the collapse of the Berlin wall, the market crash of 1987, the fall of the Mexican peso, the list is endless. On the contrary, there are major areas of growth emerging, particularly in the Far East and Latin America. For example, the telecommunications area is one rapidly moving sector of the world economy. We are in fact in an exciting time to invest. Of course, the other option takes the guesswork out of when the best time to invest is by using the dollar cost averaging approach to your investment strategy. By systematically investing per month through a pre-authorized chequing plan your money is buying shares each month -- sometimes you will be buying when the market is low so you will accumulate more shares. The other advantage of a systematic savings plan is that it is easier on the pocket book. Instead of having to find a lump sum to deposit, you can structure the budget for a monthly contribution. After a couple of months your investment becomes just another payment. The pre-authorized plan is a sound strategy for RRSP contributions. If you would like a copy of Templeton's "The Best Time To Invest" analysis or if you would like more information on the mechanics of starting a pre-authorized investment play, please call the Money Concepts office.

Currently most of the major economies of the world are experiencing low controlled inflation and sound growing economies. Given this backdrop, gold would seemingly not be expected to perform well, certainly measured by its historic means. Indeed, Bullion has traded in a fairly boring trend of somewhat below $400 an ounce U.S. for most of the 1990's with a rare few shots above $400 lasting very briefly (the most recent being February 1996). Despite all of the above, the price of gold producer stocks have been doing very well in 1996. This begs the question -- why? The most widely accepted explanation comes from, of all things -- simple supply demand economics. In the first three quarters of 1995 global gold demand grew by 15% compared with a flat supply. Most of the increase in demand comes from Southeast Asia, notably India and China. There are millions of people who for the first time now have some discretionary income and Asians generally like gold for jewelry and as safeguard against local currency. The lid has been kept on gold bullion despite almost 3 years of demand exceeding supply in part by large gold producers like Barrick Gold Corp using a technique called forward selling whereby they borrow the gold from a central bank, then sell it as a futures contract. This approach can backfire if gold moves up and with a real fear this may happen there have been signs that forward selling is being used less and less. Dynamic has been on record for about 2 years now predicting Gold will hit $700 per ounce U.S. by the year 2000. They are still holding to that prediction. There is another, for some more compelling reason, to have some gold in your portfolio. It is not correlated with other investment assets. Stocks and bonds move in the same direction the majority of the time. Gold, on the other hand, "beats to its own drummer". So even though gold is a risky investment by itself, having a small portion (say 5%) in a portfolio will likely have the effect of smoothing out the overall volatility of your portfolio. If you wish to have gold as part of your portfolio, there are two major ways. One is to buy direct bullion. The other is to buy shares in gold companies. If the gold story turns out to be as positive as some believe in the next few years, both of these approaches should provide favorable results. However the latter approach should be the more favorable in terms of degree. That's because a gold producer that spends $300 per ounce to produce gold trading at $400 is making a $100 out of the ground margin. If gold moves to $500 per ounce the out of ground margin will double. For most investors the second option will involve selecting a mutual fund that specifically invests in gold or gold companies. As a final note, Canada has a very high gold weighting so if the gold story unfolds favorably this will provide a favorable boost to our overall markets.

For a disability lasting more than 3 months, the average duration is between two and three years. Did you also know that in one year: 1 in 106 people die 1 in 88 homes catch fire 1 in 8 people become disabled Despite these alarming statistics far too many people still do not have proper insurance coverage. Then when a disability strikes, they find themselves unable to meet monthly expenses. Loss of income because of disability is far and away the leading cause of mortgage foreclosures. Ask yourself these two very simple questions. First, if a disability strikes how much money will you need? Second, where will that money come from? To answer the first question you will need to look at your expenses such as food, housing, auto expenses, medical/dental bills, etc. Also include in this section adequate savings for your retirement. If you suffer a disability that lasts for several years and are not able to save for retirement it can very easily and significantly alter your retirement plans. Now let's turn to the source of the money you will need for this disability. Many people without disability insurance coverage say that the money they need will come from other sources. Let's look at a few. SAVINGS: If you saved 5% of your income each year -- six months of disability would wipe out ten years of savings. If you dip into your retirement savings, not only are you not making the necessary deposits to fund your eventual retirement, but you are using up what you have already saved. You're going backwards. BORROW: Who is going to lend money to a disabled person with no income? WORKING SPOUSE: Can one person be spouse, parent, private nurse and employee all at the same time? Also ask yourself if your current lifestyle is dependent on two incomes? LIQUIDATE ASSETS: Can you get a fair market price when you are forced to liquidate? CPP/UIC: CPP disability benefit payments are difficult to get and relatively small. UIC benefits last less than four months. WORKER'S COMPENSATION: This plan only covers WORK related injuries. However, 53% of all accidents happen AWAY from work and 80% of disability is caused by illness. Business owners can exempt themselves (not their employees) from Worker's Compensation coverage and buy private coverage that may cost less and provide better, full time coverage. Employees can buy additional private coverage for non-work related disabilities. The best solution for most people is to have adequate disability insurance coverage in place. Although such coverage is more difficult to qualify for than life insurance plans and more expensive, it does protect your most valuable asset, your ability to earn an income! Many may have some coverage through their employers' group benefits plan. Such coverage tends to be far cheaper than private plans, but there are a few things you should check out. First, if your employer is paying part or all of the premium the income you receive from the plan will be taxable. If you are paying the premium the income will not be taxable. Second, if the insurance company finds your group is not profitable it can drop the coverage in a matter of months or they may raise your premiums. With private plans your premiums are set and the policy is guaranteed to be renewable. Some other features of disability plans to look at are: HOW MUCH WILL YOU RECEIVE EACH MONTH?: The maximum available is generally about two-thirds of your income, but if you pay the premium the benefits are tax free. DEFINITION OF DISABILITY: Definitions vary widely among companies and policies. WHEN DO YOUR BENEFIT PAYMENTS START? HOW LONG WILL YOUR BENEFITS LAST?: Ideally your benefits should cover you until you plan to retire and your retirement income kicks in. This protects you against severe long-term illnesses such as heart disease or strokes. However, the longer your plan will pay you the higher your premium will be. ARE YOUR BENEFITS INDEXED TO PROTECT YOU AGAINST INFLATION? DOES YOUR PLAN COVER YOU FOR ILLNESS, INJURY OR BOTH? You may already spend a lot of money protecting your assets (home, car, etc.) but don't neglect the one thing that makes them, and your other possesions, possible -- your income! You simply can't afford to.

Commencing this issue we will include your questions and our solutions. Q The March 6th Federal Budget introduced several measures that will make it a little more difficult for Canadians to save for their retirement. I've recently heard that the RRSP Administration Fee Deductibility has been eliminated. P.K., Newmarket A Using the logic that tax sheltered plans "already provide significant tax assistance", Mr. Martin eliminated the tax deductibility of RRSP and RRIF administration fees and investment management fees. If you paid your 1996 RRSP/RRIF administration fee prior to budget day, you will be allowed to deduct it on your 1996 tax return. Do you have any questions you would like to see answered?

When you're trying to decide where to invest money, what careerchoices are best, where to live and a myriad of other options, youneed to have an awareness of some of the powerful forces that arechanging our world. What are some of these forces? MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY: the microchip is changing about every area of our lives. Moore's Law states that the maximum microchip speed doubles every 18 months. With this increased speed comes the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks (ie: video phones, etc.) more efficiently and many more tasks yet unimagined. The microchip essentially spelled the end of the industrial age where large governments and large corporations thrived, and ushered in the information age. THE SHRINKING IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT: from the death of communism to the emergence of free trade, power is passing from government to business. The Canada - U.S. free trade agreement saw the U.S. government answer to a higher power for the first time in its' history. Bond and currency traders exert enormous power over government policy. Heading into the next century the importance of government will continue to shrink while the influence of business will increase. LARGE TO SMALL: large corporations continue to downsize as the need for a large administration staff gets replaced by technology. In its' place, there is rapid growth of small entrepreneurial companies. It is estimated that up to half of our society may work for themselves before the end of the 21st century. BOOMERNOMICS: in Canada and the U.S. there was an unusually large percentage of the population born between the late 40's and early 60's ... the so-called "baby boomers". Because their numbers are so large they were partly responsible for high inflation in the 70's as they reached their consuming 20's. As the baby boomers went out to buy their first homes in the 80's, real estate surged. The next 20 years will see the boomers in their 40's and 50's, generally considered to be the peak savings years. The billions being poured into financial markets, chiefly through mutual funds, is the beginning of a trend that will likely be with us for the next 20 years. LONGER LIVES: with improved medical knowledge and technology, people are living longer. Many feel that, living to well past 100 will be commonplace in the very near future. Particularly in North America with our baby boomers, we will be living in and catering to an aging population in the 21st century. Industries catering to this phenomenon such as medical services, health sciences, finance, travel and entertainment should be areas of growth. The above list is by no means exhaustive but does shed some lighton the trends that are shaping our world. If you are interested inlearning more about the future, see our announcement in "upcomingevents".

Saving money inthe early years so that one can live comfortably in the "GoldenYears". If you have followed this principle the next question thenbecomes: How does one protect accumulated wealth from the tax manshould you die before you have spent it? Also, how can youtransfer that wealth to your family minimizing probate fees as wellas taxes? Another scenario that should also be considered is that uponretirement you may have accumulated more money than you need tomaintain your lifestyle but are reluctant to transfer funds toother family members as yet. What can you do to protect your wealthfrom taxes? A universal life insurance contract may be the answer. Bydepositing funds into such a plan, the growth of this money withinthe plan remains tax sheltered, that is... the income does not haveto be reported on your annual tax return. Taxes are paid uponwithdrawal from the plan. You have the advantage that the growthcan be used at a later time if required or can be part of theestate capital upon death in which case the heirs receive allmonies including the investment returns tax free. A thirdadvantage is that the policy can always be used as collateralshould you need further funds but do not wish to undo the estateplan. This approach could be used to supplement your retirementincome on a tax free basis. There is another interesting twist to the plan. If you buy a lifeinsurance plan, as the owner of the contract you can make the lifeinsured a child or grandchild. In most cases you can change theownership of the policy during your lifetime to a child orgrandchild on a tax-free rollover basis. Effectively you havetransferred funds to your heirs without tax or probate fees. Thelife insurance part of the plan is of course payable only on thedeath of the child but the premium is based on the child's age notyours. The amount you can invest tax sheltered has extensiveguidelines, otherwise wealthy individuals would literally transfermillions to each of their heirs to avoid taxes. There is howeverstill substantial room here for effective tax planning. It isimportant to talk to your financial advisor to establish whetherthis program is right for you.

Since theirinvestments have traditionally been in GIC's their income hasdecreased dramatically, in some cases up to 50% over the last sixyears. In the early '90's, one year GIC rates were close to 10%while today's rates are now lower than 5%. Furthermore, it is widelybelieved that we are entering a prolonged period of low interestrates due to the deficit reduction programs being implemented inmost industrialized nations. If you and your spouse are both retired and qualify for full CPPand OAS, your approximate annual income from government pensionplans is approximately $12,000. If you have little or noadditional company pension, a significant portion of your incomemust be derived from investments (RRSP/RRIF's or non-registeredinvestments). Obviously the best strategy is to keep money in aregistered portfolio so that taxation on this money is postponedfor as long as possible. Your RRSP/RRIF portfolio grows fastersince a portion of your return is not paid to the taxman each yearand is thus allowed to compound tax free until withdrawn. With low interest rates GIC investing increases the risk that youmight outlive your money. As an alternative consider investingnon-RRSP money in investments which earn dividend income as opposedto interest income. The above strategy is very powerful. Why? In Canada, tax ratesdiffer not only according to the size of your income, but alsoamong types of income. The following table illustrates the marginaltax rates in Ontario on various types of income. Combined Federal and Provincial Income Taxes in Ontario in 1995 Income Salary Interest Dividend Capital Gains $6,750 - $29,590 25.8% 27.4% 7.4% 20.4% $29,591 - $34,900 40.3% 41.9% 25.5% 31.4% $34,901 - $42,380 41.0% 41.9% 25.5% 31.4% $42,381 - $50,937 41.9% 41.9% 25.5% 31.4% $50,938 - $52,325 41.9% 44.9% 27.3% 33.7% $52,326 - $59,180 44.9% 44.9% 27.3% 33.7% $59,181 - $62,194 50.1% 50.1% 33.8% 37.5% $62,195 - $63,437 50.1% 51.5% 34.8% 38.6% $63,438 - $66,651 51.5% 51.5% 34.8% 38.6% $66,652 - $67,895 51.5% 53.2% 35.9% 39.9% $67,896 and over 53.2% 53.2% 35.9% 39.9% It is clear that the most tax favoured type of income outsideregistered portfolios are dividends. In all income brackets, taxrates on dividend income is the least. Tax savings on dividendincome is the largest for people with an annual income of $29,590or less. While some seniors have higher incomes than that, manyfall within this range. Using investments which earn you dividend income may reduce yourtaxes significantly. For example, a couple each receiving pensionincome of $12,000 a year, and having $200,000 in non-registeredinvestments, would have taxes on investment income calculated asfollows: Invested in GIC earning @ 5% per year Invested in Dividend Mutual Funds @ 8% per year Income $10,000 $16,000 Tax $2,746 $1,184 Net Income $7,260 $14,816 Dividend income may be derived from holding shares in largeestablished Canadian corporations which have paid out dividendsconsistently for a considerable time (ie: Banks). Or you mightwant to buy a dividend mutual fund which is professionally managedand invests in these types of companies. In both cases thedividend payout is approximately 8% per year. While dividends arenot guaranteed, these companies - in which you - or even better -your mutual fund manager invest, are long established profitablecorporations. Therefore, annual return fluctuations on this type ofinvestment is minimal compared to many other types of investments(ie: equity mutual funds). If you look at the performance ofavailable Canadian dividend mutual funds you will see that theirperformance has been consistent, and over the long term, betterthan that of GIC's. The above strategy enables you to increase your after tax income,your capital appreciation, or both. Therefore you reduce the riskof outliving your money. The new investment environment in the 90's, with low inflation andlow interest rates requires a fresh new approach. After years ofhard work it's now time to retire, relax and have your money workfor you for a change.

It is a choice of convenience rather than of investment to buy an account in U.S. dollars; for example, the unitholder has a U.S. bank account already or spends part of their year in the United States.

Stennis Space Center. The objective ofthe WindStar Project is to establish the commercial viability of usingtwice-a-day satellite scatterometer data to produce marine wind observation andforecast products for commercial television weather broadcasts. Usinginformation from NASA's "NSCAT" scatterometer on board the JapaneseADEOS satellite, User Systems is developing "broadcast ready" weatheranimations showing current and forecasted wind speed and direction. Specialcoverage of hurricanes and extra-tropical cyclones at sea will also be provided. Another product being developed as part of the project is the display of oceanwaves and storm surge associated with severe weather events. User Systems alsois developing the distribution system to deliver these products to televisionstations in time for local television newscasts. NSCAT is a microwave (14 GHZ radar) scatterometer instrument with sixdual-polarized antennas for collection of backscatter data with a resolution of25 km. Scatterometers use a highly indirect technique to measure wind velocityover the ocean. A scatterometer transmits microwave pulses and receivesbackscattered power from the ocean surface. Changes in wind velocity causechanges in ocean surface roughness, which modify the radar cross section of theocean and the magnitude of the backscattered radar power. By measuring thebackscattered power from various aspect angles, these measurements can be usedto derive wind speed and direction. The information derived from NSCAT iscritical in determining regional weather patterns and global climate. Theinstrument is capable of measuring winds in all weather and cloud conditions. Several coastal television stations are participating in the WindStarProject: WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, WCPX in Orlando, Florida, WWL in NewOrleans, Louisiana, and WRC in Washington, D.C.

In 1971 I.C.B.C. bought WLIB-AM and in 1973 exercised their option to pick up the FM station (WLIB-FM) and changed the call letters to WBLS-FM. Today I.C.B.C. owns five radio station across the country. WHO WEARE WLIB is the flagship station of I.C.B.C. and as such maintained its commitment to be the cultural center ... the very heart and soul of New York's Black Community. We are the collective mind and experience of a people. We are the spirit and hope of our race. WLIB, located at 1190 on the AM dial, represents millions of residents in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut metropolitan area, providing news, education and information specifically to this area's African- American and Caribbean community. WLIB's format is a mix of News and Talk with Caribbean Music and Information centered in its perspective of the issues of the day. The radio station not only feeds its audience a healthy dose of African, Caribbean and African-American news, history and culture, but also serves it's specific New York community by allowing them to electronically interact with their leadership and spokespeople. The station has a reputation of community accessibility. WLIB's airwaves are used to link African Americans to each other through the telephone. WLIB presents community news and views from an Afro-centric perspective through a forum that is aimed at educating all of its participants. We depend on community and listener involvement. WLIB's format allows guest appearances from luminaries in the educational, social, cultural, medical and commercial field. Here the audience can participate in meaningful discussion, and get valuable viewpoints. The Caribbean region boasts one of the richest heritages of music in many variants, which is largely due to the polyglot people of the area. WLIB's weekend programming goes all out to re-unite it's people with the nostalgic pulsating multi-rhythms of the Caribbean. Our goal for the listener is to enlighten, inform and inspire. Our goal for the advertiser is to increase profits, build consumer confidence and promote good will. OUR PROGRESS WLIB is the flagship station of I.C.B.C. and as such maintained its commitment to be the cultural center ... the very heart and soul of New York's Black Community. We are the collective mind and experience of a people. We are the spirit and hope of our race. WLIB, located at 1190 on the AM dial, represents millions of residents in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut metropolitan area, providing news, education and information specifically to this area's African- American and Caribbean community. In 1976, Pierre Sutton, Chairman of I.C.B.C. founded the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (NABOB), a group dedicated to advancing black radio and TV ownership. I.C.B.C. purchased the Apollo Theater out of bankruptcy in 1980. Today the renovated Apollo has a 1,500 seat auditorium, a 3,500 square foot sound stage, state of the art 24 track audio recording and post production facilities and satellite link ups for national and international broadcasts. The closest step to achieving broader ambitions was the production of a weekly syndicated TV series, "It's Showtime At The Apollo". Like the Apollo project, I.C.B.C.'s involvement in cable sparked the imagination of management to one day being a major supplier of cable programming. I.C.B.C. along with several partners, make up Queens Inner City Unity Cable Television Systems (QUICS), the only minority owned cable company awarded a franchise by the City of New York. It is a joint venture between Queens Inner Unity Cable System and Warner Cable, a subsidiary of Warner Communications. In 1983 QUICS won a joint cable franchise for a section of Queens with 180,000 households. | WLIB | The Station | Music | Events | News & Talk | Contests | Family Card | Copyright © 1995-1996 Inner City Broadcasting Corp.

"Such Is Life represents reggae's return to the musical mainstream," says the band's manager Kathryn Emery. "When you hear Such Is Life, you hear echoes of all the great reggae bands - The Wailers, Inner Circle, Zapow, Word Sound, and Power - but it's not imitative. This is the reggae the guys grew up on ... the reggae they love ... and the music I suspect that the vast majority of the listening audience loves." Bob Marley's influence haunts "Such Is Life" like a guardian angel. Lyrically, "Such Is Life" is one of the most sophisticated reggae albums of the last ten years, combining a clarity that masks as simplicity with a wide global and historical purview, and an in-your-face frankness about injustice, politics, and love. "My lyrics are poems set to music," says lead singer Paul Tulloch who shares songwriting credit with his brother Peter. "I marinate my ideas before I write them. Some of these songs have taken a year to write. I want my work to be savored. I don't do fast-food." Such Is Life.

They immediately formed a solid sisterly bond that constantly fuels their creative chemistry. The Divas recently released their latest Mesa/Bluemoon album entitled Conspiracy. Conspiracy features the fierce, hit-bound lead single "24 Seven." Also in daring Divas style, "Conspiracy," a strong dancehall message song, confronts people caught up in life's negative cycles and embraces those whose lifestyles and pursuits are positive. Lady English, Diva B, and Lesi are the three woman who comprise the Dancehall Divas. Lady English (Vanessa Rose), a mesmerizing MC, is a native of Birmingham, England. Her deejay style is spicy, bubbling, and on par with the best mic controllers in the business, including Lady Saw and Patra. Ms. English originally made a name for herself as half of the reggae duo Lady English and Miss Linda. Her resume also includes assisting in the formation of the popular female reggae group Worl A Girl and collaborating with R&B/pop star Cheryl Pepsi Riley on the hit single "Gimme." Diva B (Beverly Lawrence) has been a singer, songwriter, and dancer since her formative years growing up in Kingston, Jamaica. Diva B recorded and released five impressive singles with several of Jamaica's leading producers, including Sly and Robbie and Phillip Smart, who clearly appreciated her smooth, sultry voice. Finally, Lesi (Elesia Cunningham) hails from Brooklyn where her Jamaican parents encouraged her to pursue her passions for modeling and singing. Cunningham's soulful vocals, inspired by both her Caribbean heritage and urban New York sensibilities, create a harmonic balance that ingratiates the Divas expansive sound. A classic example of a sum whose total is greater than its individual parts, the Dancehall Divas are truly ready for the world, and Conspiracy proves it on the vocal as well as production fronts. Mixing hard-core dancehall with sexy R&B and sharp hip-hop edges, Conspiracy is a cross-cultural, ground-breaking album.

It's easy. Just ask Rita McDowall and she'll tell how easy it is to peer into the future of the energy and utility field with NewsNet. Rita is primarily responsible for researching competitive intelligence and pricing for the marketing department at Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPS). CIPS, a public utility, conducts all core research on an in-house level and recently began intense competitive tracking with NewsFlash. Rita likes NewsFlash for easy retrieval of the information she needs to project possible mergers or uncover services the competition may offer in the near future. "The utility area is very competitive. NewsNet helps us pinpoint the changes occurring with the competition. NewsNet helps you know your competitors, as well as you know yourself, " Rita says. "With NewsNet, I don't waste time waiting for what I need. I could go into NewsNet and find a company profile or an analysis of the latest development in the field. It's so easy, and the news is so timely," Rita says. Another benefit is the large number of newsletters online covering the energy and utility fields and the ability to pull stories off the newswires. "We like to see what the newswires release online related to our field. Sometimes a story about a utility a thousand miles away will be a real benefit to us," she explains. Rita feels the analysis is simplified when the right information is at your fingertips and no time is wasted. "When all the needed information is in front of you, it's much easier to complete the analysis. We want to be able to make accurate projections as soon as possible- before something happens. It's how we remain competitive in the field," she adds.

But she isn't. "I wish I'd have been using it much sooner," says Barbara, a researcher for the international public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton based in Washington, D.C. Hill & Knowlton has found the service to be invaluable in a number of ways. The firm serves a diverse client base consisting of a variety of industries including healthcare, pharmaceutical, aerospace and telecommunications. In the public relations arena, fast-breaking news takes center stage. Who's doing what and when is what Hill & Knowlton's clients need to know. And serving clients needs is what Hill & Knowlton is all about. "NewsNet has become an indispensable tool to monitor breaking news for our clients," says Barbara. "If a client is experiencing a crisis, I can monitor the wires and custom tailor our search to retrieve just the information they need." Barbara feels the benefits of NewsNet are countless, but the best advantage is getting vital information- fast. "I would say NewsNet's greatest attribute is the timeliness of information combined with the vast number of publications available. I capture the news before the competitors," Barbara says. "We're getting the news quicker and from a greater number of sources than we could in any other way," she adds. It's these advantages that give Hill & Knowlton the edge they can pass on to their clients. "With the diversity of our clients, NewsFlash makes it easy to track projects for a number of clients at the same time," she says. "I really like the way I can custom tailor searches to get the precisely the information I need from the best sources." "I'll sign on a couple times on an ordinary day- and when there's breaking news I'll sign on every half-hour for the most up-to-date news." "NewsFlash consistently performs to my expectations. It's difficult to pick one instance of an excellent search- they're all excellent," she adds.

The convenient grouping of services covering the telecommunications industry is a principal reason Ed uses NewsNet so frequently, as well as the broad telecommunications coverage offered by NewsNet. "Special searches are much easier to conduct with NewsNet's industry grouping," stated Ed. "And we always know what's being published in the area." In addition to NewsFlash and the quick full-text retrieval methods, Ed likes NewsNet because of its extensive worldwide coverage. "My favorite attribute would be the worldwide coverage available on NewsNet. If I need to know what the latest developments are in Saudi Arabia, I know that the information is going to be found in a number of newsletters and wires that are on the system. I feel confident that NewsNet covers the entire waterfront in delivering the latest breaking news in a timely fashion."

Established in 1873, Shearman & Sterling is one of the largest law firms in New York City. Fred Shanks, a reference librarian for its headquarters in New York and one of its primary NewsNet users, signs on to the system each business day to check his NewsFlash profiles. NewsFlash is one of his favorite NewsNet features. He likes being able to continually monitor news stories in the media and track particular issues of interest. Corporate information, tax and bankruptcy news, and general litigation are some of the main points of interest for Fred and his coworkers. The timeliness of information retrieved from NewsNet, especially those articles clipped in NewsFlash, is one of NewsNet's most attractive features according to Fred. "We can pull stories that have come out in the last couple of hours or so, and that's a real advantage," he said. Accessing the wire services through SCAN and SEARCH are also popular activities with the NewsNet users at Shearman & Sterling. Getting current, relevant information on NewsNet is elementary.

Jim knows the importance of getting current information quickly when it's needed. Jim has been a NewsNet user since 1982, its first year of commercial operation. He currently signs on three or four times each day to retrieve NewsFlash hits and to conduct ad hoc searches. He uses NewsFlash to track policy and international information on missile threat, defense and production. The ease of sifting through hits generated by NewsFlash is one of his favorite NewsNet features. "You don't have to worry about searching," he says. "NewsFlash does the work for you." When Jim does conduct searches, he generally searches wires such as Federal News Service and Kyodo News Service and daily defense services for stories of interest to ballistic missile defense. He finds the breadth of coverage and the wealth of information to be one of the most important reasons for using NewsNet. "I can retrieve large amounts of information from various services and bring them together to produce a nice presentation that is very effective for our needs."

Online UserJanuary/February 1997, "Monitoring the Media" by Judith Mandelbaum. "...NewsFlash from NewsNet is an excellent way to monitor breaking news forcoverage of products and companies, since NewsFlash constantly matches your tracking profiles against more than 17,000 articles that enter the service each day. NewsNet and NewsFlash have over 800 sources that include real-time, worldwide newswires, and many daily newsletters and papers. There is no limit to the number of NewsFlash topics you can monitor and the menu-driven software allows more options for customizing your profile than any other system. For instance, you can specify activation and expiration dates, ask the system to search only certain segments (full text or headlines), or sort your results. You can track against a single source, any combination of sources, or everything added to the system. When your profile is active, NewsFlash notifies you at sign-on with the name of the folder and the number of new articles. You can scan a list of new headlines and decide to view results in full, KWIC, or preview formats (the first 18-24 lines). Once you've looked at the articles, you can either delete or save them..."

NewsNet is particulary strong in the electronics and computer industry and in the fields of energy, environment, financial, international, publishing, broadcasting and telecommunications. The service also boasts an impressive array of real-time yet searchable wire services (foreign and domestic), plus gateways to Dun & Bradstreet, Standard & Poor's, and TRW Services."

There's been a flurry of activity at NewsNet during the past few months which has resulted in options for using NewsNet in new and different ways. Of course, all new options will enhance your NewsNet experience, bringing results to you more quickly and easily than ever before. Speedy Delivery We've revved up the core system so that you will notice faster response time during search sessions (a tip for online users: check your modem speed and increase if necessary). System response time is continuously monitored by Tom Scott, NewsNet's Vice President of System Services, and Mike Stein, NewsNet's Vice President of Software Development. Together, Tom and Mike along with their conscientious and hardworking teams, provide you with optimum performance and relevant results when using NewsNet. Just added to NewsNet on the Web You asked for Project Tacking on the Web and we were proud to deliver within three weeks of receiving your request! You can search NewsNet on the Web and be able to track specific projects or clients, therefore insuring accurate accounting requirements are met. NewsNet Web subscribers were thanked for their ongoing support when Project Tracking was implemented over Thanksgiving weekend. We at NewsNet were thankful that our holiday introduction of this new feature worked like a charm. You also requested 3N (NewsNet multi-Notation) for quicker retrieval and review of search results on the Web. We agreed that this was a great suggestion and are pleased to announce 3N's general release. 3N is a real time saver, permitting headlines to be "noted" and retrieved as a group, rather than having to select and review one headline at a time. Forgiven KWICs "Forgiven KWICs" are available for NewsNet on the Web Users, and soon will be available for Baton and command line users as well. You may be wondering what exactly are "forgiven KWICs." Well, traditionally, when you've requested a KWIC (Keyword in Context) display from NewsNet, you have been charged a fee for the KWIC. If you found the article relevant to your needs after viewing the KWIC, you requested the full-text and were charged a fee for the article too. No more! In keeping with NewsNet's long tradition of adopting fair pricing policy practices, NewsNet will forgive the cost of the KWIC when full-text of the same article is purchased. NewsNet Web subscribers will see an instant reduction in the price of the article when forgiven KWICs are triggered. Baton and Command Line Users will notice credit adjustments to their invoices in the near future to accommodate forgiven KWICs. NewsNet Hot Headlines Visitors and subscribers alike are being treated to free Hot Headlines on NewsNet's new Web Welcome Page [www.newsnet.com/welcome]. NewsNet Web subscribers will notice a selection of new headlines every morning. The selection covers breaking news, hot industries, and lifestyle trends of interest for that day (updated Monday through Friday) as chosen by a NewsNet editor. Just click on the hypertext of the headline title to retrieve the free full-text version of the story. "Hot" selections are drawn from anywhere in NewsNets entire database of 1,000 active sources! Selections are not just limited to one or two newswires. Quote.com brings added value to NewsNet on the Web Complete your competitive intelligence research with free stock quotations from Quote.com, available at no charge right at NewsNet on the Web Welcome Page. Provide your clients a well-rounded picture of their competition--all from one place. NewsNet makes it easy to compliment your in-depth search results with timely monitoring of competitive stock positions.

A: Due to the many differences between online Baton or Native mode, and NewsNet on the Web, a new and separate ID and password are required for access. A NewsNet customer support representative can have you up and running in no time because you already have an existing account established with NewsNet. All you have to do is answer a few simple questions as to how you want your new Web account to function, and you'll be ready to go. Since we already have all of your billing information on file, you won't encounter any undue delays. Q: How do I use online invoices? A: Online invoices are a very helpful NewsNet tool. Invoices are available for your account, online, for up to six months. At any time you can query this information for detail of past or current billing. You can tell when the last time was that you received information for a particular project, or find details of billing for a particular client account. You might want to access this information from your PC rather than search paper files, or instead of taking precious time from your accounting department to pull older documents. Your NewsNet customer support representative will be happy to give you a tour of online invoicing if you haven't had the opportunity to acquaint yourself with this feature. Q: What does it cost to access online invoices? A: Online invoices are provided as a service to NewsNet users and no fee is assessed for using this service. Q: When can I use Baton global options and do I have to call NewsNet? A: Global Options for Baton and native mode are always accessible to users without having to call NewsNet. Complete personalization options are as close as your fingertips and as easy to use as point and click on Baton, or menu selections in native mode. Options include being able to custom-design your screen display. You decide how you want your display to look and whether or not you want information to scroll, or present a screen at a time. As a professional, we want you to be as comfortable as possible in your work environment in order to make access as easy and flexible as possible. You also decide what fields NewsNet should search for you and how NewsNet should search. Do you want NewsNet to search all full-text for you, search headlines only, search headlines and lead paragraphs? You decide the level of depth the system should got to in order to pinpoint your results. We believe in providing the flexibility you need to enjoy better, faster, more relevant and more timely search results. And tell NewsNet how to search--whether you're a novice wishing to use Concept searching in plain English, or an experienced, professional searcher requiring Boolean power and flexibility, NewsNet is obliging. Q: How many newswires are on NewsNet? A: There are currently over 25 newswires on NewsNet, including AP, UPI, Reuters, PR Newswire, Business Wire, Agence-France-Presse International News, and Xinhua to name a few. Most newswires are updated in real-time and available for retrieval on NewsNet within seconds of transmission. NewsNet is proud to be the timeliest provider of breaking business news from multiple sources, year after year since our beginnings in 1982. Q: How does NewsFlash work? A: NewsFlash is NewsNet's personalized, automatic "clipping" agent for current awareness needs. NewsFlash works in the background, continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week monitoring and clipping information from 1,000 active sources (over 20,000 fresh articles per day) that match your phrases. NewsFlash then delivers these results to the proper NewsFlash folder(s) that contains the phrase(s) you're monitoring.

You may have as many folders as you like, containing as many phrases as you need in order to ensure that you've covered every area of importance to you. NewsNet automatically places results in their proper place and intelligently eliminates duplicate stories within your phrases. Continue to the next article of the NewsNet ActionLetter.

For example, instead of paging through the "News on NewsNet," there's now a single tear-off sheet with new titles bolded for instant recognition of new sources. Simply detach this sheet and place within easy view for quick reference. Another goal was to be a good neighbor and save some of our favorite trees by requiring our new design eliminate the need for mailing envelopes. The ActionLetter is your monthly information update from NewsNet and therefore we welcome your comments, suggestions and questions (Call Sandy Schulman at 1-800-952-0122 or send e-mail to sandy@newsnet.com.)

Andrew S.Elston, NewsNet's President, began the meeting by welcoming all and giving a summary of NewsNet's history-to-date. Elston was followed by Carol E. Arscott, NewsNet User Group Liaison, who gave abrief presentation on the purpose for forming the group, and a synopsis of whatwe all hope the group will accomplish in time-for the benefit of all NewsNet users. As you can imagine, a good deal of discussion focused on the Web and its implications for all of our future information needs. Michael Stein, VicePresident of Software Development, was on hand to address these issues and to answer users' questions about NewsNet's dependable Windows-based Baton product also. The outlook for a strong and active user group is promising. "The User Group has the capability to become a strong force within the company. We want to hear what NewsNet users like about the system and what they'd like to seeimproved further," said Arscott. "We want NewsNet users involved in shaping thefuture of NewsNet." The next meeting is planned for May of 1997 in conjunction with the National Online Conference in New York City. If you are interested in future NewsNet User Group activities, please contact Carol E. Arscott at 1-800-345-1301 (or, 610-527-8030 outside of the U.S. orCanada) or via e-mail at info@newsnet.com. Continue to the next article of the ActionLetter.

Nynex officials are used toupsurges in usage during bad weather and thought they hadplenty of capacity this time, but there were more phones,faxes, pagers and computer modems switched on than theycould handle. Many customers experienced delays in gettingdial tones.     NATIONWIDE, there were 45 million home-based workers in1994, up from 6 million in 1984, according to the NationalAssociation of Home-Based Businesses. That included bothself-employed people and employees who work from home. Thenumber continues to grow.* * *     GOLDILOCKS, who preferred her porridge not too hot andnot too cold, has lent her name to the current economy. Mostanalysts think the Federal Reserve has engineered it "justright," and they expect it to continue through 1996.     THAT WOULD make the new year the sixth straight year ofeconomic expansion since the last recession. If inflationremains under control, it could also be the fifth straightyear with consumer price increases under 3 percent. (Thehigh-inflation 1970s look more like an aberration everyday.)     UNEMPLOYMENT should also remain low, according to theconsensus, but that won't stop Americans from worrying.Corporate downsizing has given them a permanent sense ofinsecurity. Also, real income growth has been stagnant fortwo decades, leaving many middle-class families hard-pressedto make ends meet.     THE ECONOMIC YEAR may start slow as automakers andretailers struggle to move unsold inventories, but thecavalry is already on the way in the form of lower short-term interest rates from the Fed. Rates were cut twice lastyear as the economy faltered, and analysts say continuedtame inflation will allow further cuts in 1996.     IN SUM, there are so few clouds on the horizon thatmost economists expect stable, if boring, economic growthright through 1997. David Berson, chief economist at theFederal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), says"modest economic growth and benign inflation" are the mostlikely outlook for the next two years.Back to Headline List CopyrightAMERICAN MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996SPLIT MAILING EARNS VICTORIA'S SECRETA LAWSUIT FOR GENDER DISCRIMINATION     Denise Katzman was outraged by the obviousdiscrimination: She and a male coworker had each receivedseemingly identical lingerie catalogs from Victoria'sSecret, only his offered a $25 discount on orders of $75 ormore, while hers offered only a $10 discount.     On Jan. 2, she filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S.District Court in New York City. She sought $15reimbursements or credits from the Columbus, Ohio, companyfor anyone who received the smaller discount.     The suit alleged discrimination based both on genderand income, because the company presumably had done enoughmarket segment research to know that Katzman made less thanher coworker. The suit further alleged a historic pattern ofdiscrimination, on the grounds that the company had done thesame thing previously.     Wrong! In a brief statement released the next day,Victoria's Secret called the suit "baseless." Industryinsiders said Katzman was apparently the victim of nothingmore sinister than a "split mailing," whereby marketers testthe pulling power of various come-ons by including differentones in two or more segments of a given mail drop.Deja Vu     In 1991, American Express became embroiled in anothercontroversy involving a split mailing. The Joan Cook mail-order house, which sells housewares, wanted to mail out someof its catalogs, but not all, with the message thatcustomers could charge orders using the AmEx card.     The president of Joan Cook got the idea to try a splitmailing at a time when many retailers, restaurants and othermerchants were objecting to - and publicly revolting against- the high fees they had to pay to AmEx on each transaction,and the long time it was taking AmEx to reimburse them forcharges. Schwartz wanted to see whether "The Card" waspaying its freight, so to speak.     AmEx was trying to stamp out the revolt, and threatenedto stop doing business with Joan Cook if the company wentthrough with the split mailing. The catalog companyrelented, but AmEx was later forced to cut its fees for manymerchants after Land's End, L.L. Bean and Laura Ashleystores joined the revolt (AM, Feb. 27, 1992, p. 44).Back to Headline List CopyrightAMERICAN MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996THE MILLION-DOLLAR MARCH:L.A. BLACKS SWITCH BANKS     Hundreds of Los Angeles-area African-Americansresponded to a self-help campaign Jan. 6 and switched theirbank deposits to four black-owned institutions. In one case,Founders Bank of Los Angeles saw its deposits increase by$600,000.     The event was called "Change Bank Day." It was part ofa larger campaign called Recycling Black Dollars that calledon blacks to patronize black-owned businesses.     Campaign organizers estimate that blacks have about $9billion deposited in various Los Angeles-area banks.     "If we were able to get just 25 percent of our moneyinto black banks, we can see a hotel on Crenshaw, a hotel atthe Convention Center, new manufacturing plants in South-Central, which in turn would provide more jobs for youngblacks," says Muhammad Nassardeen, head of Recycling.     Founders Bank President Carlton Jenkins is ready to dohis part to further such dreams. He has promised to investhis depositors' money in the black community, while alsogiving his customers excellent service. Five-year-oldFounders has $100 million in assets.     "It's just phenomenal!" said Jenkins of the $600,000windfall the bank received Jan. 6. Sounding somewhat likemovie banker Jimmy Stewart, he added, "What they're sayingis, 'We've finally arrived with you, Carlton!'"     The other institutions participating in Change Bank Daydid not immediately release information on the amounts oftheir new deposits.Don't Call It Separatism     Nassardeen insists that the campaign is about self-help, not racial separatism. "We're into survival," hedeclares. "Nobody ever called it racism when other peoplewere doing it."     The concept of financial solidarity within the blackcommunity has been around for years, but it was recentlyrevitalized by the Million Man March on Washington, D.C.     "It was time to let people know that we are not thepoor people that many people have depicted us to be,"Nassardeen says.Back to Headline List CopyrightAMERICAN MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996BANKERS DISCOUNT CREDIT CRUNCH,EXPECT SURGE IN HOME BANKING     As the new year approached, the Consumer BankersAssociation (CBA) polled its board of directors for theiroutlook on a number of vital issues. They were emphatic ontwo issues of interest to marketers: 1) They do not believethe recent increase in consumer debt levels will lead to asignificant pullback in spending; 2) They are certain thathome banking is about to become very hot.     "There will most likely not be a major financial shockin 1996 as a result of the consumer loan situation of 1995,"says William MacDonald III, president and CEO of NationalCity Bank in Cleveland and chairman of the CBA.     MacDonald concedes that many banks "extended" theircredit standards in 1995 to make more money on interestpayments. They were particularly aggressive about issuingnew credit cards.     But although the ratio of consumer installment debt toincome has risen as a result, "the good news is that creditcard debt is but one segment of consumer debt," he says. "Tofairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans fromhome equity and personal and revolving credit lines." Viewedfrom this "macro" perspective, he argues, "the debt levelnumbers are not as alarming."     And given a relatively high level of consumerconfidence, "experts are not looking for consumerretrenchment in the near future," he continues, but adds, "Iexpect to see some tightening of consumer credit standardsand an increase to more historically normal loss anddelinquency ratios."A Naysayer in Dixie     MacDonald's sanguine outlook is not shared by JohnKirby, who heads the Consumer Lending Group at SouthTrustBank of Alabama, headquartered in Birmingham. (His boss,Chairman and CEO Julian Banton, sits on the CBA board.)     "In my opinion, 1996 will be a year when we see higherdelinquency and loan losses as the consumer becomesoverextended," Kirby says. "Consumer purchases will softenbecause of this trend as the year proceeds."     Kirby says too many banks have lowered their creditstandards to maintain earnings in the face of growingcompetition. They have engaged in a race to the bottom onrates for credit cards and auto loans. That forces prudentlenders into a Hobson's choice: accept more marginalapplicants, or leave their business to someone else.     In either case, the marginal applicant gets the loan,and Kirby fears many of them will be unable to keep up thepayments in 1996.Home Banking     "It is no longer a question of whether clients want andare willing to use home banking; the question is how many,how soon and how much will they pay for it?" says RichardHartnack, vice chairman of Union Bank in Los Angeles.     "A number of factors are converging to make 1996 theyear of electronic banking," says Linnet Deily, who ischairman, president and CEO of First Interstate Bank ofTexas, based in Houston.     She explains: "Consumers are increasingly comfortablewith online technology; time is an ever-more preciouscommodity; and millions of Americans are alreadyenthusiastic users of personal financial management softwarepackages such as Quicken and Microsoft Money.     "Judging by the level of enrollment in the first weeksafter First Interstate Bank began offering online servicesand our usage trends on check cards, electronic banking willbe a significant part of how we do business in the future."FTC Warning     At the CBA's recent annual conference, an official fromthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned bankers to becareful with the Pandora's Box represented by onlinebanking.     "Technology provides unprecedented opportunity togather information on consumers," said David Medine, theFTC's associate director for credit practices, but bankersmust control the temptation to sell such information tomarketers. "The challenge will be to educate consumers abouthow information is gathered and used, and then provide themwith a vehicle for exercising choice."

WOULD HEALTHYFOOD PRODUCTS TASTE AS SWEET?     America's love affair with healthier foods has mademany government truth-in-labeling standards obsolete. Whyinsist that "peanut butter" contain 90 percent peanuts whena less-concentrated version can taste as good and be farhealthier?     That is essentially the question asked by the U.S.Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) in twin Dec. 29 notices in the FederalRegister. The notices invite public comment on proposedchanges to a wide range of naming and labeling rules.     The regulators say many old-fashioned rules are denyingfood processors the opportunity to offer healthier and moreconvenient products. But some processors and consumeradvocates worry that looser rules will allow watered-down oreven adulterated versions of common foods.On the Table     Without apparent ironic intent, FDA food labelingofficial Betty Campbell says "everything is on the table" inthe current review. She insists that food labels will stillhave to list ingredients and nutritional values, regardlessof any other changes that may be enacted.     That does not satisfy Larry Davenport, president of theAtlanta-based International Jelly and Preserve Association.     "Without federal standards," he warns, "it opens thefield to a free-fire zone where people can do whatever theywant, which is to, say, make a sweet-tasting paste of somesort, with coloring and sugar, call it a jelly or jam orpreserve."     Currently, strawberry jelly has to be almost one-halfstrawberries to wear that name. Beef stew must be one-quarter beef by weight. The rules date to 1938, when theywere intended to keep processors from watering down theirproducts or stretching them with fillers. Perversely, therules often encourage high fat, sugar and salt content.     Even our everyday language has left the old standardsbehind. People who say, "Pass the butter" or "Pass thecream" these days do not necessarily expect to receive thereal thing. Yet, technically speaking, butter must be 80percent butterfat, and cream must be cream, not half andhalf.     Dairy farmers have actually lost business because theycould not lighten up their products without relabeling them,says Fergus Clydesdale, head of the Food Science Departmentat the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.     To be sure, health considerations have already led tochanges in some rules involving water, fillers and labeling.The FDA has ruled that the product once called "ice milk"may now be sold as "low-fat ice cream." But the agencycomplains that each such change requires a cumbersome andexpensive special review under current rules.The Specific Proposals     The USDA wants to allow reduced-fat versions of hotdogs, ground meats and other meat products to go by thetraditional names, so long as their labels clearly statethat water or fillers have been added.     Both the USDA and the FDA are proposing to allow theuse of such common terms as beef stew, peanut butter, etc.on healthier versions, provided that the percentage of beef,peanuts or other key ingredient is revealed on the label.     Michael Taylor, who supervises meat inspections for theUSDA, says, "Presumably, there's some point at which there'sso little beef it's misleading inherently to call it beefstew, but what's magic about 25 percent?"

That's what consumers said, essentially, in focusgroups made up of regular Unocal customers and drivers whopatronize other stations. They were far less interested inalleged performance differences between brands - thetraditional pitch - than in convenient squeegees with soapywater, paper towels, and clean, well-supplied restrooms.     Accordingly, the TWBA Chiat/Day advertising agency cameup with a campaign of TV and radio spots with the theme, "WeGet It." It started running in Southern California on thefirst, and is slated to run in Northern California soon. Itemphasizes the "little things" people want.     "We learned that gasoline is not a primary factor inchoosing a service station," says Cindy Hearn, Unocal'smarketing director. "We get it: people want more than goodgasoline; they want the little things that make theirexperience at the station as efficient, quick and pleasantas possible."Focus Group Art     During the focus groups, participants were asked toshare their feelings about service stations - not justorally, but through a sort of arts-and-crafts exercise. Theymade collages of words and pictures relating to service, andthey drew cartoonlike "thought bubbles" filled with theirfeelings about the fill-up experience.     Hearn says the "We Get It" campaign is less a promotionthan a new way of doing business, designed to maximizecustomer convenience and minimize hassle. As part of thisnew push, all local dealers have been asked to sign pledgescommitting themselves to the new philosophy. Point-of-salematerials reinforce the message.     "We are making a long-term commitment to consumers,"says Lawrence Higby, president of the 76 Products Co., therefining, marketing and transportation unit of Unocal. "The76 ball has always stood for gasoline quality, and now itwill become a symbol of guaranteed good service, too."

Public studies areopen to participation by anyone who visits the three sites.     Greenfield's quantitative research includes opinionpolls; attitude and usage studies; customer satisfaction andtracking research; market segmentation, concept and producttesting; plus advertising and Web site testing. Qualitativeresearch includes focus groups, in-depth interviews, idea-generation sessions and management problem-solving sessions.Who Needs It?     The company expects many of its clients will bemarketers with World Wide Web sites. Spokes-man HughBraithwaite says online research studies "will help clientsto optimize their corporate and brand imagery and overallsite effectiveness, measured against specific marketingobjectives."     Andrew Greenfield, president of the parent GreenfieldConsulting Group, says online research is not only logicalfor online marketers, but an almost mandatory means ofintelligence-gathering.     "With speed to market emerging as a key corporatestrategy for success, we believe online research will becomean increasingly valuable means of achieving projectefficiency and cost control," he explains.     Although online research is an infantile offshoot oftraditional research methods, the Greenfield group says ithas proven to be statistically comparable to them. In arecent test, survey results collected via Prodigy proved tobe virtually identical to results obtained by telephone.     In other respects, the company says, online researchhas clear advantages. It can reach people who have littleinclination to participate in traditional phone and mailsurveys, and in-depth interviews can be conducted acrosswide geographic regions without the time and expense oftravel.     "Traditional research studies that previously took fiveto 10 business days will now be designed, administered andanalyzed almost overnight and ready for the weekly marketingmeeting," says Paul Jacobson, v.p. for marketing forGreenfield Online.

The WFS saysthese are not forecasts or predictions, which imply a highdegree of probability, but "futuribles," or realisticconceptualizations of possible future developments. Some aremerely linear projections of developments that are alreadywell under way, but others are more visionary:     y A microchip implanted somewhere on our bodies mightserve as a combination credit card, passport, driver'slicense, personal diary - you name it. Implants might evenhelp us think.     y Local languages will disappear at an acceleratingpace as global communications induce people to adopt commonones. English, which already dominates global computer net-works and communications, among other fields, may become thedominant language worldwide.Cyberghettos     y Neighborhoods may become more, not less, homogeneous,because people who "telecommute" to their jobs will be ableto live wherever they feel most comfortable. Generally, thatmeans among people of their own demographic groups.     y Digital assistants, using artificial intelligence,will surf through thousands of online catalogs and consumerinformation banks to identify the products and services wewant. They will then solicit bids from competing suppliers.Although highly efficient target marketing will eliminatethe proverbial "wasted" half of all advertising costs, muchof the savings will be spent on getting around the digitalassistants, which will be programmed to filter out "junk"messages.     y "Smart cards" and crime fears will finally make papercurrency obsolete. Federal Express has not accepted cash atmost of its air freight locations for 10 years now, and manyretailers are following suit. This may put a severe crimp inthe so-called "underground economy," because it will becomeincreasingly difficult to exchange funds without creating arecord of the transaction.     y Government officials and dissidents, as well asbusinesses and consumer advocates, will increasingly usecyberspace to spread disinformation as well as facts.Anonymous individuals will share the online forum withgovernment information bureaus and Madison Avenue. Small-time snake-oil salesmen, cranks, radicals and slandererswill have a potential audience of millions.Dollars for Data     y Much of the information on the Internet will remainfree or nearly free, but a growing amount will be availableonly for a fee. Information providers who can't or won'tfinance dissemination through advertising or otherunderwriting will have to charge for it (see box, below).     y The new media may make people increasingly insular,egocentric and selfish. First, it will allow them to avoidmany in-person contacts. Meanwhile, content providers andmarketers will compete for their attention by courting themas all-important members of a special elite. The result maybe widespread narcissistic self-satisfaction.     Finally, the society notes that not even its best mindscan foresee everything in the future:     y Many of the biggest payoffs from informa-tion/communications technology will come as surprises. "Theywill be serendipitous benefits that nobody planned buteveryone will want to take credit for," says WFS PresidentEdward Cornish.

Most of the employees at the government's chief number-crunching agencies - the Bureau of Labor Statistics and theCommerce Department's various statistical branches - werefurloughed in mid-December because Congress and PresidentClinton could not agree on a continuing resolution. Theirleave was extended into the week of Jan. 8 by a blizzardthat paralyzed the East Coast.     Without those statisticians, the economic and businesscommunities had no data on such things as consumer spending,unemployment, new housing starts, inflation, the GrossDomestic Product and international trade.     That caused immediate nervousness on Wall Street, wheremarkets often rally or tumble based on the latest economicnumber. Traders were left to their own devices, and theybegan to make decisions based on the latest word aboutbudget talks between the White House and Capitol Hill.     But many businesses also use government statistics.According to Labor Secretary Robert Reich, "The privatesector really does rely on this information [for] everythingfrom what to order, when to order, how optimistic to beabout inventories and sales. Without these reports, it isnot just the financial community that's handicapped, it'salso the entire business community."     Many trend watchers fell back on "the understudies," asCommerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich called privatelycompiled numbers on manufacturing and sales of previouslyowned homes, autos and chain-store goods.     "But they're just not as reliable," says Morgan StanleyChief Economist Stephen Roach. "It's pretty hazardous todraw solid conclusions from these types of numbers."     In the end, though, Roach says even lost data will havelittle effect, so long as the flow resumes soon. "If we losta month or two along the way, it won't be a disaster. But ifit lasts a long time, it will [create] problems...,"especially if the Fed makes a misstep with regard tointerest rates.Back to Headline List WT02-B32-281IA095-001020-B043-27http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ad28.html 205.156.212.5 19970121214906 text/html 185980HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 21-Jan-97 21:46:15 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:42:23 GMTContent-length: 185794Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ad28.html Sample Issue Copyright FORECAST via NewsNet JANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES The Changing Face Of The American Worker (2623 words) A Penny Saved Is Two Pennies Earned (1077 words) TECHNICAL SUPPORT: READERS' QUESTIONS ANSWERED (1720 words) The Northwest Trades Wood Chips For Microchips (1738 words) I'm Okay, Eurokay?

The mix is a far cry from 1960 when, according tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90% of the permanent job pool consisted ofskilled and semi-skilled white men.  Today, there may not be a job foreverybody, but many more kinds of people are available to work.In the next 10 years, not only will the labor market retain its kaleidoscopicquality, the ranks of older workers, minorities and women will expand a gooddeal further.  BLS projects that in 2005, 62% of all workers will be women andminorities, compared with 58% in 1992.  One out of every three people over theage of 55 will be in the work force; 39% of the labor pool will be 45 orolder, up from a current level of 31%.As a result, experts foresee rising numbers of part-time skilled employeesworking later in life than did the previous generation.  As workplacediversity becomes even more obvious, issues concerning the glass ceiling forwomen and minorities and adjusting management to different work styles willhave to be addressed with more effective diversity programs.  Moreover,training, compensation and benefits programs will have to change to take intoaccount the needs of this multicultural labor force.Retraining existing workers to fill projected needs will become one way toretain valued employees in an age when neither employee nor employer canexpect lifelong loyalty.  Compensation programs based on productivity andincluding investment options are likely to become even more common than theyare today.  Benefits that make life easier for two-income families and singleparents will give companies an edge in the competition for the best jobcandidates.Of course, today's employers already have begun making some adjustments forwomen and minorities, but few have thought about what it will mean toaccommodate large numbers of aging members of the Baby Boom generation.  Theywill soon find themselves doing so.  As Philip Rones, a Bureau of LaborStatistics expert on aging workers, puts it, "Throughout their working lives,the Baby Boomers have dominated the work force demographics.  This is notgoing to change as this group ages."One reason many older Baby Boomers will still be working in 2005 and beyond:they won't have the enticements to end their careers as early as many of theirparents.  Several recent initiatives, if passed, would further reduce thefeasibility of early retirement.  A proposal before Congress would raise theminimum eligibility age for Social Security payments.  Smaller companycontributions to pension plans will discourage early retirement.  In short,not only will aging Baby Boomers comprise a large percentage of peopleavailable to work in 2005-many will have to stay on the job longer.Age Plus Skills Equals JobsThe predicted abundance of older workers should prove very good news to manycompanies.  By the time 2005 rolls around, middle-aged and elderly employeeswill possess two of the characteristics most prized by bosses:  they'll beexperienced and they'll be cheap.  Many companies will be eager to keep themin the work force.This will be a significant change from today's labor atmosphere.  After all,company after company has spent the past decade kicking aging workers offpayrolls to cut costs.  Not only do older workers, by dint of seniority, tendto have the highest salaries, they also may have more health problems, afactor that drives up company medical plan costs.However, Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit ResearchInstitute, says several changes in compensation and related areas-alreadyunderway at some companies-should level the playing field for older workerssoon.  By 2005 this set of workers will be no more or less desirable thanyounger employees, because soon there will be little cost difference inemploying various age groups, he says."What I find really interesting is that there are things taking place forreasons that have nothing to do with older workers," Salisbury observes.  "Yetthese changes will make it more desirable to employ this group in the future.We seem to be entering a new era of age neutrality in the workplace."These initiatives include the movement toward pegging salaries to anindividual's performance or that of his work division.  "Many companies fearthat older workers slow down somewhat and don't produce as much," he says."However, when salary is tied to performance, those who don't work as harddon't cost as much.  In addition, you create an incentive for people tocontinue producing top-quality work, year after year, no matter what theirage.""The movement toward defined contribution pension plans also makes it mucheasier to employ older people," Salisbury adds.  "In the past, most companiesoffered straight pensions, which meant that they had to pay more into plans asworkers got older, no matter what.  Now, the employee has to pick up some ofthe costs himself.  And, what the company pays is tied to how much the workerearns, not his age."A third trend-offering salary packages that mix cash, stocks and bonds-oftenappeals to older workers because they need to pile up investments, Salisburysays.  Although these weren't designed with older workers in mind, suchbenefits work in their favor.There's another factor likely to increase the desirability of older workersover the next 10 years.  The Baby Boom boasted more college graduates than anyother generation in American history, according to Education Departmentstatistics.  "The future belongs very much to workers with strong skill sets,"says Alan Reynolds, a scholar at the Indianapolis-based Hudson Institute."The demand for them already is outstripping the supply.  Today there are over100 million people in the labor force, and only about 20% of them have collegedegrees."BLS predictions about employment growth by industry between now and 2005follow a pattern of more jobs in services and fewer in manufacturing, themodel that has dominated the U.S.  economy since the 1970s.  Although someservice jobs require little education, nearly all high-paying ones call for atleast a college degree.  And few require the physical strength and dexterityusually associated with younger workers.Barbara Adolf, a benefits expert in the Fort Lee, New Jersey, office ofconsulting firm Kwasha Lipton, predicts that aging workers will be wellpositioned in 2005-providing they are well-educated.  "In the next century,there'll be more competition for skilled workers-particularly in high-tech andservice jobs," she says.  "Companies already are much leaner.  They're sayingin effect.  'There's no room for fat anywhere.  Each job has to count andcontribute to the company's goals.' All this creates a tremendous pressure onorganizations and individuals to perform.  Suddenly, human resourcesdepartments have become very important to companies.""The good news for workers, though, is that if they have the right skill sets,they will be sought after," she says.  "Many very talented people actually nowfind themselves in stronger positions than they were when companies werefatter.  In the next century, this should mean that highly skilled olderworkers will find themselves both more in demand and with fewer young peopleas competition."Of course, in between the lines, Adolf implies that 2005 will be a very harshtime for aging employees-as well as the younger ones-who lack the requisitebackground.Steve Bookbinder, a vice president in the Boston office of managementconsultant Towers Perrin, says the skilled older workers of 2005 should havelittle trouble attracting jobs-on the company's terms.  "Corporate Americawould love to be able to hire many experienced workers," he says.  "They'llprobably try to hire them part-time, so they don't have to pay their medicalbenefits or fund their pensions."Martin Sicker agrees with Bookbinder's latter conclusion.  The economist headsthe older workers program for the Washington, D.C.-based American Associationof Retired Persons.  He says workers over age 55 often are forced out offull-time employment and into a string of part-time jobs.  A recent BLS studyalso documents a very strong increase in older men being forced intoretirement, then taking low-paying, part-time jobs with few benefits.During the last 10 years, the trend of pushing aging workers out of permanentjobs and into consultancies and other part-time arrangements has createdtremendous tensions between old and young workers, to say nothing ofmanagement and labor.However, there are some good reasons to think this hostility will subside.  AsEBRI's Dallas Salisbury points out, there is a strong trends towardage-neutral wage and benefits policies, a phenomenon that should lessen someof the stigma against aging workers.  In addition, with the largest block ofthe population, the Baby Boomers, approaching late middle years, older workerswill become socially and politically more powerful.Dealing with DiversityAging workers are not the only cohort that will be represented in greaternumbers in the work force in 2005.  The ranks of women and the minorities willalso be larger.Many experts believe women are the growing demographic segment best adapted tothe economy of 2005, with its preponderance of service jobs.  "Traditionally,women have been well-represented in service industries," says Ken Goldstein, alabor economist with Manhattan's Conference Board.  "They have tended togravitate toward these jobs, and society generally has accepted them in thesepositions.  In fact, one of the reasons larger numbers of women have beenentering the work force in recent years is the increase in services work.  Ifour economy was still concentrated in heavy industry, there probably would notbe as many women workers."The fate of minorities in the 2005 job pool will be strongly linked toeducational achievement and skills training.  "Historically, there have beenrelatively large proportions of dropouts among minorities," says the HudsonInstitute's Alan Reynolds.  "To survive in the economy of the future, it'svery important that more minorities become college graduates.  Actually, thisalready has started happening for blacks.  Education Department statisticsshow that more blacks are entering college than ever before."While it's likely that a good share of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asianswill possess the education needed to snare jobs in 2005, many companies willhave to alter their workplace culture in order to create an atmosphere inwhich all types of workers can be productive.Michael Wheeler, a Conference Board associate who recently completed a studyof corporate diversity initiatives, says that while progressive managementscurrently tend to be aware of the need for an inclusive atmosphere, theyfalter in their attempts to generate one.  "There's a gap between awarenessand understanding what to do.  And our study included only companies thatvolunteered to establish diversity initiatives.  Right now, there's a lot oftalk, but not a lot of models."A recent study by the Center for the New American Work force at Queens Collegein New York City concluded that diversity strategies often fail because theyare not linked to positive business initiatives.  Instead, many companiesstart such programs just to avoid lawsuits and unfavorable publicity.However, Wheeler believes that diversity initiatives will increase, both innumber and importance, between now and 2005 because there are compellingbusiness reasons to create an inclusive culture.  "The first reason iscreativity," he says.  "When you have people coming together from a variety ofbackgrounds to discuss business issues, you get more responses and moreoptions for solving problems.""Our study showed that cross-cultural problem-solving groups often take longerto get started than homogenous groups, because it takes more time for peoplewho differ to understand each other," he says.  "But the work was definitelymore creative and far-sighted than when people from like backgrounds gottogether."  The second business advantage of a diverse team:  it reflects themarketplace.  "More and more, the U.S.  is made up of all sorts of people fromall sorts of backgrounds," Wheeler says.  "And this is the prime customer basethat many companies want to sell to.  There's a lot to be said for having awork force that looks like your customer base."He adds, "In the past U.S.  companies operating in foreign markets often madethe mistake of bringing all their staff from home.  Often they wound up makingstupid mistakes that wouldn't have occurred if they'd had talked more to thelocals.  Companies are in danger of being in the same predicament at home-ifthey don't try to include many types of people in their decision-makingprocesses.""And that's the whole point about 2005," Wheeler says.  "Companies will findways to work with all these different kinds of employees-better ways than theyhave now-so that they can appeal to many kinds of customers"Redefining BenefitsCompanies still need good employees, even though they are unwilling to financelifelong employment and defined-benefit pension plans.  This often translatesinto a situation in which employers go out of their way to provide benefitsthat don't cost the corporation much, but nonetheless simplify and improvelife for the workers.For instance, Kwasha Lipton's Adolph says her own company has begun offeringsuch innovative benefits as on-site car washes and laundry pick-ups, as wellas payroll programs that make automatic de- ductions for consumer purchaseslike car payments.  Such offerings are shrewd corporate moves, she points out,because they win the workers' gratitude and generally cost very little.  Ofcourse, providing these services on-site also reduces workers' outsidechores-and keeps them at their desks longer.Telecommunications company GTE Corp.  in Stamford, Connecticut, has developeda number of programs tailored to women, who comprise about 60% of itsemployees.  They include a back-up on-site daycare center, open on work dayswhen school is out, and a referral service for care providers for olderrelatives."Many members of the Baby Boom generation will have critical childcare andeldercare needs, often at the same time," Adolf says.  "More employers willneed to offer supports-beyond the traditional compensation and benefits-sothese workers, particularly the women, can do their jobs."Another of the far-sighted new benefit offerings is continuing education.These programs soothe the workers' fears of job loss by enabling them toexpand their skills and retain their desirability in the marketplace, Adolfsays.  At the same time, the programs do not involve a promise of continuedwork from the employer.Northern States Power, a Minneapolis utility, has developed an innovativeprogram that addresses both workers' fear of unemployability and management'sdread of an underprepared work force.  The company's offerings includeteaching computer skills to meter readers, a job category Northern Statesplans to replace with machinery.  The utility also is a leader in providinghigh-potential members of minority groups and with professional mentors.Adolf adds that in some shrewdly managed companies, the death of the conceptof a job-for-life has freed both management and workers to negotiate eachjob's hours, structures and benefits on a creative and individual basis."For instance, the whole issue of flexibility is very important today," shesays.  "Both sides are demanding more flexibility.  Many workers withresponsibilities at home want to be able to take time off to care forrelatives.  At the same time, new technologies allow some workers to workoutside their offices.  For their part, companies have financial reasons forwanting people either to work part time or out of the office."In the future, she says, this new freedom, will work to the advantage of bothmanagement and labor-if they learn the art of making trade-offs.Leslie Wines is senior writer of Forecast.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996A Penny Saved Is Two Pennies EarnedFact:  in 1995, there were about 34 million Americans age 65 or over.Fact:  by 2010, there will be about 40 million Americans age 65 or over.By 2020, there will be about 53 million Americans age 65 or over.By 2030, there will be about 70 million Americans age 65 or over.This is called both a problem and an opportunity.The problem is that under any reasonable understanding of the Social Securitysystem, the great bulk of these people will not be able to retire with thesame level of benefits that retirees have now.  This will lead to a stupendousstruggle over benefits and who will be cut the most in coming years anddecades.The downside hints at the upside:  If Americans cannot reasonably expectthemselves to be cared for adequately by the Social Security system, they willhave to pay into their own private savings and investment schemes to supportthemselves in their golden years.The scope of the effort required is enormous.  If you look at it on anindividual basis and then on a collective basis, you get an idea of the moneythat will be needed.Take a baby boom couple who have reached age 45.  They have around 20 moreyears to work, or so we will imagine.  Their combined earnings are $100,000 ayear (just to make it easy).  They spend almost all of that on living, plustaxes, saving only a few thousand a year.  At age 65, if inflation stays inthe bottle at 3.5% per year, they will need to make almost exactly $200,000 ayear to equal the buying power of today's $100,000.  By age 75, they will need$281,000, and by age 85, which they can be expected to reach, they will needabout $400,000 per annum.To make it really simple, let's imagine that the lucky couple, whom we willcall Mike and Ginger Bayer, will need to live on $280,000 per year for theentire 20 years between retirement and shuffling off this mortal coil.It's reasonable to expect that Social Security will pay for some of this.Unless there is some major upheaval, a couple paying in all their workinglives and getting every possible Social Security benefit is likely to receive$60,000 a year by 2015, or about twice what they would have received at thetop end of the current benefits scale.  (Bear in mind that all of thesenumbers are approximate.)That means the Bayers must bring in about $220,000 per year from other sourcesby 2015.  To do so, they should have a capital sum-that is, savings-largeenough to provide that yield.Assuming mild inflation of 3.5% per annum, the Bayers might expect to earninterest of 6.5% on their investments in 2015.  This means they need to amassa capital sum of roughly $3,384,615 by 2015.  This sum will allow them tospend at their 1995 level and also to save, adding to their capital, so thatthey will have higher interest earnings in the future when they need them.This would also allow them to leave a decent sum to their children, to providefor any hazards that lie in the future.Now here comes the part that will make the couple's hair stand on end andshould make Merrill Lynch start salivating.Suppose the Bayers have the decent, but by no means lavish, sum of $200,000already saved as of mid-1995.  Imagine further that they can earn 9% pretax-7%after tax-on their investments.  This is not a staggeringly good rate ofreturn, but it is a fine historic rate.  To get to $3,386,000 by 2015, theBayers will have to save $4,947 per month.  Of a likely after-tax monthlyincome of perhaps $6,000, the Bayers will have to save about five-sixths.Impossible?  Well, maybe so.  So let's give the Bayers a break.  Let's saythey will be able to earn 10% per year, all in annuities, and that the yearthey retire taxation is abolished.  This is unlikely, but let's be really,really generous in our assumptions.  The Bayers will still have to save about$2,528 per month, or about 42% of their after-tax income.Of course, to the extent that the Bayers can spend less and cut their standardof living after they retire, they will need to spend less.  But just how easyis it to spend less when faced with the demons of boredom, opportunity fortravel because of the end of work and the possibility of declining health?The Bayers would also have to save much less if they lived on their savings asan annuity, using up part of principal and interest each month.  But just howmuch do they want to risk outliving their capital?  And how badly do they wantto leave money to their children in this highly uncertain world?  For comfortof mind, substantial savings are called for.Obviously, if the Bayers could start out with $200,000 at age 35 and have 30years instead of 20 to save up for their retirement, their payments to savingseach month could be far smaller.  The advantage comes from the gains made bycompounding the excess of the rate of return on their investments above theinflation rate for a long period.There are several key numbers-oriented points here.  If middle aged peoplehave any sense at all, they are terrified about their retirement.  If theireyes are open, they will be looking to save as much as they possibly can.Their advantage will be immensely increased to the extent that they canincrease the yield on their savings.  (If you save $20,000 per year for 20years at 10%, you come out with $1,145,000.  If you can earn 13%, you have$1,619,000.  If you can earn 15%, you have about $2,050,000.)Now, multiply the Bayers by tens of millions of middle-class people preparingfor their golden years.This surely must be the marketing opportunity of all American history.  It'shonest and straightforward, and the numbers tell the story.  It's a scarystory, but it's almost criminal not to hear it.Benjamin J.

All too often, what you see on yourscreen is a thing of beauty compared to what you print out.  Fortunately,there are solutions to this problem.Dear Forecast,We use mapping techniques extensively for site location.  I spend several dayseach month building maps that look good on my computer monitor, but when I tryto print them on the color printer, they look fuzzy and my labels [text] printlike characters made of blocks.  I'm working on an IBM PC and the printer is aHewlett-Packard.Jan S.  Spokane, WAJan, it would help if we knew exactly what kind of printer you were using asHP builds many different units, but the underlying issues are the same for allprinters.  In addition to the obvious differences between printer technologies(dot matrix, ink jet, laserprinter, thermal wax and dye sublimation), thereare three kinds of printer "languages" in use.  What we're talking about isthe lingo employed to convert computer output into printed pages.1.  The most basic printing engine simply prints a series of characters asthey are output by the computer.  Such a beast cannot print graphics, since itis strictly character-based, with the shape of each character kept in theprinter's modest memory.  This is (fortunately), a dying breed due to itsinability to handle graphics and multiple type sizes and fonts.  Since you canprint the maps, albeit fuzzily, you don't have this dinosaur.  2.  The secondkind of printer-probably what you are using-prints each page as a series ofdots.  Type characters are composed of dots that shape each letter.  Thisprinter can print graphics, but its type reproduction abilities are limited.This technology is used in non-PostScript printers, but font outlinetechnologies such as TrueType are improving type output from these printers.3.  Last, and arguably best, is the PostScript printer.  Type is sent to theprinter as vector-based descriptions of each letter, called outlines.  Theprinter prints the outline of the character with very smooth precision andthen fills in the letters.  Some images are composed of PostScript code, too.Programs such as Adobe Illustrator create PostScript files.The advantage of this technology is that the edges of lines used to createletters and shapes are much smoother and can be enlarged or reduced with noloss of quality.  PostScript printers cost more than other models because theyrequire additional printer-based computer power.  There's also a fee paid bythe printer's manufacturer to license PostScript from Adobe Systems, itsdesigner.  This adds a few hundred dollars to the cost of these units.Problem #1:  Your problem with the label type coming out in blocks is fairlycommon with non-PostScript printers.  You can solve that problem quickly byadjusting to your printer's limitations.  Just make sure to use only the fontsand font sizes included with your printer's software.But if you need a greater selection of fonts than your printer has available,install TrueType on your computer and then use only TrueType fonts.  TrueTypecomes with Windows and Macintosh operating systems, and there are thousands ofTrueType fonts on the online services.  Look in the desktop publishingsoftware areas.Problem #2:  As for your maps looking fuzzy, if you are using a color ink-jetmodel HP printer, you may be using the wrong paper.  Regular paper suitablefor copiers and laserprinters absolutely won't work for quality color printingwith ink jets.  In fact, dust from conventional copier bond can clog yourprinter's heads, requiring frequent cleaning or replacement.Buy ink-jet paper made by companies such as Epson and HP and see if your mapsdon't suddenly appear clean and vibrant with color.  This paper is availableat most computer stores and large office supply houses.  For top-qualityprinting, try HP's Premium Glossy Paper.  It's expensive, but your maps andcolor charts and graphics will look better than ever.Dear Forecast,We are assembling an investment report for our shareholders.  We tried using alaserprinter output but our printer said it was not good enough for "repro"(what's that?).  Would a better laserprinter fix the problem as ours isgetting old?Shelley L.  Beaverton, ORDear Forecast,I would like to put my charts on 35mm slides, but it's very expensive at thephoto house I use.  Is there a better way?Brian H.  Truro, MAThe solution to both of these problems is similar, so we'll handle themtogether:Brian, we assume that you are creating colored charts on a PC (or Mac) andthen taking the printed output to a professional photo service.  There, theyessentially have to re-create your art and that is expensive.A better way to handle this is with a device called a film recorder.  Itconnects to your computer and reproduces your slides on conventional 35mmfilm.  Film recorders are expensive, starting in the $1,500 range for a fairlyunsophisticated unit, so you may not be able to afford one.  But there's abetter solution.  Read on.Shelley, essential to quality reproduction-that's what "repro" means-isresolution.  For decent reproduction of type, you'll need a laserprinter withat least 600 by 600 dots per inch (600 dpi).  For photos, 1,200 dpi isrequired.  But here, too, there's a better way.Use a service bureau.  This is a well-equipped shop that owns a printer ofsorts called an imagesetter.  This expensive device takes computer output (PCor Mac) and renders it to photographic paper or film.  While your laserprinterstruggles with 300 or 600 dpi, imagesetters typically output at 2,500 dpi andup.That's the kind of resolution, Shelley, that will satisfy your print shop.Service bureaus are found in the phone book under desktop publishing,photographic film processing and typesetting.  Many offer free pick-up anddelivery, although we would definitely shop price.  Prices per page run from$5 to $15 depending on output size, paper or film, output quality andquantity.Brian, you may need to do a little more shopping.  While every service bureauowns an imagesetter (it is their raison d'etre), not all possess a filmrecorder.  Call around or pick up a copy of desktop publishing magazinePublish!  and look at the ads in the back.  Shops around the country offerfilm recorder services complete with acceptance via modem and overnightdelivery of the finished slides.Cost:  about $5 to $15 per slide depending on the shop.  Again, shop price andlook for a shop that outputs at 4,000 lines per inch (lpi), not 1,500 or2,500, since that's not good enough for high-quality 35mm slides.Dear Forecast,How can I videotape the maps I make?  I use MapInfo on a Macintosh IIvx.Hideko K.  Chicago, ILWe'll tackle this topic the best we can here, as it's really more suitable fora book.  First, don't use a camcorder to shoot the screen.  The results willbe horrendous.Instead, what you want to do is to capture the computer's internal videosignal and send that to the videotape.  The easiest way to accomplish thisminor miracle is to use an add-on video board, which can be purchased for bothMacintoshes and PCs.These boards aren't cheap, unfortunately, with price tags over $1,000 forquality models.  (Owners of Macintosh AV-models have this ability built in.)Some computer configurations and add-on boards are only capable of 20 framesper second (fps), but this makes for a jumpy video.  The videotapes you areused to seeing are recorded at 30 fps.With a fast computer, the right board, software, enough memory and a gianthard disk, full-screen 30 fps is now possible on personal computers.  Butwe're afraid, Hideko, that you're going to have to swap that IIvx for a fastermachine-at least a Quadra 6100AV or a Pentium 100 or better.To capture video, you simply run your mapping session and send it to the tapethrough the board's output jacks.  The owner's manual will explain the correctprocedure.  Look for a board packaged with useful video management and editingsoftware such as Video Spigot/Adobe Premiere where possible.  Your originaltape will need editing unless you're capable of a perfect session with no longpauses.  And, this is assuming that the finished tapes don't demand the kindof quality seen on TV.For professional quality, you probably should seek professional help.  Theequipment required is quite expensive, and final polish will require anediting console and an experienced operator.  Pros can also add nuances suchas captions, titling, music and effects-all for a price, of course.You can also dump your "movie" to QuickTime on Macs, but this is an additionalstep if your real need is videotape.You can, however, use QuickTime and a QuickTime editing package to edit yourmovie before shipping it to tape.Last, if you do use slow computer, shoot screen shots of each change to themap.  Then build a file of these shots, dumping each one over and over.  (At20 fps, a 4-second shot requires you to dump the same screen to tape 80times.)  The finished file can then be dumped to video and your machine'sspeed won't be such a significant problem.  This will, however, take time andpatience on your end in order to get the timing and pseudo-animation right.You can also use a product such as Macromedia Director to help you build yourmovie.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996The Northwest Trades Wood Chips For MicrochipsThe first half of the 1990s produced a substantial economic restructuring inthe Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington, one that will fuel theregion's growth for the rest of this decade.The federal forests, long a major source of timber for wood productmanufacturing in these states, were virtually shut down to provide improvedhabitats for endangered species.  That forced thousands of logging and millworkers to find new jobs.  Boeing Corp., the largest manufacturer inWashington, downsized significantly in response to commercial airplane orderdeferments and cancellations, as well as to the weaker defense and spaceproducts market.Despite these adverse developments, however, these states have continued toenjoy healthy rates of growth.  The reasons:  the expansion of thehigh-technology industry and the migration in of people and firms.  By the endof 1995, the negative forces had moderated.Better, new high-tech projects now underway should keep the PacificNorthwest's economy climbing at a pace above the national average for the nextseveral years, and the region's increasing economic diversity will cushion itagainst any mild cyclical downturn.Oregon No Longer TrailsOregon today might be described as the poster child of industrialtransformation, celebrating a series of announcements of new or expandedhigh-technology facilities.The list of companies boosting their production in Oregon includes SanJose-based microchip manufacturer LSI Logic Corp., Fujitsu Ltd.  (Japan'slargest computer maker), Korean conglomerate Hyundai Ltd., silicon makerSiltec Corp.  and Tokyo-based Komatsu Electronic Metals.  In addition, majorconstruction projects by Intel Corp., Integrated Device Technology, Inc.  andWacker-Siltronic Corp.  are already under way.  These expansions and newplants will serve as reservoirs of strength for the state during theirconstruction and opening phases.  Total potential investment in thesefacilities exceeds $10 billion.The worldwide microelectronics boom, the availability of water and low-costhydroelectric and combustion gas power, a skilled and educated work force andtax breaks under Oregon's Strategic Investments Program all played roles inthis high-tech surge.  Designed to attract major corporations, the SIP-inwhich each county has the option of participating-caps property taxassessments at $100 million for up to 15 years.  Intel, LSI and IDT all tookadvantage of this program.The strong economy boosted income tax revenues (the state has no sales tax),and the state's gambling operations have been very successful, fattening statecoffers.  Thus, the major fiscal stress that some observers expected as aresult of state property tax cuts has been largely absent.Much, but not all, of the new corporate investment is in the Portlandmetropolitan area.  Employment gains in the past two years were widespread;all the metropolitan areas (Portland, Salem, Eugene-Springfield and Medford)added jobs either at or above the state average.Still, Oregon is seeing non-metropolitan growth that has made the first halfof the 1990s look like a replay of the 1970s, when rural areas generallymatched or even outpaced metro areas in population growth.  (For an example ofone fast-growing nonmetropolitan area, see the sidebar above.)Oregon labor markets tightened throughout last year, raising increasingconcerns among employers about the labor supply and putting pressure on wages,particularly in construction.  Net in-migration continued its strong pace.  In1995, the state's population grew an estimated 50,000; of that, 35,000 peoplemoved to Oregon from somewhere else, many from California.  Housing priceincreases began to raise questions about affordability, particularly in thePortland metropolitan area, where the median price of a home rose 12.5% injust the first three quarters of 1995, reaching $131,500, according to theNational Association of Realtors.Going into 1996, conditions in Oregon are ripe for increased pressure on wagerates and higher labor force participation rates.  Employment is anticipatedto grow at about 2.5% to 3%, with a personal income increase near 6%, thisyear.  This forecast is a bit lower than 1995's growth, which, when theyear-end figures are in, should reach about 4% for employment and 7% forpersonal income.Oregon's high-tech sector will continue to expand, given the backlog ofprojects either announced or already under way.  Construction will remainstrong, with major industrial projects, a light rail expansion and continuedpopulation growth.  The only dim note comes from the forest products sector,which is continuing to decline due in part to harvest constraints, althoughthere have been some gains in secondary processing.The rapid growth in recent years has focused concern in the state on issuessuch as growth management, whereas less than 10 years ago encouraging growthwas the mantra.  The state's land use planning process is being tested in someareas by the extended period of expansion.  Concerns about rapid growthcontributed to one county's decision not to extend the SIP incentives to alarge company last year, losing it to Arizona.  The growth problems are notlikely to dissipate soon.Washington at the CrossroadsWashington State offers more of a mixed message.The pace of growth in Washington has been slower than in Oregon throughout the1990s.  The biggest reason:  the contraction at Boeing, which now has about70,000 employees in the state, down from nearly 107,000 in 1990.  Layoffs atboth Boeing and the Hanford Reservation, a former nuclear materials productionfacility, had a constraining effect on the state economy, which in otherrespects was doing very well.  Statewide total nonagricultural employmentincreased by 2.5% in 1994, and as of September 1995, year-over-year job growthhad slowed slightly to 2.1%.Many observers had expected the economic braking effect of Boeing's work forcereduction to end early in 1995, but the company decided to reduce its workforce by another 12,000 during the year.  In 1996, Boeing will be anessentially neutral force, with no additional work force reductions expected,but no major hiring.  The November announcement of a multi-billion dollar saleof aircraft to Singapore signals an improving outlook for Boeing, but this isnot likely to translate into job gains for some time.On the other side of the state, the major contractors on the HanfordReservation also announced plans to reduce their work force by 4,800 during1995 due to a slowed pace for the radioactive waste cleanup program.  Furtherjob reductions at Hanford are certainly possible in 1996.Despite these temporary and permanent reductions in payrolls, the statecontinued to grow in terms of total employment and personal income.  Theacceptance of early retirement offers by many Boeing and Hanford workerscontributed to the dampened effect of the work force reductions, but the realstory was strength elsewhere in the economy.High technology was the primary growth force in Washington in 1995.  Softwareemployment expanded rapidly, led by Microsoft but accompanied by expansions ofseveral hundred other firms and a flood of small startups.  Biotech continuedto expand slowly, and medical electronics firms have also been doing well.Late in 1995, thanks mainly to some key changes in Washington's tax code, thesemiconductor industry rediscovered the state.  In September, Intel announcedthat it had chosen Dupont, a small town located between Tacoma and Olympia, asthe site for a manufacturing/research and development facility that willemploy 6,000 people within several years.  Two other semiconductormanufacturing companies announced expansions of existing plants:  Matsushitain Puyallup and SEH America in Vancouver.  In addition, BHP Steel, anAustralian company, chose a site near Kalama for a steel rolling mill thatwill employ 230 workers.These announcements were major coups for the state's economic developmentleaders, who attributed the moves to a new sales tax credit available tomanufacturing companies that invest in plants and equipment.  Although thestate has no income tax, it has a high sales tax that-until the credit tookeffect last year-applied to manufacturing equipment, inhibiting corporateinvestment.Other indicators also showed growth.  Airport traffic was up 12% at Sea/Tac inthe first half of 1995 compared to the first half of 1994, and several newinternational routes were added.  Despite harvest constraints, the lumber andwood products industry added 700 workers, and log exports were up 15% in thefirst half of 1995.  Headhunters reported tightening labor markets,particularly in the Puget Sound area.In the early fall, the state's revenue forecasters reported higher thananticipated collections, indicating a more vigorous pace in the state economy.With problems in some sectors and considerable strength elsewhere, the statemoved ahead at about the rate of the national expansion.Still, worries remain about the sustainability of current employment levels inthe wood products industry, with the federal forests essentially closed andother stumpage sources unable to increase harvests.  Ultimately, a modestresumption of production from Forest Service lands and perhaps imports fromRussia and Pacific Rim sources may help boost supply.  Secondary wood productproducers saw some drops in exports and total production in 1994 due toweakness in both the U.S.  and foreign economies, but expect to show astronger performance by the end of 1995 and into 1996.Structural change continues in the retail sector, with national storesadvancing into regional markets.  Several local chains, such as BallardComputer and Smith's Home Furnishings, have faced restructuring andbankruptcy.Exporters of agricultural commodities, timber and manufactured goods shouldbenefit from the exchange rate that makes dollar-valued goods more attractivein Japan and Europe.  With Windows 95 finally out of the box, Microsoft andother software companies expect 1996 to be a very good year, as millions ofbusiness and personal computer owners upgrade their systems.  The expandingsemiconductor manufacturing sector will add further strength to the economy.The Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast called Washington the "most improved"state economy based on mid-year employment data.  The manufacturing andconstruction sectors lagged the nation's, but growth in the trade and servicesectors continued at faster rates.As long as the national economy continues to expand, Washington should do aswell as-and perhaps a bit better than-the U.S.  as a whole.Paul Sommers, Ph.D., is the executive director of the Northwest Policy Centerat the University of Washington in Seattle.  John W.  Mitchell, Ph.D., is asenior vice president and the chief economist of U.S.  Bank, based inPortland, Oregon.

Public opinion polls in Germany,without whose participation monetary unification would be DOA, run two-to-oneagainst giving up the Deutsche Mark.  Great Britain has already opted out ofjoining.  And France has been crippled by strikes protesting the governmentspending cuts necessary for the country to qualify for entry."There's a fear, especially in wealthy countries, of redistributing wealth,"Klaus Friedrich, chief economist for Germany's Dresdner Bank, explained to agroup of financial journalists in December.  "People think Portugal and Greeceare coming in and will destabilize the currency.  They're not, because they'revery unlikely to meet the criteria for convergence in time.  People just don'tknow enough about it."The lack of popular support for the Euro doesn't discourage continentalpolicymakers, bureaucrats and bankers.  So far, the EU has kept very close toits timetable.  And public opinion is malleable, especially since citizenswon't have to give up their francs and marks for another six years.  Notwasting any time, the EU has already launched a Europewide public relationscampaign to promote the Euro.The real obstacle to the common currency may be the economic criteria forjoining.  By the end of 1997, each member nation must have an inflation rateof about 3%, interest rates below about 10.5%, and a stable currency.  Many,if not most, countries will have little difficulty reaching those goals.  Butit will be harder to clear the remaining hurdles:  a government budget defecitof less than 3% of the nation's gross domestic product and total public debtof less than 60% of GDP.The point is to assure stability.  "That will be taken care of by being a cluball of whose members are equally rich," Friedrich says.  In a recent report,he gives the best odds to a union of eight European countries-Germany, France,the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria and Ireland-althoughothers may join later.What if the EU fails to sway public opinion in favor of adopting the Euro?Many observers believe that would spell the end of the "European agenda," thefull financial integration of most of Western Europe.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Index of Tardy Economic IndicatorsPity the Conference Board.  No sooner had the nonprofit business-researchorganization won approval to take over production of the U.S.  CommerceDepartment's Business Cycle Indicators program, which includes the widelyfollowed Index of Leading Economic Indicators, than the federal governmentshut down-not once, but twice.  Although the Conference Board now calculatesand disseminates the leading, coincident and lagging indicators indices, theraw economic data that comprise them still come from the feds."It's ironic," says Michael Boldin, the Conference Board senior economist incharge of the program.  "They properly decided to privatize in order toconcentrate on what they do well, and now they're not even able to work onthat."At the end of December, just a day before the leading economic indicatorsindex for November was to be released, the Conference Board still hadn't seenthe data for four of its 11 components.  The report on new factory orders anddurable goods shipments was stuck in limbo and likely to delay production ofthe index even longer.  Those figures hold considerable weight in the index,on which many analysts rely to gauge of where the economy is heading in thenext three to six months.Boldin points out that, in addition to the new orders data, economists aremost worried about whether the Commerce Department will be able to gather andrelease labor force figures.  They are also impatiently awaiting disclosure ofthe full methodology and details of the new chain-weighted method forcalculating gross domestic product, so they can revise their econometricmodels.  "I don't think anyone knows how to live in a world without thesethings," he says.For now, the Conference Board will continue to use the same calculations asthe government.  But it has assembled an advisory board to recommendrevisions.  "We will also be soliciting ideas and suggestions," Boldin says."I would like to make the index as simple and transparent in its calculationsas possible, so that economists can make better use of it."Starting in February, the organization will also assume responsibility forpublishing Commerce's Survey of Current Business, likely to be renamed theBusiness Cycle Indicator Report.  It will include all of the data included inthe indices, plus explanations of any new additions or other issues in whichreaders may be interested.That is, if it can get the government-supplied data it needs to fill the firstissue.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Growing GranniesEvery nine-year-old knows that grandparents are supposed to spoil kids rotten.But no one ever put a number on it until now.According to a recent study by Packaged Facts, a New York City-based researchfirm, annual spending by grandparents will rise to $25.6 billion by the year2000, up from an estimated $19.9 billion in 1995.  The company used reportsfrom other market research companies, including Roper Starch Worldwide, inpreparing its 100-page, $1,850 report, titled "Marketing to Grandparents."It projects the number of grandparents will swell to 62.8 million in 2000 from57.1 million today, rising at a rate of 95,000 a month.  About 67% of allAmericans age 45 and older have grandchildren.The report states that most "mature" Americans feel 10 to 15 years youngerthan their actual age, but that many marketers persist in portraying them as10 to 15 years older.  "In the past, grandparents have been stereotyped asfrail and feeble, but because of lifestyle trends, grandparents are perceivingthemselves as younger and having a more active lifestyle," says David Lummis,project manager for the marketing report.  "I think the portrayals we see inadvertising are getting younger.  And the range of products and services aimedat grandparents is widening."One of the fastest-growing areas is travel, with such companies as Club Med,Hilton and Westin Hotels pitching packages to active grandparents who take thekids along.  He expects that over the next several years, travel will commanda greater share of grandparents' spending at the expense of such traditionalcategories as toys and food.Noting that three of the four major television networks (counting Fox) stilldevote themselves to courting younger viewers, Mr.  Lummis thinks that asadvertisers and programmers recognize the growth and spending power of theolder population, the inequality will begin to dissipate.  "Money talks, andonce advertisers realize they can make money talking to an older audience,they'll pursue them," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Hispanic ZIP Code UpdateHispanic market research firm Geoscape International, of Boca Raton, Florida,just released Base Hispanic U.S.A., a new database tool for penetrating theburgeoning Spanish-speaking consumer market.  Available in diskette, CD-ROMand printed formats, it updates the 1990 census block-area data, providing acurrent look at the country's commercial and residential Hispanicneighborhoods by ZIP code.It provides country of origin, age, sex, income and educational attainmentinformation.  Besides 1995 demographics, it forecasts population for the year2000."The 1990 census data is now six years old," says Geoscape president CesarMelgoza.  "Six years is a long time in the Hispanic community.  As a group,Hispanics move more often than the rest of the population and have a greatdeal of mobility within cities.  This is because many Hispanics are immigrantsand are unlikely to own their own homes.  They tend to rent, and renters movemore often than owners."The database contains direct marketing tools-including current nationwidelists of 7.7 million consumers and 4.5 million households-for businesses thatwish to tap the U.S.  Hispanic market through the mail.  It also providesnames and addresses of grocery stores, shopping centers and other businessesthat cater to this segment.Geoscape also breaks the market into media regions for radio, television orprint advertising.  According to Melgoza, 70% of Hispanics listen toSpanish-language radio, and television broadcasting in Spanish, includingcable programming, is growing fast.Geoscape is aiming the product at both U.S.  and Latin American companies."Because of the devaluation of the peso, Mexican companies in particular areconcentrating on exporting goods now," Melgoza says.  "The cheapest thing forthem to do is to find Mexican immigrants in the U.S.  because these consumersalready are familiar with Mexican goods."Pointing out that the the Hispanic market is made up of myriad subsegments ofpeople from divergent backgrounds and countries, Melgoza adds, "Thetraditional way of looking at these markets at a gross level is problematic.Marketers today must take into consideration the trading area for theirproduct or service and then look at candidate areas where the conditionexists.  Under that scenario, there will be many additional 'micro markets.'"A version for Atlas GIS for Windows encompassing the full U.S.  Hispanicmarket is available for $9,995.  Pieces of the database may be purchased forsmaller sums.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996King of the Conceptual RoadWhen is a truck not a truck?  When it's still a concept.Once you see it, it's hard to forget Volvo's new Environmental Concept Truck,a pale blue one-of-a-kind vehicle with a bubble-shaped, traffic-stoppingdesign.  Its round-cornered contours are so striking that the ECT, as Volvoexecutives like to call it, could have been built solely for visual effect.However, the vehicle's primary purpose is to stimulate research on how tobuild safe, low-environmental-impact delivery trucks for city streets.  Thetruck is the end-product of an 18-month research project at Volvo's Goteburg,Sweden, headquarters.  It was created not for sale, but as a laboratoryexperiment in no-emission technology."ECT is not a commercial venture," says Karl-Erling Trogen, president of VolvoTruck Corp.  Instead, he says, the vehicle "demonstrates solutions that cancreate a new foundation for the development of tomorrow's trucks andtransportation infrastructure."At this stage, though, the ECT has significant unsolved structural problemsand is not yet ready for the world's highways.  For instance, its ethanolfueled and two-ton electric battery-powered engine may be ecologicallycorrect, but the battery runs down every 15 to 25 miles.  Volvo engineers arehunting for ways to enable the batteries to function for longer stretches.Volvo unveiled the ECT in Goteburg in September to members of the truckingpress.  In November the vehicle arrived in the U.S.  and was displayed tojournalists, fleet owners and lawmakers in three cities.  "We wanted buyers oftrucks and legislators to start looking at how trucks could be designeddifferently in the future to meet new emissions laws," explains Phil Ramba, asenior public relations specialist at Volvo-GM Heavy Truck Corp.  inGreensboro, North Carolina.In the U.S.  there is a movement toward tougher auto emissions regulations.The ECT was designed in part to capitalize on the trend, which Volvo'sforecasters expect to spread throughout the world.  In California a new lawmandates that after 1998 at least 2% of vehicles sold in the state mustfeature zero-emission technology.  On the East Coast, the Ozone TransportRegion, which consists of 13 states from Virginia to Maine, recentlypetitioned the federal Environmental Protection Agency for stricter emissionstandards for cars and trucks weighing up to 8,500 pounds.Volvo designed the ECT to emit little pollution when running on ethanol and tomeet urban zero-emission standards when running on the battery alone.  Whilethe market for delivery trucks that require a battery charge every 15 miles ispretty slim, Volvo executives expect to incorporate pieces of the ECT intofuture designs.Carol Birkland, a senior technology editor at the trucking magazine FleetEquipment, inspected the ECT at the Goteburg debut.  She gives high marks toits safety and visibility features, which include huge, round front windowsand a very low height of nine feet.  "The wrap-around windshields give thedriver incredible visibility," she says.In place of rear mirrors, the truck has remote video cameras installed in theback.  The driver monitors the view from the cameras on a screen.  The lowheight and round edges of the vehicle promote safety by minimizing collisiondamage.The ECT's most impressive feature is probably its unique steering system.  Thetruck's front and rear wheels can turn in opposing directions, giving itunusually good maneuverability-but only at speeds under 20 miles per hour,when the feature is most useful.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996New Databases to Map on ExcelAiming at small businesses, Claritas Inc.  has released seven inexpensivedatabases for use with Microsoft Excel's new DataMap feature.

Chairman Louis V.  Gerstner, Jr.  talked about someintriguing technologies:  microprocessors with several billion or trilliontransistors, intelligent agents and transponders the size of postage stampsthat can be attached to just about anything.He noted that all these inventions are part of a project on "things thatthink" underway at the MIT Media Lab.  The aim of the project is to installartificial intelligence into everyday inanimate objects, such as door knobs,furniture, glasses and shoes."A computer in a shoe?," he asked the crowd."Actually, it's not such a crazy idea," he continued.  "As I understand it,you power the computer with every step you take, and when you shake hands withsomeone who's also wearing a shoe computer, you establish a low-voltageelectrical connection and instantly exchange information through thehandshake-sort of a 'personal area network.'""What happens is you download to your shoe the person's title, what he does,where he works, phone and fax numbers-maybe a digital photo or a video clip.""If you think that's nutty, think about it tonight before you hit the sack.Try to remember the names and faces and affiliations of all the people youmeet today.  Empty your pockets of all the business cards you've collected.Then look at your shoes.  Not such a wacky thought, after all.""So," he concluded, "in terms of raw technology, our industry's future isextraordinary.

A premature leak of the agency's numbers might allowa smart speculator to corner the market on, say, sugar beets.  Multinationalagribusiness corporations, commodity trading firms, farmers' cooperatives andacademics all engage continuously in their own analyses of crop and livestockmarkets.But none can match the resources of the vaunted USDA, which employs 1,000full-time and 2,000 part-time staffers to visit farms and inspect ripeningcrops each month to gauge the health of the agricultural economy.  In theweeks before the November report was issued, the agency interviewed some19,000 farmers and conducted tests of 2,000 corn fields and another 1,500cotton fields.The tests are only a part of the process.  The USDA has a vast array ofsatellite photographs-so detailed that they can distinguish one farm from thenext-to help judge the volume of planted acreage.  Increasingly sophisticatedcomputer models crunch the numbers, as well as weather predictions from theNational Weather Service, to yield an impressively wrought report that tracksin excruciating detail everything from the Texas grapefruit and Florida orangecrops to peanuts grown in Georgia and rice in Louisiana.  The department alsohas information officers in every overseas embassy collecting estimates offoreign production, critical data in forecasting import and export patternsand price movements.Given that sales of crops and livestock in the United States amounted to $188billion in 1993 (the latest complete figures available), with farm assetsnearing $900 billion, the stakes are high.  According to the American FarmBureau, 3.5 million people work on farms in the U.S., about 2% of the adultpopulation.  The trade group estimates that through its ripple effect on suchbusinesses as supermarkets, restaurants, equipment manufacturers and financialservices firms, agriculture affects roughly 20% of the nation's generaleconomy.Still, the USDA's forecasting capabilities are necessarily limited.Predicting crop production is a maddening exercise, given to constant shiftsand revisions as weather patterns evolve, insects eat away at otherwisehealthy fields and orders for exports suddenly evaporate when a bumper harvestmaterializes on some foreign shore.  An economist tracking employment, factoryutilization and consumer confidence can forecast a coming recession with someassurance.  But farm forecasting is a tenuous process, subject toserendipitous change with every passing storm cloud."It's a very difficult business," concedes Frederick Vogel, director of theestimates division of NASS.  "Agriculture is seasonal; you only grow it once,with no second chances to start over.  It's not like a factory assembly linewhere you can slow down production for a time and then make it up later onwith overtime.  The weather can cause huge swings in production-from a bigcrop to a major failure-in a very short period of time."Adds Gary Benjamin, a vice president and economic advisor who specializes inagriculture with the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago, "Computers have given usbetter modeling and analytical capabilities.  But it seems that many of thebig surprises in the farm sector, particularly weather and export demand, arehard to anticipate.  I'm not sure we're forecasting agriculture any bettertoday than we did years ago, although I'd like to think we are."Counting CornThe 1995 season was one of the toughest for forecasters to gauge in years.Heavy spring rains across the cornbelt forced many farmers to plant theircrops very late, well into June.  Then came one of the hottest summers onrecord, an infestation of the corn borer pest along a wide swath of theMidwest and an unprecedented early frost in late September.  In June the USDAwas cautiously predicting that the U.S.  would harvest 7.8 billion bushels ofcorn and 2.24 billion bushels of soybeans, but by November the estimates hadfallen to 7.37 billion bushels of corn and 2.18 billion bushels of soybeans.The corn estimate was 27% below the record harvest of 10.1 billion bushels in1994.  (Last year's actual harvest figures will be released early this year.)The inhospitable growing conditions and unexpected import orders from Chinaset off a storm in futures trading.  By November corn was priced above $3.30 abushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, up 20% since mid-August, and it neared$3.60 just before Christmas.  Overall, prices were the highest since thedrought year of 1988.The experts breathlessly track these shifts day-by-day, with speculatorsmaking their fortunes by anticipating correctly the next announcement, eitherfrom the USDA, the government of China or the National Weather Service.Farmers who don't want to wait for the once-a-month USDA estimates subscribeto an array of newsletters that put their own spin on interim conditions.Then, too, they're talking to university extension services, grain elevatormanagers and neighbors down at the feed store or the local cafe.For them, the forecasts are crucial:  the farmer who sells his corn crop earlyin the harvest at, say, $3 a bushel could be missing out on a price of $3.50or $3.75 if he gambles and stores it until the market improves.  Thousands ofdollars in income is at stake.  Multiply that by thousands of farmers and thestakes rise exponentially.Crop forecasting is an art as well as a science.  Dan Basse, market researchdirector of the Chicago-based forecasting firm AgResource Corp., also owns a600-acre farm in Wisconsin.  "Forecasting requires a lot of judgment.  Youalmost have to have grown up in the fields and know all the things that canaffect crops-from insects to the Russians buying on international markets-tobe able to make good decisions," Basse says."The average farmer's psyche is difficult to understand.  What price does hewant for his sow?  Will he sell it this year for slaughter or keep it forbreeding next year?  These are not easy questions to resolve."The government tries to orchestrate crop production and inventories with itsset-aside and other subsidy programs, but most observers believe that suchgovernment supports will be curtailed in the face of the budgetary cutbackmood in Congress.  In the aftermath of huge harvests last year, the USDAoffered to pay farmers this year to set aside 10% of their croplands in thecorn belt.  But in the wake of the poor harvest this year, the U.S.  will havethe thinnest so-called carryover stocks of corn and soybeans in more than twodecades."The set-aside is not an effective tool anymore.  Government policies areoften wrong," argues William L.  Roberts, an independent economist whopublishes the newsletter Agri-Business Perspective from Sioux Falls, SouthDakota.  "With more free trade of grains today and the opening of EasternEuropean economies, the U.S.  can no longer dominate pricing the way it did inthe 1960s and 1970s."When the USDA surveys corn crops, it targets uniformly sized plots and thenmeasures stalks per row, ears per stalk and then kernels per ear.  Privateforecasters even go a step further and measure the depth of each kernel.Still more precision is possible on many farms now.  The latest combinesactually process wheat and soybeans as the crops are being harvested and weighthem at the same time, Then they calculate the yield per acre by employingGlobal Positioning System techniques to bounce signals off satellites anddetermine exact land mass.Computers, of course, have further enhanced the process of estimation.  RobertWisner, a grain marketing economist at Iowa State University, recalls, "When Icame here 28 years ago it would take a half day to generate a relativelysimple chart.  Today I whip the same chart out in four minutes."Wisner keeps a database of crop conditions and production stretching back fordecades, he adds, and can search out historical analogs to match nearly anyrecent set of circumstances.  Late planting with summer heat and early frost?A search by the computer will find that conditions were similar in, say, 1974,and will recall crop yields that year."Another big thing that's changed is the way information is disseminatedtoday," says William Uhrig, an agricultural economist at Purdue University."It used to be that you'd wait to get the USDA's forecasts the next day out ofthe local newspaper.  Today farmers sitting in their offices at home pull thenumbers off the computer within minutes of their release."Long-Range Weather ReportsComputers and satellites are also making weather forecasting more precise.Paul Handler, president of Atlas Forecasts Inc.  in Urbana, Illinois, studiessunspots and wind currents, among other factors, in predicting weather out sixmonths and more.  His weekly newsletter correctly predicted in July theSeptember frost that hit much of the northern corn belt."Agriculture production in many places in the world is correlated to otherplaces in the world," Handler claims.  "When India has a good monsoon season,for instance, the U.S.  usually has a dry crop year."An elite corps of agriculture economists, toiling for organizations such asthe International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C., hardlyconcern themselves with the day-to-day vagaries of weather and crop prices.They take a long view-the institute recently issued a forecast of agricultureto the year 2020 worldwide-and worry over the implications of such cosmicissues as global warming.Such forecasting may be even more difficult than predicting next month'srainfall in Iowa.  In the 1960s, for instance, many self-styled futuristspointed at rising populations and predicted the world would run short of foodby the 1990s.  The subsequent Green Revolution that boosted crop yields helpedavert that disaster; the more populous world is being fed better today thanever before.Long-range forecasting contains more enigmas than ever before.  As in anyfield, not just agriculture, the more variables come into play, the lessreliable the prediction.  Add to that unforeseen advances in technology andthe future becomes even harder to call.Genetically engineered strains of corn and soybeans in research laboratoriespromise to make crops invulnerable to insects and heat someday.  Farmers nowyielding 130 bushels of corn an acre may get 300 bushels or more in the age ofbiotechnology."Advances in genetic development might allow us to leapfrog beyond anythingwe've seen before," says Terry Francl, a senior economist with the AmericanFarm Bureau in Park Ridge, Illinois.  "But there's no way to be sure.  Youcan't predict where something like biotechnology will take you."H.

Spanning the Columbia River, the Tri-Cities-with a 1994population of 169,900-are the hub of economic activity in the southeasternpart of the state.Tri-Cities is the transportation and processing center for rich agriculturallands in both Oregon and Washington.  The Columbia River bisects the area,providing a wealth of recreational activities and supporting a shippingindustry.  Wheat and other agricultural commodities are transported downriverto the Pacific Ocean and industrial goods come upriver to markets in theinland region of Washington and nearby states.This area is home to the Hanford Reservation, a nuclear material productionfacility from World War II through the 1980s.  It now houses major researchfacilities, radioactive and hazardous waste cleanup programs and Washington'sone operating nuclear power reactor.The Hanford hazardous waste cleanup program is a 30-year, $50 billion to $70billion operation funded by the U.S.  Department of Energy and carried out bylocal contractors.  The sheer size of the program provides significantopportunities for waste technology companies.  A substantial environmentaltechnology industry has grown up in this area as a consequence.  Nearly 15,000people are employed on the Hanford Reservation by government agencies andcontractors.  Led by the three major contractors on the reservation -Westinghouse Hanford, Battelle Northwest and ICF Kaiser Hanford-many otherfirms have located nearby to supply specialized technologies, to commercializetechnologies developed on the reservation, as well as to market thesetechnologies and services to other nuclear industry sites around the world.The Tri-Cities are at the heart of a vast agricultural area that produceswheat, apples, wine and juice grapes, corn and other commodities.  Some ofthese commodities are barged down the Columbia River for offshore shipment,making the ports in these cities important points for loading barges.  Otheragricultural products, such as frozen vegetables and wine, are processedbefore shipment to markets.  Food processors located in the area include LambWeston, Simplot and Seneca Foods.  Wineries located nearby are St.  Michelleand Columbia Crest.In 1994, the trade and services sectors comprised 62% of total nonagriculturalemployment in the Tri-Cities.  The counties had a labor force of 96,700 as ofmid-1995 and an unemployment rate of 6.4%.  By the end of 1995, employment atthe Hanford Reservation had been reduced by 4,400 to about 14,660.  Many ofthe reductions came in the form of early retirement.  To the extent that theseretirees stay in the area, the economic impact of the reduction will bemitigated.  Current expectations are that the bulk of the layoffs arecomplete, but future budget years may bring additional challenges for thecleanup program, its work force and contractors.To cope with these challenges, the Tri-Cities Industrial Council, along withcity and port economic development organizations, have created a marketinggroup based on agribusiness, technology transfer and commercialization, andwestern Washington businesses looking to expand or relocate.  Because of theinvestment in office space, telecommunications infrastructure andtransportation systems to support the Hanford cleanup, the area has manyamenities to offer companies.  The agribusiness and technology efforts havebeen quite successful, with new food processing plants and several newtechnology firms announcing expansions during 1995.The cleanup program and the growing agribusiness complex created a veryhealthy real estate market in the Tri-Cities in the early 1990s.  Residentialbuilding permits soared and substantial retail development occurred with chainstores, such as Target, Eagle and Costco establishing outlets in Tri-Citiesmalls.  But with job losses in 1995 came weakness in the real estate market.The guardedly optimistic outlook for the Tri-Cities is contingent on relativestability at Hanford.  If federal budgets force further major layoffs,economic diversification efforts will face a difficult challenge, and thelocal area will face higher unemployment and reduced construction.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Rural Renewal:  Umatilla County, OregonLocated about 150 miles east of Portland, Umatilla County has much of itsnorthern border along the Columbia River and its southern border in the BlueMountains.  Transportation linkages are one of the county's major advantages.Two major interstate highways intersect there, and it is on the Union PacificRailroad's main line between the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest.The county population held essentially stable between 1980 and 1990,increasing only 0.7% over the decade.  But between the 1990 census and July 1,1994, the population increased by 8%, slightly below the state-wide gain of8.4%.  More than half the population growth was due to net in-migration overthe period as the economic fortunes of the county improved.  By 1994, countypopulation reached 64,000, with the largest communities being Pendleton(population 15,715), Hermiston (10,330), Milton-Freewater (5,865) and Umatilla(3,115).Umatilla County has what for Oregon is a unique mix of employers that includesan army depot, a state prison, a major food processing/agricultural complexand forest products firms.  The county ranked third in the state in sales fromfarms and ranches in 1994 at $212.2 million, primarily from grain, potatoes,peas, beans and cattle.  Food processing makes up the largest piece of thecounty's manufacturing sector, accounting for 2,920 of 4,940 manufacturingjobs in the county in 1994.  The forest products industry has outperformed thestate's, with employment reaching 980 in 1994.Three government installations are part of the county's employment base.Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution is a medium-security facility that had375 Corrections Department employees and housed 1,534 inmates in mid-1995.Blue Mountain Community College-offering basic skills programs, specializedtraining for employers, including an industrial maintenance program for thefood processing industry, and college courses for transfer-is located inPendleton, with facilities in Milton-Freewater and Hermiston.  And the20,000-acre Umatilla Army Depot, constructed in 1941, is a munitions storagefacility that straddles Umatilla and Morrow counties.During 1996, plans call for the construction of an incinerator that will beused to destroy munitions stored at the army depot.  It is expected to takethree-and-a-half years to build the incinerator, one-and-a-half years to testit, and another three and-a-half years to destroy the munitions.  The facilityis scheduled to close in 2003.The Pendleton Round Up, one of the nation's premier rodeos, draws thousands tothe county each September.  The area also offers the amenities of the ColumbiaRiver and the Blue Mountains.  In 1995, the Wildhorse Gaming Resort opened.This permanent 40,000-square-foot casino, located seven miles east ofPendleton on the Umatilla Indian Reservation, opened in March and employed 265people by mid-summer.  A 100-room motel opened in December.Employment in Umatilla County has increased each year since 1987.  Annualaverage wage and salary employment increased 17% to 23,130 in 1994 from 19,770in 1987.  The broad-based gains in the period came from expansion inmanufacturing, trade, services, government and construction.Such growth is likely to continue.  Wal-Mart has announced plans to build adistribution center in Hermiston in 1997, capitalizing on the county's easyaccess to highways for distribution.  One combustion gas turbine generatingplant is under construction and two others are being considered.Umatilla County mirrors the pattern of many nonmetropolitan countiesnationwide, with flat (or declining) activity during the 1980s changing tostronger population and employment growth during the 1990s.  And the impetusbehind that growth is hardly unique to Umatilla.  Food processing has expandedwith export opportunities and increased demands for convenience.  The prisonrepresents stable employment in a growth industry and the Indian gamingfacility is another growth activity that is changing parts of rural America.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Growing and Declining IndustriesBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predictions of employment growth by industryfollow a pattern of more jobs in services and fewer in manufacturing, themodel that has dominated the U.S.  economy since the 1970s.  The bureauforecasts that the number of U.S.  jobs will rise from 121.1 million today to147.5 million in 2005.  (Given that it also predicts a maximum of 156 millionavailable workers, this could mean that there won't be employment for as manyas 8.5 million unsuccessful seekers, or an unemployment rate of about 6%.)  Afull 25.1 million of the 26.4 million new positions that will be createdbetween now and 2005 will be nonfarm salaried jobs, the agency says.The service-producing sector-which is wide enough to include such diverselines of work as engineer, lawyer, real estate agent, shoe clerk, teacher,software writer, mechanic, fast food seller, clerical aide and maitre d'-willaccount for 24 million of the new jobs.  Within this broadly-defined category,7.1 million of the new jobs will be added in health services or businessservices, 4.4 million in retail trade, 3.4 million in government, and 1.4million in finance, insurance and real estate.BLS says the service-producing sector's share of nonfarm jobs rose from 70.4%in 1979 to 78.6% in 1992.  In 2005, the bureau predicts, services will accountfor an overwhelming 82% of all U.S.  unemployment outside farming.Turning to the goods-producing sector, the agency projects that almost all thejob gains-1.2 million new positions-will be in construction.  Manufacturingoverall should shed more than half a million wage and salary jobs, fallingfrom the 1992 level of 18 million to the projected 2005 total of 17.5 million.In specific job categories, BLS sees increases in 2005 of 138% for home healthaides, 19% for janitors, 46% for restaurant cooks, 112% for computer engineersand scientists, 48% for psychologists, 57% for legal secretaries, 54% forpreschool teachers and 70% for correction officers.On the downside, the bureau foresees reductions in 2005 of 21% for farmers;29% for sewing machine operators; 32% for household servants; 11% ofelectrical and electronic parts workers and 51% for directory assistanceoperators.The bureau's projections for 2005 also indicate a continuation of the currenttrend toward leaner corporations with fewer middle management positions.  BLSpredicts the number of executive, administrative and managerial workers willincrease 3.1 million to a 26% share of all jobs.  Although a healthy increase,this is much slower than the 50% growth experienced by executives between 1979and 1992.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996The Work Force in 2005The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that in 2005, one in every threepeople over the age of 55 will be in the job pool.  The labor segment thatwill expand most rapidly in the coming decade is workers aged 45 to 64.  Thisage bracket, which currently comprises 31% of the labor force, will make up39% 10 years from now.  The percentage of workers aged 45 to 54 will increaseto 24% from today's level of 19%, while the segment aged 55 and older willrise to 15% from 12%.The bureau also predicts that by 2005, 62% of the work force will be made upof women and racial minorities.  The agency anticipates a total labor force in2005 of 147 million to 156 million people, consisting 52.3% of men and 47.7%of women.  The current breakdown is 54.5%, men, and 45.5%, women.  The gapbetween men's and women's shares of the job market has been narrowing sincethe 1950s, and the 2005 projection represents the most equal distribution ofthe work force by sex in history.In specific projections, BLS forecasts the proportion of whites in the jobpool will shrink from the current 78% to 73% in 2005.  About two-thirds of newentrants to the labor market over the next decade-or 33.4 million people-willbe whites, while about 22.4 million whites will exit the job force, leaving109.7 million whites in the job force.  While they will retain a clearmajority, their rate of expansion will be well beneath those of other races.As the percentage of white workers falls, Hispanics and Asians will enjoy veryhigh percentage increases of labor force entrants.  Hispanics, who today makeup 8% of the pool, will see their representation climb to 11% in 2005.Currently, there are 10.1 million Hispanics in the labor pool.  During thenext 10 years, 7.8 million more will enter and only 1.4 million will exit.These changes will boost the total of Hispanic workers in 2005 to 16.5million.Asians, who now comprise the smallest group, with just 4.3 million workers,will experience the largest gains of any racial group over the course of thenext 10 years.  Their ranks will increase by 81%, as 3.9 million join thelabor market.  Only about 746,000 Asian-American workers are expected to dieor retire during this time, so about 7.5 million will be eligible to work in2005.  This will leave them with a 5% share of the total market.On the other hand, African-Americans will not experience a significantshrinkage or increase during this period.  Currently, they are the secondlargest work force segment, with 13.6 million workers, or a 10.8% share.  BLSpredicts the addition of 6 million new black workers and the exit of 3.1million.  These changes will raise the percentage of blacks in 2005 marginallyto 11%, giving them the same share as Hispanics.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996BOOKS ETC.:  Marketing Goes Beyond Fun And GamesThe Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management & MarketingStedman Graham, Joe Jeff Goldblatt and Lisa DelpyIrwin Professional PublishingBurr Ridge, Illinois, $30.00Sports Marketing:  It's Not Just a Game AnymorePhil SchaafPrometheus BooksAmherst, New York, $25.95These two new books by marketing experts shriek out an undeniable truth:there's money, money and more money to be made in sports marketing, and eachyear the proceeds get heftier.Both books back up that central thesis with a plethora of anecdotesdistributed throughout the manuscripts.  In 1992, the Fox Network paid theunprecedented sum of $1.58 billion to the National Football League for anexclusive four-year broadcast arrangement.  The cost of a 30-second Superbowlcommercial rose from $850,000 in 1993, to $900,000 in 1994, to $1 million in1995.  In return for wearing its shoes at the Summer Olympics, the Germansportswear giant Adidas gave free samples to athletes in 1972, but bestowed upto $10,000 per participant for the same favor in 1976.  The list goes on andon and on.But while both works begin with the same set of inarguable facts, they proceedin different directions.The Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management and Marketing is essentially ahow-to manual for people interested in entering the field, a textbook thatspells out how to rake in some of the lovely lucre.  It is pitched tomarketing professionals, as well as to college business professors who canincorporate it into courses.In fact, although one of its co-authors, Stedman Graham, is a professionalsports marketer, the other two co-authors, Joe Jeff Goldblatt and Lisa Delpy,teach sports and event marketing at George Washington University.  Some of thematerial has been pulled from their course work.Sports Marketing:  It's Not Just a Game Anymore, by Phil Schaaf, is lively andfull of interesting details, but it has a less consistent focus.  Schaaf doesa thorough job of documenting such modern phenomena as battles between citiesto sponsor ball teams and the debate central to the 1994 baseball strike overwhether players' salaries should be pegged to owners' profits.At times, Schaaf turns into a social critic and ruminates on whether allowingfinances to dominate the sports world is destructive to our society.  Yet atother points, he writes as if his primary concern is advising Fortune 500companies on how to get the most out of their sports advertising budgets,weighing such issues as whether celebrity endorsements or stadium advertisingbillboards offer the better deal.Sports Marketing 101The book by Graham, Goldblatt and Delpy is less intent on being all things toall readers.At the beginning of one chapter it quotes the legendary sportswriter RedSmith's succinct observation about the eternal primacy of athletics in humanlife:  "The Coliseum is the oldest building in Rome."  The Ultimate Guideoperates on the assumption that sports have always held a strong fascinationfor people and that each society will find its own way to capitalize on thatfact.Because it can be used as a college text, the Ultimate Guide is laid outsystematically and is full of pragmatic advice.  Each chapter covers an issueof concern to budding sports marketers, such as strategies for managing eventlogistics, techniques for reviewing contracts with sponsors and suppliers, andadvice for working with celebrity athletes.  The chapters all bear utilitariantitles like "Emerging Opportunities" and "Critical Planning to Master theGame," and they end with a series of questions designed to provoke furtherthought about the topics.The Ultimate Guide is full of helpful tips geared primarily to young adultsembarking on their career paths.  For instance, it recommends volunteering atmarathons to get a toehold in sports marketing, a break-in technique unlikelyto appeal to older aspirants or marketing professionals switching fields.It attempts to assure us that this strategy can pay ultimate dividends bypointing out that no less important a figure than Barnett Lipton-best knownfor arranging a display of 88 grand pianos during the half-time show at the1988 Superbowl-started his professional life as a humble volunteer.All this may sound a bit too didactic-to say nothing of juvenile-for readersalready established in the marketing field.  Fortunately, the book is writtenin a breezy and pleasant style, an attribute that should broaden its appealsomewhat.  Nonetheless, it is tailored to the needs of beginners, whoinevitably will make up the largest portion of its readership.A Fan's NotesOn the other hand, Schaaf, the director of San Francisco consulting firmPacific Sports Marketing, has written a book with something for everybody:marketers, athletes, labor negotiators, business analysts, fans and evenculture critics.  He does best, however, when he sticks to analyzing theintersection of sports events and product positioning.Consider the creative marketing campaigns for the PowerBar, which in Schaaf'sestimation amounts to a modern Mom-and-Pop success story.  Thecarbohydrate-rich snack, capable of providing vast surges of energy to fuelathletic feats, was concocted by former marathon running star Brian Maxwelland his wife Jennifer in their own kitchen.  Initially, the Maxwells promotedthe PowerBar by handing out samples at local sporting events.Over time this simple, cheap, no-tech method grew into sponsorshiparrangements with more than 4,000 sporting events, ranging from the big bucksNCAA college basketball playoffs to small-town charity auto racing events.The company, PowerFoods of Berkeley, California, even went on to devise itsown sporting events, such as the PowerBar Women's Challenge, an annualbicycling race in Idaho.The PowerBar case illustrates that cleverness and persistence can overcome theobstacle of under-capitalization.  This is the sort of moral that appeals toSchaaf, who never quite seems to make his peace with the money-drenched worldof modern sports.However, when Schaaf cares to, he can do a fine job of analyzing why sportingevents and big business are such a compelling match.For instance, he cites the sponsorship of the Arizona Fall Baseball League bySafeway Stores in 1994, and the role that basketball superstar Michael Jordanplayed in that alliance.  By selling game tickets in its supermarkets, Safewaywas able to lure new customers into its stores and increase sales in its coregrocery business.  At the same time, Schaaf tells us, the company increasedits visibility greatly by associating its name with Jordan's much-publicizedcrossover into baseball.Schaaf explains over and over again that the real value of sponsorships tocompanies is that associations with athletes and teams bring them closer tothe customers they covet.  It's no more complicated than that.  Being asuccessful sports marketer is just a question of finding ways to turn athleticaudiences into consumers of goods.  The challenges lie in creating newpromotional formats and in matching particular products to specific events.The author also excels at dissecting other oddities of the sports world, suchas the franchise system of team management and ownership.  In a chapter aboutlicensing sports merchandise, he quotes from an October 31, 1994 SportsIllustrated article:Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones has been complaining about NFL rules thatlimit each franchise to a 1/28th share of league licensing deals.  As Jonespointed out to the Washington Post last week, merchandise bearing the Cowboylogo generated 28 percent of all NFL Properties revenue in 1993.  Still, don'thold your breath waiting for the league's other twenty-seven owners to offerJones-or anyone else-a bigger slice of the pie.  Cleveland Browns owner ArtModell put it this way:  'We are twenty-eight fat-cat Republicans that sitaround the league meetings and vote Socialist.'Athletics are SecondarySchaaf goes on to note that this sort of memorabilia fuels a $4 billion-a-yearindustry that in most major sports is under the tight control of teamfranchise owners.  The owners' right to enter sponsorship arrangements withcorporations enhances the value of team ownership well beyond ticket sales andbroadcasting rights, and has spawned a considerableindustry-within-an-industry.  The author contends that sometimes the actualsports contests become secondary to the needs of these adjunct businesses andfranchise owners' profits.Obviously, that's one of the aspects of the contemporary sports business thattrouble Schaaf.  In the last two chapters of his book he clarifies hisconcerns.  For one thing, he worries that amidst all the hype, deal making andprofit taking, we have fallen into an approach to sports that is ritualized tothe point of boredom.  Schaaf seems to think that big business is in danger ofsqueezing the life out of sports.He quotes Chris Friden, a young and slightly irreverent sports journalist whobroadcasts on public access channels in the Bay Area, on the frustrations heencountered in trying to interview basketball's Dream Team II in Oakland in1994:Shaq [O'Neal] and Derrick Coleman were great, but the system around theplayers was uptight.  The system, not the players, is the barrier.  The systemcreates and illustrates the image.  There can be no deviation, no frivolity.It seems so ridiculous that they have a narrow definition of professional fromthe media's standpoint.  ...  It seems that the uncreative system we have isalmost unprofessional, because it does not develop the interview.  I mean, howmany times can you ask, 'How do you feel about the win?,' and fool the sportsfans out there like there's any emotion.In his final chapter, Schaaf gets to the point.  "The main issue in sports isgreed," he writes.  "Specifically, if greed will damage both the image ofcompetition, and the competition itself.  Major League Baseball generatesalmost $2 billion annually.  The owners and players cannot agree how to divideit."How is it that a man who makes his own (presumably rather pleasant) livelihoodas a sports marketer can be annoyed with the industry's mega-profits?In the last paragraph of the book, Schaaf notes critically that,when CBS purchased the television broadcast rights from Major League Baseballfor $1.06 billion, the owners did not take the extra revenue (profit) and turnit over to the consumers (fans) in the form of reduced ticket prices,concessions, etc.  They spent it on labor, the players.  More free agentsignings, higher salaries, and higher financial risks, which increases thecosts of event production and presentation.  Fans have to accept management'sdecisions.  Fans cannot ask for binding arbitration, or a new cost settlementon professional sports spectating.At last we learn who Schaaf really is.  At heart, he's not a businessman or asocial critic.  He's a fan, one who has written an entertaining book thatmanages to explain in detail how the sports business functions, all the whilesignaling his strong distaste at the industry's excesses.Leslie Wines is Forecast's senior writer.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996CONSUMERZ 'N THE 'HOODIF ONE ACCEPTS THE ADAGE THAT YOU are what you eat, then the United States isfull of ambulatory burritos, chicken salads and hamburgers, while Japanesefactories hum thanks to industrious slices of raw tuna.That's merely a fanciful illustration of the futility of trying to judgepeople by a single trait.  Not that we don't often tryto categorize individuals, using labels to describe ethnic background,economic status and political affiliations.  But since humans are the mostcomplex critters on earth, neither skin color nor the shoes upon a man's feettruly say much about character or behavior-unless you're sizing up a guywearing Birkenstocks.However, according to the developers of "lifestyle segmentation" systems,people do reveal nearly everything about themselves in a singular way.  Forwhile you may not be what you eat, you are indeed where you live.  And even ifresidence is not quite an ultimate destiny, geodemographics-with a littlepsychographic data added for spice-still speaks volumes about consumers in thehere and now.Since they first appeared in the 1970s, these systems have promised marketersa means to find and categorize clusters of consumers.In turn, this helps businesses to predict the wants, needs and spendingbehavior of each discreet group, and find out exactly where concentrations ofindividuals live.  Based heavily on U.S.  Census Bureau information, theclusters are usually comprised of people residing in neighborhoods, includingrural, urban, suburban and an ever-growing panoply of permutations.Indeed, where segmentation was once limited to a couple of dozen clustergroupings, some of the industry's firms have created nearly 100 distinctgroups and subgroups.  Several companies give clusters straightforward names,such as "Urban Professional Couples" and "Social Security Dependents."  Stillothers have turned geodemographics into a delightful-or borderline smarmy,depending on your taste-realm by using catchy terminology.  The "YoungLiterati," for instance, is a market that's obviously as different from "NormaRae-ville" as the "Family Scramble" is from "Executive Suites."All this makes sense, in that the cost of rent or mortgage payments in anygiven 'hood is a reasonably good indicator of income and spending power.Tenements and 3,500-square-foot homes are seldom found side-by-side.  Andsince the consumers in each cluster ostensibly have similar demographiccharacteristics, on the premise that people with like socioeconomicbackgrounds tend to congregate in proximity to each other, the consumers ineach neighborhood or segment should also have similar purchasing patterns.That is, if the Jones family at 22 Maple just bought a 1996 Ford Explorer, theodds are fairly high that just two doors down at 18 Maple, the keeping-upSmiths are lusting for a new Grand Cherokee.  Or so goes the basic thrust oflifestyle clusters."Of course, there's no such thing as a totally homogenous neighborhood,"concedes Michael Pugliese, the director of Consulting Services for StrategicMapping, Inc., a Santa Clara, California-based firm that's been in thelifestyle segmentation business since 1983.  "If you look at the smallestclusters that can be produced, a mere five to 15 households in a specificarea, you're going to find consumers who don't begin to fit the profile towhich the cluster has been assigned."A "Baby Boomers with Children" suburban household might well be flanked by"Thriving Immigrants" and an "Older Settled Married Couple."  Midlifeprofessionals in their peak earning years may well live among retirees whobought their homes 30 years ago.  Aside from Stepford, few neighborhoods arefull of clones."What any and all of the segmentation systems now on the market will do,including ours, is help increase your chances of reaching the customers you'reafter," explains Mike Mancini, the vice president of Marketing andCommunications of Claritas, an Arlington, Virginia-based segmentation firmthat with its PRIZM system has been an industry leader since 1971.  "Clustershave an above-average incidence of the people they describe.  Using themsimply increases the law of averages."That margin, adds Mancini, can produce a big payoff.  "For example, if yourcompany is planning to sell an upscale product nationally through direct mail,increasing your efficiency just a couple of points can be worth millions ofdollars.  Costs are reduced if you avoid sending mail to consumers unlikely tobuy what you're selling.  Sales go up if you reach the correct target."The Bon Marche chain of 41 department stores, for instance, has usedsegmenting to cut down its direct mail costs, and in the process has learnedmore about its customers.  Nearly a dozen times each year, the stores in thechain promote an event through direct mail, sending out some 750,000 pieces.Through the PRIZM system, Bon Marche found that most of the customers duringthose sales came from three clusters.With a cluster-coded map, the chain found a core group of 250,000 shoppers whopatronized the sales and lived close enough to the stores to respond to amailing within one day.  By mailing only to its best targets, the Bon Marchesent out only 500,000 pieces per promotion, saving mailing and distributioncosts of $1.5 million annually.  It also learned that 90% of its business camefrom 60% of the chain's customers, which allows it to focus its future mediaand mailers even more tightly.Going beyond the obvious direct-mail application, the use of clustersinfluences business decisions as varied as where to locate a particular retailstore in a given town, where in the nation a company will find the largestconcentrations of customers for a product, where to make the most effectiveadvertising media purchases, and how to calibrate the creative pitch behindthe product.  Hence some of the more colorful descriptive words for eachcluster."If you know where your potential customers are and have a picture of whatthey look like," says Pugliese, "segmentation can be of use for both strategicand tactical marketing."But while lifestyle segmentation has gained increasing recognition as apowerful marketing tool, it generates revenues of only about $100 million peryear for the industry's major players.  (Besides Claritas and StrategicMapping, the list of major players includes Equifax National Decision Systems,based in San Diego, and CACI Marketing Systems in Arlington, Virginia.  Othercompanies focus more narrowly on specific industries.)As these firms create ever-smaller clusters-where a couple dozen were a oncecommon breakdown, some companies now divide the U.S.  population into nearly100 distinct types-these systems gain some strengths, yet take on certainweaknesses.Using more segments allows businesses to target their markets more precisely.But the smaller the number of households in a sample, the less reliable theresults.  And working with scores of categories can get unmanageable, leadingsome companies to cluster their clusters into broader groups.Putting People in Their PlaceSegmentation has come a long way in this country since Jock Bickert, now chiefexecutive of Denver-based Looking Glass, Inc., developed his "LifestyleSelector" system and founded National Demographics & Lifestyle more than twodecades ago.  "As long as humans have been interested in explaining puzzlingevents, they have turned to typologies for answers," Bickert observes.Biologists use typologies in analyzing organisms, as do mental healthprofessionals to better understand and treat the human psyche.  And whilemarketers have long searched for typologies to understand "the oftenbewildering array of consumer behavior," Bickert adds, "the quest to decodeconsumers and predict their behavior continues."In the U.S., the quest commenced after the 1970 census.  But according to LynnWombold, CACI's technical director, the ACORN clustering system-it stands forA Classification of Residential Neighborhoods-her firm produces was first puttogether in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.  Prior to the 1970 U.S.  Census,she points out, the Census Bureau's computer tapes could be best described asuser-hostile.  "Twenty years ago, segmenting neighborhoods was impossible,"she says.  "While a variety of clustering techniques were available, the datawere not."Interest in small-area statistics prompted the bureau to eventually developways break its data into "block groups," which average about 350 to 400households.  Then came the "block-level" data, which encompass about 30households.  "But with each jump to a tighter focus, the bureau suppressessome of the data out of privacy concerns," says Pugliese.  "Block-level datacan't tell you as much about the people in them as you can get with blockgroups."In the early 1980s, when the United States Postal Service introduced 9-digitZIP codes-or the ZIP+4 system-marketers believed they'd found a way to targetclusters as small as five to 15 households.  Equifax's MicroVision system, forexample, reflects the postal system's more than 23 million ZIP+4 areas.Yet since ZIP+4 is essentially just a mail delivery system, segmented databases cannot rely only on Census Bureau information to get a reasonablyaccurate read on households in this particular kind of division.  SaysWombold:  "We must also use computerized files with information about consumerpreferences and spending, credit histories, and details from purchases,affiliations, product warranty cards and other data."Even then, there are questions about whether ZIP+4 clusters are simply toosmall to have any great meaning.  "One of the weaknesses with ZIP+4 is thatthere's just too much instability, when one or two households out of 15 canskew the cluster profile," says Pugliese, who before joining Strategic Mappingworked for one of its rivals."Say you also have credit data, and it shows one household buying a new car,and another spending almost nothing.  Well, the people in the second householdmay be saving for a European vacation.  And when they do take the trip andspend the cash, it again throws things off.  I think you need 30 or morehouseholds-at least the block group-to get reliable calculations, or to seesome statistical consistency in a neighborhood."Mining the DataOf the major lifestyle segmentation firms, all but newcomer Looking Glass havebuilt their fundamental systems on Census Bureau information.  (The Denverfirm's Cohorts II system is constructed on data from nearly 40 million productwarranty card questionnaires, from stereo systems to lawnmowers to homeappliances.)What's different about each system is its other sources of consumer data.  Allhave links to syndicated consumer panels.  But some have specialty ties todatabases from various industries.For example, Equifax's MicroVision has strong links to financial servicescompanies, packaged goods and the telecommunications industry, among others.The Claritas PRIZM and Strategic Mapping ClusterPLUS 2000 systems have hadsuccess in the advertising game.  All five, however, produce useful clustersand data, says James Mendelsohn, the manager of marketing research andinformation for Perdue Farms, Inc., which uses two rival systems.  "But thesegmentation company that any marketer might want to pick really comes down toits experience in your industry and how it fits with your particularenterprise."Like the kind of poultry various people prefer to eat, choosing a particularsystem is almost more a matter of preference than of identifying any intrinsicsuperiority.  In other words, they all taste like chicken.  But just asdrumsticks have a slightly different flavor than boneless breasts, each of thebig systems has its hallmarks.With more than 3,000 clients, Claritas is well known for its PRIZM system, andfor the novel names it assigns to 62 separate clusters, ranging from "BlueBlood Estates" owned by super-rich families, to the "Hard Scrabble" clustersof older families in poor, isolated areas.  Starting with 1990 censusblock-level data, PRIZM also develops statistics for finer, ZIP+4 analysis.According to Mancini, Claritas figures that several dozen demographicvariables in six broad categories explain much about the different types ofneighborhoods.  These include social rank, encompassing income, employment andeducation; household composition, given the age, sex, and family type of theresidents; mobility, which is the time of residence; ethnicity, from race toancestry and language; urbanization, or in turn, whether it's a town, suburbor rural area; and, finally, housing, which is the physical unit and itsvalue.To pull all this together, Claritas taps more than 500 million consumerbehavior records, including car registrations, credit histories, shoppingpatterns and psychographic studies.  It also updates its system annually, frommore than 1,600 sources of federal, state and local demographic data."Things in neighborhoods change, but not as fast as you might think," saysMancini.  "The same factors usually dictate who moves into a neighborhood.  Weroutinely look at things such as building permits.  But even gentrification ofa neighborhood happens over a period of five to 10 years."Like other segmentation companies, Claritas has found more and more targetgroups developing.  In the past 10 years, it has adjusted for the surge inimmigration from Latin America and Asia, creating a cluster called "LatinoAmerica," which includes largely foreign-born Latinos in young, blue-collarurban families.  In another cluster are concentrations of older and moreaffluent Asian and Latino immigrants, called the "American Dreams" segment.Also similar to its competitors, Claritas clusters its clusters.  "You want toprovide data without it confusing marketers who don't need to know everythingabout seven different clusters," Mancini explains.  For instance, one ofPRIZM'S natural groupings, the so-called "Affluentials," includes "YoungIntellectuals, New Empty Nests, Boomers & Babies, Suburban Sprawl andBlue-Chip Blues," the latter meaning upscale blue-collar families.The system can also be retooled to identify specific targets for an individualbusiness.  When Home Pro, an 800-store national home improvement chain, founditself facing stiff competition from the likes of Home Depot and othersuperstores, the company figured it had to remodel its image and find newcustomers.Known for its "no-frills-good-value" products, Home Pro identified five targetclusters within the PRIZM roster.  Calling it "This Old House-ers," the customsuper-cluster included the "Starter Families, Boomers & Babies, Upward Boundand Suburban Sprawl," the kind of folks who spend considerable time and moneyon home improvements.  Locating these budding Tim Taylors, Mancini says,enabled Home Pro to target its advertising and creative approach.Equally as venerable as PRIZM is Equifax's MicroVision segmentation system,which got its 1971 start as National Decision Systems.  It has nine majorgroups that include 50 clusters, with labels such as "Upper Crust,""Comfortable Times," "Metro Singles" and "Trying Rural Times."  It also has 95other subsegments that go down the ZIP+4 level."Like the other systems, we start with census data," says David Tedrow,product manager for MicroVision.  "At the block level, you can figure outwhich household is making $1 million annually, the ethnicity breakdown of theneighborhood, and the number of homes with two incomes or children.  But wealso get a tremendous amount of aggregate data from our parent company."Equifax, of course, is a huge repository of credit information.  (Because ofprivacy and legal concerns, says Tedrow, Equifax does not provide itssubsidiary with house-by-house data; ZIP+4 is as detailed as it can go.)  Thecompany also has alliances with at least 10 market research companies,including Footwear Market Insights, SRI International, the Electric PowerResearch Institute and Simmons Market Research Bureau.  "The data that goesinto our model," says Tedrow, "is always fresh."And MicroVision segments can all be wrapped in with a client's own data base."By appending the MicroVision code to their data, we can help clients in avariety of ways," Tedrow explains.  "Say a company wants to find a locationfor a new outlet or branch, which is important retailers and banks.  Bylooking at the clusters and knowing the customers you're after, it can helpyou pick the right intersection for a store."Still other customers can analyze large clusters while planning productintroductions or a major expansion.  Areas around Washington, D.C., to mentionone locale, include numerous clusters of affluent consumers.  But even forcustomers who want to identify all of those clusters, segmentation reportsaren't necessarily expensive."A small entrepreneur with a file of customers can get a cluster analysis fromus for about $90 per 1,000 names," says Tedrow.  "Of, if you want to look atLos Angeles and how many households might be your potential target, the costis about $100 per market area.  If you're opening a restaurant and want anidea of what kind of people in the area like ultra-premium hamburgers or amid-priced sandwich, those clusters can be found for about $500 per product.A small business can get a lot of information for $2,500."On the flip side, he adds, corporations that intend to advertise in largenewspapers or on television might spend as much as $50,000 to $100,000 onmarket segmentation.  "Telephone companies, utilities and insurance companieshave millions of customer records.  Their marketing campaigns are simply goingto be larger and more costly."While Equifax has seen the same changes as Claritas, it also has observeddifferent users of segmentation products.  "While it used to be that retailerssuch as Mervyn's and Nordstrom looked at who was buying what, we now seesuppliers, such as Levi's, also buying cluster analysis.  The suppliers arefinding the information useful when working with the retailers; it helps themhelp the stores market a different range of products."CACI Marketing Systems has produced U.S.  population segmentation clusterssince 1977.  It also sells forecasts of economic trends up to five years aheadin neighborhoods, and 20-year forecasts for counties and states.  Its ACORNsystem breaks up the U.S.  population into 40 different segments, with namesthat are a bit more clear than cute.  "Top One Percent" is self-evident, asare "Rural Resort Dwellers," "Military Proximity" and "Prairie Farmers."Proceed with CautionCACI's Lynn Wombold is not a fan of the ZIP+4 breakdowns.  "I simply don'tlike them," she explains.  "The census block level group is the smallest areaof good data."  She also maintains that summary statistics from creditbureaus-from bank cards to home mortgages, credit lines and auto loans-must beused carefully.  "Income is often a derived variable, and the source of ageand other demographic data is unknown."In combining census and non-census data that comes from multiple sources, "theanalyst must ensure the data are compatible with each other and are measuredin ways that do not result in undue bias."  ACORN thus makes heavy use ofconsumer surveys to verify and validate what's found in its segments.  As muchor more than any other segmentation company, CACI presents itself as a firmpopulated by rigorous statisticians and analysts.  "What distinguishes us inthe market," says Wombold, "is how much imagination goes into our products,and the continuous measurements we make to be sure that the data arereliable."As for changes, Wombold echoes Mike Mancini's point that "changes don't happenovernight.  Corn fields don't instantly turn into housing developments.  Butin the last ten years," she adds, "we identified one market that is nothingbut retirement communities.  And in the future, you might see a cluster of'Downsized Middle Managers.'"Strategic Mapping bills its ClusterPLUS 2000 segmentation system as a"micro-marketing" tool.  In addition to its 60 lifestyle segments-which go bystraightforward descriptions-SMI adds the concept of "urbanicity" to itscluster segmentation.  "Urbanicity is a neighborhood geographic measurecreated by SMI to indicate a geography's proximity to an urban center, as wellas population type, housing density, type and structure characteristics," saysSMI's Michael Pugliese."The degree of urbanicity affects consumer behavior," he continues.  "Forexample, someone making $40,000 per year in a small town can have the samespending power as someone living in a major metropolitan center and earning$100,000 per year.  Meanwhile, the goods and services that each of thempurchase can be vastly different.  So segmentation that simply lumpsdemographics together without accounting for urbanicity can miss the mark."Like its competitors, SMI also uses information from consumer data bases andresearch companies, including National Family Opinion, Nielsen Media Researchand the Arbitron Company, among others.  Pugliese also explains that, "We alsohave a close relationship with Dunn & Bradstreet, which has a file ofinformation on 86 million households."When it comes to looking at clusters, most clients find six to 12 that areimportant to their business.  "At the very least, most businesses will bemarketing to at least three clusters, and usually more," says Pugliese."But what I'm seeing that's new in our marketplace is the use of segmentationfor tactical purposes almost as much as for strategic concerns.  That is, apackaged good marketer will break down its targets on a store-by-store basis.The other innovation is using segmentation for business intelligence, toanalyze what the competition is doing.  If I'm going head-to-head with anotherfirm, I want to know where our clusters overlap, and where I might be able tograb business through the use of what we call 'Atomic Clusters' andmicro-marketing."What's in a Name?Unlike other lifestyle segmentation firms, Looking Glass doesn't rely on thecensus for its segmentation.  Its Cohorts II clusters are based on 65different personal activities and interests, in addition to detailed householddemographic data.  Looking Glass considers its clusters among the mostaccurate, since the information comes from consumers themselves.  The CohortsII groupings are built on 35 million product warranty cards.  "And we includea fresh 25 million each year," says Jo Moniak, chief marketing officer forLooking Glass.Out of that data comes 27 clusters.  But what's also different about CohortsII is that each of the clusters is described with a name that suggest apersonality, not just economic status."Victoria" is not just a cluster, but a woman with a median age of 44 andmedian income of $97,650.  She's a busy executive overwhelmed by emails and ademanding travel schedule.  "Cindy & Dmitry" have a median age of 38 and anincome of $44,922.  They've got one kid, Dmitry drinks beer, and the coupleworks on home improvement projects together.  The cluster known as "Elmer" isdescribed as having "sedentary men with fixed incomes and few interests beyondtheir grandchildren and gardens."So why the names?  "When we ran a distribution list of the names on thewarranty cards, we found that men named Elmer, Adolf, Otto and Chester wereindeed sedentary men," explains Moniak.  "'Bret & Tracy' turned up as olderGeneration Xers on the rise.  'Russ' is a well-off young executive."So if residence isn't destiny, then perhaps your first name guides youreconomic fate.No matter which system a company uses, the point is the same:  to know thecustomer better.  In an era when consumers are growing ever more picky,marketers must choose their targets carefully.James Mendelsohn of the Salisbury, Maryland-based Perdue Farms, firmlybelieves that, if you'll pardon the language, clusters can sell cluckers.  "Wedon't just sell chicken, but a variety of poultry products," he says.  "Anddifferent groups of consumers have clear taste preferences, be it for wholechickens, boneless breasts or even Cornish hens.  In the pure vanilla sense,we look at clusters and their known preferences:  the Hispanic andAfrican-American populations like the dark meat in chicken, which adds flavorto many recipes.  Other groups-say where they don't do much complex homecooking-prefer boneless breasts to whole chickens."But in a more applied sense, adds Mendelsohn, Perdue looks closely at theclusters near the grocery stores that Perdue supplies.  "We sell selections ofproducts to stores, including Perdue brand and private label poultry," heexplains.  "Those assortments are different from store to store.  But when weanalyze clusters, we might see opportunities to change the assortment thatstore managers might not notice.  Cornish hens are not a high penetrationitem, but in certain upscale areas they will sell to that segment ofconsumers.  But in areas where consumers are cost-conscious, whole birds undera private label might do better.  So this enables us to help the stores.  Thething is, there's not a lot of room for mistakes in the poultry business; iteither sells or smells."For all the work done in lifestyle segmentation, no cluster has yet been foundwith a preference for bad chicken.  But even if consumers aren't what theyeat, where they live still says much about what they're inclined to think, doand purchase.Jay Stuller is Forecast's national correspondent.  His work has appeared inSmithsonian, Men's Journal and other magazines.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Editor's Note:  Happy Birthday to UsHaving created the youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s, then defined theyuppie era, the huge generation has now begun to move into-and beyond-middleage.  Every newsstand this fall trumpeted the fact that the leading edge ofthe Baby Boom is turning 50.That means that over the next 20 years we can expect to see increasing mediacoverage of the lives of older Americans, more products and services gearedtoward their needs and perhaps more three-dimensional portrayals of them inboth advertising and popular culture.As Leslie Wines points out in this issue's cover story, it also means thatbusiness must learn to cope with the realities of an aging work force.  We'relikely to see greater opportunity for skilled part-time jobs, increasedretraining for older employees and even an end to corporate staffing policiesthat encourage early retirement and favor younger workers in hiring.The graying of the labor pool isn't merely an outgrowth of the Baby Boom'sshear numbers, by the way.  Less generous pension pay outs, low savings ratesand the insecure future of the Social Security system will keep many BabyBoomers in the job market longer than their parents.  Lengthening life spansand the nation's shift to a service economy-affording more work to people withphysical limitations than strenuous manufacturing jobs do-also play a role.As the Boomers age, they will be more likely to experience mobility problems,hearing loss and sight impairment.  Yet many companies have only just begun tomake special efforts to reach and accommodate potential customers who havethese disabilities, writes Bob Cole in "Discovering the Disabled."  Given theBaby Boom's consumer activism and clout with marketers, the corporate worldshould catch on fast.Of course, predicting the future is easy.  Getting it right is another matter.This issue of Forecast inaugurates a reformulated column by Steve Schnaars onthe back page.  Called Future Imperfect, it explores historical visions of thefuture, some laughable now in hindsight, others startlingly prescient.We've also added a new column called Technical Support.  With aquestion-and-answer format, it's designed to help readers cope with marketingand mapping software headaches.  I encourage you to send us your practicalquestions.Finally (here's where we come back to the aging Baby Boomers), we've increasedthe size of our typeface just a smidgen, from 8.5 to 9 points, to make iteasier to read.  But a few of you may still need your bifocals.-Miriam LeuchterBack to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Babies for Bucks in MalaysiaIn marked contrast to nations whose leaders fear exploding populations as athreat to prosperity, Malaysia's government has introduced tax incentives toencourage greater fertility.  With a goal of full industrialization by theyear 2020, the government of this sourtheast Asian country is betting onbigger families to build a large consumer market and provide workers for aplanned heavy manufacturing sector in the coming century.Malaysia today has 19 million people.  Its population is predominantly Muslimand young; about 37% are under the age of 15.  The government, concerned abouta shortage of workers (particularly skilled ones), wants to boost thepopulation to 70 million by 2095.  In the meantime, officials encourageskilled foreign workers to take jobs there and provide inducements toMalaysians to pursue higher education.The Malaysian citizenry also is increasingly urban and Westernized, accordingto a recent issue of the newsletter Market:  Asia Pacific, published inIthaca, New York.  Supermarkets and convenience stores have made their debuts,and Western foods are popular.  The newsletter points out that Malaysiarepresents an untapped market for supermarket products that are acceptableunder halal, the Muslim standards of dietary hygiene.Whether full industrialization can be accomplished in the next 25 yearsremains to be seen.  However, there have been a number of positive economicsigns in recent years.  For instance, Malaysia's Ministry of Finance forecaststhe nation's gross national product per capita to rise to $4,335 this yearfrom $3,948 last year and $3,519 in 1994, a 12.3% increase.According to Global Trade Information Services, based in Columbia, SouthCarolina, Malaysia was the 17th largest importer of goods from the U.S.  inthe first nine months of 1995, when it bought $6.4 billion of our products, upfrom $5.1 billion and $4.3 billion in the same periods in 1994 and 1993.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996MODERN AGE HOME IMPROVEMENTHindsight may be 20/20, but foresight is far less reliable.  Some views of thefuture come through as if with telescopic vision, while others-sometimes fromthe same person-display a surprising degree of myopia.  That's because, nomatter how insightful, forecasts can't help but be shaped by the times thatproduce them.Take the Roaring Twenties, an era enchanted with all things industrial.  InAugust 1926, the prestigious magazine Nation's Business published an articleby Gerald Wendt, director of the Division of Industrial Research atPennsylvania State College, titled "The Synthetic House of Tomorrow."  Heobserved that while many industries had moved into the "iron age," housing wasstill stuck in the "stone age."Steel, which two decades earlier had begun to transform skylines by supportingskyscrapers, was rarely used in houses.  Brick, stone and wood were still moretypical.  That would change in the near future, Wendt said, forecasting theuse of steel framing and walls in residential construction.  "It is easy topredict that the next decade will see a similar complete revolution in ourhome-building," he wrote.  "Our present stone and wood construction, madeprehistoric almost overnight, will pass out swiftly as the carriage did."Flat steel roofs would allow for rooftop sun rooms.  "Modern medical researchhas demonstrated overwhelmingly the healthful action of sunlight," Wendtnoted, "and especially the extreme violet rays which our present glass windowsshut out."The inside of homes would also change radically.  Wallpaper, floors, woodworkand furniture would be made of plastics and resinoids, reducing fire hazardsand resisting stains.  Walls, draperies and just about every other interiorfeature would be easily washable with a wet sponge.  Rayon, a hot new fabric,would be found throughout the modern home.Lighting would be chemical, rather than electrical.  Walls would be paintedwith phosphorescent paints, gathering light during daylight hours and glowingbrightly during the night.  Color could be added.  Even the streets would becoated with luminescent materials, lighting the roadbed itself and thuseliminating street lamps.Overall, Wendt foresaw a fireproof, stainproof synthetic house of the futurewith a concrete foundation (he was right there), steel walls (wrong, unlessaluminum siding counts), rooftop solaria (almost anathema, given today's skincancer fears), synthetic stone floor bases (maybe, depending oninterpretation), rubber, leather or cellulose floor surfaces (not really),curtains made of rayon (not unheard of, but other fabrics are more common),and furniture of molded resinoids (wood and fabric are still more popular thanplastic).But while Wendt got many of the architectural and furnishing elements wrong,he did well when it came to electrical appliances.  He predicted that electricrefrigerators would make ice boxes obsolete and that each room in a housewould have an air conditioner.  He scored another hit by predicting that asingle thermostat would control both heating and cooling.  As the price ofpower declined, he said, housework would become easier as the motorized vacuumcleaner proliferated.Wendt did best of all, however, when it came to communications.Radios-novelty items at the time-would become commonplace.  He foresaw "thetransmissions of moving pictures on the air" and confidently predicted:  "Thenwe shall have movies in every home."  More prescient yet was his predictionthat live events would be beamed directly into homes.  Today we call ittelevision.Wendt went even further by predicting that by the end of the decade (that is,by 1930), "the next war will be seen and heard around the world at the momentit is taking place."  It took much longer than he expected, but anyone whowatched the Persian Gulf war will affirm the accuracy of that forecast.Wendt's final prediction was a real long shot.  He believed that "the house ofthe future will have a movie room, or better still, a news-room, where by theturn of a dial, we shall be able to tune in and look in on Los Angeles, Miami,London, the North Pole or the ringside.  It will be the center of the house,like the old Roman Atrium.  It will be a triumph of science."In 1926, that was only a dream.  Ultimately, of course, it became a reality.Steven P.  Schnaars is a professor of marketing and chairman of the marketingdepartment at Baruch College, City University of New York.His book Megamistakes (Free Press, 1989) evaluates the accuracy oftechnological forecasts.Back to Headline List CopyrightFORECAST via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Mapping Review:  Is Mapping Going Mainstream?Product:  DataMap:  An add-on module included with Excel 7.0 and MicrosoftOffice for Windows 95.Rating:  (Out of four stars)Features:  *Ease of Use:  ***Value:  (DataMap is essentially free.)Technical Support:  1/2Documentation:  1/2Data Included with Product:  **Overall:  H 1/2Windows Version:  Free with Microsoft Office for Windows 95 and Excel 7.0.Requires Windows 95 or Windows NT.  Memory guesstimate:  16MB to 24MB RAM(avoid using virtual memory as it's too slow when using Windows 95 with Exceland the mapping engine), at least 30MB free space on the hard disk for Excel,the mapping engine, maps and data.Pros:  A (very) basic mapping module for Excel that, at the user's discretion,can be installed or ignored during Excel installation.  It's reasonably easyto learn and use, but that's in part because it doesn't do much.  However,there are relatively inexpensive add-on packages available that substantiallyexpand the product's functionality.Cons:  Limited functionality, although sitting on top of Excel, many featuresgermane to stand-alone software can be performed or emulated.  Nearlynonexistent documentation.  No tutorial.  Questionable Microsoft commitment toDataMap success, as quoted in this review.  No one seems to know if or when aMacintosh version for Excel will become available.WHEN WE BEGAN RESEARCHING OUR BOOK Market Mapping in 1991, it was difficult toconceive of mapping technology evolving into a mainstream analysis tool.  Theproducts of the early 1990s were a either high-power, high-cost, hard-to-usetools designed for engineers and scientists or what we call "presentationmapping software."  These lesser products were capable of producing colorfulmaps but unable to import outside data or analyze problems.Commitment to the more powerful PC-based products of the era was a majorcorporate investment.  It meant a big bill for the initial purchase andmaintenance, and hopping a plane for factory training.  Once trained, usersthen hunkered down at a PC, manual in hand, and attempted to exploit theirnewly acquired expertise.  The interfaces were as daunting as a CAD program.Astronomical data prices also made the software that much harder to justify.Today, mapping is easier, less expensive, and more accessible.  Even Excel 7.0includes a simple mapping engine-DataMap-designed for Microsoft by industryleader, MapInfo.  Selecting correctly formatted data cells within Excel andclicking the "globe button" builds a simple map using basic globalcartography.It's breathtaking (well, almost) to realize that mapping technology has madethe transition from a niche technology for highly skilled analysts tosomething that anyone can run with Windows 95, Excel 7.0 and a well-endowedpersonal computer.  But it's disappointing to see what an anemic offeringDataMap really is.  It's really little more than a charting alternative to thepie charts, bar displays and grids included with previous releases of Excel.What Can You Use It For?Looking at it from the perspective of a mapping product, DataMap is a handyadd-on for some users because it's free.  With simple geocoding, existingExcel spreadsheets can be used to build maps without leaving the MicrosoftOffice environment.  The attribute and cartographic data that comes with itcan be used to explore the United States (at the state level) and foreigncountries to identify new markets for expansion.  Most users, however, willneed to study markets in more detail than it allows, so add-on packages arerequired for deeper analysis.The interface is simple enough, and there's a choice of several styles of datarepresentation, including dot density, graduated symbols, shading and piecharts.  Beyond these capabilities, few options exist; although, in fairness,the power of Excel stands behind DataMap, and some functions that might behandled in a stand-alone mapping product can be accomplished within the mightyExcel.There is some data provided with the product.  We'll save you a call totechnical support or search through Online Help and tell you to open the fileMAPSTATS.XLS to get at the included attribute data.  If your hard drive is C:,you can find it in:  C:\PROGRAM FILES\COMMON FILES\ MICROSOFT SHARED\DATAMAP\DATA\MAPSTATS.XLS.With DataMap, you receive basic demographic data for the countries of theworld.  For the United States, you also get population data by age, race andethnic group, zip centroids and a few other goodies.  Zip centroids appear inthe features dialog.  Initially we were excited that we could use such data inthis "free" product, but we found the function grayed out.  (After goingthrough a number of steps, we finally gained access to the centroids.)  Statedata and county boundaries are included, but no city-level data could belocated.Something for Nothing?DataMap is free.  So, is it true that you get what you pay for?  Well, maybe.For the cost (and problems) of upgrading to Windows 95 and purchasing orupgrading Microsoft Office, you get a bare-bones mapping package of limitedcapabilities.  Another potential problem is that Microsoft has provided almostno documentation with DataMap.  It's fortunate that the product doesn't domuch, because you'll have to figure it out for yourself.A more serious problem is Microsoft's commitment to mapping technology withinExcel.  As you can see from the following snippet of conversation with anExcel support technician, we ran head-on into this problem:Bakers:  "This product doesn't seem to do very much."Excel support technician:  "This really is a demo version of Info Map's [sic]software."Bakers:  "Can we upgrade to a full version of MapInfo?"Technician:  "No, not that I know of.  I suggest you call the Info Map [sic]people."As it turned out, the technician had very little information on the DataMapmodule, and must have lacked even basic training on this product.  Calls totwo other techs revealed a pattern:  there was little knowledge of DataMap,and both techs verified that the only supplemental documentation consisted ofan "app note" available from Microsoft (which neither could locate to send tous).  One acknowledged that the department wasn't up to speed on DataMap, "butthey hoped to be soon."  We hope this isn't a demonstration of Microsoft'sactual commitment to DataMap and mapping technology in general.Should You Upgrade to Use DataMap?The writing is on the wall:  most users, especially in corporate environments,will at some time make the transition to Windows 95 or a subsequent version ofit.  While it may not be this month, or in some operations, any time soon, itwill happen eventually.  For users of existing PCs, Windows 95 requiresexpensive RAM upgrades, plus the purchase of a Windows 95 license and anupgrade to the newest version of Microsoft Office.  This upgrade will not comecheap, not because Windows 95 or the Office upgrade are expensive, but becausethe RAM upgrade may cost anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars to as muchas $1,000, depending on how much memory is currently installed and whetherthese chips can be reused or must be replaced.  (Users of older PCs may need awhole new workstation for Windows 95, because the upgrade cost is impracticalor the machine too slow.)Most novice mappers would be better off with a program such as Scan/US ($495with an extensive collection of data), with its tight links to Excel, or theeasy-to-use EasyStreet with its new $495 price tag.The underlying question is:  should you spend the time and money to upgrade totake advantage of Excel's DataMap if you wouldn't have done it anyway to takeadvantage of Windows 95?  For now, we would have to say "no."But the news about DataMap isn't all bad.  Read on about third-party add-onsfor the product that make it almost cool.Company:  Microsoft, Inc.Address::  One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052Phone:  (206) 882-8080Fax:  (206) 936-7329Internet:  http://www.microsoft.comADD-ON BUILDING BLOCKS FOR DATAMAPDataMap may well fail to impress with its limited features, nearly nonexistentdocumentation and finite cartographic and attribute data.  But two add-onproducts for DataMap are worth your consideration.  Among a flurry ofannouncements, two software add-ons-both on CD-ROM-augment the restrictedpower of DataMap and convert it from a product barely suitable for basicdemographic studies to one of at least some power and influence.While neither product adds operational features to the DataMap software, bothcontribute a mix of attribute and cartographic data that is the basis of aneffective mapping package.  Both are priced under $100, so they're affordableadditions for most Excel users and in line cost-wise with the rest of themapping market.  (If you had to spend $400 to reach the power of a $150stand-alone product, then these additions wouldn't make sense.)Still, serious market mappers will want a full mapping package, as no numberof add-ons to DataMap will address the limited functionality of the underlyingengine.  But for novice mappers looking for something, well, almost fornothing, these packages transform something of limited capability into aworking, albeit unconvincing, mapping environment.Product:  Maps, Data, and Mapplets:  Add-on modules for DataMapFeatures:  ***Ease of Use:  ***Value:  ***Documentation:  *Technical Support:  ****Data Included with Product:  ***Overall:  ***Windows Version:  $99 for the complete set on CD-ROM.

(See the requirements for DataMap above.)Pros:  For $99, you can transform the bare bones DataMap into a useful mappingenvironment and get five useful mapping applications.  Includes two tutorialsfor DataMap, and more.Cons:  No paper-based manual.DEVELOPED BY MAPINFO, THE SAME PEOple who built DataMap for Microsoft Excel,the complete Maps, Data and Mapplets collection fills in some of the potholeson the way to successful mapping inside Excel.  First, and possibly foremost,is the incorporation of two tutorials-Mastering DataMap and Great Map!-thathelp bring users up to speed on the basic use of DataMap.  (We wonder whysomething like this wasn't included with the Microsoft release.)In addition, three small Excel/DataMap-based applications add demographicanalysis, territory management and what MapInfo calls "market performance"abilities to DataMap.  Additional data sets include the "must have" U.S.county and five-digit zip code boundaries along with additional demographicdata also by county on businesses, consumers and industry.  Demographic andattribute data include income, home values, job classifications, health careanalysis for locating and operating care facilities, retail trends and a lotmore.The most interesting Mapplet is "Marketing Savvy," in which users can "pin"their marketing activities to a map within Excel and study the results to seewhich plans work and which require retooling of some sort.  This is a toolthat makes regional analysis of sales and market penetration a snap.  Is thebillboard campaign working in the tri-state area?  How does it compare withtelemarketing efforts in the surrounding region?For $99 plus the cost of the Windows 95 upgrades described in the review ofDataMap, this is a useful and appropriately priced package.

Clumsy install procedure for thecartographic data courtesy of Excel.SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN MAPINFO'S entry, Maps, Data & Mapplets, Maps and Datafrom MaconUSA consists of a collection of maps and well, data.  But while thissounds mundane, the product adds substantial power to the otherwise anemicDataMap.  As with MapInfo's add-on Mapplets, no new functionality is appendedto the Excel mapping engine, but the presence of better cartography and aricher data set allows real mapping within Excel.We tested the product by loading zip codes for California-a two-step process.First, outside of Excel, the cartography must be selected and a multi-stepinstall procedure followed.  Then, inside Excel, the data must be selected andthe map built by clicking on Excel's new globe icon.  If more than one map canbe used with the data selected, you are given a choice of maps inside a dialogbox.Once loaded, and after a brief wait, we had a map of California zip codes, butlittle else.  Calling the company, because we couldn't find it documentedanywhere, we asked how to load a second set of data so that we could mappopulation density by zip code.  The support engineer said he would check andcall us back in five minutes.Lo and behold, the phone rang about seven minutes later.  The procedure issimple:  load the first set of data and then the second set within the samespreadsheet.  Then, in the now larger spreadsheet document, select the data touse and wait for your map to appear!The "mini-manual" contains three example applications that will get you atleast partially up to speed.  The product ran without problems.Excel users will have no difficulty relating to the Maps and Data paradigm,although due to the design of DataMap for Excel, it's a little different inoperation than standalone mapping products.

The idea hadnothing to do with business cycles or market timing.  Instead, the analyst,Christopher D.  Sullivan, pointed out that people who are deaf or hard ofhearing could have money to invest.  But many won't invest if they can'tcommunicate directly with their financial advisers; and investment firms don'ttypically market their services to this 10 million-plus sector of thepopulation.  Indeed, at the time, not one major Wall Street firm offeredspecial services to investors with hearing impairments.So Merrill introduced a Deaf/Hard of Hearing Investor Services program, withMr.  Sullivan at the helm.  That was back in 1989.Today, the company conducts investment seminars using sign language for peoplewith hearing disabilities, has five financial consultants-Merrill's term forbrokers-who are deaf andhas trained 1,200 other consultants on the use of telephone relay services,which enable them to converse with people who can't hear voices over a phone.The results?  "All told, more than 700 of our consultants have clients with aserious hearing loss.  More important, we have more than half a milliondollars in assets under management for this population group," says Mr.Sullivan, who has been deaf since the age of two.In addition, Merrill Lynch is planning a pilot program that will use Brailleand large print to communicate with people who are visually impaired.Merrill Lynch is one of a plethora of corporations to discover that cateringto the more than 40 million Americans with some disability means more thanjust doing good-it's smart business.For one thing, the size of the population considered disabled is huge, nomatter what system of measure you use.  According to projections based on aU.S.  Census Bureau household survey taken in 1991 and 1992, nearly 49 millionpeople have some kind of disability, defined very broadly to encompasseveryone from the 1.5 million people who use wheelchairs to the more than 17million people who have trouble climbing stairs without resting.  That amountsto almost one out of every five people in the United States.  "When you throwin relatives and caregivers, you're at or above 30% of the population,"asserts Cyndi Jones, publisher of Mainstream, a San Diego-based publicationthat describes itself as the "magazine of the able disabled."Of course, the numbers presented by advocates for the disabled tend to look atthe market in the broadest possible terms.  Using the Census Bureau'sdefinitions, a little fewer than half of the people with disabilities -24million-have severe impairments.According to the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, thepopulation includes an estimated 22 million people with hearing impairments, 2million of whom are deaf, 1.2 million with partial or complete paralysis, 9.2million with such developmental disabilities as cerebral palsy and mentalretardation, 120,000 who are totally blind and another 60,000 who are legallyblind.The U.S.  Census Bureau calculates that this sleeping giant of a consumermarket-even though many, if not most, of its members are underemployed orunemployed-had total annual discretionary income of $188 billion at the end of1992.Loss of vision, hearing and mobility skills commonly comes with age.  So,because of increasing life spans and the aging of the Baby Boom generation,this market will undoubtedly grow over the coming decades.Yet, while the desire and ability to spot and penetrate new markets, alongwith a sense of social responsibility, has sparked some of the businessinterest in people with disabilities, many experts in the field insist thatthe prime mover now is the Americans with Disabilities Act.The 1990 federal law attempts to bring the disabled into the economicmainstream by barring discrimination against people with physical or mentalhandicaps in either employment or the delivery of services.  Like otherminority groups that have benefited from government prodding, many people withdisabilities view the legislation as a positive step in their efforts to gainjobs and to receive the products and services that non-disabled consumers takefor granted.The law's work is far from done.  Five years after President Bush signed theADA into law, declaring, "Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally cometumbling down," the National Council on the Disabled rhetorically asked in areport to the President and Congress, "In 1995, can people with disabilitiesfinally have the same expectations as other people in their community-to live,work, travel, communicate to, and generally feel comfortable in theircommunities?"The answer is:  Not yet.Changing from the InsideStill, positive assessments of the ADA are moving many companies fromunawareness and inactivity to concern and action.The most obvious changes have come in the form of renovating business premisesto accommodate people who are blind or in wheelchairs; some of thoseadaptations began long before the ADA was signed.  All the marketing andadvertising in the world won't help if potential customers don't have accessto a company's products and services.For example, NationsBank Corp., KeyCorp and countless other depositoryinstitutions have installed automated teller machines with Braille keys andlower-set ATMs and teller windows for people in wheelchairs.  Many banks alsoteach sign language to branch personnel, install teletypwriter (TTY) machinesin branches, print checks and account statements in Braille and hire outsideconsultants to assess how user-friendly their facilities are for people withdisabilities.The travel industry, too, has begun to make changes.  In the early 1990s, forexample, Embassy Suites Hotels, Inc., focused on accessability.  Tinybathrooms, an absence of railings and narrow doorways all combined to makeaccommodations less than accommodating to guests in wheelchairs.  Managementalso worried about the responsiveness of hotel staff.So the company sought outside assistance from Opening Doors, a Woodford,Virginia-based consulting firm that helps employees become comfortablewith-and thus better at-dealing with customers and co-workers who havehearing, vision or mobility impairments.As a result of the changes it made, Embassy Suites has seen an average annualincrease of 23,000 room bookings for people with mobility impairments and $13million in gross revenues from guests who are disabled.Other efforts long predate the legislation or go far beyond the requirementsof the law.  Among the corporations getting good marks from advocacy groupsfor reaching out to and accommodating people who are disabled are MerrillLynch, AT&T Corp., General Motors Corp., McDonald's Corp., Prudential Co.  ofAmerica, Marriott Co., Toys 'R' Us, Inc.  and NationsBank.  Their activities,many of which date back a number of years, are generating follow-the-leaderresponses elsewhere in the business world.For example, besides taking an acive role in the passage of the ADA,McDonald's introduced Braille menus back in 1979.  It was one of the firstcompanies to use people who are disabled in advertisements and has sinceproduced a television commercial in sign language.  "It was the right thing todo," says spokeswoman Malesia Webb-Dunn.  "It also makes good marketing senseto have all of our customers enjoy their meals at McDonald's."Similarly, in response to questions from parents, relatives and friends ofchildren with disabilities, more than a year ago Toys 'R' Us created a productbrochure titled "Toy Guide for Differently Abled Kids."  Available from thecompany upon request, the current version describes 117 toys appropriate forchildren with a wide range of disabilities, promising to help them developauditory, language, visual, tactile, gross and fine motor, social, creativeand cognitive skills, as well as the often elusive self-esteem."This isn't a marketing vehicle; it's a response to customers who soughtadvice in purchasing toys for children with different abilities," says JeanneMcIntosh, product manager.  While the company does not track toy salesgenerated by the booklet, she adds that letters and comments by consumers whohave used it warrant its continued publication.Detroit's Big Three auto makers have also gotten into the act.  General Motorsprovides customers with up to $1,000 in reimbursement for mobility adaptationcosts and vehicle "alerting devices" for drivers with hearing losses.  Some24,000 GM customers have received reimbursements since the program startedthree years ago.  The company also provides information on area mobilityinstallers and wheelchair-compatible GM vehicles."We've always been a leader in crash protection.  This is a crash avoidanceprogram for a very important market segment," says Dean Rotondo, a spokesmanfor the company's North American operations.But even among the recognized leaders, efforts to reach out to people withdisabilities is still fairly limited.  The "differently abled" toy cataloguecan't be found at every Toys 'R' Us store, for example.  And GM is only justexploring the development of a flashing light alarm to alert hearing-impaireddrivers who are deaf if they've left the key in the ignition or if anothervehicle is honking at them.(For one consumer's frustrations with the travel industry, see the sidebar onpage 38.)This Year's ModelsSpurred by pioneers such as McDonald's, AT&T, Nordstrom, Marshall's and LeviStrauss & Co., scores of businesses are targeting ads at people withdisabilities and using them as models.  "We still have a way to go, but we'reseeing more handicapped individuals in advertisements than ever before," saysElaine Brodey, executive administrator in charge of affirmative action for theScreen Actors Guild.Advertisers are also taking steps consumers without disabilities may nevernotice.  For fees of approximately $300, the Vienna, Virginia-based NationalCaptioning Institute, Inc., that creates closed captions for televisionprograms and commercials, enabling viewers who can't hear to read the text assubtitles with the help of an electronic device attached to the TV or acomputer chip built into the set.  The not-for-profit NCI, the largest ofseveral such firms, has captioned more than 20,000 spots for more than 400advertisers since it first developed closed captioning in 1980, with usagegrowing swiftly in the past few years.  The reason:  the huge growth in theaudience using closed-caption reading devices, since Congress mandated theirplacement in all TVs with 13-inch or larger screens built after 1993.In addition, NCI's market research indicates that 66% of closed captionviewers are more likely to buy products advertised with captions.Advocacy and service groups encourage the advertising trend through adcompetitions.  For instance, the National Easter Seal Society gives out annualawards called EDIs, for "equality, dignity and independence," to mediacampaigns that further the understanding of disability issues.  Thesix-year-old program gave out more than 40 EDIs this year in categoriescovering journalism, advertising and television programming.ITT Hartford Life Insurance Companies-one of the 1995 winners, with six awardsin such categories as print advertising, broadcast journalism and televisionprogramming-aims its broadly based marketing campaign not directly at peoplewith disabilities but at corporations that buy disability insurance for theiremployees.Using sports as a unifying theme, the company created a three-pronged approachthat focuses on disabled athletes.  It encompasses advertising in trade andgeneral-interest business magazines, producing such TV programs as "TakingCharge:  Empowering People with Disabilities" on public television and "ITTHartford's Break Away," the first show devoted to athletic events for peoplewith disabilities, on the all-sports cable channel ESPN.The company also sponsors national athletic events for people withdisabilities, such as a recent ski weekend in Aspen that drew 400participants, and a wilderness adventure in Maine for its insurance claimants."Our big selling point," says spokesman Jack Hayward, "is in getting ourclients' employees back to work."As an insurance company, ITT Hartford had long been involved with this market.But as at Merrill Lynch, where Mr.  Sullivan's own experience informed thecompany's response, the impetus behind ITT Hartford's focus on empowermentcame from an employee who is an athlete with a disability himself.  That's avery typical route to change within corporations:  often the personspearheading efforts to expand products and services to the disabled market isa manager who has a disability or has a relative with one.If the Carrot Doesn't WorkMany of the business efforts on behalf of people with disabilities, however,clearly come in response to the ADA.Despite angry rhetoric from some businesses about the "prohibitive cost" ofcompliance, more than half of the accommodations for people with disabilitieshave cost between $1 and $500, according to the Job Accommodation Network ofthe President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities.  Another17% of them cost nothing.But defending a lawsuit brought under the act can be much more expensive."There still is a lot of discrimination out there," observes Scott Wolfington,associate publisher of Ability, a magazine dealing with disability issues,published in Irvine, California.  "This has to spur lawsuits."Indeed, it already has.  "We've seen an increase in the number of ADA-relatedlawsuits over the past year," says Andrea de Gorgey of the New York law firm,Hughes Hubbard & Reed.  "This trend should continue, especially since the'undue hardship' defense is being viewed with increasing skepticism."Adds Cyndi Jones of Mainstream, "The business community better wake up.  Ithad a grace period from 1990 to 1995 and many people who are disabled are atthe end of their patience.  They feel businesses that ignore their needs aresaying people with disabilities have no usefulness.  This angers activists whoview lawsuits as their only recourse."Not everyone agrees that suits play a big role in compliance, however.  In aJune 7, 1995 speech to the Association for Persons in Supported Employment,former PCEPD Chairman Justin Dart called fears of more litigation a "myth inthe media.""As of January 1, 1995," Mr.  Dart noted, "there had been roughly 600 privateand public lawsuits-affecting about one-hundredth of 1% of the entitiescovered by the law."Says John Lancaster, executive director of the PCEPD, "I really don't see achange one way or another in the number of lawsuits.  People with disabilitiesare becoming increasingly proactive, but their energies are more likely toconcentrate on lobbying, not suing, businesses."Lawsuits more often focus on employment than on accommodation.  And becausethe definition of disability keeps broadening, fights over who should becovered by the ADA break out not just between courtroom adversaries but amongdifferent factions within the disabled community, as well.Still, most observers agree, the threat of litigation remains and activistsare more than willing to raise that specter at the same time that they promotebetter routes to encouraging compliance with the ADA.Chief among the better routes is education.  "I really think 90% of theproblem is awareness and attitude," says Joel Ziev, executive director of theNew York Society for the Deaf.  "For example, the hotel industry genuinelywanted to help, but many managers simply didn't know how."  Today, he adds,the industry is definitely more disabled-friendly than it was five years ago.Lancaster cites two examples of how dialogue, rather than litigation, made forpositive before-and-after scenarios.  "A dentist in my hometown of Potsdam,New York, was moving his office from a wheelchair accessible building to arenovated private home, the entrances to which were by steps.  He was unawareof ADA requirements, but once I explained how inexpensive it would be toconstruct a ramp, he happily agreed to do so."The second situation was somewhat more confrontational.  "A new restaurant wasopening in Potsdam and the owner didn't want to spend money to make itaccessible to people with mobility impairments.  I told him I'd never dinethere and that the loss of business from me and people who shared my viewswould, in two years time, exceed the cost of the necessary repairs."The repairs began shortly thereafter.The Road AheadProgress notwithstanding, some advocates for people with disabilities say thatfragmentation within their communities is delaying the total elimination ofbarriers."There are too many examples of people with disabilities not banding together.We're almost at the point where amputees above the knee don't deal withamputees below the knee, while similar differences crop up within othergroups," says Angela Miele Melledy, publisher of Able, a monthly newspaper forthe disabled, published in Old Bethpage, New York.In addition, some people with disabilities don't want to be singled out.Mel and Enid Zuckerman, co-owners of Canyon Ranch, one of the world'stop-rated health spas, wanted to build a resort for people with disabilitiesthis year but couldn't find an enthusiastic customer base."The interest wasn't there," Mel Zuckerman says.  "Most groups don't want tobe isolated; they'd prefer to mix with others if they went to a health andfitness resort.  All we could do is design more rooms for people with mobilityproblems, and make sure we have TTYs, captioned televisions and light alarmsfor guests with hearing problems.""One solution," says Jim Weisman, general counsel for Eastern ParalyzedVeterans, "is to band together.  Too many organizations focus only on onedisability."He notes that the American Association of People with Disabilities was formedthis year "and is striving to be the AARP of the disabled community.  If itsucceeds, it could become a very effective spokesorganization."In the meantime, it and other groups work both separately and collectively topromote understanding and further accommodation.The ingredients are certainly in place for both.  They include a healthy angeron the part of people with disabilities and their families, a watchfulgovernment, fear of lawsuts, awareness that people with disabilities are alsoconsumers with disposable income, noticeable room for improvement and sheermomentum.Five years ago, companies that went out of their way to market to people withdisabilities stood out, winning new business and plaudits.  Five years fromnow-and perhaps even sooner-companies that don't court this growing populationwill be the ones that stand out.Robert S.  Cole is a public relations professional who has a hearing-impaireddaughter.  He has worked for a number of organizations serving the deaf,including the Deafness Research Council, where he was director of development.Portrait of Disabled AmericaBased a survey of 30,000 households bewteen in late 1991 and early 1992, theU.S.  Census Bureau estimates that 48.9 million people, more than 19% of thepopulation, have a disability, defined as having difficulty performing atleast one daily living activity or socially defined role or task.  People whoare completely unable to perform a particular activity or task, or who musthave personal assistance, were considered to have a severe disability.Who are they?Age 21-64 56%Age 65 and older 34%Men 22.9 millionWomen 26.0 millionSeverely disabled 24.1 millionEmployed (ages 21-64) 14.3 millionEmployed, with a severe disability 2.9 millionOf those age 15 and over:Use a wheelchair 1.5 millionHave trouble seeing words in a newspaper,even with corrective lenses 8.1 millionCan't see words or letters in a newspaperat all, even with corrective lenses 1.6 millionHave trouble hearing a conversation 10.0 millionCannot hear a conversation 924,000Have no health insurance coverage 18.7%Source:  U.S.  Census BureauA Consumer's ViewLike many people involved with disability issues, Robert Cole becameinterested thanks to personal experience.  He interviewed his daughter abouther frustrations as a frequent business traveler.Debra Cole-who recently served as head of the recruitment office for theuniversity from which she graduated in 1992-had a delightful three yearstraveling around North America heralding the strengths of her alma mater.Well, almost delightful.Unlike most travelers, she had the hardest time getting a hotel room in whichshe could make phone calls.  Or enjoy television.  Or know that she would bealerted if a fire broke out.  Despite assurances from reservation clerks thatshe would have these basic comforts, she often entered a hotel lobby withstomach pains, afraid those assurances would be worthless.Ms.  Cole is deaf.  In order to use a phone, she needs a teletypewriter (TTY)machine, also known as a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).  Tohave words accompany the images she sees on TV, she needs a closed-captioningdevice that flashes dialogue across the bottom of the screen.  And to bealerted to an emergency, she needs flashing lights, not a beeping alarm.According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, hotels and motels must havethese devices readily available.  But Ms.  Cole has found that many do not.Or they do have them, but hotel personnel are:  a) unaware of the fact, b)don't know where the devices are, c) don't know how to install them, or d)don't want to be bothered."Deaf people have a better chance of getting the services they need atexpensive hotels," Ms.  Cole notes, "but Gallaudet University," her alma materand the nation's only liberal arts college for people who are deaf, "has alimited budget."Of budget and moderate motels and hotels-those charging between $30 and $75night-Ms.  Cole rates Holiday Inn the best and Super Six the worst she hasencountered in terms of providing the necessary equipment."But even when hotels have a TDD, closed-captioning device and flashing alarm,it is still a battle," she says.  "I've often had to write an angry note todesk clerks asking that they let me look in the office so I could find theequipment for them.  Sometimes that works; other times the hotel has nothingand either I have to drive around looking for a hotel that complies with theADA or take a room and demand a discount."Her other pet peeves include:* being told there is a TDD in the airport that she can use to confirm travelarrangements, then discovering it's in a different terminal; * seeing a signsaying she can arrange a ride to an off-site car rental company by using ahandy-but not TDD-"courtesy" phone; * being told by hotel clerks that a roomis "for a person who is disabled" because it has railings in the bathroom; *encountering service staff who handle their discomfort at dealing with someonewho is deaf by ignoring her."On the plus side," she adds, "there were looks of shock, then of realization,that a single woman who is deaf could travel around the country.  I feel thatthe more deaf people make themselves visible, the better their chances ofreceiving services that hearing people take for granted."For More InformationThe following organizations provide information on people with disabilities.The President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities 1331 FStreet, NW Washington, DC 20004 Voice:  (202) 376-6200 TTY:  (202) 376-6205National Council on Disability 1331 F Street, NW Washington, DC 20004 Voice:(202) 272-2004 TTY:  (202) 272-2077The National Easter Seal Society 230 West Monroe Street Chicago, IL 60606Voice:  (312) 726-6200 TTY:  (312) 726-4258National Parent Network on Disabilities 1727 King Street Alexandria, VA 22314Voice and TTY:  (703) 684-6763American Association of People with Disabilities 4401-A Connecticut Ave., NWWashington, DC 20008 Voice:  (202) 363-8970U.S.  Department of Justice Civil Rights Commission Public Access Section P.O.Box 66738 Washington, DC 20035 Voice:  (202) 541-0301 TTY:  (202) 669-6820Back to Headline List WT02-B32-282IA095-001020-B043-59http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ad29.html 205.156.212.5 19970121214950 text/html 32054HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 21-Jan-97 21:47:29 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:42:22 GMTContent-length: 31869Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ad29.html Sample Issue Copyright HIGH-TECH MARKETING via NewsNet JANUARY 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES -IDG OFFERS GLOBAL MEDIA BOOKING FACILITY (121 words) -NEW INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS GROUP FORMED (143 words) -SIMD TO ADDRESS DM, ELECTRONIC MEDIA (111 words) -DURACELL MOVES FOR HIGH-PROFILE WEB ADS (111 words) -THE BRIEF (639 words) -FEATURE:BREAKING THE LANGUAGE BARRIER (1025 words) -PUSHING THE BOAT OUT (34 words) -ON THE PITCH (218 words) -HTM CHRISTMAS CARD AWARDS (839 words) -THE BARMAN (1379 words) CopyrightHIGH-TECH MARKETING via NewsNetJANUARY 1996-IDG OFFERS GLOBAL MEDIA BOOKING FACILITYHIGH-TECH MARKETING-IDG OFFERS GLOBAL MEDIA BOOKINGFACILITYCOPYRIGHT 1995-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDInternational Data Group has introduced a globalmedia booking facility which lets customers bookmedia throughout the IDG worldwide empire as well asgiving customers credit according to their level ofadvertising spend across IDG's 270 publications in 75countries around the world.

Alexa Cate of TDM Marketing Associates Ltdexplains how they managed to please -- but notconfuse -- everyone.Back in 1994 when NORWEB Communications came into theworld it had all the right ingredients for success.Its parent company had a strong brand name which thetarget audience already associated with quality andgood service; it had a state of the arttelecommunications network using the very latestdigital technology and it was in the process ofrecruiting a top team from the telecommunicationsindustry to handle its sales and marketing. Some may say that this would be apushover for the PRagency... NORWEB Communications is a public telecommunicationsnetwork operator in the north west of England, whichwas granted a Public Telecommunications Operator's(PTO) licence in April 1994 and launched services a year later following a period of network expansionand staff recruitment. NORWEB's network stretchesfrom Macclesfield in the south to Carlisle in thenorth and from the Lancashire and Cumbria coastacross to the Pennines. The company targets thebusiness sector, offering a range of voice and datatelecommunications services such as ISDN, facilitiesmanagement, card services, leased circuits and LAN toLAN interconnect as well as plain old telephony.Apart fro m facilities management and the value addedservices which are available nationwide, most ofNORWEB Communications' services are targeted only atnorth west based companies. The company thereforeprefers not to encourage demand from outside thenorth west as it is only in a position to offerservice on its own network in the NORWEB area.  TDM was officially appointed in March 1994 to handlePR and provide marketing consultancy as required. Ourkey objectives were to establish NORWEBCommunications as a major network operator on thenorth west of England, to increase awareness ofNORWEB amongst the north west business community, tolaunch NORWEB's portfolio of products and servicesand to position NORWEB as the preferredtelecommunications supplier for north westbusinesses. Our brief was, and still is, to complement othermarketing activities such as direct mail andadvertising in local and regional business press. Wealso work closely with NORWEB plc's corporate affairsdepartment as they need to be kept fully briefed onour activities. Although our main area of activitywas to be PR with local, regional and trade/technicalpress and event management we have found ourselvesgetting involved with all manner of projects fromroadside workers' luminous jackets through toclothing for a clay pigeon shooter! Whatever the project however, we soon learned theNORWEB rule of "No purchase order number, no pay" andthat on average it takes three weeks for a purchaseorder to be processed! On the PR front, the local and regional press werealready familiar with NORWEB plc -- their localelectricity company. They were however less familiarwith the technicalities of telecommunications and thechallenge for TDM was how to interest them in the new services on offer from NORWEB Communicationswithout turning them off with telecommunicationsjargon. The importance of this was amply demonstratedat the official launch of NORWEB Communications whichwe organised in June 1994. There was a press briefingin the morning attended by a mix of technical andregional business press. Some of the NORWEB spokespeople had a tendency to usejargon, (especially when under the hot glare of mediaflashguns) and in no time the regional pressjournalists were asking questions like "So whatexactly is a 2Mb link?"In the first few months after the official launch wedidn't need to worry too much about bamboozlingjournalists with techno jargon -- the challenge was alittle different. NORWEB Communications had not yetlaunched their core telephony services and we had togenerate press coverage with stories about the manynew staff appointments and not so many existingcustomers for whom NORWEB already provided specialisttelecommunications services. After the tenth newappointment announcement the regional business presswas probably wondering where it would all end. Once the services were launched we had a lot more toshout about and the press began to call more upon ourspokespeople for comment and interviews. We decidedit was time for some media training so we hired awell known freelance telecommunications journalist togive them a going over and she certainly proved valuefor money. They came out of it a bit battered aroundthe edges but ready to face anything the press couldthrow at them. The next milestone was arranged around the officiallaunch of NORWEB Communications' new services. It wasdecided to hold a three day Communications Expo atG-MEX Manchester for north west businesses. Whilstthe event was an overwhelming success (over 500businesses attended) we vowed never again to trustNORWEB when they said they had "cleaned" theirdatabase of invited guests -- just how did that manfrom Cable NorthWest get in the door? Our most recent launch has been the Nexus Centre --also at G-MEX -- this is a showcase of NORWEBCommunications' services which businesses can visitto see the services in action and talk to theexperts. We had a few experts on hand at the launchto give talks on various new telecommunicationstechnologies, once again supposedly in layman's termsbut I did hear the odd "155Mbit/s" and "packetswitching" being bandied about. Next time I thinkwe'll lay on an interpreter to translate for thosepeople who can't resist using jargon no matter howmuch you ask them not to. So what does the future hold? As you're probablyaware NORWEB has recently been taken over by NorthWest Water and many of the recent press enquirieshave been about the takeover. For once ourspokespeople had no excuse for talking intelecommunications riddles - all they were allowed tosay was "No comment!"Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH-TECH MARKETING via NewsNetJANUARY 1996-PUSHING THE BOAT OUTHIGH-TECH MARKETING-PUSHING THE BOAT OUTCOPYRIGHT 1995-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDVNU BUSINESS PUBLICATIONS has launched a 26-issuepartwork home computer guide called Easy PC andlaunched a major GBP1.6m nationwide advertisingcampaign.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH-TECH MARKETING via NewsNetJANUARY 1996-ON THE PITCHHIGH-TECH MARKETING-ON THE PITCHCOPYRIGHT 1995-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDOn The Pitch is compiled from a number of sources.Confirmation of activity should be sought before anyprofessional time is spent pursuing such activities.Argyll Public Relations has been appointed by BTRIEVETECHNOLOGIES INC to handle UK public relations andinfromation office services.CHEMFREE CORP has appointed Baron, McDonald & Wellsto handle its US PR and marketing for promoting itsnon-hazardous parts cleaning system.

HTM has examined theChristmas cards which came into M2 Communicationsalong with comments from many other journalists andPR folk in the field to present the (subjective) best-- and worst -- of the bunch.A lot of companies copped out and used charity cardswith the usually-well printed company name in thecentre trick -- so these are mainly excluded from thejudging but DPA/Flying Pig deserves a mention as theydesigned a card for the Bramley Area Bosnia Appealwith another local firm for subsequent resale: a neatmove.A special mention mist go to Fox Parrack Fox who usedChristmas to announce a new office move -- 1 3/4miles as the sleigh fiies -- and to prove thisrecipients could move Santa and watch his progressthroughout London.

But not all companies will benefit from a maturation of theInternet. Analysts expect that Internet service providers will see amajor shakeout beginning this year as larger telephone companies enterthe market of bringing businesses and consumers onto the Web.Web Measurement      Advertisers will demand better information this year about whois seeing their Web pages while Web publications, such as  TimeWarner's Pathfinder [TWX] or Hearst's HomeArts site, will betterquantify Web usage, knowing full well that the moneymaking potentialof a Web site depends on solid information about the people who useit.      "Measurement is an increasingly hotter issue," said Ed Hott,vice president of marketing at Interse Corp., which designs softwareto measure Web site activity. "There's a lot of information available,it just has to get logged and interpreted in a proper way."      Information that is readily available includes "pageimpressions" -the number of times a single Web page is downloaded by auser -- and the time a user spends on a page before clicking toanother Web page. This information can tell marketers which Web pagesdraw the most interest or produce a direct sale. They can then adjustthe content of their sites to maintain the interest of a core group of users.      Audited reports of Web site usage also will begin to appear asthe Audit Bureau of Circulations, the non-profit organization whichaudits print subscribership and newsstand sales, ends its testingprogram of Web tracking software this month and begins to offeraudited reports of Web site usage.Advertising Prices Fragment      This year also will see more companies define their marketingobjectives for the Web and how they use it to advertise or acquirebusiness leads.      "I see a couple of different pricing models," said MattThornhill, president of Martin Interactive in Richmond, Va.He said Web sites that draw in thousands of people, such as the Webdirectories Yahoo! and Lycos, may be able to begin selling advertisingon a cost per thousand basis, similar to the measurement criteria intelevision.      The other pricing model will resemble direct marketing's costper lead basis, which is generally targeted and more expensive,especially for business-to-business advertising.      "Direct marketers may pay between $150 and $300 for a lead, butif a business can convert a $20,000 sale out of it, it's worth it," henoted.Slowing Web Growth      Thousands of companies launched sites on the World Wide Web lastyear because they wanted to experiment with the new medium and notfall behind competitors. But that growth is slowing, says a study byThe Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston which specializesin information technology.      The firm found that the average weekly growth in commercial Websites slowed from a yearly high of 4.4 percent during the thirdquarter of last year to 2.8 percent during the last quarter. Thisslowdown may be attributed to a cooling of the hype surroundinginteractive media or possibly the end to the surge of technicallysophisticated telecom and technology companies which jumped on the Webearly.Year of the Shakeout      The rush to the Web by thousands of businesses spawned a wave ofstartup Internet service providers, many of which are not expected tohave enough capital or cash flow to survive an industry consolidation.      Telecom firms that begin offering Internet access, such as AT&Tor major cable-TV companies, probably will end up the winners in thecompetitive struggle. The Yankee Group predicts that the number ofInternet service providers will fall from 1,400 now to 600 by the endof the year, which it is labeling the Year of the Shakeout in theInternet industry. That number will fall to less than 300 by the endof next year.      "We expect to see scale-backs in everything from Internetdevelopment plans to the number of Internet network providers," saidGregory Wester, director of research at the firm.      Evidence of an industry consolidation is being seen as companiessuch as PSI buys out smaller Internet service providers such asPipeline and Panix, both once based in New York.      An industry shakeout should have little impact on mostbusinesses which market through traditional sales methods or advertisein established media such as print publications or television. Ifanything, it will make marketers and consumers more cautious abouttheir choice of access providers.      A shakeout also is a strong indicator of how the Web will beused for commercial purposes, according to the study. Westeridentified four distinct phases which characterize companies' Internetdevelopment plans: experimentation, development, justification andincorporation and fulfillment.      Most companies are now in the experimentation and developmentphase in which they have an Internet presence, but they do notscrutinize its marketing effectiveness. The justification phase iswhere companies can back up the investment in interactive media withevidence of growing revenue streams. The final phase, fulfillment,occurs when interactive marketing generates a consistent revenuestream and return on investment. None of the companies surveyed havereached the fulfillment phase.      A total of 18 percent of companies with an Internet presencehave done no analysis of the effectiveness of their interactivemarketing program, said Steve Franco, program manager at The YankeeGroup.      "Only 12 percent [of companies surveyed] have justified theirinvestment plans under the scrutiny typically required within anorganization," he said of the justification and incorporation phase.      This sentiment is echoed by Thornhill at the Martin Agency.      "My overall opinion is that '96 will be a watershed year for theWeb as major marketers will put their toe in the water to test itout," he said. "Marketers have money in the budget for '96 to try awhole lot of stuff. But when October '96 rolls around and they budgetfor '97, the big questions about its [the Web's] effectiveness will beasked. The Web really has to prove itself this year to survive nextyear."       As companies move toward the justification phase, they will bepressed to demand quantifiable results in reaching a desired targetaudience, acquiring new customers and building lasting relationshipswith existing customers.      The firm said most near-term Internet successes will be seen inthree areas of activity:*Leveraging traditional core competencies: An example of this type ofsuccess would be a cable programmer, such as CNN or ESPN, using theInternet to distribute news already gathered by its editorial staffand distributed through cable systems.      *Efficiencies of scale: Floral delivery companies which generatea large volume of low-priced transactions through a Web site may bemore successful marketing on the Internet than sellers of suchbig-ticket items as cars.      *Cost reductions: A bank which allows customers to conductInternet transactions may save on the costs of expanding a branchnetwork.

But interactive marketing will not add value to a company'ssales efforts unless the company maximizes this interactive capabilityby building one-to-one relationships with customers and making anonline sale.      Clearly, assuring customers that credit card numbers or otherpayment information are secure will be a major factor in online sales.The major purchase card companies, Visa International and MasterCardInternational , are working on developing security protocols forInternet transactions.      The protocols are a necessary part of how computers communicateconfidential payment information without the risk of being stolen byan interloper.      Although each company began developing its own protocols lastyear, some executives expect to see the two firms combine theirefforts this year.      "At the request of Visa, we have met with them a couple of timesabout coming back together," said Dorea Smith, director of globalcommunications at MasterCard.      Another MasterCard insider said that Visa and its securitydevelopment partner Microsoft Corp. have come back to the table andwill make an announcement soon of their intentions to work withMasterCard on an open set of standards.      MasterCard has spent the last few months listening tosuggestions from security consultants about its protocols and expectsto begin testing them during the first quarter of this year andrelease them for Internet use in April.      Executives at Visa were unavailable for comment.      "In 1996, you will see security solutions moving from the realmof specification debates and political jockeying about protocols tobeing actually rolled out," said Stratton Sclavos, president ofVeriSign.      The widespread deployment of security solutions will acceleratethe acceptance of electronic commerce and make doing business onlinemore commonplace, said John Patrick, vice president of Internetapplications for IBM. "In 1996, we will see the beginning of a newlevel of trust and understanding about authentification andencryption. This will bring the next major round of growth, fuelingmajor growth in electronic commerce," he said.      Software firms are expected to incorporate electronic paymentmodules into both client and server software packages by midyear.Initially, most will focus on credit card payment methods, with cashand check systems catching up late this year or early in 1997, sayanalysts. This development could allow other security solutions toemerge, although companies with existing products will continue to beregarded as market leaders, they say.Dorea Smith, MasterCard, 914/249-1421  Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ARTHUR ANDERSEN LAUNCHES WEB SITE      Someone finally did it: Published a history of accounting on aWeb site.

The demonstrates that 70 percent of online adults -- the nearly16 million U.S. adults that have access to the Internet or subscribeto an online service -- have a Visa card, while 50 percent have aMasterCard, 30 percent use Discover and almost 18 percent have an AT&TUniversal Card.     "We would expect to see a higher number of credit cards amongInternet users, because the demographics of Internet users are skewedtoward upper-income and college-educated adults," said JamesDesrosier, head of global advertising at MasterCard.Internet shopping is relatively undeveloped now for a variety ofreasons, including no "critical mass" of online users and prevailingconcerns about Internet security. But Internet security is expected toimprove as payment card companies develop improved encryption methodsfor cardholder data.     As security does improve, it is reassuring to know that onlineadults have the purchase cards to allow them to engage in Internettransactions in the near term.     "It's best to capitalize on an existing base of a certainbehavioral segment," Desrosier said.     Because that base now largely consists of value-minded,college-educated males, MasterCard is using a three-pronged approachto getting the most out of its Web marketing strategy.     Desrosier said his company's Web site is designed to attractcollege students, sports enthusiasts and value-minded shoppers.     A large proportion of the 15 million college students in theUnited States have free access to the Internet, which means the Web isuseful in targeting an attractive market segment.     Because Internet users are mostly male and men tend to be sportsenthusiasts, MasterCard has sports tie-ins on its Web site to reachthis group and sign them up for credit cards.     Desrosier said the company is also trying to attract value-mindedshoppers by offering contests and giveaways.     "Value shoppers are looking for freebies, value-added offers andgive-backs," he said.     He declined to comment on how many new cardholders the company'sWeb site has solicited compared with other types of solicitations.Overall, direct-mail was less successful at attracting new cardholderslast year, according to BAI Mail Monitor, which tracks direct-mailsolicitations. It reported that more than 2.6 billion card offers weremailed last year, up from 2.4 billion in 1994, but response rateshovered around 1.4% last year, down from 1.6% in 1994.     Desrosier said he would expect to see higher response rates fromWeb users who visit the MasterCard Web site, simply because the usermay be actively seeking out a credit card application. But the key toeffective Web advertising is directing the foot traffic of Web users.     "You have to provide the right kind of content for the kind ofpeople who are surfing the 'Net," Desrosier said. "Right now, thatconsists of value-driven shoppers, males and college students."

Although market research firm Inteco Corp. predicted that thenumber of installed multimedia kiosks would grow 69 percent this yearto a total of 211,000 units, Greg Swistak remains cautiouslyoptimistic.     Swistak is president of Factura Inc., a kiosk maker based inRochester, N.Y. that was bought by touch-screen manufacturerMicroTouch Systems Inc. in February.     "Some of Inteco's numbers were based on a couple of largerollouts which were put on hold," Swistak said.     He said he expects his company's unit sales to grow 50 percent toa total of 15,000 kiosks this year. The company has installed 30percent of the 100,000 kiosks now in operation in the United States.     The biggest installers of interactive kiosks have been greetingcard companies, such as American Greetings. American Greeting hasbetween 10,000 and 12,000 kiosks which print customized greetingcards. It was installing 800 kiosks a month during a peak installationtime last year, but that program was put on hold.     Hallmark also installed 1,500 kiosks in its chain stores andgrocery stores, but is now in the process of redeploying some unitswhich did not perform as well as expected.     "If a kiosk takes up space in a food store, it has to beproductive," said Mindi Ellis, a spokesperson for Hallmark.     But interactive kiosks are not limited to printing greetingcards. Swistak said all types of retailers are taking interest ininteractive kiosks to offer product information to customers.     "The real benefit is to have much more detailed productinformation than a human being can offer," Swistak said.     He said stores which don't have the time or resources to teachhigh-school and college-student employees about a wide range ofproducts may benefit from installing a kiosk, but Swistak concedes itis difficult to measure the return on investment for the devices.     Kiosks may be expensive depending on their capabilities. The costof a kiosk enclosure costs a mininum $750, and a touch-screen monitorcosts between $700 and $1,000. A personal computer which sits insidethe kiosk may cost about $1,500 and a printing device could addanother $500 to $1,000. Depending on the choice of hardware anindividual kiosk may cost between $4,000 and $20,000. And then there'sthe cost of designing the software to interact with a kiosk user.     "The cost of designing the software depends on a company'scomputer expertise," Swistak said.     One of his customers, JCPenney Co., is in the process ofinstalling 1,500 kiosks for its bridal registry program. The companyhas a large internal systems department that designed the entiresystem.     Another customer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, has a group oftransportable kiosks which are temporarily installed at the office anew health-maintenance organization customer. The kiosk allows acompany's employees to view information about various health insuranceplans, select a plan and even select a preferred doctor.     Swistak foresees kiosks with greater Web access which would allowa user to search for more extensive product information.     "A company like General Motors could have kiosks in itsdealerships which allow people to browse its home page and get moreproduct information," Swistak said. "There are a lot of marketingapplications out there."Greg Swistak, Factura Inc., 716/264-9600Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996lLOOKING BACK ON A YEAR OF INTERACTIVITY     Go back to the beginning of 1995 and look at the businessliterature. Without fail, nearly every publication has devotedenormous amounts of space to interactivity, the Internet, and theelectronic marketing revolution.     The emphasis on interactive marketing and interactive potentialhas dominated the technology literature, the financial literature, themarketing literature, the futurist literature, and the salesliterature. Without a doubt, 1995 was the year of the acceptance ofthe topic of interactivity.     It may come to pass, as we enter 1996 and the years beyondleading up to the new millennium, that more businesses will form as aresult of interactive technology than have formed across all ofhistory to date.     During 1995, the entrepreneurial visionaries of the worldactually came to believe that everybody can be a publisher. Up untilnow, publishing was reserved for only certain members of society'selitist layer.  With the advent of the Internet, the elitist layer wasredefined and ambitious individuals discovered that the world will payhandsomely for both information and entertainment.     The world is dividing into those who provide and those who usecontent.  Put another way--a more entrepreneurial way--the world iscleaving into those who will buy information and entertainment andthose who will sell information and entertainment.  That is a profoundshift.     Witness, if you will, the hardly surprising indications ofmankind's propensity to drift to the lowest common denominator.  TheInternet is itself cleaving into the useful and the profane.  Thebroadcast world is subdividing into The Learning Channel and RickiLake.  The great Bell curve, however, is firmly centered over"Unbelievably Vulgar and Coarse."     Cyberspace seems to be a more environmentally (with emphasis onthe "mentally") friendly place for business than it is for children. Perhaps it is business that will serve as the "hemisphere of good" incyberspace while entertainment is relegated to the "hemisphere ofevil."  Perhaps it is information and business applications ofinformation that will redeem interactivity and its elemental shapingof our future.  Perhaps it is information distilling to wisdom thatwill create grace in cyberspace.     And so, as we continue into the first full years of thecyberspace age, it is well we should look back at where we have beenand attempt to influence where we are going.  A great number ofcorporations are spending massive sums of money to dominate variouscorners of cyberspace. A huge number of individuals are counting oninteractivity as being their personal Holy Grail. An even larger massof humanity is dying from ignorance and poverty. We are entering theformative and truly shaping years of interactivity. We have choices tomake as to content. Those choices can be driven be goodness or bygreed.       When the interactive world contains merchants of pornography andviolence, I despair for the future. When the interactive worldcontains cheats and thieves, I despair for the future. When theinteractive world contains darkness and hate, I absolutely despair forthe future. It is up to each member of the interactive world to choosea hemisphere of content. It is up to each member to choose a directionfor he future. With some small amount of luck, we may actually makethis thing called interactivity work for good instead of just anotherspecious "profit." But, frankly, I doubt it.          Donald R. Libey is a marketing futurist, consultant, speaker andauthor.

Specifically, the company has inked a deal with USA Networks inwhich Simon and Schuster will advertise its new Star Trek Omnedpediaand Star Trek Technical Manual CD ROM games on The Dominion, the Sci-Fi Channel site on the World Wide Web (http://www.scifi.com), inaddition to the Sci-Fi Channel television network in the UnitedStates.     In exchange for Simon and Schuster advertising with the USANetwork, the network has created a seven-page section which willdemonstrate the CD-ROMs to Dominion users, as well as the opportunityto order the CD-ROMs via fax.      "Essentially, [Simon and Schuster Interactive] is the first tobuy a site," within USA's online area, said USA Network's DanMartinsen.  "What it does for us is to bring us some revenue."     In the past, there was a great deal of debate about how well thistype of agreement would pan out, he added.  "But it actually doesbecome a revenue source."  He declined to provide projections on whatUSA Network expects to earn.     "The key is ...to do it in a way not to turn off [consumers],"said Martinsen.  "It's a challenge to create advertising...but make itof interest to [cybersurfers]."     For Simon and Schuster, the obvious benefits amount to tappingUSA Network's online traffic as well as cable viewers. The Dominionsite, launched in March 1995, is the home for science fiction on theWeb.  The growing Sci-Fi Channel is available in more than 26 millionhomes nationwide.     "The unified message we have directed through the Sci-Fi Channeland its Dominion online site provides the one-two punch we look forwithout Star trek advertising," said Walter Walker, vice president ofmarketing for Simon and Schuster Interactive.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ONLINE PROMOTIONS GAINING FOOTHOLD     The launching of interactive Web sites to promote entertainmentproducts is multiplying at a phenomenal rate.     One of the latest trends is for entertainment giants to useinteractive Web sites that offer behind-the-scenes video clips,interactive games and contests to promote new products.     The sites range from simple reviews of the film and stillpictures to actual sound and video clips, interactive board games andtrivia questions.      For example, Magnet Interactive Communications, a leadinginteractive media development agency for Sony Pictures Entertainment,has created a web site that offers six downloadable games that offerusers the chance to win a trip to Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla.     By creating the site, the company hopes to introduce cybersurfersto its show featured online.     The Jumanji site hopes to attract game buffs, as well as casualsurfers.  "Users will encounter the same sense of adventure the movieoffers in this thrilling home page," said Basel Dalloul, chairman andCEO of Magnet Interactive Group. "This site invites moviegoers toenjoy the Jumanji experience in an exciting original format plus achance to win great prizes."Back to Headline List WT02-B32-284IA095-001020-B043-133http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ad30.html 205.156.212.5 19970121215111 text/html 44631HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 21-Jan-97 21:49:04 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:42:22 GMTContent-length: 44446Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ad30.html Sample Issue Copyright INTERACTIVE PR via NewsNet May 6, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HOT WIRE (239 words) TO COMMUNICATE BELL ATLANTIC/NYNEX MERGER, WEB PAGES ARE SENT TO REPORTERS VIA E-MAIL (702 words) EVOLVING INTO AN INTERACTIVE MARKETING TOOL, SCREEN SAVERS PROTECT BRANDS, NOT MONITORS (739 words) 'A CACOPHONY OF VOICES, A MASS OF CLUTTER', ANOTHER DISCUSSION ON INTERACTIVE MARKETING (1360 words) ONLINE INTERVIEW: JEFF OSTER (1278 words) NEW WEB AD NETWORK LETS MARKETERS, OTHERS, TARGET AUDIENCES TO AN UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE (523 words) INTERACTIVE NEWS & IDEAS (597 words) ONLINE MEDIA (556 words) THE WELL (488 words) CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996HOT WIRENEW YORK C:\risis! Throw Out Those 3-Ring Binders. Crisis managementhas finally entered the computer age.  Burson-Marsteller (B-M)introduced the industry's first computer-based crisis managementsystem, called C:\risis.  B-M is certainly one of the world leaders inthis field, having worked on crises from Tylenol and Bhopal to Perrierand Pan Am at Lockerbie.No Time, Information. Losing control of a crisis is almost always aresult of either not enough time or not enough information, RayO'Rourke, director of B-M's U.S. practice, told IPR.  So C:\risis wasdeveloped to save time and provide accurate real-time information inmanaging a crisis for tracking and evaluating a rapidly evolvingsituation, formulating strategy, and responding quickly.   No Plug & Play.  The system provides resources, such as onlinemonitoring, database and Net search tools; communications drivers,such as e-mail, fax polling, and satellite paging; and an electronicmanual of procedures, policies, contact lists, and backgroundmaterials. Of course, all this information must be customized to aorganization based on its business and the kind of vulnerabilities itfaces.    Beam It Up, Scotty.  O'Rourke said C:\risis will be especially helpfulon site at an emergency, where facilities are often lacking. Thesoftware fits in a laptop, and info can be received or sent out viamodem and cell phone, if needed.  It even has a built-in hand-heldpage scanner, to send out local media stories that won't be foundonline.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996TO COMMUNICATE BELL ATLANTIC/NYNEX MERGER, WEB PAGES ARE SENT TOREPORTERS VIA E-MAIL      WASHINGTON  To communicate its information and spin on itsrecent merger agreement with Nynex, Bell Atlantic has embraced a newInternet technology that allows it to deliver its media relations Website to a self-selected group of reporters and other influencers usinge-mail.  Thus, instead of waiting for reporters to log onto the Weband remember to surf over to its site, Bell Atlantic goes directly tothem.      This capability is enabled by e-mail programs that allow for thesending and receiving of e-mail messages with embedded HTML, LiveObjects and images  i.e., the ability to send or receive Web pagesvia e-mail.      Bell Atlantic public relations/public affairs has been anInternet innovator since launching the Web's first major corporatepublic affairs site back in December 1993 during another proposedmerger, this time with Tele-Communications, Inc.  The media relationssite, ba.com  went up well before the general BellAtlantic site , and today remains one of thebest on the Web (see IPR story, Aug. 10, 1995).       Bell Atlantic has always used a listserv, which is a mailinglist of e-mail addresses to which it can send messages almostsimultaneously.  People interested in receiving Bell Atlanticinformation subscribe to the list.1,000 On Listserv      The listserv is a good communications strategy in itself. Due tointerest in the merger, Bell Atlantic's listserv has grown to about1,000 people, and can be found on a special Media  Resource Centersite on ba.com for merger information .      The ability to deliver Web pages to this listserv provides addedbenefits, according to Ken Deutsch, director of Washington-based IssueDynamics, Web site manager and consultant for Bell Atlantic.           "The problem with the World Wide Web is you have to have peoplecoming back to your site but as people go out and browse the Web, theyfind other sources and do not come back to yours," he said.  "Sendingindividuals HTML documents by a listserv delivers the Web to their e-mail. Since most Internet users check their e-mail on a daily basis,you'll always be able to get to them."      Photos, charts or tables can be e-mailed to users, but theability to sent hyperlinks to the Web is the most powerful benefit. When a specific announcement is e-mailed to reporters, they can simplyclick on a link to send an e-mail query to the relevant Bell Atlanticor Nynex contact.      For example, one recent announcement, on responses to themerger, was based on comments by Ed Young, a Bell Atlantic vicepresident.  The document referenced the merger and linked to the MediaResource Center. It then highlighted Ed Young's name, and a hyperlinkcould be clicked on to pull up his bio, photo and past speeches.  Atthe bottom of the page was a link back to the main ba.com site.      "In Bell Atlantic you can get any corporate profile, you can getany speech, you can do a keyword search of the whole site." Deutschsaid.  "You can do a search and find out everything that Ray Smith(Bell Atlantic's CEO) said about mergers before this announcement."Growing User Base       Most e-mail programs do not support the sending and receiving ofWeb pages, although it's almost certain they'll add the feature toremain competitive, so the user base should grow.      Today, it's available in the e-mail programs in the NetscapeNavigator browser, version 2.0 and higher, and in the MicrosoftNetwork.        Eudora, the most widely used e-mail program, does not have thefeature, but its latest 2.2 version supports what it calls "ActiveURLs."  Users can be sent an e-mail with an embedded URL (e.g., "tolearn more, see http://ba.com/nynex"), and by clicking on the URL,their Web browser is automatically opened and the specific Web page isdownloaded.       It's not quite the same as directly receiving a Web page, butit's close.  From a sender's point of view, users can still bedirectly linked to the Web.  Major Web publishers, such a c|net, usethe feature in newsletters e-mailed to subscribers.          Deutsch said that about a third of the new people joiningba.com's listserv for merger updates opt to receive Web pages ratherthan plain text messages.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996EVOLVING INTO AN INTERACTIVE MARKETING TOOL, SCREEN SAVERS PROTECTBRANDS, NOT MONITORS      LOS ANGELES - It used to be that a screen saver just kept youfrom burning a picture in your monitor. But in the last year it hasevolved into a powerful and popular branding and one-to-one marketingtool of choice.      Improved computer monitor technology has eliminated the need forscreen savers, yet millions are sold, downloaded, and given away aspromotional items.        That's because on today's screen savers, increasing quality,sound, interactivity and variety has become  de rigueur.      "It's priced right up there with a coffee cup and baseball capand pen, traditional items that companies give to their customers orprospects, said Jeff Oster, president of Interloc Design Group,specialists in customized screen savers (see Online Interview). "Itputs something right in front of  customers to keep the name in frontof them."      Interloc has developed custom promotional screen savers forcompanies such as Sprint, Nintendo, CompuServe and Yonex golf clubs.      "The strongest recognition of the power of  this whole thing isstarting to come through now as people see what PointCast is doing,"said Oster.       The PointCast Network (PCN) online news service works like ahybrid screen saver/browser that automatically or manually downloadsan astonishing breadth of current news headlines, weather, sports andU.S. stock chart and ticker information, and can be customized toreceive only the information the user desires, such as the number ofcompanies the user wants to monitor. (See IPR, April 8).       The service is free, paid for with a section of its screen thatprovides animated commercials: Click on any of the commercials, andyou jump directly to the advertiser's Web page.        When the PC is inactive, the PCN screen saver kicks in and rollsvarious news headlines and leads that the user can click directly tofrom the saver.  Some have described the PCN screen saver applicationas a taste of the killer app for the business Internet PC. Incentives Make A Difference      Fun and original screen savers are well and good but matterslittle if the user doesn't install it and keep it active for someperiod of time. Thus it becomes necessary to create an intrinsic valueto the user. That comes most readily in the form of incentives, as ininformation, entertainment, or most likely, money and prizes.        Interloc is developing a screen saver for a store grand opening.Diskettes will be mailed out in enticing packaging that tells peopleto bring the disk to the store to find out if they've won a prize. Even non-winners who install the program can benefit from storecoupons and rebates that can be printed from the screen saver at thehome or office.       "They're using it to draw people to the opening, and thenthey're using it as another delivery vehicle for coupons later," notedOster.      To keep users from ignoring or uninstalling the saver, time-released information may come in handy. Programmers can release anyspecified information over time, so that a contest or vital piece ofinformation may not appear on the screen for a while after the screensaver is installed, say one week or 90 days later.      PC Dynamics Inc., another screen saver developer, lays apractical set of rules at its Web site  onwhat not to do when you go about designing a screen saver, such as,"Computer users don't want screen savers that are blatantadvertisements," and "Don't even think of showing a bouncing oranimated logo." PC Dynamics, incidentally, created the Energizer BunnyScreen Saver.      Bouncing cookies however, may whet one's appetite. The winsomeNabisco screen saver , is housed in the company's kids site, butis equally amusing for adults who grew up on Oreos and Fig Newtons.      The animal motif has worked for successful screen saversstarring the Budweiser frogs and Coca-Cola's skiingpolar bears Interactive Marketing, Inc., also of Capistrano Beach, Calif.,designed a screen saver for King World Productions, distributors ofWheel Of Fortune, Jeopardy and Oprah, that was designed to read theinternal clock of the user's computer so that message changed everyday and reminded users of various promotions and other pertinentactivities during certain sweeps periods. "We incentivized users by telling them the screen saver wasseated and that one day a clue was going to pop up and if they knewthe answer they could win a trip to Hawaii," said Andrew Batkin,president of Interactive Marketing.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996'A CACOPHONY OF VOICES, A MASS OF CLUTTER', ANOTHER DISCUSSION ONINTERACTIVE MARKETING NEW YORK The year 1995 ended paradoxically for theinteractive marketing industry, said Alfred Sikes, president of HearstNew Media & Technology. "Despite a great year for the Internet, thecognoscenti ended the year soberly. Never have so many invested somuch in the future." Is there a business in interactive? This is "the recurringquestion that gnaws at us," he said. His answer: he's "certain there is." Sikes keynoted IM'96: The 7th Conference & Expo on InteractiveMarketing, organized by Capistrano Beach, Calif.-based InteractiveMarketing Communications April 16 to 18, which both looked to thefuture of the industry while trying to help attendees grapple with themore immediate issues of the day. Sikes said three forces will work together to makes today's Web"look like black and white TV," he explained: 1) competitionresulting from the new telecom law, 2) the seemingly infinite capacityto improve the performance of digital systems, and 3) market demand. Golden Era Another keynoter, Martin Yudkovitz, president of NBC InteractiveMedia, was also optimistic. "I'm firmly convinced we live in the most invigorating era tolive in in information and entertainment the golden era of TV," hesaid. And no "rank amateur" upstart is going to beat NBC in seizingthis new era, the way Ted Turner did with cable TV. "We're not going to let that happen in interactive media,"Yudkovitz proclaimed. Indeed. NBC's been playing for keeps since clinching a strategicalliance with Microsoft more than a year ago. MSNBC Cable, a 24-hour news and information service, and MSNBCInteractive, an interactive online news service, will both launch thissummer. NBC already has launched Web sites for the last Superbowl, ingolf, the Olympics, and coverage of Bosnia, to name a few. It'sdeveloped other initiatives, as well. One is the NBC Desktop Video, which provides full-motion videofor the financial community on its desk tops. It's an "expensive, butterrific product," Yudkovitz said, and "Wall Street can afford it." NBC has also embraced Intercast technology, which links theInternet and television on desktop computers so that information ormultimedia delivered via HTML pages can be delivered simultaneouslywith normal TV broadcast programming. It's a way of deliveringinteractive TV without the expense of set top boxes, Yudkovitz said,and NBC will use it with the Olympics. Full motion video was his message. He said the Web's been "sorely disappointing in itsentertainment power." Good product is "absolutely necessary," he said, but "being goodisn't good enough" for the Web, where there's "a cacophony of voices,a mass of clutter." "Design your content for where the medium is going, not whereit's been," he urged. "It is a full-motion video medium, a transactionmedium."Thirst For Bandwidth Not everyone at IMC'96 was desperate to turn the Web into TV,into a marketing model based on TV advertising. Steve Goldberg, manager of advertising development and strategyfor Microsoft Network, said he was "fascinated by marketers thirst formore bandwidth," since they still haven't figured out how to do thesimplest things, such as design and place an ad banner. "Focus on how to improve that as an art form," he challenged."We have a long way to go." Martin Sloane, president and CEO of Supermarket ShoppingNetwork, strongly suggested that brand marketers in general, andpackaged goods marketers in particular, should abandon resident Websites altogether. "Let corporations do this for IR (investor relations) andcorporate purposes," he said. "Resident Web sites are becoming less attractive" because theyare "too much trouble," he said. "Packaged goods marketers "don't wantto be the publisher of an interactive magazine"; rather, they want "avehicle they can turn on and just as quickly turn off." Sloane outlined alternatives. He said the advertising route is targeted, flexible, measurable,accountable in sales, and can offer full interactive facilities suchas surveys, promotions, contests and feedback. The umbrella Web site alternative, sometimes called the "virtualmall," offers lower costs and "relief from the burden of creatingfrequently changing and engaging content," he said. All participantsjointly promote the site, and achieve the necessary mass of consumerpromotions to offer the gratification and rewards needed to keepconsumers coming back, he added. Brands Will Blossom Lynn Upshaw, Ketchum Advertising's EVP for brand marketing, wasmore enthusiastic about brands and Web sites. "Brands will blossom on the Web," he said, and all thesuccessful brands he mentioned had resident Web sites. He said the Web will be "Brand Central" and that brands "will beone of the drivers, part of the super structure" of the Web. Brands are using the Web to "outflank competition," he said, insome cases attracting a younger and richer demographic. Ragu, forexample, had an older demographic than its competitors before itbecame one of the first consumer products on the Web, he explained. The session on "Site Promotions: Both On & Off The Net,"provided three panelists all charged with promoting entertainmentproducts on the Web. They stressed the power of deal making. Stuart Halperin, EVP of marketing for Hollywood Online explaineda nifty deal he worked out with National Theater Owners Association(NATO). NATO theaters run 30-second trailers promoting HollywoodOnline prior to their feature movies. In exchange, Hollywood Onlineprovides movie listings on its sites (on all the online services andthe Web) something that's in its interest to do anyway!Linking Thinking "Cut deals, find ways to form partnerships," said RobertaJacobs, SVP sales and marketing for Viacom New Media, which marketsvideo and CD games. She said online guerrilla marketing campaigns are "moreimpactful than TV ad campaigns," and at far less cost: "hundreds ofthousands rather than millions of dollars." She said sales with promotions linked to the Net can be graphed. To promote the Beavis & Butthead In Virtual Stupidity game onthe Net, a promotion was done with MTV Spring Break Weekend and linkswere made to MTV's homepage as well as to TV and print advertising. "Use linking thinking," Jacobs enthused. To get into this mindset, she said to identify companies thatalso reach your target market, and to "think of things to build intoyour site that others would like to link to." She said Viacom New Media gets approached a lot for cross-promotional links. "There are no established promotional models on the Web," shesaid. "Linking thinking" was also emphasized in a session on"Hyperlink Marketing." When asked, "how do you find hyperlink opportunities," DanielStone, SVP for Turner Broadcasting Sales, Inc., said: "They're allover the play, you just need the perspective to see them." He offered that many sites are looking for content providers andthat a strategic alliance with the right company "can bring anadditional 50,000 people to your site." He also said: "We see this as a branding medium; we see thevalue of the branding impression as important as an ad promotion," Back at the session on site promotion, Annie Van Bebber, a VP atAttitude Network, which publishes the Happy Puppy software game Website, also emphasized the value of cyber marketing over traditionalchannels. "Focus first on marketing online then roll out into othermedia," she said. It's So Easy She advised companies to hire one good person internally foronline marketing, but didn't think the position required muchexperience. "Students are a great resource," she said. "They don't have tohave any marketing experience just be able to type a word in asearch engine" because "it's so easy to get around the Internet."Maybe monkeys can be trained to do it. The subject of newsgroups wasn't raised until the end of thesession, when Van Bebber said they're "a great source" because "wordcan spread like wildfire." She suggested to "find one in your niche." An attendee said he'd heard there was danger in usingnewsgroups, and asked, "What is proper?" "Use proper Netiquette," Van Bebber replied. "What is that?" the attendee asked. "Well you should know," Van Bebber bristled. Apparently, she didn't.// For contact information on companies or people mentioned, e-mail.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996ONLINE INTERVIEW: JEFF OSTERMarketing With Screen Savers Jeff Oster is president of Interloc Design Group (IDC), based inCapistrano Beach, Calif.

So it continually becomes a new device.The information can be from a company that's trying to get informationto the consumer level, or it can be delivered over an Intranet. It'salmost like an electronic sign. Messages can scroll across the screenwhen the computer is inactive, and those messages can be informationthe user wants. IPR: How are they used internally?Oster: We've done internal screen savers for MCI and Sprint and othercorporations that want time-released messages in front of employees.These might be advertising schedules or corporate information, missionstatements and goals. This is just a new way of putting it in front ofthem on their computer screens. Really, the applications areunlimited. IPR: Are companies starting to send customized information to theiraudiences?Oster: In fact we're meeting with an agency for one of the automobilemanufacturers and that's exactly what they want to do. They want tohave a module similar to PointCast where the user can say, "Okay,here's the news I want. Here are the things I'm interested in andhere's the schedule I'd like to receive it in." (Note: PointCast is adesktop screen saver that provides users with updated, customized newsand information from news sources via the Internet. See IPR, April 8,or http://www.pointcast.com).IPR: Can a screen saver draw traffic to a Web site?Oster: Yes, it could. In fact that's something one agency we'reworking with wants to do. We can build a screen saver on disk that'sgiven away to a consumer, like a phone card. It's got free Internetaccess time on the disk, it's got a browser, and the screen saver. Allthe user needs is a modem. Now they've got 20 minutes of free time onthe Internet, and the program launches them right to the Web site of the company that gave it to them. This is similar to a phone card with30 free minutes of long distance calling on it and you hear a littlecommercial before you make your call. That's just one way to do it.IPR: With all the screen savers out there how do you make your's standout? Oster: Since we've developed this as a marketing tool one of the firstquestions people ask is, "Why is someone going to load this on thesystem? And then once they get it there, why are they going to keep itthere?" And you know, if you load something and it doesn't work orit's a bit frustrating or you just see the same thing over and over,you think "Okay, give me something new." So we've spent a lot of timeresearching that and found that incentives are very effective. We'vedone instant cash prizes for radio stations, golf clubs, tickets to aPGA event, and American Express gift certificates. Some clients willuse a grand prize. Radio station KOST 103.5 had five disks withinstant cash winners of $1,000. The screen saver disk had a serialnumber etched into the shutter so that somebody couldn't duplicate it. Others have spread those prizes over a wider number of disks. Onedistributor of computer products had about 4,000 disks and 100 of themhad $25 American Express gift certificates that were time-released, sopeople would be inclined to keep it loaded on their system over thenext ninety days. ViewSonic's screen savers announced an incentivetrip for resellers, with pictures of the Caribbean. But now we're getting into more people wanting to releaseinformation as the incentive. And that's really what PointCast is: ifthe information that ends up on your screen is something you want tosee, then that's a value. An incentive to someone in a corporateenvironment may not be an incentive to a university student. We'vefound that if information is valuable to the market we're going after,it's almost a stronger incentive than cash. If you thought you couldget information that would put you a step ahead of your competition,that would probably be pretty valuable to you as a business person. The other thing that we've found in doing this is that, whetherit's a CD or a diskette, this kind of direct mail gets a significantlyhigher response rate than a printed piece. You'll load it in yoursystem and spend about 20 minutes fiddling with it as opposed to thedirect mail piece that you might look over briefly and throw away.IPR: What do you say when a client asks what this is going to cost?What's the analogy?Oster: Good point because really the analogy is we view this as asoftware program that can be given away and has a retail value ofmaybe $15.00. We price these to our clients based on quantity anywherefrom $1.00 to $7.00 apiece, which includes the disk, labeling,software duplication royalty or licensing fees. The creation of themaster can range anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000, average $3,000 to$5,000. That generally includes putting in some kind of motion. Mostof the cost is building in the interactivity, if you want to hit a keyand have something else happen. We've rebuilt some where the user canactually put in their own information, like reminders or quotes. Itgenerally takes four to six weeks from the time we get a story board.IPR: When is a screen saver not an effective marketing vehicle?Oster: I talked to the Los Angeles Dodgers more than a year ago aboutdoing a screen saver night, and they said, "When we give somebody abaseball cap we know it fits everybody's head." So you've got to lookat the audience first. IPR: How do you work with communications agencies on these projects? Oster: Agencies obviously are creative people so it's something thatwe look to them for. They generally come to us with the story board. Sometimes they come to us with the content as well. If you go back ayear, nobody knew what the Internet was. We used to go call on allthese agencies and had to describe to them what a screen saver was.Today a lot more people know what it is.IPR: Are there any media relations applications for screen savers?Oster: The Nintendo screen saver was done for Golin/Harris, which isNintendo's public relations firm. It became part of an electronicpress kit so that reporters could load the disk and see 3D screensfrom Donkey Kong.IPR: It seems screen savers have come a long way.Oster: We're developing a trademark on the word "Kinetic Screens"because our engine is really more than a screen saver. It's adevelopment tool where we do 3D animation, video, sound, and allmultimedia components. But once we've worked with all those things wecan make a kiosk out of it, a Web site, a CD-ROM. The screen saver isreally a part of that. It just happens to have this unfortunate namethat everybody knows.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996NEW WEB AD NETWORK LETS MARKETERS, OTHERS, TARGET AUDIENCES TO ANUNPRECEDENTED DEGREE NEW YORK DoubleClick, the first Web advertising network (seeIPR, Feb. 19) has just ended its beta test phase and is now live. DoubleClick is intended to help advertisers reach the peoplethey want in a highly efficient, and therefore cost-effective manner. And for Web sites seeking advertisers, an ad network like DoubleClickmay remove the need to have an ad sales department or rep firm. But because targeting an audience through DoubleClick can be soprecise, the network may prove a useful tool for purposes beyondgeneral advertising, such as public relations, public affairs, or anyapplication where a specific group of people is to be reached with aspecific message, and quickly. DoubleClick offers this example on its Web site: "you cantarget females who work for aerospace component manufacturers in theLos Angeles area with at least $100 million in operating revenue whouse PCs with Windows 95 and like sports."Most Advanced Medium "We've taken it from one of the most primitive mediums to themost advanced medium," said Kevin O'Connor, DoubleClick CEO andpresident. "We do more right now with this medium than any othermedium can possibly do." The network enables targeting by Web page/site category (e.g.,arts and literature, entertainment, health and medicine), by one ormore geographic locations (e.g., by countries, states, area codes orzip codes), by operating system, browser type, by Internet domain,organization type (using SIC code), by organize size or revenue, bypersonal interests, and time (i.e., days or hours to display an adbanner). Advertisers can also control the types of banners, bannerdistribution, as well as banner frequency and ad banner series. "We have some advertisers using six different parameters, so wehave to hone it into a very specific group," O'Connor said. "I'm waiting for a restaurant to take out ads between 4:30 and5:30 Thursday, Friday and Saturday to get you to go to therestaurant," he added. "It's inevitable." The DoubleClick service is based on a massive database ofinformation on Internet users/organizations, combined withsophisticated proprietary application software. It lets advertisers control reach and frequency in real time, and provides measurableresults so advertisers can improve their campaigns.Non-Advertising Applications That's great news for advertisers, but also imagine thepossibilities for political campaigning, grassroots lobbying, issuesmanagement, and other applications such as financial communications especially as other ad networks sprout on the Web, some dedicated tovertical industries areas such as health care, for example. "We're not going to be the only network," O'Connor said. However, DoubleClick is the first and appears to be off to agood start. According to O'Connor, since the beta phase began in February,DoubleClick has delivered ads to more than two million Web users. Ithas grown from five to 25 participating Web sites, with more than 200sites asking to participate. And advertisers are pleased with theresults. "(DoubleClick's) targeting capabilities allowed us to bolsterour night-time traffic and better hit our demographic by doing latenight blitzes to the '.edu' domains," said Stephan Paternot ofWebGenesis, a site targeting the college market.//Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE PR via NewsNetMay 6, 1996INTERACTIVE NEWS & IDEAS NEW YORK c|net Look Out, Tech Marketers Get Ready.

From a business and job marketpoint of view, the answer is certainly "yes."  Most PR execs alsowould view the new federal laws on corporate financial disclosure, andto a lesser extent on lobbying as pluses.     From the point of view of excitement, the year was clearly awinner.  Last year's No. 1 story--the emergence of cyber PR--continuesto grab attention.     The other big stories of the year were: the press-monitoringfiasco at the Department of Energy, the Counselors Academy's droppingof APR as a membership requirement, a continuing high priority for PRmeasurement, leadership changes at IABC and IPRA, the Unabomber'sletter about Thomas Mosser's murder, and the death of PR legend EdwardBernays.Cyber PR Stays Center Stage     The standing-room-only crowd packed into Nicholas Negroponte'skeynote speech at the Public Relations Society of America conferencein October was striking evidence of the primacy of interactive PR. The cyber celeb's characterization of the World Wide Web as a "PRengine" should convince all but the most hardened technophobes thatthe Internet must be embraced.     And many have.  PR executives often have been heavily involved inthe launch of home pages by thousands of corporations and scores of PRfirms.  Home pages also were unveiled last year by the major PRprofessional bodies (Public Relations Society of America,International Association of Business Communicators and the NationalInvestor Relations Institute.)     Cyber services for media relations also logged on last year. PRNewswire and MediaMap Medannounced a linkup, that, in addition toautomating transmission of news releases via wire, mail and fax,provides automated e-mailing of releases to media.  Media directorycompanies added editor's e-mail addresses to their directories, and ahandful of companies began offering Internet clipping services.Strong Market for Jobs, Accounts     "Happy days are here again" could well be the refrain for the PRindustry last year.  The corporate and agency job market was thestrongest it has been since the boom of the mid- and late 1980s (July10, p. 1; June 26, p. 1).  In some markets--especially high-tech--lastyear's demand for experienced professionals appears to haveoutstripped the supply.     In another indicator of the robust job market, a number of PRexecutive recruiters reported that 1995 will go down as their bestyear ever.       The strong economy and corporations' increasing tendency tooutsource PR projects have combined to give most firms--including somewho had posted a string of soft years--a healthy flow of income.  Solopractitioners, whose numbers continue to increase sharply, also appearto have benefitted handsomely from these trends--and by a growingtrend of firms themselves to hire them on a project basis or asindependent contractors.Press Monitoring Overloads Circuits     A fairly routine PR measurement tool--content analysis of mediacoverage--unexpectedly became the most visible PR story of the year,hitting the front-pages of major newspapers such as The Wall StreetJournal and the Washington Post and nearly forcing the resignation ofa cabinet secretary (Nov. 20, p. 1; Dec. 11, p. 1).     Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary found her modestexpenditure of about $40,000 for Carma International's analysis ofDOE's press coverage become a lightning ride for criticism by thepress and Republican Congressmen.     Subsequent stories and a panel of journalists at the NationalPress Club ultimately acknowledged that content analysis generally isbenign--rather than underhanded.  Nonetheless, a media attorney on thepress club panel said that federal law prohibits media monitoring byfederal agencies--a subject that never was brought up in initialreporting of the story or in criticism by lawmakers.Lobby Disclosure Law Passed     As expected, President Clinton on Dec. 19 signed into law ameasure requiring registration of lobbyists and lobbying activities. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 was supported by both the AmericanLeague of Lobbyists and the American Society of AssociationExecutives, both of whose members will be required to comply with thelaw (Dec. 11, p. 1).  The measure also will require full-timecorporate lobbyists to register.     While many corporate, trade association and independent lobbyistshave been registering all along, the new law closes loopholes thatallowed many lobbyists to legally bypass registration if they chose.     Coincident with the new lobbying disclosure law, both the Houseof Representatives and Senate passed strict rules banning most gifts. In the case of House members, almost all gifts are banned.  Senatorspassed rules allowing gifts of up to $50.IR Execs Get Their Wishes     1995 was a great year for investor relations, with majorvictories on federal regulation and with the Financial AccountingStandards Board.     Late last month (Dec. 22), both houses of Congress voted tooverride President Clinton's veto of a bill limiting frivolouslitigation (see story this issue, p. 8).  The new law will limit theability of shareholder plaintiffs to sue publicly traded companieswhen they believe that companies' disclosure of earnings or marketprojections turned out to be inaccurate.  Moreover, even in cases whensuits may go forward, the law limits the amount of payments toplaintiffs, as well as attorney's fees.     IR professionals also counted as a gain a January decision by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board to drop a proposed change thatwould have required publicly trade corporations to determine anddisclose a present value for stock options granted to seniorexecutives (Jan. 23, p. 8).Measurement: Still A Top Priority        Proving the value of PR to management--both on a project leveland on a fundamental level--continues to be a high priority for PRprofessionals.     A fall survey of PR NEWS readers conducted by the newsletter andSchenkein/Sherman Public Relations revealed that proving PR's valuewas the top concern of corporate and agency PR people (Oct. 23, p. 1).     Nearly two-thirds of the 200 responding readers also said thatthe best way for the profession to gain more credibility with topmanagement would be "national studies" that show PR's effectiveness atchanging behaviors.     At a rare meeting of the leaders of the largest PR firms lastmonth (Dec. 11, p. 8), these agency chieftains voiced support for astudy of this type. Counselors Drop APR Requirement     After fighting an uphill battle to increase membership--particularly among executives at the largest PR firms--members of theCounselors Academy of the Public Relations Society of America votedlast fall to drop PRSA accreditation as a requirement for membershipin the group (Nov. 6, p. 2).     In the 1980s, the Academy became the first and only group tomandate the APR (Accredited in Public Relations) designation as arequirement for membership in the section, whose membership iscomprised solely of PR agency executives and individual practitionerPR consultants.     While the APR certification is not required for membership inPRSA, it remains a requirement for chapter and national officerpositions.Leadership Changes at IABC, IPRA     1995 marked changes at two of the world's largest PRorganizations, the International Association of Business Communicators(IABC) and the International Public Relations Association (IPRA) (June12, p. 1).  IABC's board selected long-time headquarters stafferElizabeth Allan as its new president, after the sudden resignation ofDavid Paulus after only eight months on the job (June 19, p. 1). Allan became IABC's fifth president, and the second woman to lead theapproximately 12,500-member organization.     In contrast to the IABC's nearly instantaneous move to replacePaulus, IPRA has not decided who will take over the reins of the1,000-member organization following the mid-year decision to acceptIPRA President Dennis Clagett's resignation.  Among the options beingexplored are the hiring of a part-time executive director, sharing ofan executive or administrative support with another PR organization,using an association management company, or moving its headquartersfrom Geneva, Switzerland, to a less-expensive city.     Clagett's last day on the job was Dec. 22. Bomber Targeted PR in Mosser Murder     The shocking December 1994 mail-bombing murder of former topBurson-Marsteller executive Thomas Mosser was in the news again lastyear when a letter from the notorious Unabomber revealed the reasonsfor the PR executive's targeting (May 1, p. 8): "We blew up ThomasMosser last December because he was a Burston-Marsteller [sic]executive.  Among other misdeeds, Burston-Marsteller helped Exxonclean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident."  Theterrorist also said the firm's identity as one of the major PR firms,whose work often involves "manipulating public attitudes," made it atarget.Edward Bernays, PR Pioneer, Dies     Edward Bernays, the last and possibly most celebrated of PR'searly pioneers, passed away last March at age 103 (March 20, p. 3).     A high-level New York PR counselor for about 40 years, he alsowas the author of a seminal work on PR practice, "Crystallizing PublicOpinion."  The booked marked one of the first uses of the term, "PRcounsel."     "He made very real, very substantial contributions to thebusiness," first and foremost the understanding of psychology, saidChester Burger, himself one of the legendary counselors in the field. Burger said Bernays also was a pioneer in the use of opinion researchat a time when many were "flying by the seat of their pants."     Bernays also is remembered as the most visible proponent oflicensing of PR professionals; he sponsored an effort in his homestate of Massachusetts in the early 1990s which failed to gain muchsupport in the state legislature.     He is remembered for many successful marketing PR programs, suchas a 1920s Proctor & Gamble Co.  effort that encouraged children touse soap by sponsoring a soap-carving contest.  He in later yearsadmitted regret for his successful work for tobacco companies, inwhich he conceived programs promoting the smoking of cigarettes bywomen, by labeling cigarettes "torches of freedom."Back to Headline List CopyrightPR NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HOLLYWOOD TAPS WEB TO HYPE ITS FILMSStudios follow movies' themes to create fun promotional sites     Hollywood studios are quickly adding the flashy World Wide Web totheir promotional machinery for new movie launches.        Entertainment companies now are using interactive Web sites thatoffer behind-the-scenes video clips, interactive games and contests topromote films.     The sites range from simple reviews of the film and stillpictures to actual sound and video clips, interactive board games andtrivia questions.        For example, in conjunction with box office success "Jumanji," ahome page developed by Magnet Interactive Communications has created aWeb site for the Sony Pictures Entertainment release.  It offers sixdownloadable games allowing users the chance to win a trip to BuschGardens in Tampa, Fla.      "For us it is another way to advertise our product.  It is usedin addition to billboards, television and print ads," said JenniferKennedy, assistant account executive for KillerAp Communications,which worked with Sony on the project.     Sony is not the only entertainment company jumping onto theInternet.  Castle Rock Entertainment is offering an interactive Website for its recent release, "The American President."  Users can votein an online poll, take a tour of the White House, participate in avirtual press conference, fill in a crossword puzzle or take aConstitution quiz.Games Carry on Jumanji Theme     With a roll of a die, visitors to the Web site for "Jumanji" canmove across a virtual board game through three phases of challengingriddles, travel cards or fun and perilous games to qualify for Jumanjiprizes.      "Users will encounter the same sense of adventure the movieoffers," said Basel Dalloul, chairman and CEO of Magnet InteractiveGroup, which helped develop the page.  "This site invites movie goersto enjoy the Jumanji experience in an exciting original format plus achance to win great prizes," he said.     Six games on the site allow visitors a chance to win the Jumanjiprize.  The games include:     -- Bullseye!, in which the player plays a spunky monkey let loosein a kitchen where the object of the game is to target everything insight;     -- Spashot, in which the player becomes a jungle photographerwith only 12 exposures to take pictures of animals who rapidly appearand disappear into the jungle;     -- WebCrawl, a spiderweb maze where the gamer is a fly trying toescape the web without being eaten by the dreaded tarantula,     -- Gator Raid.

A recent survey found that PR agencies are much more likely to beon the Internet than corporate PR departments.  The survey, which wascompleted last month by Chicago PR agency DGPR, polled 115 PR agencyand corporate department chiefs.       Ninety-two percent of agency respondents said they could accessthe Internet, compared to 70 percent of corporate respondents.     However, in-house PR departments are more likely to design theircompanies' Web sites than are outside consultants; 40 percent ofcorporate respondents said they design Web sites compared to 25percent for agencies.     The survey suggests that, per-person, it costs agencies more toget online.  Agency heads pay 60 percent more per workstation to gainInternet access; in-house PR departments pay $1,207 compared to $2,020for agencies.       DGPR president Deborah Gordon says agencies may be gettingonline faster than corporations because agency owners can makestrategic investments in computers without time-consuming budgetapprovals.  But because they are not part of a large corporation,agency heads are paying a premium for equipment.

A sales tax on PR firm bills for their services appears isbecoming an issue again in New Jersey.  After becoming the target ofan audit by the Field Audit Branch of the New Jersey Division ofTaxation, Anne Klein & Associates (Marlton) last month sent an appealfor help to Public Relations Society of America members in New Jersey. Anne Klein, the firm's president, said several New Jersey firms haveagreed to provide financial support for legal appeals, or other formsof support--such as government relations--to help her firm's fightwith state auditors.     Klein said New Jersey authorities auditing her firm areattempting to collect a 6 percent sales tax and penalties going backthree years for both in-state and out-of-state clients.     The state's top auditing official last summer changed hisinterpretation of existing law, and concluded that language requiringtaxation of "advertising services" also covers public relationsservices, according to Joseph Dietz, president of ad/PR firm J. M.Kesslinger & Associates (Union).  Dietz heads a coalition of ad and PRfirms that have been working with New Jersey tax authorities to try todevelop clearer guidelines of what is taxable for both state auditorsand agencies.  The coalition also hopes to mount an effort to havetaxes on ad and PR services stricken from the law.     Current law puts New Jersey agencies at a disadvantage whencompeting with agencies from neighboring Pennsylvania and New York,which do not tax ad and PR services, Dietz said.

To counter the move by the larger bottlers, a group of smallspring water companies formed a new association, the National SpringWater Association, after the International Bottled Water Associationrefused to back them on labeling that would identify water as eitherspring water or well water.     Armed with information from scientists from the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey, thespring water association hoped to make the case to the public and tofederal authorities in charge of water labeling, that spring water wasinherently more pure than well water.  The NSWA also had access toconsumer research data, which indicated that, if given the choice,consumers preferred spring water over all other types of water,including well water.Announcement of Own Label     With federal authorities in the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationmoving slowly on a labeling decision, the NSWA decided to go aheadwith its own labeling program in conjunction with its PR firm,Fitzgerald Productions Inc. (Margate, Fla.).     A "gold seal" label was created that would identify to consumersthose waters whose producers had gone through an NSWA-designedcertification.  The unveiling of the program was used as a news hookto build visibility for NSWA's position among consumers and keygovernment officials.     A news release announcing the program was sent by mail and wireto about 1,000 print and broadcast media in early November, 1994. This was timed to raise public awareness in the weeks leading up to anexpected December decision by the Food and Drug Administrationregarding bottled water labeling.     Packets sent to many news media also included names of third-party experts that NSWA had cultivated, whom the media could call foroutside opinions on the merits of the labeling issue.     Follow-up calls by Fitzgerald resulted in a number of telephoneand in-person interviews with Jim Heaton, the head of NSWA.     The press release and media contact resulted in widespread mediacoverage.  Among the most significant:     -- a report by WTVJ-TV (Miami), which was sent around the nationon NBC's network feed;     -- appearances by NSWA representatives on two television talkshows, "The Susan Wornick Consumer Show" (Boston), and the "Issues andAnswers" program on Montgomery Cable TV in Washington, D.C.'s Marylandsuburbs (where most of the FDA offices are located).     Many smaller or consumer-interest magazines carried the story,and included information asking readers to contact governmentofficials and press for accurate spring water labeling.Lobbying the FDA     NSWA executives and member companies testified before the Foodand Drug Administration, providing information about the differencesbetween spring water and well water.  NSWA obtained permission fromscientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S.Geological Survey for their views on spring and well water to beincluded in NSWA testimony.     Ultimately, the FDA came out with a ruling that, on the surface,supported NSWA's position.  However, according to Elaine Fitzgerald,the ruling contains loopholes that appear to allow non-spring watercompanies to continue to label their water as spring water.  As aresult, the NSWA is continuing with its media and labeling campaign.

"The good news on this is the 'safeharbor' provision, which will allow executives to speak morefreely...in putting forward assessments of where you see thingsmoving."     It should put a damper on shareholder litigation, said DavidOlson, vice president of investor and public relations at HealthSystems International Inc..  "The rise of shareholder litigationreally did put an unwarranted muzzle on many companies' ability totalk about their conditions and their prospects," he said.     Olson gave much of the credit for the passage of the law to theNational Investor Relations Institute, which had lobbied and mountedgrassroots efforts for most of the year (PR NEWS, July 17).Provisions of the Measure     The new law's provisions will:-- make it harder to be sued if forecasts do not come to pass, byincluding a "safe harbor" that allows spokespersons to communicateforward-looking information--with the caveats that these are notguarantees, and could be affected by other factors;-- make it harder for plaintiffs to file cases, by requiring them toshow evidence that suggests that corporate insiders knew they werecommitting fraud;-- limit attorneys' fees, (which at times swallowed a major portion ofsettlements), and allow punishment if judges determine that they havefiled "frivolous" lawsuits.     The National Investor Relations Institute has mailed to members afive-page summary of the new law's implications.  Free copies areavailable to non-members by calling NIRI at 703/506-3570.(Bowater, 803/271-7733; Health Systems, 800/474-676.)Are Annuals Better When PR Exec Heads the Team?     Companies get better annual reports when their roster ofcorporate officers includes a PR executive, according to a recentstudy conducted for PR NEWS by annual report maven Sid Cato.     In an analysis of 1994 and 1995 annual reports, Cato, whopublishes a newsletter on annual reports and conducts a yearlyconference, found that just over 10 percent of the hundreds of annualshe reviewed listed a PR executive as an officer of the company.  Butthese annuals were markedly better, according to his analyses, whichare based on standard indicators related to depth of financialdisclosure, clarity, level of detail in the chairman's letter, etc.     Specifically, Cato found that:     -- about 14 percent of annuals by companies with PR officersreflected positively on companies (in terms of his indicators)compared to only 3 percent for other companies;     -- most of the reports by companies with PR officers included twofeatures that Cato regards as critical: a percentage-change columnwith the up-front financial highlights (57 percent had it), and anobvious theme on the annual's cover (all had it).     -- all reports by companies with PR officers met Cato'srequirements for "attractiveness," while only 3 percent of reportsoverall met his standard.     For other companies, only about one-quarter had the financialpercentage-change column, and just over one-half (55 percent) hadcover themes. (Cato, 616/344-2286.)
