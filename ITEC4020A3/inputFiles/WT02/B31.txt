It was time, they felt, for a bold experiment. Their mission was tofocus theenergies of the young company on the mutual life insurance business so it could capitalize ontheopportunities they saw ahead. The benefits of membership in a mutual society were spelled out in one of new YorkLife's firstadvertisements. "One of the peculiar advantages attending insurance with this company isthat all theassureds share annually in its profits and are interested in its success." The trustees ofthe companypledged that company funds would "be invested for the benefit and security of all the partiesinvolved." Underwriting American lives in the perilous mid-nineteenth century was a new game thathad to beinvented. By today's standards, it was an era of unusual risks and uncertainties. Thehazards ofpioneer life took a heavy toll, as did wars on the frontier, outbreaks of disease, poor waterand sewagesystems, and cities and towns made of wood that often burned to the ground, causing largelosses of life. Life insurance companies and agents in the nineteenth century faced a challenging task: creatingconsumer demand for a product that was largely unknown. Assigning a dollar value to humanlifeseemed irreligious to some. Others associated life insurance with gambling. Despite thepublic's lackof awareness regarding the need for life insurance and the difficulties of estimating thehazards ofhuman life, New York Life accumulated assets of $1 million during its first decade. Buildingandmaintaining a strong financial foundation allowed it to pay out another $1 million to policyholders andbeneficiaries during that decade.

The broader the coverage of thepopulation, the morefavorable the averages. In an age of primitive medicine and harsh everyday risks rangingfromcontaminated food to unsafe buildings, New York Life managed the risks by cultivating anin-houseability to assess risks that was second to none. In 1892, the era of "scientific" management was just beginning, and the trio of GeorgePerkins,Darwin Kingsley, and Thomas A. Buckner would lead the company in it. Perkins was given the daunting job of reorganizing the entire sales operation. Heupgraded thecompany's sales force and replaced the general agency system with a new marketing structure. Of all Perkins' innovations, creating a corps of professionally trained, full-time agents didthe most toadvance the reputation of the life insurance industry as a business on the same footing asbanking. Toimprove the quality of service to policy owners, to stem the widespread turnover in thebusiness and toeliminate the erratic sales performance of the less-dedicated agents, the company created anewmethod of compensation called "Nylic for Agents." Under this plan, an agent received a guaranteed lifetime monthly income after twentyyears ofservice, provided he did not enter the service of another life insurance company. Hislifetime monthlyincome was based on his sales production during those twenty years. The plan's deferredcompensation and old-age security elements were rare for any industry in 1895. With Chairman McCall's full encouragement, Perkins proceeded to select thebranchmanagers, who in turn recruited and supervised the activities of individual agents whosecontracts weremade directly with the company rather than with the intermediary general agent. McCall and Perkins took their inventiveness to other departments as well. In 1892, thecompanyastonished the industry by offering a policy that swept away all restrictions except theinsured'sobligation to pay the premium on time. Standard policies were then riddled with restrictiveclauses andexceptions, often to the dismay of hard-selling agents. The policy introduced by New York Life in 1892 removed all previous restrictions withrespect tooccupation, residence, travel lifestyles or manner of death. Also for the first time in1892, a lifeinsurance policy included a policy loan feature. To cement New York Life's intention toprovidecoverage, regardless of the circumstances, the company determined that after one year thepolicy wasincontestable. " . . . What may be called the Life Insurance Era began about 1845; what may be calledthe'Crusades' began about 1890." The results, said Kingsley, dwarfed any other businessundertaking. In1898, "The Great International Life Insurance Company" appeared on the company's letterheadand onits policies. New York Life had by then extended operations far beyond U.S. boundaries toeighty-threecountries, and on May 23, 1899, it reached $1 billion in policies in force. For almost halfa century, thecompany worked hard to create and broaden a global market for life insurance until war on anunprecedented scale in 1914 brought the crusade to an end.

New and faster equipment was designed to handle payroll,accounting,billing, sales analysis and other areas. By World War II, the leap was made into electronic equipment. ENIAC (ElectronicNumericalIntegrator and Calculator) was developed at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School ofElectricalEngineering by J. Presper Eckert and physicist Dr. John W. Mauchly. They eliminated the needformoving parts by adapting electronic circuits and using electronic pulses to flip vacuum tubeson and offlike switches, with the "on" and "off" states representing zeroes and ones, the roots ofcomputers'binary language. New York Life took delivery of its first modern computers in the 1950s - one from RCA andone fromIBM. Paternal management made everyone feel like a member of a big extended family. As aperquisite,the company acquired two employee vacation properties, located in the rural Bear Mountainregion ofNew York State about an hour's drive north of New York City. Camp Nylic, for male employeesandtheir families, offered cabins named after company officers. Women employees were housedseparately at Elm Valley Farm, twenty-five miles away. The rate charged for full room andboard was $1a day. Anyone sent to the camps for convalescence by the medical department got in free. One of the most conspicuous results of the company's prudent management was unveiled in1928 when the company moved into its new Manhattan Home Office at 51 Madison Avenue. In 1889, the first Madison Square Garden occupied the site. New Yorkers for the nextthirty yearsturned to the Garden for championship fights, operatic recitals, six-day bicycle races, horseshows anda potpourri of live entertainment. The cornerstone of New York Life's new Home Office was laid with appropriate ceremony onJune17, 1927. Architect Cass Gilbert, famous at the time for many structures - including theWoolworthBuilding, once New York's tallest and the U.S. Supreme Court Building - had prepared plans tobuild "aCathedral of Life Insurance," using the Salisbury Cathedral in England as the inspiration. In November1928, the entire office force from 346 Broadway moved into the new quarters, requiringpractically everypiece of moving equipment in the city for all the files and furniture. An opening-day speech by New York Life President Darwin P. Kingsley was broadcastnationwideover NBC. President Calvin Coolidge pressed a button in the White House that unfurled theUnitedStates flag in the lobby of the new building. For the life insurance industry, the downward plunge in the thirties was just asspectacular as theboom of the twenties. Yet New York Life, without taking elaborate preventive measures,preserved theassets of its policy owners. With no equities in its portfolio, it was able to exercisetight control over itsown destiny. Unlike many other life insurers, New York Life's receipts continued to exceeddisbursements. In 1933, the deepest year of the depression, the company met obligations of$366million and still managed to increase assets to over $2 billion.

By 1946, the company was readytoproceed with a long-range program of investing in owned and managed housing developments. In October 1949, the last of 3,000 families moved into Fresh Meadows, a 173-acre,self-containedcommunity of 10,000 people in Queens, New York. Built on a former golf course, Fresh Meadowscontained a department store, banks, a theater, doctors' offices, restaurants, fiftyspecialty shops, abowling center, a post office, and a school. All told, the housing effort was enormous. The company estimated that it had provided,in the fiveyears between 1946 and 1950, enough apartments and small homes for 300,000 people. Besidesproviding owned and managed housing in New York, New Jersey, and housing on a former slum siteinChicago, some $778 million was invested in more than 79,000 residential mortgage loans aroundthecountry, most of them for less than $10,000 each. New York Life also led the way in recognizing the need for new methods to financethousands ofmiles of superhighways, parkways, thruways, turnpikes, bridges, and tunnels as auto and trucktrafficincreased. The company proposed revenue bonds as an alternative to government borrowing,whichwould increase federal, state, and local taxes. For over a century, New York Life had confined its business to "ordinary" whole lifeinsurance for theindividual. In 1951, it was the world's largest in this category, with over 4 millionpolicies in force. During World War II, however, the inclusion of fringe benefits in labor contracts stimulatedthe growth ofgroup insurance. After the war, management-labor bargaining led to an almost universal useof grouplife and health insurance in multi-year contract packages. In the mid-1950s, the company positioned itself to become more of a financial servicescompanythan a life insurer. The notion of cradle to grave private insurance was revolutionary, andNew York Lifeprepared to meet the ever-growing needs of the expanding nation. While new products and services were being developed, the Home Office decided itstraditionalbusiness needed a thorough shaking-up as well. Assumptions, policy language, and premiumswerenot keeping pace with the rapid changes of the national economy and demographics; thecontractscustomers were signing as the company entered the 1950s were nearly the same as those theirgrandfathers had signed decades ago. When President Devereaux C. Josephs implemented a new product line, every other biginsurer triedto follow New York Life's lead. But New York Life agents had the pioneering advantage. Theywere firstin the market with products specifically designed for an insurance-buying public that wasbecomingmore value and cost-conscious. Everyone seemed to be going up a notch or two on the economicladder in one of the swiftest and most thoroughgoing changes in history.

Yet thepoint isworth making that the series of episodes recounted here, the people, the product developmentand theevolution of sales, management and electronic systems, took place in an environment ofunalloyedAmerican optimism. While the United States had diverse view points on almost everything fromeducation to entertainment, practically everyone felt that the unique American democraticsystem wouldprovide a better and better standard of living for all. The great American boom became astandard partof life, no more surprising than Detroit's ads plugging the two-car family, or each family'sdream of thethree-bedroom suburban home. The Keogh plan, named after a U.S. congressman from Brooklyn, was enacted in 1962,makingtax-free private pension funding almost universal in the United States. In the expandingworld ofsavings, "investing for growth" had become as legitimate and desirable as "investing forincome." Thenew mindset created increased competition between different sectors of the financial servicesindustry. In the midst of an increasingly competitive climate, the life insurance industry seemedto be thriving. The number of life insurance companies grew by the hundreds in the 1960s and 1970s. TheInstituteof Life Insurance's surveys showed that 85 percent of American families had some sort of lifeinsurance coverage; in more than half the families, all members of the household wereinsured. Butthe percentage of disposable income spent on life insurance was declining every year, andthereseemed to no way to stop it. A strategic move into an expanding market like equities seemedinevitable. The exciting actuarial breakthrough made by Charles Sternhell, John Fraser, and WalterMiller in 1969opened the door to the move into equities. Their discovery that the premium basis for avariable policycould be the same as for a fixed-dollar policy brought them industry-wide acclaim. The rest of the industry created products from the New York Life formula, but thecompany did notenter the business until 1983, when it became possible to pay regular commissions on variablelife. Inretrospect, it was the best possible decision, and not just for the protection of the agencyforce. Equities- and the new variable life policies - did not perform well in the seventies.

In 1982, thecompanysmoothly completed a $1.6 billion restructuring of its pension fund portfolio, whichmeasurablyincreased the quality of its security holdings. This immense transaction, achieved with thehelp oftrading experts at Salomon Brothers, involved the sale of 104 issues and the purchase of 57others. Computer simulation prior to the actual event made the transaction go through without aglitch. The stock market crash of 1987 prompted another major shift in investment strategy. InOctober1987, the stock market lost twenty-two percent of its value in a day after five fat yearsduring which theDow Jones industrial average roared from below 1000 to 2700. New York Life saw the value ofits bondportfolio rise sharply as the stock market tumbled. Competition for consumers' dollars brought intense challenges to New York Life'sindividualinsurance operations. More and more Americans were making a distinction between theprotectionafforded by insurance and the investment potential of permanent, cash value insurance, whichtheyviewed as inferior to CDs and other investments. The logic of this comparison seemed todictate "buyterm and invest the difference." Anyone combing through the $8 trillion financial-services world in the late 1980s for ablue-chip firmwith the ability to tailor products to the needs of all sorts of individuals and groups wouldfind the searchdaunting. Credit ratings systems were so lax, by design or otherwise, the resultinginformation couldreally turn out to be misinformation. Some straight talk was needed about the value of safety, security and conservatism inthe investmentfield. "The Company You Keep" slogan was first seen by American consumers September 17,1989, ina New York Life TV commercial. Plenty of investors had been burned in the biggest stock market crash of all time justtwo yearsearlier. In a culture of seemingly permanent change, when beliefs as well as institutionswerecrumbling everywhere, a simple message had appeal: good, old, reliable New York Life was assoundas ever.

The official demographic measurement of household income in 1990 provided by the U.S.government was a bit shocking. Not all boats had risen in the 1980s. In 1990, according tothe IRS,some ten percent of U.S. households had incomes over $75,000. That was the good news. Buttheremaining 90 percent were hardly awash in wealth. The majority of households, three-quartersof thetotal, had incomes under $50,000. And a remarkable forty-two percent were living by the skinof theirteeth. Just as the government had plunged into deficit financing, so had individuals. In a drive to find new avenues of distribution, New York Life created the BrokerageDepartment in1992. Its focus is and has been independent producers who serve customers in the top one totwopercent of the wealthiest households in the United States and large corporate clients. The experience with the brokerage business encouraged New York Life to seek otherdistributionopportunities. In a departure from the way it traditionally sells products, the companyannounced aunique 10-year direct marketing opportunity in April 1994. The American Association ofRetiredPersons (AARP), a 33-million-member organization dedicated to addressing the needs of personsaged 50 and older, selected New York Life Insurance Company from numerous competitors tounderwrite, market and administer a newly designed life insurance program for its members. In 1984, New York Life expanded its investments focus to include the independent activemanagement of stocks and bonds by purchasing MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, ablue-chip, active moneymanagerbased in Manhattan. In 1987, Monitor Capital Advisors was created as an independentsubsidiary ofNew York Life focusing on the passive, quantitative strategies of stocks and bonds. In 1988,GreystoneRealty Corporation, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, was founded to provide independentprofessional management of equity real estate. In order to compete effectively in the ever-expanding defined contribution market, thecompany madea major acquisition that year, buying a Boston-based benefits consulting and administrativefirm, nowrenamed New York Life Benefit Services. New York Life now has the capabilities to compete as a"full-service"provider in the 401(k) market. The company had reentered the international life insurance market in 1988 with theacquisition of alife insurance company in Hong Kong. That year, it formed New York Life Worldwide. Theinternationalre-entry continued in 1989 with the acquisition of Windsor Group, a life insurance firm basedinEngland. Three years later, the Gresham Group, another British life insurer, was acquired. Ever since its founding, New York Life managers and agents have been conscious that theactions ofthe company are often far reaching. The character, and perhaps the stability, of Americansociety havebeen affected by organizations that try to look beyond the statistics to act as goodcorporate citizens. "[I describe] life insurance using the Latin sui generis." Hohn continues, "Sui generismeans 'uniqueunto itself.' And life insurance is unique unto itself. It's the only way that you can havea person whojust gets married and has the first baby or two and provide for them right then and there bypaying apremium on a life insurance policy. That's invaluable. That's unique. And that's one ofthe reasonswhy we are in business - to provide those benefits. "Suppose there weren't life insurance - how would you arrange for your own family? Weprovide avery basic tenet that we all rely upon. We do a lot of other things but that's our corecompetency, and wedo it, I think, very well. And so we're going to be around for another 150 years - and more. You can count on it." New York Life Benefit Services Click here to go to the New York Life Benefit Services web site.

Stagnating consumer spending, along with sharp declines in housing, government purchases, and net exports were offset by a surge in business investment and inventory accumulation. In the fourth quarter, growth should remain sluggish due to a slower rate of inventory accumulation, but final demand is set to pick up again. With real disposable income up about 3.0 percent from a year ago and the unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent from 5.6 percent, consumer confidence is near a seven-year high. Under these conditions, the recent decline in bond yields and the surging stock market should encourage a revival in housing as well as a good Christmas shopping season. For the second half of the year, real GDP growth is expected to average about 2.1 percent -- well below the first half average of 3.3 percent and slightly below the economy's long-term non-inflationary growth potential. Once the inventory correction is over, however, the economy should have the momentum to maintain above trend growth until it is slowed by the Federal Reserve. For the year as a whole, economic activity should be up a moderate 2.3 percent, and 1997 is expected to show a stronger 2.9 percent increase, with help from strengthening economies in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Mexico. Inflation still subdued, but set for upward creep After six years of economic expansion, there are still few signs of accelerating inflation. However, the unemployment rate has fallen well below levels previously associated with rising inflation, and wage rates have begun to accelerate again. So far, decelerating benefit costs have offset most of the wage acceleration, but this cannot continue indefinitely. The current slowdown has been just in time to relieve these emerging inflationary pressures, but as the economy picks up speed again next year, they are likely to reemerge. Any slack created by the slowdown will be quickly eliminated as growth picks up again, and more definitive inflationary pressures will emerge. After rising 2.8 percent in 1995, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) should be up 3.0 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 1997. Fed tightening postponed Following three easing moves, the Federal Reserve has left monetary policy unchanged since February and is not likely to begin tightening credit conditions again until some time next year. There appears to be increasing political pressure to wait and see how long the economic slowdown lasts or how low unemployment can fall before inflation picks up again. It may be that the rate of unemployment that sparks inflation has indeed shifted downward somewhat in recent years due to demographics and other factors, but as it becomes clear that the unemployment rate has resumed its downward movement, the Fed is likely to begin a series of tightening moves. Bond yield up-trend to resume Long-term bond yields have declined from their recent highs in response to the Federal Reserve's decisions not to tighten monetary policy at its September and November FOMC meetings and economic statistics that appear to have justified these decisions. Post-election promises to continue budget deficit reduction efforts also have helped. As the economy picks up again next year, however, the up-trend in interest rates, both short- and long-term, should resume and continue until the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy again. This is likely to require a flattening of the yield curve, with short-term interest rates rising faster than long-term rates. Ideal equity market conditions not likely to continue When the economy is near full employment, too much growth is just as bad for the stock market as too little. So far this year, the economy has been just right. The bull market for equities has been driven by the continuation of moderate growth, strong earnings gains, and low inflation. These ideal conditions are likely to change next year. While earnings should remain relatively good, economic growth may look a little too strong, inflation will be creeping up again, bond yields will be rising, and the Federal Reserve will be tightening. As the economic expansion continues into its seventh year, there will be increasing concerns about the emergence of late business cycle pressures on profitability and the arrival of the next recession.

Your goal may be to fund your children's college educations, to protect your family during your working years, or to guarantee your own retirement security. These things won't happen by accident. You must plan. You need to know what you want to achieve and then map out a strategy that will help you achieve it. The good news: You don't have to do it alone. Your New York Life insurance agent does more than just sell insurance policies. He or she is a professional problem solver who can help you identify the most cost-effective products to help you meet your financial objectives. Your New York Life agent provides a full range of services. These include working with you to: Review your individual situation and personal objectives. Perhaps your needs are so clear that life and health insurance can be determined after a few minutes of conversation. Or it may quickly become apparent that nothing short of a full-blown, detailed "fact finding" session is required, going beyond such basic vital statistics as birth dates, income assets, etc. Why is it important to probe and ask questions? Three reasons: First, your situation and needs are different from those of your neighbors. Your agent needs to understand those differences. Second, money is not a goal in and of itself; it is merely the means to an end. (Your goal may be a comfortable, secure retirement. However, the means to achieve that, for example, might be a retirement nest egg of $600,000.) Finally, the more your agent knows about you, the more precise and on-target will be the recommendations you receive. As a result, your agent may take some time to discuss - and even appear to be a bit nosy about - your hopes, dreams and objectives ... the things that really matter to you. By the way, all information will remain strictly confidential. Analyze and review your needs. As needed, your agent will work with you to identify and prioritize your objectives, then help establish benchmark goals. This is important because we live in a world in which there are unlimited resources. People often fail to achieve objectives because they try to accomplish too much at once, or they don't attach specific deadlines to their goals. For instance, you may have a desire to retire in comfort, make sure your children are able to graduate from college debt-free, plus vacation in the Caribbean every winter. But your resources may say that you cannot do it all. Your New York Life agent can work with you and help you focus on what's most important to you. Together, you may find it helpful to break down these goals into quantifiable objectives: accumulate $600,000 by age 65; have a college fund of $40,000 in 15 years; set aside $10,000 each year for vacationing. Then you can look at available resources and decide which goals are realistic, which need to be adjusted and scaled down, and which simply must be abandoned. Develop and implement a strategy to help you achieve your goals. Based on the information you share and the goals and means you establish, you'll receive specific recommendations on where life and health insurance products can help. Coordinate your financial activities. If desired by you, your agent can also serve as a quarterback for you and the other members of your team of advisors. Monitor progress, provide ongoing service as your needs and situation change over time. This is crucial. Planning is not a one-shot deal. Strategies need to be adjusted periodically. Your agent will work with you over the years to help keep your program on track with your changing needs. By the way, there is no charge for advice, planning or ongoing service provided by your New York Life agent. Your Role: It's a crucial one. Your agent cannot do it alone. It's a two-way street. The key to getting maximum value from your relationship with your agent is communication and candor. Do the following: Get acquainted. It's recommended that you contact your agent and arrange a meeting to discuss the full extent of available services, and to review your situation. Educate your agent. Don't expect a mind reader. Your agent may anticipate many of your needs, but will not assume anything. That's why it's so important that you be candid in providing information. Educate yourself. At the same time, you too should be sure to ask a lot of questions. Be nosy. Ask for details and explanations about recommendations and how certain plans may work. Remember, the only dumb question is the one that isn't asked. Make it a team effort. Work together. Listen carefully to the recommendations, but remember - all decisions are yours. Make sure you're comfortable with the outcome. Recommendation: Contact your New York Life insurance agent today. Arrange an appointment. There's no cost or obligation.

Every successful business has at least one executive and, often, more than oneindividual whosecontribution tothe business is invaluable. Naturally, you value their contribution and want toprovide these employeeswith anadded incentive package that can help tie them to your business. One such incentiveis an ExecutiveBonus Plan.An Executive Bonus Plan, also known as a Section 162 plan, is a tax deductible wayfor you, theemployer, toselectively provide life insurance and supplemental retirement benefits to yourvalued executives. Benefits to the Employer An Executive Bonus Plan offers an employer the following features and benefits: Tax deductible. Covers select executives. Does not require IRS approval. Simple to create. By funding with life insurance, the executive has an added incentive to staywith the company, oftenreferred toas "Golden Handcuffs." The amount of life insurance coverage on select executives can vary. Benefits to the Owner/Employee As owner, you also have the right to apply for and own a life insurance policy onyour life. You own the policy. If the corporation's tax bracket is higher than the owner/employee, moreafter-tax dollars will beavailable topay the premium. Death benefit proceeds provide a source of income to your family upon death. IF SELECT EXECUTIVE DIES Benefits to the Employee The select executive will receive many valuable benefits from this type of plan: Executive owns the life insurance and any cash values. Personal insurance needs are met with business dollars. The policy's cash value can be used to supplement retirement income. Death benefit proceeds may be income tax free. Death benefit proceeds can be used for estate settlement costs or as a sourceof funds for a buy-sellagreement. How Does an Executive Bonus Plan Work? In this arrangement, an executive applies for and owns a personal life insurancepolicy. The employerpays the keyexecutive's life insurance premiums, either directly to the insurance company or asa bonus to theexecutive. Inmost cases, the premiums are deductible to the company as a business expense. Note: Although the premiums are included in the executive's currentincome, the deathbenefitmay be income taxfree.

But, have you considered whatwouldhappento your business and family should you unexpectedly die or become disabled? Do your heirs have experience operating the business on a day-to-day basis? Would your heirs be forced to sell the business? Would your heirs receive a fair price? Would the IRS seek a higher valuation for your business? These are difficult questions to answer. You owe it to yourself and your family toprotectyour years ofhard work. At New York Life, we are dedicated to meeting your personal andfinancial goals.Throughproper planning, you can secure the continuation of your business and the financialsecurityof yourheirs. How Can You Protect Your Business and Family? The Buy-Sell Agreement When examining different strategies, it is important to select one that insures asmoothtransition ofownership and protects your family's financial future. A buy-sell agreement canhelp youaccomplishthis goal. A buy-sell agreement is a contract among business owners. At the loss of an owner,thebusinessinterest is transferred according to the terms of this contract. The other owner(s)areobligated topurchase the deceased's business interest and the deceased's heirs are obligated tosell. Just lookat what a buy-sell agreement can do: Your Heirs: Are free of business worries and guaranteed to receive a fair price for thesale of thebusinessinterest. May help avoid some of the delays associated with probate. Surviving Owners: Will not have to worry about new and possibly unwanted partners. Know the purchase price of the business beforehand. Remain in good standing with clients and creditors through a smooth transitionofownership.Simply put, a properly funded buy-sell agreement will benefit your family,surviving ownersandcreditors. Methods of Funding Available Option 1: Wait and Pay Cash In this option, surviving owner(s) use cash at the death of a co-owner to fund thebuy-sellagreement.But, several drawbacks to this method exist. At death, funds may not be readily available for payment. A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow? Will a savings plan be depleted to pay for unforeseen expenses? Accumulation of cash may cause an accumulated earnings tax problem. Option 2: Wait and Borrow Funds In this option, surviving owner(s) borrow funds, usually bank loans, at the deathof aco-owner to fundthe buy-sell agreement. But, much like the first option, this method has drawbacks. Future growth may be slowed due to an increase in expenses (repayment of loan). Death of an owner may cause sales to decline, compounding the problem. Death of an owner may make it difficult to receive a loan. A surviving owner may have to sign for funds, exposing personal assets. Surviving owners pay dollar for dollar plus interest for the deceased'soutstanding shareof thebusiness. Option 3: Insurance: The Smart Choice Purchasing insurance can be the most cost effective funding option for a buy-sellagreement.Usinginsurance as a funding vehicle will provide the following benefits: Immediate availability of proceeds when death or disability occurs. The funds used to buy the deceased's share are purchased for pennies on thedollar. Death benefit proceeds are generally income tax free. Premiums may be significantly lower than the cost of repaying the loaninterest. The Types of Buy-Sell Plans Available What Will A Buy-Sell Agreement Accomplish? Creates a market for the stock. Sets a predetermined price at which owners agree to buy and sell their shares. Provides money to fund the plan. Cross Purchase Plan In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with one another. To fund this plan,each ownerappliesfor, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on the other owners. When an owner dies: Life insurance proceeds are paid to the surviving owner(s) income tax free. Proceeds are used to purchase the heirs' business interest. Heirs receive an agreed-upon payment for their business interest. Surviving owner(s) receive an increased cost basis for the acquired businessinterest. Entity Plan In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with the business. The businessapplies for,owns, andpays the life insurance premiums on each owner. When an owner dies: The business will receive the life insurance proceeds. The business uses the proceeds to purchase the deceased's business interest. Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for their business interest. Stock Redemption Plan A stock redemption plan is an agreement between the business and its shareholders.Thecorporationapplies for, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on each shareholder. When a shareholder dies: The corporation will receive the life insurance proceeds. The corporation will use the proceeds to purchase the shareholder's outstandingstock. Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for the shareholder's outstanding stock.

But have you considered whatwouldhappen ifyour key employees died unexpectedlyor became disabled? Key employees are the foundation of a successful business. They are businessowners, salesdirectors, CFOs or any other individuals who are sources of leadership,profitability, andwould beextremely difficult to replace. Unless the proper steps are taken, the death ordisability ofyour keyemployees can be devastating to the financial well-being of your company. The Solution: Key Employee Protection New York Life can provide you with strategies that will help continue your businessin theevent of a keyemployee's death or disability. Funding a plan to protect key employees will giveyourbusiness theadditional funds it needs at a difficult time to: Hire and train replacements. Replace an employee's contribution to profits. Maintain the confidence of clients and creditors. Funding Options Option 1: Cash or Sinking Fund In this option, a business establishes a savings plan, much like a bank account, toprotectitself fromthe death or disability of its key employees. At death, the cash in the savingsplan is usedas a sourceof funding. Unfortunately, this method has several drawbacks: A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow? A savings plan may be depleted to pay for other expenses. Accumulated cash could cause an accumulated earnings problem. The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar, thus depleting the amount ofcash thatcould be used elsewhere. Option 2: Borrowing Funds In this option, funds are borrowed, usually a bank loan, to replace the financialloss causedby a keyemployee's death or disability. Drawbacks of this option include: A potential slow-down in business growth due to additional loan repayments. A reduction in future profits may occur because of the loan repayment. The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar plus interest. The company's credit may be adversely affected due to greater debt. Option 3: Insurance: The Cost Effective Alternative Purchasing life and/or disability insurance on your key employees is a costeffective way tosafeguardyour business and minimize the impact of a key employee's death or disability.It will provide your business with the following advantages: Funding with insurance is easy to administer. Funding costs pennies on the dollar. Funds are available even if death or disability occurs tomorrow. Although the premiums are not deductible, the insurance proceeds at death aregenerallyreceivedincome tax free to the business. SETTING UP THE PLAN The business applies for a life insurance policy on the life of a key employee. Thebusinessis theowner and beneficiary of the policy.

"We recognized that young families often have limited resources but stillrequire protection," said Mike Gallo, senior vice president of the Company'sIndividual Life Department. "Spectra Life will provide flexible, neededinsurance protection at a reasonable cost to a segment of the populationthat studies show is often underinsured." Indeed, New York Life believes Spectra Life is the ideal insurance packagefor growing families headed by individuals between the ages of 20 and 45with an income between $30,000 and $75,000 - a market that representsapproximately 14.4 million households in the United States. 1 Spectra Life offers growing families three different options of lifeinsurance protection designed to provide insurance coverage at a premiumcost that can be, in some cases, up to 60 percent less than a traditionalwhole life policy. The options are as follows: Spectra 1 - offers families a 25 percent whole life and 75 percent term insurance mix that maintains a level of cost for a five-year period. In addition, customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance portion of the coverage into cash value whole life. Spectra 2 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life and term life insurance that maintains a level cost for a five-year period. In addition, customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance portion of the coverage into cash value whole life. Spectra 3 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life insurance with a Dividend Option Term rider and the Option to Purchase Paid-Up Additions rider. This blend maximizes insurance coverage and eventually replaces the term insurance with paid-up additional insurance. "We believe New York Life's Spectra Life plans will give young families theability to purchase insurance when their needs are greatest - at a loweconomical cost - and to allow them to increase their coverage as theirneeds mature," added Gallo.

Our Commitment to Our Customers 1894 - New York Life becomes the first United Statescompany to issuelife insurance to women at the same rates as men Susan B. Anthony, the 19th-century American social reformer, believedstrongly that ifwomen were to achieve political equality, they had to be financiallyindependent. She wasone of the first women to own an insurance policy, and her insurer was New YorkLife. 1896 - New York Life becomes the first company toinsurepeople withphysical impairments or hazardous occupations Using a scientific basis to evaluate people with substandard risks, NewYork Life wasable to issue policies to people previously considered uninsurable. Thisinnovation --praised by experts at the time as the single greatest advancement in lifeinsurance -- enabled millions of people (who in the past would have been declined) to qualifyfor lifeinsurance and protect their families' financial future. Adding Value and Flexibility to Life Insurance 1860 - New York Life becomes the first company to issuepoliciescontaining a "non-forfeiture option" Before any state law required it, New York Life developed thenon-forfeiture option,which formed the foundation of guaranteed cash values found in policies today. This featureenables a policy to remain in force even when a premium payment isinadvertently missed. Today, policyowners have various ways to apply cash values to prevent theirpolicies fromlapsing. Typically, the options include automatic premium loan, extended terminsurance, andreduced paid-up insurance. 1892 - New York Life becomes the first major company toissue policieswith an incontestable clause To give policyowners even more peace of mind, New York Life sets a timelimit on theinsurer's right to dispute a policy's validity based on material misstatementsmade in theapplication. 1920 - New York Life becomes the first company to issueapolicy with adisability benefit that presumes total disability to be permanent after apredeterminednumber of months New York Life has long been a leader in liberal insurance concepts.

Our Focus on Quality Service 1892 - New York Life becomes the first insurer toorganizea BranchOffice System To provide the highest possible level of service to our expanding customerbase, theCompany established an integrated network of General Offices across thecountry.

Establishing asoundfinancial plan can be a key to easing that burden and allow your children the education theydeserve. Putting a Foundation Beneath Your Children's Dreams All parents have big dreams for their children. They hope one day they'll grow up to becomesomeonetruly great - the President of the U.S., a doctor who finds a miracle cure, a concertpianist. Thesedreams can be obtained with the help of a college education. How Much Does College Cost? Most people look back on their college years with great fondness - and many look ahead totheirchildren's education with some anxiety. With costs so high, how can I afford to send my kidsto college?According to 1995-1996 College Board statistics, a college education currently averages about$37,000 for a four-year degree at a public college, and over $79,000 at a four-year privateschool.Looking at the Ivy League? Four years of tuition, fees, room and board now costs about$100,000 atelite schools such as Harvard and Yale. And costs keep rising. The College Board says thattheaverage annual increase in tuition at private universities during the 1980s was about 11%.Thesenumbers can strike fear into the hearts of parents of college-bound children. Sure, the everrising costsof college can be a challenge, but it is one that can be met. Early preparation can help makeit easierfor everyone concerned. How Much Will You Need To Save? If your child is age 1: It will take a $434 invested each month for 17 years to pay for a college education at aprivateuniversity. If your child is age 10: It will take a $876 invested each month for 8 years to pay for a college education at aprivateuniversity.

No consideration ismade fortaxes, sales charges, or any other fees and expenses. Here Are Some Tips on Getting a Handle on College Funding: Pre-Pay Tuition - Some state universities have set up innovative programswhere college expensesmay be paid in installments over many years, prior to attending the school. This may be aconvenientway to meet expenses, but it takes the choice of school away from your child. What if yourchild doesnotwant to attend the state university? This could pose a problem. Borrowing - These days, most people borrow at least a portion of the moneyneeded to cover collegeexpenses. You may want your children to look for student loans with special lower rates andrepaymentterms for college. However, repaying a large loan for many years after graduation can be a burden for some recent graduates. Tapping into your401(k)plan may be an option, but you may want to take a loan rather than a withdrawal to avoid taxconsequences. Of course, a loan will impede the potential growth of your retirement nest egg. Financial Aid - There are billions of dollars available each year inscholarships, grants, and work studyprograms. Financial aid to middle income families may be tough to come by, but with theshrunkencollege age population, some student-hungry universities are more willing to offer generousfinancialaid packages. It's certainly worth contacting your child's high school and prospectivecollege financialaid office to see if you're eligible. The Team Approach - With the seemingly overwhelming cost, it may be mostpractical to financeschool through many sources such as your personal savings, student loans, financial aid, even apart-time jobfor your child. Once in school, your child might want to look into paid internships thatprovide valuableexperience and help pay the bills. Every bit will help, but the bulk may still have to comefrom moneyyouput away over the years - so it's essential to make the most of your savings and investments. The Key to College Funding Start saving now! There's no better time than the present to begin accumulating funds forfuture collegecosts. Below are some tips: Put time on your side - If your children are young, or you don't havechildrenyet, you can put the powerof time to work for you. The sooner you start, the better, letting the wonder of compoundinterest helpbuild a nice college fund. Pay yourself first - Systematically set aside a fixed amount at a regularintervalthat you can comfortablyafford. You may be able to have this done automatically through bank drafting and payrolldeduction.Speak to your financial institution and payroll department to set up these convenient savingsmethods. Use tax advantages - You can try to maximize earnings and minimize taxesthrough severaltax-advantaged strategies. Investing in tax-free municipal bonds or bond funds, setting up atrust, andmaking a gift under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act are three ways to possibly lower the taxbite. Consultyour tax advisor and attorney regarding these approaches. Don't put all your eggs in one basket - Diversification is a key to reducingpotential risk. Dividing yourmoney among different financial vehicles may help protect against loss and increase thepotential forcompetitive returns. If your children are still in diapers and you have a long time horizon,you may wantto consider financial products that may offer the potential for greater returns to complementtraditionalbank products.

Permanent life insurance products, such as whole life and universallife, offercash value accumulation in addition to their essential financial protection.

Are Pension Plans Too Complicated For SmallBusinesses? Simplified Employee Pension Plan Ideas From The Company You Keep Owners of small businesses agree that a retirement plan can do a lot for a growing company.Findingone with features that your business needs, such as tax advantages, low cost, and minimalpaperwork,can be challenging. Look no further than a Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP). A SEP plan is an easy way to make contributions toward youremployees' retirement income - and your own. Through a SEP, you take a tax deduction for contributions you make directly to youremployees' IRAs.Meanwhile, these contributions are excluded from employees' gross incomes. Since employeeshandle their own IRAs, you pay benefits directly into their accounts instead of operating apension planof your own. Your contributions are also completely discretionary, and you can change themfrom year toyear. Even if you've missed the year-end deadline that applies to most qualified plans, you canstill establisha SEP for last year - and get the tax deduction. Thanks to the tax deductibility of contributions, the net cost of installing and running aSEP can be zeroor may even create a positive cash flow for many business owners. The Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP): Tax-Free, Form-Free, Hassle-Free...Completely Stress-Free You may find a SEP most attractive for what it doesn't have: No annual IRS or Department of Labor filings; No funding until your company's tax filing date; No income taxes on contributions; No required contributions from year to year; No complicated plan documentation; No complex record keeping or expensive administration. A SEP means no longer trying to accommodate an expensive, labor-intensive pension plan designed for a large company. A SEP is a cost-effective and flexible program, packed with employeeadvantagesand the flexibility a small company needs. You can: Choose from a wide variety of investment options; Offer a companion plan (a Salary Reduction SEP [SARSEP]) that enables employeesto makepre-tax contributions, just like a 401(k); Design eligibility criteria that make the most sense for your company.

They're both quality financial tools. If you're debating whether the best place foryourmoney is acertificate of deposit (CD) or deferred annuity, the answer depends upon yourindividualfinancialsituation and investment objectives. Both CDs and deferred annuities are savings vehicles used by individuals toaccumulatewealth.However, these two products are quite different; each has its own unique strengthsand uses.For thesake of comparison, let's look at two similar versions of these products - anindividuallyowned,non-tax qualified bank CD and an individually owned, non-tax qualified singlepremiumdeferred annuityearning an annually renewable fixed rate of return. Review the list of objectivesandidentify those whichare most important to you. This will help determine which of these two products -CD ordeferredannuity - is best suited for your needs at this time. Objectives Safety of Principal: Both CDs and deferred annuities areconsidered low-riskinvestments. CDs aregenerally issued by banks and, in most cases, are insured by the Federal DepositInsuranceCorporation (FDIC) for up to $100,000 per depositor. Should the bank fail, theFDICguarantees CDs upto this amount. Deferred annuities, on the other hand, are issued by insurance companies and arenot insuredby theU.S. government. They are backed in their entirety by the financial strength of theissuinginsurancecompany, regardless of the amount. Before purchasing an annuity however, you shouldmake suretheissuing insurance company is financially sound. You can determine financialstability byrequesting thefindings of independent rating companies such as Moody's, A.M. Best, Standard &Poor's andDuff & Phelps. Short-Term Accumulation: When deciding between a CD and adeferredannuity, your investmenthorizon should be a key factor. Your investment horizon is the amount of time youneed tosave for aspecific goal. For short-term goals, such as a down payment on a home, a new car oravacation, a CDmay prove to be a better choice for you. In most instances, you can select amaturity datefor your CDthat corresponds to your time horizon. Maturity periods can be as short as onemonth or aslong asseveral years. Long-Term Accumulation: On the other hand, a deferred annuity isgenerallythe product of choice forthe long haul. Deferred annuities are designed to help accumulate money forretirement or toprotectfunds already saved up once you've reached retirement. They can even be used toprovide alegacy foryour heirs. In later years, a deferred annuity also provides more flexibility foraccessingyour money. Interest Return: CDs offer a guaranteed rate of return for aspecifiedperiod oftime. Interest rates willvary depending on current market conditions and the length of time to maturity.Generally,the shorterthe period of time to maturity, the lower the rate. There is no guaranteed minimumforrenewal rates.With a deferred annuity, a guaranteed interest rate is locked in for an initialperiod,usually one to threeyears. After that, interest rates may be adjusted periodically, generally eachyear. Becauseannuities arelong-term vehicles, their interest rates tend to be higher than comparable CDs. Deferred annuities also offer a guaranteed minimum interest rate. Regardless ofmarketconditions, theannuity will pay at least the minimum guaranteed rate established at the time ofpurchase. Inaddition,some companies offer a "bailout" rate to protect against excessive year-to-yearratefluctuations. Tax Savings: If taxes are a concern, a deferred annuity may be abetteroptionfor several reasons: Earnings on CDs are taxable in the year the interest is earned even if you don'ttake themoney out. Withdeferred annuities, on the other hand, earnings accumulate free of currenttaxation. Earningsinside anannuity are not treated as taxable income until they are withdrawn. This allowsmore of yourmoney towork harder towards achieving your long-term goals and gives you a measure ofcontrol overwhen youpay taxes and how much you pay. This tax deferral feature is one of the greatestadvantagesof deferredannuities. As you can see from the chart below, when saving for the long term it makes goodinvestmentsense tohave the power of tax deferral on your side. Keep in mind that withdrawals from theearningsportion of adeferred annuity are taxable and, if you're under age 59 1/2, these earnings may besubjectto a 10% taxpenalty. *Hypothetical rate used for illustrative purposes only.

Deferred annuities may also help reduce or eliminate the taxes on your SocialSecuritybenefits. Byleaving your money in a deferred annuity you can reduce your taxable income,keeping it belowthe levelwhere you would begin to owe taxes on your Social Security benefits. But with CDs,yourinterestearnings count in the calculation to determine how much of your Social Securitybenefits willbe taxed -even if you don't withdraw the earnings. As much as 85% of your Social Securitybenefitscould end upsubject to taxation. At death, the annuity's account value will be paid directly to your namedbeneficiary(ies),avoiding thecosts and delays associated with the probate process. This is not the case with aCD, whichisincluded in your estate. When purchasing a deferred annuity, look for one thatdistributesthe fullaccount value to beneficiaries. Some companies apply surrender charges on deathbenefitproceeds. Liquidity: If you need access to the funds in a CD prior to thematuritydate, youmay pay an interestpenalty ranging from 30 days' to six months' interest. Of course, you can limityour exposuretosurrender penalties by investing in several CDs with staggered maturity dates. A deferred annuity also provides you with access to funds should the need arise.Mostcompanies willgive you the flexibility to withdraw a portion of your deferred annuity's accountvalue,usually 10% eachyear, without a company-imposed surrender charge. Withdrawals from deferredannuities can bemadein response to a one time cash need or set up systematically to respond to acontinuous need.In fact,most deferred annuities offer the opportunity to systematically withdraw funds on amonthly,quarterly,semi-annual or annual basis. Keep in mind that deferred annuities are designed to build your retirement nestegg.Withdrawals ofearnings prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. Plus, mostinsurers assessasurrender charge if the contract is terminated during the first several years. Distribution Options at Maturity: When a CD reaches its maturity,you cantakethe CD's lump sum valuein cash, renew the CD for the same or different maturity period or examine otherinvestmentalternatives(such as a deferred annuity). In a deferred annuity you may elect to withdraw your money in a lump sum or you maywant toselect alifetime income option, which will provide you with a consistent flow of incomethat youcannot outlive.Or, you can simply elect to let your funds accumulate until a need arises. These are just a few of the factors to consider when making your selection betweena CD and adeferred annuity. Depending upon your investment horizon, you may want to allocatea portionof fundsto a CD to cover short-term needs and a portion to a deferred annuity for the longterm.

It'simportant that thefuturefinancial strength of these nonprofit organizations is secure. They face thedilemma ofincreased demandfor services in the wake of reduced government support and overflowing operationalcosts. New York Life offers hope. Charitable Adjustable Life (CAL), a specially designedlifeinsurance plan,underwritten by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), can helpsecureendowment funds for the future. Charitable Adjustable Life is Here to Help CAL can help ensure the well-being of individual nonprofit organizations bycreating a poolof moniesfor futureefforts. CAL is a simple permanent life insurance policy with competitive interestcrediting. As theowner and beneficiary of the policy, individual nonprofit organizations have accessto anycash values thataccrue - areal plus if they need liquidity. CAL makes it possible to plan now for a brightfuture. CAL - The Best of Both Worlds In the past, it was common to rely heavily on a handful of wealthy donors. BecauseCAL isaffordable,those limited to making smaller donations may now be able to fund sizable gifts fortomorrow. CALneed not interfere with present solicitation efforts - it's meant to supplement,not replace,currentdonations. Donors to a nonprofit organization that participates will also find CAL attractive.Sincedonors can fund CAL from current income,rather thanaccumulated wealth, they don't have to utilize assets that were intended for theirfamilies. Of course,they may also be able to take any applicable tax deductions when itemizing theirtax returns. Gifts areeasy to arrange and are outside of the probate estate. We're Here to Support Nonprofit Organizations CAL is simple, effective and makes perfect sense for nonprofit organizations. NewYorkLife'soutstandingreputation for customer service makes establishing a CAL arrangement easy. Aftera nonprofit organization has secured agroup of interested donors, the donors fill out a simple medical form, and a NewYork Liferepresentative provides a letter of intent to the organization. When theorganizationreceives all premiums/donations,they simply send acheck for the total amount to New York Life.

If youalready own aterm policy, should you convert it to a permanent plan, such as whole life? Or is a flexibleplan, such asuniversal life, the way to go? There are no easy answers to these questions. And that is not because thethree kinds ofinsurance are so complex and difficult to understand - actually, the differences between themare basicand easily comprehensible. What makes these questions difficultis that theanswers depend on you, your budget, and your needs. One kind of insurance is notnecessarily"better" than the other; and they are certainly not mutually exclusive. More than likely, yourchoice willnotbe "either/or" but "the best mix." Term, Whole Life, Universal Term insurance provides economic protection for a specified period (or "term") at aspecified rate. Itis "no frills" coverage that is very inexpensive at younger ages and becomes increasinglymoreexpensive as you get older. Its "premium" (what you're required to pay to keep the policy inforce)increases each term (since you can also buy this kind of insurance for periods of one,five, or eventen years). It is designed to lock-in insurability for conversion to permanent insurance in thefuture. Permanent insurance, on the other hand, provides permanent protection, coverage foryour wholelife. "Whole life" insurance offers a level or fixed premium that is guaranteed never to go up,because itaverages insurance costs over your lifetime. In the early years, therefore, premiums arehigher than theamount required to pay only for pure death benefit protection. If it were that simple, the choice between term and permanent insurance would bestraightforward: Whatever your age, buy the cheaper product. However, the premium you pay in the earlyyears of awhole life policy helps build a guaranteed tax-deferred "cash value," which is availableduring yourlifetime, in the form of policy loans that can be used to meet emergencies, fund educationexpenses, orprovide income for retirement. Moreover, whole life policies from mutual insurancecompanies aregenerally "participating," which means that they earn dividends. What about universal life? Like whole life, this kind of insurance is permanent, offeringlifetimeprotection and cash value accumulation. Unlike whole life, however, universal-type policiesfeature anadjustable death benefit and flexible premiums. After making an initial minimum premiumpayment,policy owners may pay whatever they desire, subject to IRS and companyminimum/maximum rules;they may even skip premium payments for a year or longer. The policy's death benefit mayfluctuateaccordingly. With a universal policy, you have added flexibility to adjust your death benefitand premiumpayments according to your current needs. Which is Best for You? Term insurance is normally the better buy for the younger age groups and for the shortrun. Itmakesthe ideal choice when you're young, just starting out, and on a strict budget, since it allowsyou to buythe full amount of coverage you need at an affordable price. After all, there is no point tobuying apermanent policy if you simply can't afford it; you'll either buy less coverage than you needor, evenworse, lose your money as well as your coverage if you allow the policy to lapse because ofnonpayment. Term insurance is perfect when your needs are temporary and when you needprotection until adebt,such as a mortgage or a business or education loan is paid off. Generally speaking, if yourneed forprotection lasts ten years or less, or will cease entirely before age 50, term insurance is anintelligentbuy. If you don't need protection after a certain point in your life, for instance once the children have left home, your spouse is self-supporting, Additional income is not needed for retirement years, or you have no desire to leave an inheritance or need to protect an estate orbusiness, terminsurance is right for you. However, if you need insurance for an extended period - for ten or more years - and ifyou do havethekinds of needs listed above, you should consider permanent plans, such as whole life anduniversallife. Some Things to Consider "Baby Boomers" who are having children in their thirties and forties are often financinga mortgage,paying and saving for the education of their children, building a retirement nest egg, andperhaps evenhelping to fund long-term care for their parents. They are the first generation of Americans tobehandling these responsibilities simultaneously. Permanent insurance provides not onlynecessaryeconomic protection, but also the kind of asset accumulation opportunity they need to meetconvergingdemands. Over time, it is much more cost-efficient than term insurance. After the age of fifty, permanent insurance is almost certainly the better buy, since termpremiumsincrease considerably thereafter and are not recoverable in the form of cash value ordividends. Permanent insurance, however, allows you to leave your options open with respect toeconomicprotection, retirement and education funding, and estate planning. It can be used to boostmonthlyretirement income through a technique known as "pension maximization." It can also be amajor estateplanning tool, enabling you to minimize estate taxes and provide liquidity for your heirs. What about the retirement years? The cash value in a permanent policy can be used tosupplementSocial Security, pension benefits, and investment income. You can borrow from it or eventurn it into anannuity generating monthly income for life. Choosing the Best Mix What if you're sold on the value of permanent insurance but can't afford all thecoverage you need? You have some options. You can buy the term insurance you need and gradually convert it,piece bypiece, into permanent insurance. (Most term policies have a "conversion" privilege thatallows you toturn your term insurance into permanent insurance without proving good health.) Let's sayyou need$200,000 worth of insurance: you can buy a term policy for that amount and later convert$50,000 of itinto a permanent plan, keeping the rest of the term in force to convert in the future. Whetheryou chooseto convert to whole life or universal life will depend on your specific needs for an adjustabledeathbenefit and flexible premium payments. Another option is to buy a permanent plan with term insurance added to it. If, again,you need$200,000 of insurance but can only afford to pay for little more than $100,000 of permanentcoverage,you may be able to buy a base plan with $100,000 of cash value insurance and, for only alittle moremoney, a $100,000 "term rider." Or, you might buy a $200,000 universal life policy, startingoff with theminimum premium and gradually increasing those payments as circumstances allow. When all is said and done, you needn't be thinking in terms of "term versuspermanent." Rather,youshould be thinking of what is the best mix of term and permanent insurance that will meetyour needs. With the help of your New York Life agent, you can design an insurance plan that is flexibleandaffordable - a customized plan that will meet your needs and help you reach your goals.

They allow people to accumulate moneywithoutpaying current income tax on their earnings. This means that the amount can grow faster,dueto the tremendous power of compound interest. For example, if you have $10,000 to invest in a deferred annuity that is earning 5% ayear, at the end of the first year your annuity will be worth $10,500. That full amount willbe available to earn interest the following year. If, instead, you invest in a currentlytaxable investment that is also earning 5%, and your marginal tax rate is 28%, at the endofthe year only $10,360 will be available for reinvestment. The remaining $140 will be paid tothe government for income tax on the $500 you earn. This may seem like a small sum ofmoney,but if this continues for ten years, the difference between the values of the tax-deferredannuity and the currently taxable investment will be $2,046! (Of course, taxes must still bepaid when the earnings inside the annuity contract are distributed. If the annuity werecashed in after ten years, the income tax would be $1,761, assuming a 28% rate and nopenaltytaxes). There are two types of deferred annuities - fixed and variable. Fixed annuities pay afixed rate of interest similar to CDs. Unlike annuities, CDs are FDIC insured. Variable annuities offer the choice of severalinvestment divisions such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, which can cause therate ofreturn to fluctuate with market conditions.

Choosing an investment strategy that suits you is never easy. You face a myriad oftoughquestions,including: How much money should I invest? How often should I invest? Where should I invest my money? Fortunately, there's a venerable investment strategy that could be the answer tomany of yourconcerns.It's called Dollar Cost Averaging, and it can simplify your investment planning. The name may sound complicated but, simply put, Dollar Cost Averaging is nothingmore thanthesystematic investment of a fixed dollar amount at regular time intervals. Forexample, youcould invest$100 every week. Or $500 every month. Or $1,000 every three months. The amountandfrequencyofyour investments depends upon your financial means and long-term goals. However,once youinitiatethe plan, the key to success is sticking with it and ignoring market fluctuations. How Does Dollar Cost Averaging Work? Basically, Dollar Cost Averaging attempts to take the ups and downs of the marketand "smooththemout." Instead of trying to time the highs and lows (a daunting task, even forprofessionals),you'reinvesting the same amount of money at regular intervals. Dollar Cost Averagingencourages asystematic approach to investing that frees you from trying to time the market.Let's take alook at how aDollar Cost Averaging program would work under three hypothetical marketenvironments:fluctuating,rising, and declining. Dollar Cost Averaging in Turbulent Times Let's assume you decide to put $100 every month in an investment that is currentlysellingfor $10 pershare. (For this hypothetical example, let's assume that there are no additionalcharges).The firstmonth you invest $100 and receive 10 shares. Then, in an extreme but easy tofollowexample,themarket falls and the price drops to $5 per share. In the second month your $100buys you 20shares.The market rebounds in the following month, the price jumps to $10 per share, andfor your$100investment you receive 10 shares. Let's see where you would stand: Fluctuating Market Regular Investment Share Price # of Shares Acquired $100 $10 10 $100 $5 20 $100 $10 10 Total: $300 $25 40 Average Share Cost To You: $7.50 ($300÷40) Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $8.33 ($25÷3) As you can see, you now own 40 shares after a total investment of $300. Theaverageprice is$8.33,but the average cost to you was $7.50. Being disciplined and remaining with theprogram isthe key tothe long-term success of Dollar Cost Averaging. In Good Times... Let's say you continue with your investment program, and the market rallies. Yourinvestmentrises to$20, then $25, and eventually $50 per share. Let's see where you stand. Rising Market Regular Investment Share Price # of Shares Acquired $100 $20 5 $100 $25 4 $100 $50 2 Total: $300 $95 11 Average Share Cost To You: $27.27 ($300÷411) Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $31.67 ($95÷3) When the market rises, you benefit in two ways: the value of your total investmentincreases(obviously),and the average cost you paid is lower than the average share price (not soobvious, buttrue). Whenyou compare the average share price ($31.67) to what you actually paid ($27.27),you canappreciatethe benefits of Dollar Cost Averaging. ...And In Bad It's tough to find a silver lining in the dark cloud of a declining market, butthrough theconsistency ofDollar Cost Averaging, you can take some consolation. Let's assume the marketbegins to slideandthe price drops to $25, then $20 and eventually $10 per share. Declining Market Regular Investment Share Price # of Shares Acquired $100 $25 4 $100 $20 5 $100 $10 10 Total: $300 $55 19 Average Share Cost To You: $15.79 ($300÷19) Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $18.33 ($55÷3) Here, when the share price fell from $25 to $10 you were able to purchase thegreatest numberofshares. In addition, your average share cost ($15.79) was less than the averageshare price.Becauseyou invested a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals, ignoring the pricefluctuations, youwere able topurchase a larger number of shares when the price was low and a smaller number ofshareswhenthe price was high. In effect, you are buying a lot at bargain prices, andrelatively littleat what might beconsidered exorbitantly high prices. No Guarantees in Life As illustrated in the "declining market" example, Dollar Cost Averaging does notguarantee aprofit norprotect against loss. If you have to "sell low," no system is going to give you again. It'severy investorsdream to "beat the market," but unfortunately there are no magic methods that canguaranteethat.However, a Dollar Cost Averaging plan can offer a disciplined, systematic approachtoinvesting, thatcould be the cornerstone of your long-term planning. Since such plans involvecontinuousinvestment insecurities regardless of fluctuating price levels, you should consider yourfinancial abilityto continuemaking purchases during periods of low price levels. Setting Up a Dollar Cost Averaging Plan While Dollar Cost Averaging may simplify the questions "How much?" and "How often?"youshouldinvest, before you can enjoy the benefits of this program you must first answer thequestion,"Whereshould I invest?" Investing in variable products is a popular way to utilize DollarCostAveraging.Vehicles such as mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal lifeinsuranceofferinvestment flexibility and convenience. You can set up a customized program whereyou investa fixedamount at regular time intervals into a variable product. Your regular investmentscan bemade bysimply writing checks, or you can take advantage of the convenience of bankdrafting. Withthis method,automatic payments are withdrawn from your bank savings or checking account topurchaseshares ona regular basis.

Your kids are buckled up and ready to go. You remembered theswimfins,the beach umbrella, and the gift for your friends in Florida. This is going to be a terrificvacation! But asyou pull onto the highway, you get the strange feeling that there's something you forgot todo. Even the most relaxed traveler can be preoccupied with the thought of starting aninvestment planfora child's college tuition. You should know that there's no reason to procrastinate. You canjust pick upyour car phone - or pull over at the next phone booth - and call your registeredrepresentative todiscuss opening an UTMA account as soon as you return home. What is UTMA? The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) - and in certain states, the Uniform Gift toMinors Act(UGMA)-may be a way for you to save on taxes as you save for your children's education. As statelaws mayvary, investors should consult their personal legal/tax professional for additionalinformation. (ThisWeb page discusses UTMA since it has been adopted in the majority of states.) By setting up an account in the child's name under the UTMA, you can make a transfer ofup to$10,000 per year per child, without affecting your lifetime unified gift/estate tax credit. Since yourspousecan do the same, together you can give each of your children up to $20,000 per year,shiftingall or partof the investment earnings to the child's tax rate, which may be lower than your own. Evenif yourtransfer is less than $10,000, the strategy may offer potential tax benefits. Here's howearnings arecurrently taxed in an UTMA account: Until your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year iscovered by thechild's standard deduction and is not taxed. The next $650 in unearned income may be taxedat thechild's rate. Unearned income above $1,300 per year is taxed at the parent's rate. After your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year iscovered by thechild's standard deduction and is not taxed. Remaining income may be taxed at the child'srate. Help Make Saving for College Less Taxing The table shows how an UTMA transfer may help reduce taxes and build a larger fund forfutureexpenses. It assumes a systematic investment of $150 per month in an UTMA account for achild,starting at age seven. The account earns a hypothetical eight percent annual return, beforetaxes. If thechild's tax rate is fifteen percent (after the first $650 on interest, which is not taxed)and the parent's taxrate is twenty-eight percent, the table shows the potential tax advantages of the UTMAinvestment. $1,119$4,281 An UTMA May Help Reduce Taxes UTMA Account Account inParent's Name Child's Age at year end Annual Tax Balance Annual Tax Balance 8 $0 $1,871 $20 $1,851 9 0 3,891 61 3,808 10 0 6,073 105 5,878 11 0 8,429 151 8,068 12 0 10,974 200 10,383 13 30 13,693 252 12,832 14 55 16,604 307 15,422 15 82 19,721 365 18,162 16 120 23,049 427 21,059 17 152 26,612 491 24,122 18 187 30,424 560 27,363 19 226 34,502 633 30,790 20 267 38,866 709 34,414 Total Tax Thischart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to predict or guarantee theresults of any investment, which will vary with market conditions and fluctuations. Thischart assumes an inflation rate of 4%. Accordingly, the child's standard deduction willincrease over time. Easy to Set up Setting up an UTMA account in a child's name is easy. The account will involve acustodian; yourregistered representative can guide you in completing the application. Separate accounts arerequiredfor transfers to each child. Be sure to provide the child's Social Security number (not thatof the personmaking the gift or of the custodian). The custodian will have full authority to makedecisions, includingcontrol over investments. Since transfers must be permanent, parents can't gain access to the money for their ownuse. Also,all assets in the UTMA account will belong to the child when he or she reaches the age ofmajority. Youmay also want to consider the possibility that assets held in your children's names couldaffect thelevel of financial aid they'll be eligible to receive when they apply to schools.

In other words, the IRS, not your heirs, could be the singlelargest beneficiary of your estate. Some people think estate planning is only necessary for those select individuals who appearin episodes of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Unfortunately, this misconception couldcost your heirs. Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for estates valued over $600,000 and canclimb as high as 60% for estates over $10,000,000 and under $21,040,000. In reality, if youown assets, you need to plan for their future disposition. Do you need to worry about estate taxes? All too often, people underestimate the value oftheir estate. Did you know that your estate includes your home, cash, investments, pensionbenefits, personal property, trusts you own, alter, amend or revoke, certain life insuranceproceeds, and any other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property?The fact is, you are generally worth more than you think. Fortunately, there are a number of strategies designed to minimize the impact of estatetaxes. The following illustrates some of the most fundamental estate planningtechniques. Unlimited Marital Deduction The unlimited marital deduction is one of the most powerful estate planning tools available.The Internal Revenue Code allows an unlimited amount of property to be transferred to thesurviving spouse who is a U.S. citizen tax free when the first spouse dies. Therefore, if youare willing to pass all of your assets to your surviving spouse, there will be no federalestate tax exposure at that time. This is an effective strategy but it is not a completesolution to your estate planning needs. Yes, a surviving spouse will receive the assetsestate tax free, but when he or she dies the entire estate will be subject to estate taxes.Using the unlimited marital deduction does not eliminate estate taxes, it merely defers them- leaving your heirs, in most cases your children, with the responsibility of paying theestate tax bill. (Different rules apply to resident alien surviving spouses.) Unified Tax Credit The unified estate and gift tax credit of $192,800 allows you to give away up to $600,000while you are alive to anyone you want, whenever you want, gift tax free. If married, you andyour spouse can combine your credits. By properly utilizing the unified tax credit you candecrease the value of your estate by $1.2 million and save your heirs close to $400,000 inestate taxes. By gifting money or property while alive, the income and appreciation on the gifted assets isnot part of your estate when you die and is not subject to federal estate taxes. Tax-Effective Will A tax-effective will utilizes a combination of the unlimited marital deduction and theunified tax credit to reduce your estate tax exposure. Here's how it works: You and yourspouse establish a special account that allows the first-to-die spouse the right to leave upto $600,000 of assets to heirs. This special account is a credit bypass trust. The estate taxattributed to this trust is offset by the unified credit. If properly structured, anyremaining estate balance should qualify for the unlimited marital deduction. The survivingspouse can be an income beneficiary of the credit bypass trust, and have the right to incomefrom the trust for life. At the death of the second spouse, the assets in the trust can pass to your beneficiarieswithout being subject to estate taxes in the surviving spouse's estate. In addition, anyappreciation of the assets in the trust will pass to your heirs tax free. Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust There are basically two life insurance categories: traditional and second-to-die. Traditionalinsurance is term, whole life, and universal life coverage that pays a death benefit afterthe insured dies. Survivorship Whole Life insurance, or second-to-die insurance, insures twoindividuals in one insurance plan and pays the death benefit after the death of the secondinsured. Life insurance is a cost-effective funding vehicle for an estate plan. You pay pennies on thedollar for life insurance protection, and your heirs may use the life insurance proceeds topay the estate tax bill, without depleting the estate's assets. However, if you own a lifeinsurance policy at death, the proceeds will be included in your gross estate. To avoid this,you need to make sure you do not own the policy when you die. Also, be sure your estate isnot the beneficiary of your life insurance proceeds. Instead, create an irrevocable life insurance trust. You would gift cash to the trust so thetrust can make the necessary premium payments. The trust applies for, owns the policy, andpays the premiums. At death, the insurance proceeds pass into the trust and escape estatetaxes. If properly structured, the trust can also provide benefits to a surviving spouseand/or any other beneficiaries. If you were to transfer an existing life insurance policy to an irrevocable life insurancetrust, you must live three years from the date of transfer or the value of existing policyproceeds will be brought back into your estate. To avoid this three-year rule, you must havean irrevocable trust or other third-party owner apply for and purchase a new policy on yourlife. Annual Exclusion Gifts By gifting a portion of money and property while alive, you can dramatically reduce the sizeof your taxable estate. The federal Annual Exclusion Gift Law permits you to give $10,000each year to as many individuals as you desire. Most people choose to give such gifts totheir children and grandchildren. If married, you and your spouse can give away up to $20,000per recipient annually. Your gifts are income tax free to your recipients and each gift maydecrease the amount your heirs will have to pay in estate taxes. $3,000,000(800,000) $2,200,000$735,000 The Annual Gift Tax Exclusion 5 Years Ago Today Estate Value (married couple) $3,000,000 Less gifts (0) Taxable estate $3,000,000 Estate tax $1,098,000 Tax Savings $363,000 Assumptions: A married couple begins a five-year gift program. Both spouses gift $20,000 per year to eight family members for a total of $160,000 peryear. Taxable estate is reduced by $800,000 after five years. Estate tax is reduced to $735,000 for a total estate tax savings of $363,000. As you can see, estate planning is a little like surgery. No one can expect you to understandit all, much less perform the operation yourself. But, wouldn't you rather plan today thanhave your heirs lose 37 to 60 cents on the dollar later?

Best -- have all given New York Life and NYLIAC(its annuity subsidiary) high ratings. Term vs. Whole Life - What's the difference, and which one should I buy? As with any insurance product, it depends on your needs. Generally, the difference betweenterm life insurance and whole life insurance is that whole life is a permanent product thatbuilds cash value. Policyowners can make loans against the cash value if needed. It has ahigher initial premium, which remains level throughout the life of the policy. Term is a temporary insurance product with a fairly low initial premium, which increases asyou get older. Beneficiaries will receive insurance proceeds only if death occurs within aspecified period - the "term" of the contract. A term policy offers protection only and doesnot build cash value.

Afterdecades of living in the comfort of family, you're suddenly faced with the harshrealities of life - bills,bills, bills. How does one deal with these new-found responsibilities? You canstart by building asound financial foundation. Acting discerningly on these matters could make thedifference betweenmaking it on your own, or moving back with the folks. Choose wisely... Banking - Shop around. You shouldn't necessarily stick with yourcurrent bankjust because you'vebeen with them a long time. You may want to open both a savings account forearning interest, and achecking account for paying the bills. It's important to compare interest rates,but you also should bewary of charges for services. Some banks allow you to "link" your accounts to reduce fees. Many local newspapersrun a "scorecard"of bank rates, which can be helpful. Although deposits up to $100,000 arefederally insured, you'll stillwant to choose a financially strong institution. If possible, have your employer"direct deposit" yourpaychecks into your bank. Health Insurance - With medical costs spiraling upward, havingsufficienthealth insurance is anecessity. If you're job hunting, you should take a serious look at the medicalbenefits offered byprospective employers. If you're fortunate, your employer will offer a grouphealth plan. If not, it'sessential to obtain some type of individual health insurance. Major Medical Plans typically offer a fee-for-coverage arrangement for a rangeof services includingphysicians' costs, medical tests, hospital fees, etc. With some plans, you may goto a doctor of yourown choice and your insurer reimburses you a predetermined percentage of cost. Most plans havedeductibles, which is the amount of money you must pay out-of-pocket before theinsurer begins payingthe expenses. Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) have become a popular option because oftheirminimal out-of-pocket cost. Generally, members must visit only doctors affiliatedwith the HMO;however your co-payment could be as low as $5-$10 per visit.When evaluating different plans it's important to consider what services arecovered, and theco-payments and deductibles that are involved. Life Insurance - If you think it's just for "older people," thinkagain. If you havestudent loans from yourcollege days, you may want to consider having some life insurance to cover them,and then some. It'sprobably a good idea to purchase a policy now, because generally the younger youare, the lower thepremium. Two of the basic types of life insurance are whole life and term life. Whole life is permanentinsurance - it's yours for as long as you continue to pay the premiums. Thepremiums are fixed andthe policy cannot be canceled by the insurer. Over the long-term, the policybuilds "cash value" that canbe tapped into for financial needs. Term insurance provides inexpensive coverageover apre-determined period of time - 5 years, 10 years, etc. It is pure protection anddoes not build cashvalue. One type is not necessarily "better" than the other, but you may find thata mixture of the two maybest suit your needs. Building Credit - If you plan on buying a home, starting abusiness, or doinganything in the future thatrequires borrowed money, you'll definitely want to start building a credit historynow. Getting a creditcard and paying it off faithfully is a good way to start. Many banks andorganizations offer VISA andMastercard with lots of bells and whistles attached - product discounts, airlinemileage, etc. - butdon't overlook the basics. You'll want to find a deal that offers worldwide acceptance, no annual fee, and alow interest rate. If youdon't have any credit history or if it's poor, there's still an alternative. Somebanks offer a "securedcredit card," which is an arrangement where you deposit funds in an account thatare then used as yourcredit limit. Of course, the key to building good credit is to spend within yourmeans. Looking to The Long-Term - Building a financial foundationmeansplanning for the long haul. If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan you'll certainly want to takeadvantage of this convenient,tax-deferred retirement plan. IRAs, CDs, annuities and mutual funds are options toconsider to helpbuild your nest egg. The key to realizing your financial dreams is starting nowwhile you have a longtime horizon.

If $10,000wereinvested andaccumulated tax-free for 15 years, it would grow to $27,590. However, if Federaland stateincome taxestook 35 percent of the interest every year, the initial $10,000 investment wouldgrow to just$19,492. Thedifference, $8,098, is significant. Even if the taxes on interest had to be paidwhen themoney waswithdrawn, after 15 years, the $27,590 would be reduced to $21,434, still $1,942ahead ofpaying thetaxes annually. The difference is due to interest earned on the tax dollars thatwere not paiduntillater. For many years, the tax laws provided numerous ways to defer income taxes oninvestmentearnings.(Deferred taxes are not paid immediately but are paid later, usually when funds arewithdrawn. Incometaxes cannot normally be avoided forever, except at death.) During the 1980s, mostof thosespecialrules were repealed. Three notable, but by no means the only, exceptions involvelifeinsurance, mutualfunds, and U.S. savings bonds. Life insurance proceeds paid at death have always been free of income taxes. Lesswell-known, butequally important, is the fact that the growth in cash value of insurance policiesis alsotax-free forindividuals as long as the funds remain in the policy and are not withdrawn. Thus,the cashvalueaccumulates without any tax reduction and can be borrowed when needed to pay foreducation (or forother reasons) without tax consequences in most cases. A special rule applies to so-called "modified endowment contracts," policies thatare stronglyinvestment-oriented. Check with your agent to see if your policy qualifies as aborrowedwhen needed topay for education (or for other reasons) without tax consequences in mostcases.modifiedendowmentcontract. Mutual funds can also provide tax advantages. Even if the mutual fund payscurrentlytaxable interest ordividends, income taxes can be reduced by putting assets in a child's name. Until1987, thistechnique,which relies on the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), was very effective inreducingincome taxes,because all income was taxed at the child's rate, which normally is low. ThenCongresschanged thelaw, so that so-called "unearned" income (which includes interest and dividends)receivedby childrenunder age 14 is partly taxed at the rate applying to the child's parents. Even so,childrenunder 14 canreceive up to $550 in unearned income without paying any income tax. Thenext$550 is taxedat the child's own tax rate, typically 15 percent. Any unearned income exceeding$1,100 istaxed at theparents' rate. Another investment possibility with tax advantages is U.S. Savings bonds. Thesebonds arepurchasedfor half their face amount and pay variable market-based interest rates if held forfive yearsor longer.The interest rate is 85 percent of the rate on certain Treasury securities andvaries every sixmonths.Federal income tax is normally not paid until the bonds are redeemed, and they arecomplete exemptfrom state income taxes.

Today, they often offer interest rates that are comparable to (or higherthan) CDs, along with the added benefit of deferring taxes on the earnings until theyare withdrawn. Unlike annuities, CDs are FDIC insured. Fixed annuities, unlike many other fixed interest investments, contain guarantees ofminimum future interest rates. All fixed annuities have a minimum rate guarantee thatspecifies the lowest rate the insurer can offer. Some contracts also offer a "bailout"provision that allows the owner to withdraw money from the annuity without surrenderchargesif the crediting rate falls by more than a specific amount.

One could dismiss thismerely as the voice of a cynical generation but many financial experts have alsoexpressed reservationsregarding the future of the U.S. Social Security system. With working baby-boomerscomprising a largeportion of the U.S. population, the current Social Security system, funded by thenation's workforce, isfine. But what happens when today's boomers retire, and become tomorrow'srecipients of SocialSecurity benefits? What if there are more people receiving benefits, in the nextcentury, than there are inthe workforce funding those benefits? Many individuals in their twenties and thirties aren't wasting time speculating -they're planning for thefuture. According to the June 15, 1995 Wall Street Journal, 61% of"twenty-somethings" responding to asurvey sponsored by Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (a Chicago based moneymanagement firm)stated that they or their spouse had put money aside for retirement. The articlealso revealed that manyrespondents "were prepared to cut personal spending now in order to save forretirement." Even moreso than the boomers before them, today's under-35s are planning for the long-termfuture. With aresponsible mind focused on the future, it's also important to keep an eye ontoday, as well. Perhaps this is why one of the preferred long-term financial vehicles named by therespondents of theKemper poll was life insurance. It's wise to want to preserve future assets aslong as it does not turninto a situation of "putting the cart before the horse." While the baby boomergeneration may have beeninclined to ignore insurance in favor of financial products with potentiallyquicker and higher returns,more and more consumers under thirty-five have recognized the long-term advantagesof productssuch as whole life insurance. The first asset that younger consumers should seek toprotect -perhaps the most important asset - is themselves, and what they have today. Wholelife is a smartstep in that direction. Starting With Today The beauty of whole life insurance is that it not only offers the long-termbenefits of cash value andtax-deferred accumulation, but it also offers immediate coverage in the event of atragedy. For a marriedindividual, the need for life insurance is obvious; so much rides on an income thefamily is counting on:the mortgage payments, living expenses, child care costs - even the future plansfor a child'seducation. For young single individuals, the life insurance need is sometimes less obvious,but just as real. Acrucial step toward true independence lies in making sure that no one else will beforced to shoulderthe consequences of choices that we've made. Many people in their twenties have toborrow moneyfrom their families, or from financial institutions. Frequently, young singleswith student loans, carloans, or mortgages on a condo are only able to secure these funds by having aloved one co-sign theloan, as well. If something were to happen to the young single person, the personwho co-signed theloan would be fully responsible for the debt repayment. What if there were notenough liquid resourcesto pay off the debts and loans? Losing a loved one is difficult enough; combinedwith having to dealwith exorbitant financial debts and struggles, it quickly becomes a devastatingexperience. Whole life insurance protects against the financial consequences of these potentialtragedies, and italso gives the younger consumer a financial foundation to build on for the rest ofhis/her life. With cashvalue, tax deferred growth, and the accumulation potential of dividends2, whole lifeinsurance can easily evolve from today's protection plan to the beginning oftomorrow's retirement plan. What's more: the younger the insured, the more affordable insurance is. Sinceeveryone needs thiscoverage sooner or later, it'sa good idea to get it when it's more affordable - and when good health will usuallyassure coverage. Unfortunately, once health has declined, insurance is often no longer an option. Ironically, this could bewhen people need it the most. Whether anticipating the future or focusing on today, the under-35 consumer shouldalways keep this inmind: the ideal plan allows for today's protection as well as tomorrow'spossibilities.

Unfortunately, Social Securitywill provideonly a portion of thisincome. According to the Social Security Administration, the averagemonthly SocialSecurity check in1994 was just $674. Factor in that most Americans are living longerand it becomesclear that you willneed additional sources of income if you hope to live comfortably inretirement. A Simple and Effective Retirement Planning Tool One of the easiest ways to start building wealth and saving forretirement isthrough an IndividualRetirement Account (IRA). An IRA is a tax-deferred vehicle thatprovides you withthe opportunity toinvest in various instruments. These include: stocks, bonds,money-market funds,governmentsecurities, unit investment trusts, and mutual funds. Since the IRA is a tax-deferred account, all of your contributions andearningswill compound andaccumulate quicker than money placed in a similar taxable account. Overthe longhaul, this taxadvantage will significantly increase your retirement nest egg. Eligibility Requirements Anyone who receives compensation for working during the year (includingwages,salaries,commissions, and professional fees) can establish an IRA. The maximumamount youmay contributeper year is the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of your annualcompensation. If you have a non-working spouse, you may contribute an additional $250into theplan on your spouse'sbehalf. This would increase the maximum contribution for the year to$2,250. Thecontribution wouldhave to be made into two separate accounts and may be divided in anyfashion aslong as no morethan $2,000 is contributed to either IRA. The extra account is called aspousalIRA. IRA Deductibility Limits If both you and your spouse are employed, but are not considered activeparticipants in your employer'squalified retirement plans, your IRA contributions are fullydeductible. (Twoindividual IRAs must be setup.) If you and your spouse file a joint tax return, a maximumdeduction of $4,000would be allowed.This deduction will reduce your taxable income and your current incometax bill. If both you and your spouse participate in your employer's qualifiedretirementplans, your deduction foryour contribution may be reduced or eliminated depending on your annualadjustedgross income.Singles with adjusted gross incomes of $25,000 or less and marriedcouples withadjusted grossincomes of $40,000 or less can deduct their entire IRA contribution. Asyour annualincome increases,the amount you can deduct gradually decreases. Deductions are reducedby $200 forevery $1,000 ofincome over $40,000 ($25,000 for singles). The Power Of Tax Deferral Even if you cannot deduct your annual contribution, IRAs still offer apowerfuladvantage - tax-deferredgrowth. All of the earnings on amounts contributed to an IRA are nottaxed untilthey are withdrawn. Forexample, if you were to invest $2,000 annually, assuming an 8% returnand a 33%combined federal,state, and local income tax bracket, after 30 years, a tax-deferredaccount couldpotentially grow to$244,692. Under this same scenario, a taxable account would have grownto$148,971. That is$95,721, or 64%, more in the tax-deferred account than in the taxableaccount.1 Time Is Still Available An IRA should serve as the cornerstone for your retirement plan.Whether retirementis years away orjust around the corner, you owe it to yourself to prepare now for afuture that'sfree of financial worry.Implementing a disciplined approach to investing can put you on thepath towardyour retirementdreams. You have until April 15, 1996 to make the maximum 1995contribution of$2,000. And insteadof waiting another full year, you could invest $4,000 today (for 1996and 1997) andlet the power of taxdeferral start working toward your retirement dreams.

In 1849, the name was changed to New York Life InsuranceCompany. From the outset, Freeman knew the kind of individual who would be successful working with theCompany, and he conducted an aggressive recruiting campaign to find "capable, energeticagents" to work in all the settled territories. As pioneers moved west, New York Life agentswere there to greet them. Famous men like Lew Wallace, author of Ben Hur, and SchuylerColfax, who became Ulysses S. Grant's Vice President, represented the Company. At that time,selling and servicing insurance had not yet become a career in itself. Agents were localdoctors, lawyers, bankers, etc., who offered policies as an added service. In the twentieth century, despite war, the Great Depression, stock market upheavals andeconomic instability both at home and around the world, New York Life remained solid bystaying true to its guiding principles of prudent expansion, conservative growth,full-service and a strong Field Force. The Company's conservative approach hasenabled it to grow steadily and provide outstanding service. New York Life has neverfaltered on its obligations and has put the financial well-being of its policyholders aboveevery other concern. The Company's dedication to service has given our customers an unprecedented levelof security. As a result, our agents have earned a level of respect from our customers andthe insurance industry that is second to none.

While a family-owned businesscan provide financial benefits - capital growth, salary, fringebenefits etc. - the realbenefits are oftenmore personal. A family-owned firm can provide a better workingenvironment than a largeimpersonalcompany. Family members can take pride in seeing the family nameon products and on the signoutside the door. A well run family firm not only stressespersonal service and customerloyalty, butalso provides benefits to the local community. Some business owners build a business with an eye to selling itto the highest bidder. Manyentrepreneurs, however, hope that the business they have builtwill remain within the family. Whenmembers of the founding generation retire, with proper businesscontinuation plans in place,they cantake pleasure in knowing that the firm is in good hands. Suchhappy endings, however, cannotbetaken for granted. According to a study by the Journal ofAccountancy, fewer than fiftypercent of familybusinesses survive past the second generation. Challenges to Retaining the Business in theFamily No Qualified or Interested Family Member:Some firms do have anemployeewho could run the business, but that person is not a familymember. Perhaps the children aretooyoung, have other interests, or lack the founder's drive, feelfor the market, or technicalskills. Limited Access to Capital: A child may nothave the same relationshipwiththe bankers, suppliers, bonding company, and customers as theprior generation. Death, Disability, or Retirement: Seniormanagement may leave, whetherthrough death, disability, or retirement, before the nextgeneration is prepared to assumecontrol. Disgruntled Second-Tier Management: Asenior employee who has givenhis or her life to a company may find it difficult to work for a"boss" young enough to behis or her child. First-rate salaried managers often leave to become the nextgeneration's most potentcompetitors. Current Income versus Growth of Firm: Theretired generation may beconcerned about income to meet living expenses. The children maywant to retain profits togrow thebusiness. That could spell trouble. Estate Taxes: A closely held corporation isan illiquid asset. Taxesareassessed based on "fair market value" at a date of death. Fairmarket value is what a"Willing sellerwould accept from a willing buyer." Often, however, there are nowilling buyers. Otherassets, or eventhe firm itself, may have to be liquidated to cover the estatetaxes due. Family Differences: The eldest daughter hasan aptitude for business,buther husband has transferred to another city. The son wants torun the business, and lives intown, but has much to learn. How are parents to do what is right for eachchild, when they have onlyone largeilliquid asset to divide? Obviously, business continuity planning is not simple. Some ofthe problems are reducibletomoney. Money can provide for estate taxes,purchase a retiring owner'sinterest, orprovide an equivalent asset for the children who will not enterthe business. Along with thefinancialconsiderations, appropriate legal agreements may need to bedrafted, and coordinated with thewill andestate plan. It is up to the business owner to set the planning wheels inmotion. Here's how to begin: Planning Steps Clarify Goals: What would you, as anowner, prefer? To work in thebusiness for as long as possible? To retire at a certain age? To provide for your childrenthe lifestyleand status you have enjoyed?

The answer to thatquestion maynot be assimple as it seems. Retirement does not necessarily mean the end to your need forlifeinsurance. However, as with any other major life change, you should re-evaluate your lifeinsurancecoverage to besure it is adequate. If, as you near retirement, you still have dependents who would suffer financialhardship ifyou die, youshould consider having life insurance. On the other hand, if you no longer havedependents, you mayfind you have less of a need for life insurance. So, what are your options with your life insurance policy? One place to start isto talk withyour agent. He or she can help you determine what is appropriate for you in your situation. Here are some ideas that you might want to discuss with your agent if you have awhole lifepolicy: Keep the policy in force indefinitely by converting it to a paid-up policy. You pay nomorepremiums, but the amount of insurance is reduced. The accumulated cash valueremainsintact, andyou retain the option of borrowing against it. Use the policy's accumulated cash value to purchase an annuity, which canprovide aguaranteedlifetime income. Or, you might use the cash value for another investment. However,beaware thatincome taxes likely will be due. Taxes will be based on the sum of the cash valueplusdividends youreceive that exceed the premiums you have paid while the policy was in force(dividends arebased onthe policy's applicable dividend scale or interest crediting rate which is neitherguaranteednor anestimate of future performance). If you keep the policy in force as paid-up insurance until death, no income taxeswill bepayable. Regardless of the type of life insurance policy you have, it is a good idea toreview yourcoverage andoptions with your agent, as you approach retirement age to be sure that your policywill meetyourneeds.

In otherwords, you don't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw your money. Thatmeansmoney mayaccumulate faster than it would in a similar but currently taxable investment.(Remember,withdrawalsprior to age 591/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.) Control Your Taxes Here's another advantage of tax deferral: since you aren't taxed on annuityproceeds untilyou withdrawthem, you can plan your withdrawals so you're not hit too hard by Uncle Sam. Afteryouretire, you mayfind yourself in a lower tax bracket - perhaps you can wait until then beforeyouwithdrawyour money. Oryou can withdraw funds prudently, so you don't push yourself into a higherbracket. Anannuity can offergenuine tax control. It can help your money accumulate - and last. Select a Balance That's Right For You No two people have identical needs and concerns.

Later you mayprefer tobalance youraggressive investments with those that offer a higher measure of safety. And ifyou'renearingretirement or have already retired, a more conservative allocation may suit yourgoalsperfectly. LifeStagesSM allows you to change yourinvestmentstrategyas your needs change. Set a Course Some people track their investment accounts daily - others set a course and letitrunitself. LifeStagesSM gives you those options. Dollar Cost Averaging Option "Making money is easy," a wit said. "You simply buy low and sell high." Buthowcan youpredict whenprices will be "low" or "high?" You may not need to if you dollar cost average. With dollarcostaveraging, you set up a program of scheduled investments - given dollar amountsinvested atgivenpoints in time - and stick to it, regardless of the changes in the markets. Thisconsistent,disciplinedapproach allows you to take advantage of market volatility by buying moreinvestment unitswhen pricesare low and fewer when prices are high. Although dollar cost averaging does notensure aprofit norprotect against a loss in a declining market, over time a sustained dollar costaveragingstrategy canreduce your timing risk and optimize your return. Investors should considertheirfinancialability to continue purchases through periods of low and high price levels. Automatic Asset Reallocation Option Let's say you want to maintain a particular allocation of your assets in investmentdivisions, forexample, 40% in Bond, 40% in Capital Appreciation and 20% in Cash Management. Sinceportfoliovalues change at different rates, you may need to move money between investmentdivisions tokeepyour desired ratio. It's a popular investment strategy, but it requires a lotofmaintenance. Fortunately, LifeStagesSM offers anAutomaticAssetReallocation feature that allows you to specify when - quarterly,semi-annually,or annually- NYLIACwill review your accounts and automatically make any necessary transfers tobringyourdistributionback into the balance you selected. Payout at Retirement The goal of any annuity - including LifeStagesSM- is toprovide retirement income. And with LifeStagesSM, you canelect to receive an income that's guaranteed to last as long as you live. AndalthoughLifeStagesSM is designed as a longer-terminvestment, thereare otherways to access your money without incurring surrender charges.2 Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may besubject to a10% IRS tax penalty. Windows of Opportunity LifeStages' 10% Window allows immediate accessto10% of your policy's cash value each year (less any surrender-charge-freewithdrawals you'vemadeduring the year) without triggering a surrender charge. In addition, LifeStagesSM offers a Gain Windowfor policieswith $100,000 or more in accumulated premium payments. Without incurringsurrendercharges,youcan withdraw the greater of all of the gain in your policy or the 10% Windowamount. Loan Option for TSAs If you're investing through a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA) program only,LifeStages offers liquidity through a TSA loan provision. Loans mayequal thelesser of 50% of the value of your policy or $50,000. Guaranteed Refund of Initial Premium on Fixed Account If you surrender your policy during the first three years, you're guaranteed toreceive theportion of theinitial premium you allocated to, and that remained in, the Fixed Account. Thisrefund doesnot apply ifany partial withdrawals are taken from the policy, such as the 10% Window or the Gain Window. Guaranteed Advantages For Your Heirs To help you provide for your heirs, LifeStagesSMoffers adeath benefit equal to the greater of the cash value or the premiums paid lesswithdrawals. In otherwords, your heirs will receive at least the amount of money you've invested -evenif youraccounts havedeclined in value.3 There's even a three-year step-up4 feature that offers even more protection. Everythreeyears,yourdeath benefit "locks in" so your beneficiary is guaranteed the greater of thecurrent cashvalue orpremiums paid less withdrawals or the cash value at each third-year anniversary(plus anypremiumspaid less any withdrawals and surrender charges since the last third-yearanniversary). Thisenablesyou to lock in new, higher levels of guarantees in a growing market. Thisstep-upfeaturecontinues untilthe owner or annuitant reaches insurance age 85. 1 TransfersfromtheFixed Account to Investment Divisions are subject to some restrictions. See theprospectusfor details. Subject to contract limitations, you are permitted twelve free transfers peryear. NYLIACreserves theright to charge up to $30 for each transfer exceeding twelve per year. Thisoffermay bemodified orwithdrawn at any time. 2LifeStagesSM surrender charges are based onthedate ofeach premium payment as follows: 7% in years one through three; 6% in yearfour;5% in yearfive and4% in year six. For residents of Oregon - after ten years, surrender chargeswillnever bemore than 1%of the policy cash value. 3 Deathbenefitpayments are dependent upon the claims-paying ability of NYLIAC. 4 ForresidentsofTexas, the step-up death benefit is "stepped up" every six years.

Studies show that 60% of thepeople who reach age 65 will need long-term care services1 duringtheir lifetime, with 40% requiring a stay in a nursing home2. As people live longer, those odds will increase. Changing Times Bring New Concerns Most of us know at least one person who has stayed in a nursinghome or needed professional home health care. The financial consequencesof long-term health care can have a significant impact on a family'ssavings and lifestyle. According to the Health Care FinancingAdministration (Fall 1992), over 56% of long-term home healthcare expenses are paid, out-of-pocket, by the patients and theirfamilies. Those accumulated expenses can use up a major partof your savings. For people who enter a nursing home, the financialoutcome can be worse: according to the Congressional Subcommitteeon Aging, 70 to 80% of nursing home residents deplete theirassets within twelve months. To understand this increasing need to plan for the financial impactof long-term care services, it's necessary to understand basicchanges taking place in American society. According to the U.S.Census, there were 32 million people age 65 and older in 1990-butby the year 2030, this figure could double to 64.6 million. Moreover,people are living longer today than ever before. By the year2040, there may be more people over age 85 than there are over65 today. Not only are we getting older but, over the next 50years, working age population may increase only 2 to 18%, whilethe elderly population is expected to increase anywhere from 139to 169%. For years, it was tradition for adult children to take care oftheir parents during the "golden years". But changingtimes have brought an increase in dual-career families, job insecurity,family mobility, and divorce. Today, many adult children arenot able to stay home and look after their own children, let alonean aging parent. In addition, corporate downsizing has eliminatedthousands of mid-management jobs throughout the country; consequently,many adult children are not in a position to financially helptheir parents as they had planned. Add to this the increasinguncertainty of health care benefits for senior citizens, and agiant question mark looms on the horizon. Who Will Pay For Long-Term Care? Not Uncle Sam. Who will support this population and help pay its inevitable medicalbills? The writing is on the wall. According to Alice M. Rivlinand Joshua M. Weiner, authors of Caring for the Disabled Elderly(published by the Brookings Institution), the combination of agingBaby Boomers and an increase in the longevity of the aged willdramatically heighten the need for more public and private spending. But when it comes time to pay the bill, no federal programs-SocialSecurity, Medicare, or Medicaid will pay for all long-term careexpenses. How "Secure" Is Social Security? Social Security is not a savings account that builds up over time. It is a "pay as you go" system, paid for through payrolltaxes on present employees to support former workers. Today,according to the Social Security Administration, each retiredSocial Security beneficiary is supported by the payroll taxesof 3.3 workers. By 2020, it's estimated that each Social Securitybeneficiary will be supported by the payroll taxes of 1.9 workers. According to the Social Security system, payroll taxes wouldhave to increase by almost 60% for the system to remain solventand provide the same level of benefits in the future. Don't Bank On Medicare Or Medicaid Although Medicare provides health coverage for senior citizens,it is limited in the area of long-term care coverage. In 1992,Medicare paid a total of 4.3% of all nursing home care expensesin the country, and 9.5% of long-term home health care expenses3,primarily for nursing home and home health care services immediatelyfollowing a hospital stay. Medicare generally will not coverthe cost of nursing home or home health care services due to achronic condition. Medicaid, on the other hand, will cover thecost of long-term care, but there's one catch: to qualify, youmust become indigent ("spend down" your assets). Remember:once you have depleted your assets, you have also lost controlover where and when you receive care. Also, because of stateand federal budget cutbacks, the facilities close to your familyand friends might not have openings for Medicaid patients at thetime you need care. What are the options? If Medicare won't pay, and spending down your assets to qualifyfor Medicaid is not attractive, the cost of any required long-term care services may be paid for out of current income and savings,as by long-term care insurance. And, long-term care can be veryexpensive. In 1994, nursing home care averaged $36,000 per yearnationally4, but costs substantially more in some states. Home care usually is less expensive, but full-time home carecan cost as much as a nursing home stay. What Does Long-Term Care Insurance Cover? Long-term care insurance usually pays for skilled, intermediate,or custodial care in a nursing home. It can also cover professional"at-home" health care. This type of insurance can helppay for a variety of home and community-based care services, including:physical, speech, and occupational therapists; home health aidesand visiting nurses; adult day care, and hospice care. (Note:Generally, skilled care refers to round-the-clock treatmentby a registered nurse under a doctor's supervision. Intermediatecare refers to occasional nursing and rehabilitative careunder the supervision of skilled medical personnel. Custodialcare primarily meets personal care needs in activities ofdaily living such as help in eating or bathing.) Typically, long-termcare insurance policies pay up to a specific dollar amount day(which may be less than the total cost of the services provided). Few, if any, policies provide full coverage for all expenses. More Information is Available HIAA publishes a booklet, "The Consumer's Guide To Long-TermCare Insurance," which provides basic information on long-termcare and long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance maynot be for everybody, so it is important to research the subjectcarefully. Your agent can help you make an educated decision. 1Long-Term Care Group,October 1990 2"Lifetime UseOf Nursing Home Care."

But, wherever they go and whatever they dream, New York Life will be there -- just as it has been for the last seven generations. When we began in 1845, we were a small company located in New York City doing business intheeastern part of the United States. Today, 150 years later, we are a $74 billion financial servicesorganization with interests that span the globe. We have locations in thousands of towns and citiesacross the country and throughout the world. As a world leader in the financial services field, we touch the lives of millions of Americans -- andothers around the world -- through diversified investments and a wide range of services. Our clients include such large organizations as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Minor League Baseball Insurance Trustfor players and umpires, as well as you, your family, your neighbors, and friends. Our greatest accomplishments during our sesquicentennial were a natural outgrowth of 150 yearsofdedicated, continuous service to our customers. We set ambitious financial goals -- and exceededthem, created new products to meet your changing needs, and enhanced our leadership position asa company that protects policyowners' interests. Through our financial products, managed health care, and invested assets, we help shape thefuturefor millions of men and women. Our size and diversity are part of what keeps us financially strong. Proof of this statement can be found in our 1995 financial results. Our sales -- generally annualizedinsurance premiums and new money from investment products -- increased 13 percent from 1994; ourconsolidated assets reached $74.3 billion; our net gain was $373 million; our surplus and investmentreserves totaled $5.2 billion; and the ratio of surplus to assets, a key measure of strength, was a solid6.95 percent -- one of the highest among major life insurers. Remaining strong enables us to help you reach your financial goals. It's a strategy we intend to keep for the next 150 years. And those years promise to be even more dynamic -- and successful -- than the last. Adding new products also helps us to meet your goals. While industry growth remained sluggish, the introductionof new products and plans helped our individual insurance and annuity sales climb 24 percent from 1994. We'repleased at this tremendous vote of consumer confidence in our agents, brokerage producers, products, and quality of service. One new product, our LifeStagesSM variable annuity, contributed to a record-breakingyear for the Individual Annuity line of business -- resulting in nearly $1.4 billion in sales. Ourrevitalized Agency Force alone sold 34 percent more annuity business in 1995 than the year before. And, ourFive-Year Term policy contributed significantly to our more than $70 million in new term premium -- one of ourbest years ever for this traditional product. Another important move was the reorganization of our managed care operations to form NYLCareHealth Plans, Inc. We merged our Group insurance operations with one of our most profitable andfastest-growing subsidiaries, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, an HMO and managed care organization. This enhanced the quality of our operations and service, and simplified the way theorganizations and individuals can purchase and manage their health care benefits. NYLCare, whichestimates its 1996 revenues will reach $2.5 billion, now offers a full spectrum of health careproducts and services, including group insurance, preferred provider organizations, and HMOproducts. In 1995, we also became a major direct marketer of life insurance as the provider for the AARP LifeInsurance Program. Chosen by the American Association of Retired Persons after a rigorous selectionprocess, we began offering the program to AARP members in the fall of 1994, and the response wasoverwhelming. In 1995, sales reached $53 million, exceeding our initial estimates by a widemargin. Our MainStay® Funds set records for sales and surpassed the $6 billion asset mark in 1995. We cancredit this success to outstanding equity performance, as well as the efforts of both of our distributionchannels -- the New York Life Agency Force and Wall Street brokerage firms. On the pension side, ourtraditional Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) product continued to provide retirement security forour clients as we maintained our market leadership position. One of our strongest assets is integrity. It's been a hallmark of our Company for 150 years. Aprime example of our belief in the integrity of our people, our products, and our promises was the settlement in 1995 of a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of certain policyowners. It involved sales practiceissues and in particular, policyowners' understanding of dividends and interest crediting rates. The Company's financial strength and our confidence in our agents allowed us to work out an innovative settlement,approved by the Supreme Court of New York State in January 1996. It was high in benefits and aid to policyowners in the class, while doing nothing to disadvantage our other policyowners. In fact, over 99 percent of thepolicyowners in the class have elected to accept the settlement, attesting to its fairness. Our great financial strength, coupled with our leadership position on issues of integrity which affect our policyowners, is reflected on many levels. A Fortune 100 company overall, New York Life now ranks fourth in the insurance industry on the basis of assets and revenues, and in life insurance sales. And, onceagain, New York Life and its subsidiary, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), have receivedhigh marks from the major ratings agencies. For claims-paying ability, both Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelpsassign us AAA, their highest ratings. For financial strength, A.M. Best gives us an A++, its second highest classification, and Moody's Investors Service gives us Aa1, its second highest of 19 possible ratings. Our consistently high ratings are further proof that we keep the needs of our policyowners at the forefront of every decision we make. Our financial strength will enable us to pay out $1.2 billion in dividendsin 1996, the highest amount in New York Life's history. 1995 was also a year of change for our Board. President George Bundschuh took a long-planned early retirement on October 1, 1995. George's New York Life career spanned 36 years, and he was a valued member of both our Board and our Company. He will be missed for his intellect and vision. As chairman, I will especially miss George. We worked closely on many issues and his advice was always invaluable. It was imperative that his replacement also be an innovative leader who believes in the New York Life commitment to provide quality sevice and sound financial management. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to have Sy Sternberg as my co-signer on this letter, having succeeded George as president. Sy joined New York Life in 1989 as head of Group operations. With his steady leadership and innovative thinking, this area became a major player in the health care arena, culminating in the creation of NYLCare. Now, as president and chief operating officer, Sy has all of the business operations of the Company reporting to him. He is the vice chairman of twoBoard committees: Executive & Insurance and Investment. We also welcomed three new Board members and were heartened by the recent return of a former Director. Our new membersare Robert Baylis, former vice chairman of CS First Boston, Inc., who is a member of the Investment Committee; Kent Foster, the president of GTE Corporation, who is a member of the Executive & Insurance Committee; and Leslie McCraw, the chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor Corporation, who also serves on the Investment Committee.Conrad Harper, a partner at the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, left the Board three years ago to serve asa legal adviser to the Department of State and as a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague. Herejoined the Board in 1996. Mr. Harper is a member of the Executive & Insurance Committee. We should benefit greatly from the insight and years of experience each man brings to the Company. We want to take the opportunity of this letter to reaffirm the Company's traditional promises to you: to remain strong; to take every opportunity for prudent, managed growth; and above all, to be here for you when you need us. Whenyou dream a world -- for yourself or your children -- you may not hear our name or see our buildings, but we are there. We always will be. NYLCare Click here to go to the NYLCare web site.

The Company's first formal contributions budget was established in 1951. Since then, theCompany and, subsequently, the New York Life Foundation -- which was created in 1979 and isnow the Company's main vehicle for charitable giving -- have contributed more than $63 millionto a variety of national and local organizations across the country. Today, the New YorkLife Foundation supports a wide range of health and human service agencies, educationalinstitutions, arts and cultural groups, as well as civic and community organizations. Periodically, the Foundation selects areas of special focus within one or more of thesecategories. Its current priority areas are AIDS and literacy. The Foundation makes annual grants to more than 150 United Ways across the country in citieswhere New York Life offices are located. In 1995, recipients of other major grants includedthe National AIDS Fund, Literacy Volunteers of America, the Life and Health Insurance MedicalResearch Fund, Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, and Literacy Volunteers of New YorkCity. New York Life doesn't view its contributions program as one that "gives away" money. Grantsare made as investments in organizations whose work enhances the quality of life of thepeople they serve, thus ensuring a better future for society as a whole. Frequently, the Foundation is able to combine its financial support with the Company'sgreatest asset -- the talent and expertise of its people. For example, the Foundation forIndependent Higher Education (FIHE), which represents 600 independent colleges across thecountry through its 38 state and regional associations, has received more than $5.2million in grants. In many instances, this support has been coupled with the involvement ofCompany officers, managing partners, and agents in both the national and local FIHEorganizations. Whether it's through the Foundation's matching gift program for colleges and universities, orits Local Volunteer Action Program, which makes grants to community groups where New YorkLife employees and agents volunteer their time, the New York Life family consistentlydemonstrates its commitment to community participation.

And all permanent life insurance generates acash valuethat you can use to finance personal goals. But there's one thing most life insurance plansdon't offer:choice in how your money is invested. New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation(NYLIAC)offers a plan that does: Variable Universal Life (VUL).1 Variable Universal Life puts you in control of your life insurance. You can adjust yourpayments to suityourchanging needs. And you can even decide how your dollars will be invested - which means you have a say in howyourmoney may grow.

Flexible Protection and Flexible Payments With NYLIAC's Variable Universal Life, you have the freedom to choose the amount of lifeinsuranceprotection that best suits you. As your needs change, you have the option of increasing ordecreasingyour coverage.2 You can also control theamount and frequency of your payments. For example, if you're looking to accumulate as muchas youcan for the future, you can make a lump-sum contribution or increase your payments. Thatextra moneycan help increase the cash value of your policy, so when a personal or business opportunitypresentsitself, you'll have access to those funds.3Or if you need to temporarily cut back on your payments, youmay be able to pay less premium than usual and let the policy's accumulated cash value coverthe rest. Flexible payments let you make the choices. Flexible Investment Features With Variable Universal Life, you control how your money works for you. You can choose amongseveralfundingoptions, including stock, bond, balanced, or money-market accounts. There's also a FixedAccount witha minimum guaranteed rate of 4%. By contributing at regular intervals through "dollar cost averaging," you may get a loweroverall cost onthe units in which you're investing, without having to time the financial markets.4 What's more, you're never locked into yourinvestment choices - you can change them. You can also secure any gains you may make bytransferring them into the Cash Management portfolio or, on a limited basis, the FixedAccount.5 Those earnings can thenremain there tax-deferred. Whatever options you select, you control the investment choice. Customized Policy Design You can customize Variable Universal Life to fit your lifestyle. Ask your NYLIFE Securitiesregisteredrepresentative how you can add different policy features that can help you provide financialprotectionfor your spouse and children, keep the policy in force during disability, increase thebenefit if you dieaccidentally, or tailor the plan to cover other needs.

NYLIC and such subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to collectively as "the Company". Separate unconsolidated financial statements are shown for NYLIC and NYLIAC. All significant intercompany transactions, primarily the net equity of the insurance subsidiaries, have been eliminated in consolidation. Other subsidiaries are recorded at their underlying net equity, with the exception of NYLIC's investment in Express Scripts, Inc., a 69% owned subsidiary, which is carried at market value as allowed under New York State law. NYLIC is a diversified financial services company which offers a wide range of insurance and investment products and services, including life and health insurance, pension products, mutual funds (through its broker-dealer subsidiary), and other investments, to a large cross section of the total insurance market. NYLIAC offers a wide variety of interest sensitive insurance and annuity products. Effective January 1, 1996, NYLIC merged its Health Maintenance Organization subsidiary, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, and its Group life and health indemnity operations (which will be transferred to NYLHIC via a reinsurance agreement) into an integrated health care subsidiary, NYLCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYLCare), whereby NYLHIC will be a downstream subsidiary of NYLCare. NYLAZ expects to offer a Corporate Owned Life Insurance/Variable Universal Life product for sale in 1996. Note B: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York and Delaware State Insurance Departments ("statutory accounting practices"). Presently, these statutory accounting practices are considered generally accepted accounting principles for mutual life insurance companies and their wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an Interpretation, effective for 1996 financial statements, which establishes a different definition of generally accepted accounting principles. If the Company chooses to adopt the accounting changes required under this new definition, the effect of the changes would be reported retroactively through restatement of all previously issued financial statements presented for comparative purposes. The cumulative effect of adopting these changes would be included in the earliest year restated. Financial statements prepared in conformity with statutory accounting practices would continue to be required by insurance regulatory authorities. Under statutory accounting practices: (1) bonds and mortgage loans on real estate are stated principally at cost after amortization of premium and discount, preferred stocks are stated generally at cost, and common stocks are stated at market value; (2) the value of invested assets has been adjusted for impairments that are other than temporary; (3) an asset valuation reserve is reported as a liability; (4) an interest maintenance reserve is reported as a liability to capture interest-income over the estimated remaining lives of the investments sold; (5) premiums are taken into income over the premium-paying period of the policies; guaranteed investment contract funds are recorded as income when received; (6) matured guaranteed investment contracts are included in benefit payments; (7) commissions and other costs in connection with acquiring new business are charged to current operations as incurred; (8) pension costs are based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions"; (9) unfunded postretirement benefit costs other than pensions are based on National Association of Insurance Commissioners requirements, which include establishing a liability for retired and fully eligible active employees; (10) policy reserves are based on mortality tables and interest assumptions which are consistent with statutory requirements and are designed to be sufficient to provide for contractual benefits; (11) dividends to policyowners consist principally of dividends expected to be paid during the subsequent year; (12) provision is made for federal income taxes estimated to be payable; (13) certain assets designated as "non-admitted assets" are not included in the Statement of Financial Position; (14) in 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for the equity base tax and as a result, federal income taxes were reduced by $46 million, $12 million and $58 million for NYLIC, NYLIAC and the Company, respectively. Note C: Bond investments in the Statement of Financial Position consist of the following (in millions): Chart for Note C: December 31, 1995 December 31, 1994 NYLIC NYLIAC Consolidated NYLIC NYLIAC Consolidated U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Corporations and Agencies $5,537 $1,840 $7,403 $4,990 $1,679 $6,682 U.S. Agencies, State and Municipal 9,980 3,563 13,544 9,024 2,965 11,992 Foreign Governments 1,353 324 1,676 1,400 298 1,699 Corporate 18,857 5,846 24,748 17,062 5,670 22,740 Other 1,867 689 2,556 1,658 529 2,187 Total $37,594 $12,262 $49,927 $34,134 $11,141 $45,300 Note D: In 1995, NYLIC and NYLIAC settled a class action suit related to the sale of whole life and universal life policies from 1982 through 1994. In connection with this and other litigation, after-tax provisions of $30 million and $45 million have been recorded in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Also in 1995, NYLIC's investment in NYLIFE Inc. was reduced by $90 million after tax to reflect the potential discontinuance of NYLIFE Inc.'s proprietary partnership operations and certain claims made in connection therewith. Note E: In December 1993, NYLIC issued Surplus Notes with a principal balance of $450,000,000: $150,000,000, 6.40% Surplus Note, due 2003 and $300,000,000, 7.50% Surplus Note, due 2023.

Living the "American Dream" has been a goal for generations. Thelovingfamily,thebeautiful home ... this is the stuff dreams are made of. But protecting yourdreamsandcaring for lovedones goes back a lot further than the "American Dream" - those intentionsareprobably asoldasmankind itself. Providing for your family's financial well-being meansputtingtogether acomprehensiveprogram that will take care of today's needs, as well as plan for tomorrow.Thiscustomizedplan mightinclude a mix of bank accounts, health insurance, life insurance, annuities,mutualfunds,and an IRA.When considering the need for life insurance, it's wise to take a close lookat theadvantages ofpermanent life insurance. This type of policy not only offers financialprotectiontosurvivors but can alsobenefit a family during the insured's lifetime. Why Permanent Life Insurance is Unique Whole life is the traditional form of permanent life insurance. It is justthat -permanent -you'reinsured for your entire life, provided, of course, that you continue to paypremiums. Yourcoverage cannever be canceled, and the premiums are fixed - they can never be increased.It isalso afeature-rich,customizable plan that can be tailored to suit you and your family's needs. How Permanent Life Insurance Helps Beneficiaries To many, the primary reason for having life insurance is to protect theirfamily'sfinancialfuture. Shouldthe insured die, life insurance helps pay off mortgages, fund collegeeducations,take careof finalexpenses, offset the loss of the insured's income and allows a family tocontinueitsstandard of living.In most cases, insurance proceeds pass to beneficiaries free of probatecosts,legal fees,localinheritance tax, and federal income tax. To the extent permitted by statelaw,insurancebenefits areprotected from claims of the insured's creditors. Benefits are generallypaidpromptly tobeneficiariesthrough a convenient, interest earning, no-fee checking account. Or if youprefer,you candesignate apayment method in advance, choosing from a variety of settlement optionsthat offerperiodicpaymentsuntil the proceeds are paid in full. Not only does permanent life insuranceoffer aguaranteed paymentto beneficiaries at the death of the insured, but it also provides importantbenefits duringyour lifetime. Benefits of Permanent Life Insurance During YourLifetime Unlike term life insurance, permanent life insurance is a value builder.Bothguaranteedvalues andnon-guaranteed values build up, tax deferred, over the years, and you canput themto workfor you in anumber of ways. Accumulation of cash values - A permanent life insurancepolicybuildsguaranteed cash value as youpay your premiums when due. These values are further enhanced since taxes onthemoney'sgrowthare deferred. This cash value can be accessed through a valuable loanprovision. Tapping into your cash values - You can borrow from yourpolicy'saccumulatedcash value by taking aloan at competitive interest rates. You can use these funds any way you wish- makea downpaymenton a home, finance a new car, or even start a business (the J.C. Penney andDisneyempireswerestarted with loans from life insurance policies). The loan privilege is avaluablefeature ofpermanent lifeinsurance, but keep in mind that borrowing against your policy's valuereduces yourinsuranceprotection. In addition, any time you take money out of an insurance policy,youmay besubject to stateand federal taxes. It may be advisable to borrow only with the intention ofrepaying yourloan in full.Insurance companies offer several convenient repayment methods to restoreyourpolicy'sfullvalue. Eligible for dividends - As "participating" insurance, apermanentpolicy iseligible for dividends if andwhen the company declares them. Each year, insurers determine how muchincomeneedsto beretained to build surplus. The remaining balance, if any, is returned topolicyowners in theform ofdividends. As they are considered returned premiums, dividends are nottaxable.Youcanuseyourdividends in a number of ways. Options include: leaving them on deposit withthe insurancecompanyto earn interest; using them to purchase additional insurance coverage;applyingthem topayall or partof your premium; or taking them as cash. Unlike cash value, dividends arenotguaranteed. The Flexibility of Permanent Life Insurance As needs change, a permanent policy can be modified to reflect thosechanges.Mostinsurancecompanies make a wide range of optional benefits and riders available thatyou mayadd toyour policyto enhance your existing coverage, extend coverage to family members, andhelpoutindifficult times.Additional underwriting may be required to add benefits or riders. Enhancing your coverage - Along with the additionalcoverageavailablethroughdividend options, youcan increase your protection by adding a low-cost term insurance rider toyourpolicy. Anaccidentaldeath benefit provision can also be added, which doubles the insuranceproceeds iftheinsured diesas a result of an accident. With an OPP (Option to Purchase Paid-upadditions)rider, youmayadd,within limits, extra money to your policy to provide additional deathbenefits andincreasecash value ona tax-deferred basis. Extending coverage to family members - You may add aspouseand children'sinsurance rider toprotect those loved ones with term insurance. With a children's insurancerider,they will becoveredwith term insurance, and be guaranteed the right to purchase permanent lifeinsurance, inspecifiedamounts at specified times, as they grow up. Help in difficult times - With a waiver of premium rider,premiumsare paidbythe company during aperiod of disability, as defined in the rider. Cash value, dividends, anddeathbenefit growas if you werestill paying premiums. An automatic premium loan feature prevents yourpolicy fromlapsingshould youmiss a premium payment. If cash value is sufficient, it uses those values topaythe premium.New YorkLife now offers a living benefits rider, which pays a benefit should theinsuredbecometerminally ill.New York Life also pioneered the unemployment rider1. This provision waives one annual premiumshould the policyowner become unemployed for a predetermined period of time.

Retiring Parents: Are theyprepared? Many people face their parents' retirement and aging without a second thought,assuming thatMomand Dad are in good financial shape and ready for the golden years. Making thisassumptioncan be aserious mistake. You and your folks may think they are adequately prepared forretirement,but how fardown the road have they looked? With average life expectancy increasing, it's not uncommon for people to live 10 to20 years,or longer,after retiring. A great deal can happen in that time, and life's events don'talways workout as planned. Culprits such as inflation and illness can wipe out a nest egg and undermine thefinancialindependence of even the best-prepared retiree. Inflation and Illness Can Turn a Nest Egg into a Goose Egg Inflation can seriously erode money's purchasing power over time. Even with a lowinflationrate of 4%,retirees at age 60 with an income of $2,500/month will have the purchasing power of$1,388/month bythe time they're 75 years old. In other words, the standard of living will bevirtuallyhalved in just 15years. Many retirees today find themselves searching for part-time jobs, in orderto keep upwith therising cost of living. But no one can work forever. And, in mere months, majorillness canwipe out anest egg that took years to build. According to the Abstract of the United States, 45% of an individual's lifetimemedicalexpenses areincurred during a final illness. That's only half the story. Research figurespublished bythe NewEngland Journal Of Medicine indicate that 43% of those who turned age 65 in 1990will enter anursinghome at some time during their lifetime. As people get older, the probabilityincreases. With nursinghome costs averaging more than $30,000 a year, it's not uncommon for retirees to bereducedtopoverty. When retirees' savings are depleted, it adversely affects the next generation, too- usuallyat the worstpossible time. Frequently, adult children of senior citizens are working to providefor theirownhouseholds and futures. Too often, they become saddled with the cost of supportingtheirparentswhile still trying to meet their own household expenses. It's a tough balancingact. Plan in Advance As an adult son or daughter, you must get involved with your parents' financialaffairs, andthe soonerthe better. Start with a meeting of the generations to discuss everyone's plans,wishes, andconcerns. Here are some topics to tackle, and questions to ask: Will your parents' retirement funds be adequate? Inflation and longer lifeexpectancies maymake retirement costlier than they've anticipated. What supplemental funds areavailable? Who will manage your parents' finances if they cannot? Discuss long-termfinancialplans, thelocation of records, and the possibility of establishing a contingent power ofattorney tostep in and helpduring an emergency. What are your parents' estate plans? When and how will they distributetheir property,especiallyif they become incapacitated? Are there any charitable endeavors or causes theywish tocontribute to? Do they have updated wills and an executor who knows their wishes? Are your parents' risk management programs adequate? Without adequatehealth coverage,asingle illness could wipe out an otherwise ideal retirement plan. (Some childrencost-sharetheirparents' premiums for Medicare Supplemental or Long Term Care insurance. They seeit as awiseinvestment in their parents' future.) What about life insurance? Do your parents have special medical requests, such as living wills,trusts, lifetimegifts, etc.? Where would they want to live, if incapacitated? (You may wish to discuss nursinghome and homehealth careoptions.) Problem Generally, parents and children feel uncomfortable discussing these matters. It'simportantto do thisin a way that puts both generations at ease. One solution is to bring in theservices of aprofessional -such as an insurance agent - who knows about retirement and estate conservationissues andwhocan serve as an objective and knowledgeable source of information for thatdiscussion.

However, through careful planning for your financial future, you can help manage risk. Risk is something you encounter everyday. Even crossing a busy street involves somerisk.Withinvestments, balancing risk and return can be a tricky operation. All investorswant tomaximize theirreturn, while minimizing risk. Let's face it, putting your hard earned dollars onthe linecan be downrightfrightening. Some investments are certainly more "risky" than others, but no investment is riskfree.Trying to avoidrisk by not investing at all can be the riskiest move of all. That would be likestanding atthe curb, neversetting foot into the street. You'll never be able to get to your destination ifyou don'taccept some risk. Ininvesting, just like crossing that street, you carefully consider the situation,accept acomfortable level ofrisk, and proceed to where you're going. Risk can never be eliminated, but it canbe managed.Let'stake a look at the different types of risk, how different asset categories perform,and theways andmeans to help manage risk. Types of Risk When most people think of "risk" they translate it as loss of principal. However,there aremany kinds ofrisk. Let's take a look at some of them: Capital Risk - Losing your invested monies. Inflationary Risk - Investment's rate of return doesn't keeppace withinflation rate. Interest Rate Risk - A drop in an investment's interest rate. Market Risk - Selling an investment at an unfavorable price. Liquidity Risk - Limitations on the availability of funds fora specificperiodof time. Legislative Risk - Changes in tax laws may make certaininvestments less advantageous. Default Risk - The failure of the institution where aninvestment ismade. How Do Different Assets Perform? It may seem that there are countless types of investment products to choose frombut,basically, thereare three types of core investments: cash (or cash equivalents), bonds, and stocks. Cash - Investments such as bank savings and checking accounts,Certificatesof Deposit (CDs), andTreasury Bills. The prices generally don't fluctuate very much. To investorsconcerned withloss ofcapital risk, cash would appear to be the most secure choice, as principal isguaranteedand/orinsured. Savings and checking accounts are highly liquid, as they can be readilyconvertedinto cash.With CDs, you may face liquidity risk, as they must be held for a predeterminedperiod oftime or may besubject to penalties for premature withdrawal. Although risk to principal may beminimal,loss ofpurchasing power, or inflationary risk, must be taken into consideration. Wheninflation andtaxation aretaken into account, returns can be considerably lower. Hypothetically, let's say in1981 youearned 14%in an investment. It sounds astronomical; however, the inflation rate at one pointthat yearsoared to15%. That's a net loss of value of at least 1% - and that's before taxes takeanother bite. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures a representative sample ofgoods andservices purchasedby American consumers. It is generally considered a primary measure of inflation.T-Bills arerepresented by the Salomon 1-3 year Treasury Index. It is an unmanaged indexgenerallyconsideredrepresentative of the U.S. short-term bond market. Bonds are represented by theSalomon HighGradeLong-Term Corporate Bond Index. It is a bond market indicator comprised of about800 bondswithmaturities of 12 years or more rated AA or AAA. Stocks are represented by S&P 500StockIndex, aregistered trademark of Standard & Poor's Corp. The Salomon and S&P Indexes areunmanaged anddo not include any charges or expenses that you may incur as a direct investor ofthesesecurities. Pastperformance is no indication of future results. Bonds - Commonly called "fixed income investments," they arebasically loansor "IOUs." Interest isearned on the money you lend. The prices of bonds do move up and down, but normallynot asmuchas stocks. Many people think of bonds as conservative investments, but the returnscan have ahighdegree of volatility. The fluctuation of interest rates is called interest raterisk, and adownturn in thebond prices could significantly decrease the overall return of any particular bond. Stocks - Represent equity in, or partial ownership of, acompany.An easywayto remember thedifference between stocks and bonds is: "With stocks, you own. With bonds, youloan." Theprice of astock or share can move up or down, sometimes a lot. The returns of stocks fromyear to yearcan bequite volatile, but, as the graph illustrates, the returnsfrom stockshavesignificantly outpaced inflation, and topped the returns from cash and bonds aswell, overthis twenty-year period. Finding Your Comfort Zone It's possible to achieve higher returns through stocks rather than bonds, andthrough bondsrather thanthrough cash, but you can't expect to get higher returns without taking on somedegree ofunpredictability. If you seek higher returns, you have to be willing to live withhigherrisk. "How much riskis right for me?" The answer will affect your investment decisions. Although pastperformanceis not aguarantee of what will happen in the future, historical results over a long periodof timecan help youmake your investment decisions. The Ways to Manage Risk There are a number of strategies that can help limit risk while offering thepotential ofhigher returns. Diversification - Investing in a variety of investments, orsimplyfollowingthe oldadage "Don't put allyour eggs in one basket." With a portfolio spread among several differentinvestments, youbenefit wheneach type is doing well, and also limit exposure when one or more investment isperformingpoorly. Asset Allocation - Building upon the diversification concept,withassetallocation you create acustomized portfolio consisting of several asset categories (cash, stocks, bonds)rather thanindividualsecurities. Changing economic conditions affect various types of assetsdifferently;consequently, eachasset category's return may partially offset the others'. Dollar Cost Averaging - Systematically investing a fixeddollaramount atregular time intervals. Whenthis disciplined program is adhered to and market fluctuations are ignored, itattempts to"smooth out"the ups and downs of the market over the long haul. Dollar cost averaging, however,cannotguaranteea positive return in a declining market and you must consider your ability tocontinueinvesting on aregular basis under all market conditions. The Means to Manage Risk Most investors find it difficult to diversify effectively across the full spectrumof cashand individual stocksand bonds. That is why so many investors have chosen variable products to apply thestrategiespreviously mentioned. Mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal lifeinsuranceproducts offer the potential for maximizing investmentperformance,investment flexibility, and convenience.

New York Life's SPIA is a product that cantake away these worries. Here's how it works: you give New York Life a one-time premiumpayment,and in return you'll receive a steady stream of income payments for the rest of your life, nomatter howlong you live - guaranteed. SPIA gives you more security than a typical savings account, which you continuously drawupon, hopingit will last your entire lifetime. SPIA doesn't have an account value you can access, but theincome youreceive from New York Life's SPIA is guaranteed never to run out. That's something asavings accountcan't offer you. And SPIA also offers you alternatives that can provide a lifetime income forboth you andyour spouse or provide income to your loved ones if you die prematurely. Your SPIA income is a fixed amount of money based on your age, your gender, the amountof yourpremium payment, and the frequency with which you receive your income payments:monthly, quarterly,semi-annually, or annually. We can send your payments directly to you or, if you'd like, wecan evenhave them deposited directly into your bank account. Best of all, SPIA is guaranteed by New York Life Insurance Company. Safe From Market Fluctuations In addition to providing a guaranteed lifetime income, SPIA can also take away some of theworry aboutmanaging your money. Unlike income from stocks and bonds, your SPIA payments won't beaffectedby market swings. No matter what happens in the financial markets, you'll keep receiving your money from NewYork Life. Tax-Qualified Money, Too1 If you have money tucked away in tax-qualified plans, such as an IRA or 401(k) plan, thatmoney willbecome taxable once you receive it. Not only could that extra money throw you into ahigher taxbracket,it could even subject up to 85% of your Social Security benefits to taxation. But by putting that money into New York Life's SPIA and spreading your receipt of it overseveral years,you may avoid having that extra income put you into a higher bracket. You may even beable to prevent(or limit) the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Furthermore, if you place tax-qualified money in SPIA, you might not have to worry abouthow to satisfythe Internal Revenue Services' Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) requirements -because yourSPIA could automatically satisfy them. This is important, because the IRS imposes severepenalties ifthese requirements aren't met. Maximize Your Income You can receive the highest income for your premium amount, gender, and age if you selectour "lifeonly" SPIA. It guarantees that New York Life will pay you regularly for the rest of your life. Upon yourdeath, payments will cease. Protect Your Spouse Sometimes, income for one life isn't enough. Many couples want to make sure that theyhave enoughincome to last for both of their lifetimes. If you select a Joint & Survivor SPIA, you will receivepaymentsfor as long as either one of you is alive. This way, both you and your spouse will beprotected againstoutliving the savings you've amassed together. Provide For Your Beneficiaries None of us like to think that if we were to die shortly after giving a lot of money to aninsurance company,that money would be completely lost. New York Life offers alternatives to prevent this: Guaranteed Period Certain SPIA: With this SPIA, you choose a minimum period of timeduringwhich you will receive payments: either 5, 10, 15, or 20 years from the date that youpurchased yourSPIA policy. If you die before this guaranteed number of years has passed, New York Lifewill continuesending your payments to your chosen beneficiary(ies) for the duration of the guaranteeperiod.2 Guaranteed Total Amount SPIA: With this SPIA, New York Life guarantees to pay you atleast theamount of your original SPIA premium payment. If you die before the total money you'vereceivedequals the amount of your original premium payment, New York Life will continue to payyour chosenbeneficiary(ies) until the total amount paid to you and your beneficiaries matches your initialpremium. This way, you and your beneficiaries will at least "get back what you paid in." Of course, no matter which type of SPIA you choose, New York Life will keep paying you aslong as youlive. But these additional alternatives enable you to make sure that your money will gotoward providingfor your needs or those of your loved ones. These alternative SPIAs can also help ease the burden on your beneficiaries if you diebefore all of theguaranteed payments have been made. That's because New York Life's payments godirectly to yourbeneficiaries, unlike many other assets that may get tied up in probate. Your SPIA paymentscould behelpful to your beneficiaries at a very difficult time. 1Please discuss all matters relating totaxationwith your ownprofessional tax advisor. 2 If you choose a Joint & SurvivorSPIA, you mayelect a 10-yearor 20-year Period Certain or a Guaranteed Total Amount. The 5-year and 15-year PeriodCertainoptions are not available with a Joint & Survivor SPIA.

SPL - A Unique Concept The Single Premium Life (SPL) Insurance concept is simple and straightforward: you pay asinglelump sum ($5,000 or more) for a paid-up, cash value life insurance policy. SPL can providethefinancial security that people seek from life insurance, along with an attractive means ofaccumulatingfunds for retirement or other long-term financial needs. SPL offers: A death benefit free from federal income tax (in some states it may also be freefrom statedeath tax, probate expense, and the claims of creditors). A competitive interest rate credited to the policy's cash value. Tax-deferred accumulation of the policy's cash value. The ability to access cash values through policy loans. The convenience of paying just one premium for a paid-up policy. "A Souped-Up Annuity"? No, SPL is not an annuity, even though many industry experts feel that it may be moreappropriate tocompare SPL to annuities than to traditional life insurance. SPL and single premiumdeferredannuities (SPDA) have many similarities: a single premium payment, tax-free accumulationof cashvalue, identical tax rules governing loans, and a guaranteed death benefit. But there arekeydifferences. The death benefit of SPL is usually a good deal larger than that of acomparable SPDA; infact, by tax law, the SPL death benefit must be considerably larger than its cash value. Also,in mostinstances, the death benefit of the SPL is free from federal income tax, while thebeneficiaries ofannuities incur taxable income on the gain in the contract. A Brief History of SPL In the mid-1980s, insurance companies introduced the innovative SPL policy designed tomaximizethree tax advantages of life insurance: generally no federal income tax on the death benefit,tax-deferredaccumulation of cash value, and tax-free borrowing from that cash value. Theseadvantages, along withcompetitive interest rates on the policy's cash value, made SPL a very popular product withsavvyconsumers. In 1988, Congress enacted legislation that affected the tax treatment of some life insurancepolicies,including SPL. It is now technically classified as a Modified Endowment Contract, whicheliminates thetax-free loan feature. Now, when you borrow from an SPL policy, it results in a taxabledistribution. Thelesser of the loan or gain is reported as a taxable gain. In addition, the IRS imposes a 10%penalty taxon the taxable gain distributed before the policy owner is age 59 1/2. To Whom is SPL Best Suited? While SPL is available to most ages (0 to 85), it can be a key part of the portfolio of mature,fairly affluentpre-retirees. It provides financial security and the potential for long-term capital growth. Under its current tax treatment, SPL may not be the mostappropriate productfor people with a need for current income. For those seeking tax-free policy loans as a toppriority in alife insurance product, a traditional permanent policy may be a better choice. With SPL, it isbest torestrict borrowing until after age 59 1/2, at which point the penalty tax would not apply. The Many Uses of SPL Providing a degree of financial security for yourself and your family remains a primaryadvantage of anSPL policy. SPL allows for only a single premium payment and generates an increasingdeath benefit. Beneficiaries of SPLproceedsreceive their funds free of federal income tax. Those funds can be used to pay off mortgagesand otherdebts, fund children's or grandchildren's educations, take care of final expenses, offset theloss of theinsured's income, and allow a family to continue its standard of living. To the extentpermitted by law,insurance proceeds are protected from the claims of the insured's creditors. Below areother benefitsand uses of an SPL policy: A Source of Retirement Income - Tax-deferred cash valueaccumulation can beconsiderable over the long-term. You can tap into that cash value through the valuable loanprovision tohelp fund a comfortable retirement. Since most policies will be classified as ModifiedEndowmentContracts, you would be taxed on these loans to the extent of gain in the policy, includingany unpaidloan interest. However, loans taken after age 59 1/2 would not be subject to the additional10% penaltyof the taxable amount. Outstanding loans are deducted from the death benefit. Gifts to Minors and Adults - A lasting legacy can be left to minorchildren andgrandchildren through the gifting of SPL. There is no gift tax due on SPL policies purchasedon achild'slife up to $10,000 of single premium. The children's parents should be made custodialowners of thepolicies. Parents can also make gifts to adult children. Using joint gifts or communityproperty gifts,parents can purchase SPL policies on each adult child for up to $20,000 with no gift taxconsequences. Withdrawals may be subject to a tax penalty if made before age 59 1/2. Charitable Giving Uses - Using an SPL policy, you can make alarger donationto your favorite charity. Over the long-term, SPL can multiply your single premium severaltimes over toprovide a generous donation to a worthwhile cause. Philanthropic bequests have becomeone of themost meaningful uses of life insurance. Lump-Sum Distribution Vehicle - If there's a substantial lump-sumdistributioncoming your way in the future, you might want to take a look at SPL. It can be a good placeto putinsurance proceeds, funds from the sale of a residence, an after tax distribution from aqualified plan,annual bonuses, or inherited funds. SPL is offered by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation. For more information on SPL and its suitability to your needs, contact your New York Lifeagent.

Or, ifyou'vealready savedenough for your retirement, do you need a place to maintain that money until you'reready touse it? Aplace where that money can grow, tax-deferred? Either way, your New York Life agentmayhave theproduct for you: SPRA-2 (Single Premium Retirement Annuity), a competitive deferredannuity designedto satisfy your retirement needs. A Secure Retirement How will you spend your retirement years -financially secure, or struggling to meetbasicneeds? Evenif you haven't reached retirement, the time to begin shaping your financial futureis now. Adeferredannuity could provide you with the money you need, down the road. Or perhaps you're already retired. Are you tired of watching taxes eat away at theinterestyou earn onyour CDs? Are your earnings from CDs or other investments triggering taxes on yourSocialSecuritybenefits? A deferred annuity could provide the solution. If you're looking for a savings alternative that can take care of your financialneeds andperhaps evenprovide a legacy for your children or grandchildren, SPRA-21 may be the right choice for you. SPRA-2 allows your money to grow tax-deferred at competitive interest rates. AndSPRA-2'sliberalwithdrawal provisions offer you the flexibility to control your financialsituation. Later on, youcan evenuse the money you've accumulated to generate a retirement income you can'toutlive. The Power of Tax Deferral With SPRA-2, your money grows tax deferred -which means you won't pay taxes on yourmoney whileit's growing, only as you withdraw it.2Your money grows faster in SPRA-2 than it would in acomparable, currently-taxable investment -because in SPRA-2, money that otherwisewouldbe usedto pay taxes remains in the policy and earns interest, too. This graph illustrates how SPRA-2 can help your money grow faster. It charts thegrowth of atax-deferred vehicle at 8%, compared to a similar, currently-taxablevehicle.3 With SPRA-2, you can get more mileage out of money that's currently sitting in a CDor othercurrently-taxable investment. You can also use it to consolidate several smallerIRAs. And ifyou'reretiring, changing jobs, or if your company's pension plan is terminating, you cantakeadvantage ofSPRA-2 and continue growing your pension money in an IRA rollover. Competitive Rates, Plus First Year Enhancement SPRA-2 offers a competitive base interest rate and it also has a 1% interestenhancement on that rate for the first policyyear.4 Each year thereafter,on yourpolicy anniversary, you'll receive NYLIAC's competitive base interestrate. Historically, NYLIAC's base interest rate has been consistently higher thanthe averageone-yearCD rate5 and is guaranteednever to beless than 3%. And with SPRA-2, higher amounts earn evenhigher interest rates.6 Also,unlike manyfinancial alternatives, SPRA-2 doesn't have up-front salescharges or annual maintenance fees that can hinder your money's growth. Access To Your Money SPRA-2 is a product for building money over the long term, and withdrawals duringthe firsteight policyyears may be subject to a surrender charge as follows: Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and later Surrender Charge7 7% 7% 7% 7% 6% 5% 4% 3% None However, emergencies do arise, so SPRA-2 has a 10% "window" that allows you to takeupto 10% ofyour money, each year, without any surrender charges. And after eight years, youcan takeout as muchmoney as you want, at any time, without any surrender charges.8 Compare this with a typical CD, where twenty yearsfromnow you'llstill face a penalty when you withdraw your money (except on the maturitydate).9 With SPRA-2, you can request withdrawals as often as you'd like. If you want steadypayments, we cansend your interest, your 10% window, or any other amount on a regular basis -monthly,quarterly,semi-annually, or annually.10 We caneven have it deposited directly into your bank account. Flexibility and Control Unlike many financial products, SPRA-2 offers you flexibility and control over whenyoureceive income-and when you pay taxes on it. You can wait until you're retired and in a lower taxbracketbefore youbegin to withdraw money. You can also spread your withdrawals over several years,to evenout yourtaxburden and avoid throwing yourself into a higher tax bracket or increasing thetaxation ofyour SocialSecurity benefits.

Even if you have been financially preparingand have amassed whatyou think is an adequate retirement income, think again. Often, people will basetheir retirementestimates on several mistaken, but commonly-held, assumptions regarding retirementand whatvariousresources will provide. In many cases, the reality of retirement turns out to bequite different from whatthese common "retirement myths" would lead one to believe. 1. Myth: I'll have Social Security to support me. Reality: Wrong. Social Security was never designed to cover income needs, butrather tosupplement your pension and personal savings. Here's an idea of what you canexpect from SocialSecurity: if your annual earnings are $25,000, $40,000, $60,000, Social Securitycan provide 50%,27%, 23% of your annual income, respectively. At least, that's what you can expect if you retire now. However, some experts haveestimated that by thetime today's working baby boomers are ready to retire next century, there may notbe enough people leftin the work force to fully fund Social Security benefits. That's all the morereason to look into building upyour retirement savings. 2. Myth: My living costs will be lower when I retire, so I'll need lessmoney. Reality: Many times, just the opposite is true. The only costs that may endare mortgage paymentsand the college tuition you may now be paying. Health care costs could rise,especially if you no longerhave employer-sponsored medical/dental coverage. Also, many retirees frequentlyeat out, which couldincrease food bills. And you'll probably want to pursue your favorite hobbies,recreational activities, and"dream" vacations. 3. Myth: I'll have my company pension to tide me over. Reality: Don't count on a pension as your main source of income. Most defined benefit plans are geared toward providing a replacement ratio of between 40% - 60%of your finalaverage salary. This amount generally will be paid only if the employee has 25 ormore years of servicewith the employer. Also, defined benefit pensions are often reduced for paymentsto Social Security. Under typical circumstances, the actual replacement ratio can drop to between 20%and 30% of thefinal average salary for a rank-and-file employee. Naturally, each situation is different for each person. But many retirees havemade the mistake ofcounting on their pension, only to have to find part-time jobs to pay the bills. With the right planning, thiswon't happen to you. 4. Myth: I'm too old to begin planning for retirement now. Reality: Not true. Maybe you can't make up for lost time and opportunity butit's never too late tostart saving. Someone who takes early retirement at age 55 may still be goingstrong after 30 years. So, while you'll have to contribute more to your retirement savings account than ifyou had startedearlier, you can still be ready for your retirement - if you start now, and do whatneeds to be done. 5. Myth: The equity in my home is my retirement fund. Reality: While a house may be your largest investment, residential real estatedoes not alwaysappreciate. Even when home prices do rise, they usually increase along with allother living expenses. Even if you sell and move to a smaller home, you may wind up with far less money,after paying capitalgains taxes, than you expected. And, when all your savings have been depleted, youcan't sell yourhouse, piece by piece, in order to eat. That's why it's important to have liquidassets that will be therewhen you need them. 6. Myth: My main goal should be to preserve my savings. Reality: Inflation is a money-killer, and it will deplete your principal. Tostay ahead of inflation, youshouldn't seek to preserve money, but to build on it. Did you know that aretirement income of $20,000in 1970 would have to increase to $67,000 in 1990 to have the same purchasingpower? A solidfinancial plan allows your assets to grow, so that you can keep up with the risingcost of living.

If you are 43 years old today and expect to begin receiving Social Security benefits atage 66,your"normal retirement age" under present law, you may be in for a surprise. In the year2016 theSocialSecurity program will begin running cash deficits. At first, the problem will be manageable: benefit payments and administrative costs willexceedincomeby only $13 billion. Within five years, however, the shortfall will be $200 billionannually. Tenyears later,it will be nearly $1 trillion. By the early 2020's, if not earlier, Social Securitybenefits will almostcertainlyhave to be reduced, if the program is to have any hope of meeting its obligations. Social Security's Board of Trustees, whose financial projections are the basis for thisanalysis,saysnot to worry, the system won't go broke until 2036. They estimate that the trust fundswill rise to ahealthy nest egg of $5.6 trillion in 2024, two and a half times the projected annualpayout at thattime. According to the trustees, benefits will then be assured for another 12 years, as theassets in thetrustfund are sold off. There is a major problem, however, with the trustees' projection of a40-yearmarginof safety: there may be no money in those trust funds when it is time to draw them down.Themoneymay have already been spent on other government programs. When Social Security's income exceeds its expenses, the surplus is retained by theTreasury andusedto meet the government's non-Social Security expenses. For example, the recent gradualrise inSocialSecurity payroll taxes, from 10.8 percent of wages and salaries in 1983 to 12.4 percenttoday, hasled toannual surpluses that went to finance B-2 bombers, farm subsidies, savings and loanbailouts,andother general federal expenditures. In return for using these funds, the Treasury issuesspecialbondsto the trust funds. When Social Security's expenses exceed its income, theoretically these bonds can beredeemedtomeet current obligations. Beginning in 2016, the Treasury will need to begin redeemingthesebonds.They will have to find the cash somewhere else. Unfortunately, the choices are limited,and nonearepolitically attractive. The Treasury has three options: Sell bonds to the public. Whether the public has sufficientappetite to buy additional bonds at an average rate of $500 billion per year, even in the inflated dollars of 2025-2035, remains to be seen. Raise taxes. Policymakers can raise taxes to provide theTreasury with the necessary money. More directly, they could raise Social Security taxes, reducing the need for bond redemptions. Print money. This would increase the inflation rate. BecauseSocial Security benefit increases are tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index, inflation would result ineven higher benefit costs and the need to redeem bonds more rapidly, not to mention otherdeleteriouseconomic effects. Rather than trying, probably unsuccessfully, to redeem the trillions of dollars in bondsaccumulatedover several decades, policymakers would likely enact a package of revenue increases andbenefitreductions that would bring Social Security's income and outgo into balance in 2016, orshortlyafter.The following big ticket items are likely to be included in such a package: Increased Social Security taxes. Tax increases are easy toexplain, and most workers pay the additional amounts through withholding from wages and salaries. Increased taxation of benefits. Since 1984, beneficiaries withmoderately high incomes ($25,000 for individuals, $32,000 for married couples filing joint returns)have paid federal income taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security benefits. The 50% figure can be raised easily. In fact, this has already been proposed so often that it is likelyto occur long before 2016. Reductions in COLAs. Social Security's cost-of-livingadjustments were delayed 6months by legislation in 1983. They could be delayed again, reduced, or frozen temporarily. Increase the Normal Retirement Age (NRA). The 1983 legislationraised the NRA gradually, from 65 for workers born before 1938, to 67 for those born after 1959. These changes are present law, not just proposals. Congress has already demonstrated that itcan raise the NRA, and there is no reason to believe that they will stop at age 67. It certainly appears that the Social Security program will not be as rich for tomorrow'sretirees as itis fortoday's. People who hoped to be enjoying their retirement after 2016 should start savingmorenow ifthey want to maintain a comfortable standard of living after retiring. The necessaryamountscannot besaved during the last few working years; they must be accumulated over a much longerperiod oftime.Even if the trustees are correct, Social Security will have serious problems beginningin 2036 andwillneed to change. Today's workers need to know that now, while they still have time tomodify theirretirement planning.

How Much Life Insurance Do You Need? The main purpose of life insurance is to provide financial security for yourfamily. It helps to ensure thatwhen you die your family will have the financial resources it needs to provide foryour spouse, children,an elderly parent or some other dependent. However, life insurance also may beused to meet a varietyof long-term financial goals. It can help provide educational funds for yourchildren or funds for yourown retirement. The question that most families and individuals have, then, is"How much lifeinsurance do I need?" The answer depends largely on your family's individualcircumstances. There are no hard and fast rules for determining how much life insurance is enough,because no twoindividuals have exactly the same needs. You may be single, supporting no one butyourself. Or, you maybe supporting an elderly mother or father. You may have several children, but alsotwo incomes andconsiderable net worth. Whatever your situation, if you are providing financial support for people who aredepending on you, youneed life insurance. However, there are several things to consider when you buylife insurance, sincethe proceeds can be used with several goals in mind. For example, proceeds can: Provide ready cash for final expenses: These could include funeral costs,medical expenses,probate fees, and estate taxes. Pay off outstanding debts: not only hospital bills, for example, but a mortgageor an auto loan. Provide replacement income in amounts necessary to cover: A readjustment period of two or three years after your death. If you are a two-income family, it takestime to adjust to one paycheck instead of two. If you are the sole wage earner,with young childrenathome, your spouse's need for a readjustment period is obvious. The period while children under age 18 still are at home and dependent. (Social Security benefits that may be available supply only part of your family's income needs.) The college years, when Social Security benefits for dependents come to an endjust as expensesgrow. The years between the time the youngest child becomes independent and thesurvivingspouse reaches retirement age. The period after the survivor retires and receives Social Security or apension. In general, determining how much life insurance you need means deducting the sumtotal of theincome that would be lost upon the insured's death from the sum total of yourfamily's ongoingfinancial need. It also means calculating the impact of inflation (usuallyassuming 5% per year) andbuilding in enough "extra" to counteract inflation's effects. It may seemcomplicated, but it is an exercisethat is well worth doing. It is also one that you do not have to tackle alone. A life insurance agent can help determine how muchlife insurance yourfamily will need over time, based on the extent of your financial responsibilitiesand the kinds andamounts of your other resources. It may be that the solution to your insurance needs entails using a combinationof several plans,and the combination may need to be changed as your situation changes. Fortunately, life insurance is flexible - with several types of plans available -and an agent can work withyou to determine what products will best fit your ongoing needs and future goals.

It is used widely to solve business buyout and executive benefitproblems. Forsplit dollar towork, two parties are required who "split" premiums and benefits. In the IRSdefinition, splitdollar "isan arrangement whereby the party with the need and the party with the ability topaypremiums join inpurchasing an insurance contract in which there is a substantial investmentelement." (Rev.Rule.64-328) How Split-Dollar Insurance Works In one typical arrangement, a corporation will purchase an insurance policy onthe lifeof an ownerorkey employee, and will pay 100 percent of the premiums. The insured can own thepolicyand name apersonal beneficiary. The cash value and a portion of the death benefit will beowned as"collateral" bythe corporation to the extent of the premiums paid. The terms of the corporation'sinterestare spelledout in a "collateral assignment form" and a separate legal agreement. If theinsured dieswhile thecollateral assignment is in effect, the corporation recovers premiums paid from thedeathbenefit. Theremainder goes to the insured's personal beneficiary. If the insured lives for anumber ofyears, theinsurance cash value may be sufficient to repay the corporation for its entireoutlay. Thepolicy may thenbe "rolled out" to the insured, who can continue the plan as a personal insurancepolicy. For tax treatment, the corporation cannot deduct its premiums, nor is theemployeetaxed on thosepremiums. Rather, the employee is taxed on what the IRS calls "the economicbenefit,"which is thecost of insurance benefit as defined by the IRS. A "tax wise" variation of split dollar works as outlined above, with oneadditionalwrinkle. Here theinsured pays a portion of the premium out of his or her own pocket; the corporationpays thebalance. Inthis variation, called "contributory split dollar," the insured is not taxed onthat part of theeconomicbenefit paid with personal funds. The employee's share of the premium can equalorexceed theeconomic benefit. Uses of Split-Dollar Insurance Business buyout: Al and Luiz are co-owners of Computer Works, Inc. Bothseethevirtue of abuy-and-sell agreement and the logic of funding that permanent need with permanentlifeinsurance. Neither Al nor Luiz, however, wants to pay permanent insurance premiums from hisownpocket. Hereis what they do. Al and Luiz apply for insurance, each on the life of the other,in an amountsufficient tofund the buy-and-sell agreement, and they name themselves beneficiary. The bulk ofthepremiums arepaid by the corporation on a split dollar basis. Al and Luiz contribute only anamount equalto theeconomic benefit, roughly the same amount that they would have spent on a standardtermpolicy. Eventually, Computer Works, Inc. will recover its premiums from either the cashvalue or thedeathbenefit in accordance with the split-dollar agreement and collateral assignmentform. Splitdollarenables Al and Luiz to achieve an important business continuation objective in away that isfair andeffective. Executive Benefits: Goodman, Inc. is wholly owned by an architect, EllenGoodman. Inaddition toseveral other employees, Ellen employs a skilled thirty-five year old designer,Karl Schmidt. Ellenwould like to retain Karl's services, but is not eager to install a benefitsprogram for allemployees. After considering a number of alternatives, Ellen, on the advice of her CPA,chooses asplit-dollar planfor Karl. Split dollar provides Karl with a significant death benefit. Equallyattractive are thecashvalues. Even after repaying Goodman, Inc. for its premium contribution, the policy maybuildsignificantcash values by the time Karl is sixty-five. The plan is just too good forKarl to walkaway. ForGoodman, Inc., split dollar is a cost-effective way to retain a valued employee. Split dollar can also be an estate planning tool. Properly structured, thepolicyproceeds from theplancan be kept out of the insured's estate. Those contemplating a split-dollar planshouldcontact theirNew York Life agent, as well as their own legal and financial advisors. Split dollar is not something for nothing, but for the insured it can be agreatdeal forvery little.

What It Can Do For You What it Can Do for You Let's face it - you work hard for your money, and that's why you need your money towork hardfor you. Of course, income tax is a fact of life - and it's not something you have a greatdeal ofcontrol over. However, there is a way to accumulate money without having to pay taxes on it - atleast notuntil youuse it. It's called tax deferral, and several types of insurance and financialproductsoffer it. What is Tax Deferral? With tax-deferred products, you don't pay taxes on accumulated funds, interest ordividendsuntil youactually withdraw the money. Since the gain in a tax-deferred product isn't taxeduntil it'swithdrawn, itusually accumulates at a faster rate. For this reason, tax-deferred accumulationcan providea powerfulfinancial edge. If you participate in a 401(k) plan offered by your employer or if you own anIndividualRetirementAccount (IRA), you're already enjoying the benefits of tax-deferred accumulation. Manyinsurance andannuity products also offer this advantage. Even the interest and dividendsgenerated bytheseproducts generally avoid current income taxes! The Power of Tax Deferral The following chart shows the tremendous difference tax deferral can make in therate atwhich yourmoney grows. If we assume that a single sum of $50,000 will be invested for 30years at ahypotheticalinterest rate of 8%, we see that the tax-deferred vehicle provides better long-termaccumulation. If youare in the 31% tax bracket, you may be able to accumulate about $250,620 in ataxableaccount. However, if you used a tax-deferred account for the same investment, you mayaccumulate over$503,100. (Please note that a 10% IRS tax penalty may be imposed on withdrawalsfromannuities,some insurance products, IRAs, or 401(k) plans, when these withdrawals are madebefore thepurchaser has reached age 59 1/2.) *Hypothetical rate used for illustrative purposes only. Not intended to predictnor guarantee any actual product results. This amount does not reflect the effect of applicable feesand/or charges. Let it Accumulate Tax-deferred products offer you control over your financial situation. Not onlydoes yourmoneyaccumulate but, if you are selective in your withdrawals and plan them accordingly,you canavoidgetting "hit" with too many tax consequences when you do withdraw the money. Here's why: Tax deferral strategies work best for long-term planning, usually retirementplanning.The idea is toleave the money where it is for a long time - to let it go and let it grow. Sureyou'll betaxed on the moneyyou start to withdraw after you've retired - but you may be in a lower tax bracketby then,which wouldserve to soften the tax blow. You can be selective in your withdrawals and plan them so that you do notsufferunnecessary taxconsequences. The tax system has "thresholds" (tax brackets) that will help youdetermine howmuchof these funds you can withdraw during a given year. If you are prudent with yourwithdrawals- and youdon't break into a higher tax threshold - then the effect of these withdrawals onyour taxeswill beminimal. Remember, you're only taxed on what you withdraw. Tax-Deferred Insurance Products The cash values in life insurance and annuities accumulate tax deferred. Anannuity offersyouprotection so you don't outlive your savings. It does this by generating a steadystream ofincome thatwill be taxed as you receive it - a little at a time. As for whole life insurance,the mainfeature is the deathbenefit protection it provides, but it also offers the additional benefit of cashaccumulation. (Note:Another major tax advantage of life insurance is that, in most instances, thepayout to yourbeneficiariesis income tax free!) For people who want to combine tax deferral with the potential growth from adiversified portfolio, there are variable universal life insurance and variableannuityplans. Both of theseoffer the opportunity to participate in investment accounts - and the associatedhigher levelof risk.However, like all tax-deferred products, they accumulate gradually over time. Thatis whyinsurance andannuity products - like most tax-deferred vehicles - may work best as long-termfundingvehicles. Only you can determine what your financial needs are - right now and later in your life. But it's important to remember that sooner or later, many of us canbenefit from tax-deferred products. Talk to your New York Life insurance agent oryour NYLIFE Securities registered representative, and examine your needs -- notjust your immediate goals but your long-term goals. You'll see whether tax-deferredproducts could be right for you. This discussion is not intended to portray the features of any particular product,but simply to illustrate the concept of tax deferral.

While a discussion about taxes may not be a topic of your nightly dinner conversation, it is an issue that concerns us all, and with good reason. In 1996, we spent over one-third of our time working for the government. Tax Freedom Day According to an annual report issued by the Tax Foundation, Americans worked the first 127 days of 1996, from January 1 to May 6, just to pay taxes. In theory, this means that on May 7 your job began toproduce spendable income and your taxable investments became profitable. Thisrepresents the latest Tax Freedom Day ever. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, took itsanalysis one step furtherand broke down the tax implications for each state. Connecticut was the unluckywinner, bearing the nation's largest tax burden in 1996 with a Tax Freedom Day of May 31. Alabama saton the opposite end of this spectrum with a Tax Freedom Day of April 23. The Eight Hour Work Day To put a different spin on the way Americans see their tax burden, the TaxFoundationexamined theportion of each eight hour working day necessary to pay federal, state, and localtaxes. In1996, theFoundation discovered that the average American spends 2 hours and 47 minutes eachworkingday topay the necessary federal, state, and local taxes. This is more time than it takesto pay forfood, shelter,and clothing combined. Most of this time, 1 hour and 50 minutes, covers the federaltaxportion. Theremainder, 57 minutes, covers state and local taxes. What Are Your Options? How can you reduce the time it takes to reach Tax Freedom Day next year? Askyourself threesimplequestions related to your financial situation in 1996: Did I receive 1099s from my bank accounts? Did I receive 1099s from other investments? Did I spend or reinvest the interest? If you earned taxable interest on investments that you expect to hold for the longterm, thenyou had topay current taxes on it. With taxable investments, the reality is that you don'talwaysliquidate yourholdings to pay taxes. In all likelihood, you pay the tax out of current income orout ofwithholding fromother income sources. This technique reduces your spendable income today, and mayreduce itin thefuture. Fortunately, there are sensible strategies that will help you maximizelong-termreturns whilepotentially reducing your tax bill. With investments like annuities, your earnings have the ability to accumulate on atax-deferred basis.Simply put, you don't have to pay current taxes on money that is ear-marked for thelongterm. Instead,all earnings are reinvested and continue to accumulate on a tax-deferred basisuntilwithdrawn. Ofcourse, withdrawals of earnings from annuities are taxable and, if you are underage 591/2, may besubject to a 10% tax penalty.

Sorry, it's just notthatsimple. Term life insurance has its place. If you're young or cash shy, term can be anideal stopgapsolution; itcan provide you and your family with maximum coverage for the lowest immediatepremiumoutlay. If thechoice is an adequate amount of term coverage versus no protection at all, terminsurance maywell bethe best choice. It is also very often the product of choice when protection needs may be high for aperiod oftime, thendrop back, such as when your family is growing. Term insurance can also be aneffective waytosupplement permanent insurance during high-need years, such as when family andotherfinancialresponsibilities are outpacing income. In these situations, term coverage allows you to obtain crucial death benefitprotectionwithout breakingyour budget. Also, if the coverage is convertible (the coverage can be "converted"to acomparable cashvalue policy, without the need to provide evidence of insurability), you can getthe coverageyou needtoday...with the ability to obtain permanent coverage in the future. In thisrespect, terminsurance meetsa valuable need. The True Cost of Term Life Insurance However, term insurance has its drawbacks. It certainly isn't right for all peopleor underallcircumstances. Among its weaknesses, be aware of the following: You do have to die to "win." As unpleasant as that sounds, it's true. Term lifeinsuranceprovides adeath benefit only, and only for a specific period of time. When the term ofcoverageexpires, so doesyour protection. Also, if you stop paying premiums, the coverage ends. Period. Let's say that you own $500,000 of term insurance. You've kept the coverage inforce forten years,andthe policy expires at midnight on December 31. If you die at 11:59 on New Year'sEve, yourfamilyreceives the full $500,000 in death benefit proceeds. However, if you die at 12:01on January1, yourfamily receives nothing under the policy, since the contract has expired. Purchasing term insurance has often been compared to renting a house. When yourent, yougetthefull and immediate use of the house and all that goes with it, but only for as longas youcontinue payingrent. As soon as your lease expires, you must leave. Even if you rented the housefor 30years, you haveno "equity" or value that belongs to you. There is the very real danger of becoming uninsurable when the term coverageexpires.Whilemanyterm policies are convertible to permanent coverage, others may not be. Most ofall, even ifthe coverageis convertible, there are time limits. If the policy is allowed to expire, you mayberequired to reapply. Ifyou are found to be uninsurable at that time, you will be without coverage. The long-term cost of term can become increasingly burdensome. Premiumsincrease at eachrenewal, with the price per thousand dollars of coverage becoming prohibitive formany peopleas theyget older. Many people buy term coverage when they're in their 20s because it seemsdownrightcheapcompared to a cash value policy with the same death benefit amount. By the timethey're intheir 40s,the coverage seems a bit pricey, as the rate goes up. In their 50s, the cost hasgenerallywelloutstripped the cost of permanent coverage. Finally, in their 60s, if not sooner,they dropthe policy - notbecause they no longer need the protection, but because they can't afford it.Meanwhile, theperson whomay have paid more for that permanent policy in his or her 20s may still be payingthe samepremium. The Value of Permanent Life Insurance Cash value life insurance is still the best long-term solution for many people. Thereasons: It always pays. Cash value life insurance provides life-long insuranceprotection. With fewexceptions,once you have been approved for the coverage, your policy cannot be canceled by thecarrier,providedyou pay all required premiums. Regardless of your health or other factors, theinsurance willremain inforce. Higher initial premiums can actually be less expensive than term in the longrun. Infact, the policymaybe able to "pay for itself." Most permanent policies are eligible for dividends,which arenot guaranteed,if and when they are declared by the insurance company. Many companies offer theoption toapplyaccumulated dividends towards payment of all or part of the premiums. If values aresufficient,out-of-pocket premium payments may end after several years, yet coverage cancontinue forlife. Solong-term net cost can be quite low compared to the total cost for a term policy. It can eliminate the problem of future insurability. Cash value life insurancedoes notexpire after acertain period of time. It does not need to be renewed. Also, some policies containguaranteedpurchase options, which allow you to buy additional coverage at specified times,regardlessof yourhealth. It builds cash value. These dollars - which, under many policies, areguaranteed - can beused inthefuture for any purpose you wish. If you like, you can borrow cash value for a downpayment ona home,to help pay for your children's education or to provide income for your retirement.(Note:Borrowing cashvalue from your policy will affect your total policy values.) Plus, if you decideto stoppaying premiumsand surrender your policy, the guaranteed policy values are yours.

It started out as a niceidea, butit has since grown into an administrative nightmare. If so, why not consider going from an"unbundled"to a "bundled" plan design? If yours is a classic "unbundled" plan, chances are you're quarterbacking a diverse team ofoutsidevendors: obtaining investment services from one vendor, recordkeeping from another, and plancommunications from yet a third, while your plan trustee involves yet still another contact. Or perhapsyou keep some services in-house, while outsourcing others. One problem: It can be confusing and inefficient. Your plan may have little, if any,systems integration. As a plan sponsor, you may have to make several contacts to conduct plan changes or obtaininformation. Plus, because noboby is responsible for the entire plan, there may be limitedaccountability among vendors. Not only are errors more likely, but the task of sorting themout will likelyfall back on your shoulders. A second problem: It can be unnecessarily expensive. Because you have hired separate"experts" foreach component of your plan, you should expect to pay more. Each "expert" comes with its ownprofitmargin requirements, which you will have to pay for. Additionally, since you have to managethedifferent players, your retirement plan can divert precious resources away from the businessofrunningthe business. An attractive alternative: "bundling" your pension plan. Bundling enables you toconsolidate, orbundle, as many aspects of your pension plan under one vendor as you deem necessary. As a result, you can offer your employees a quality 401(k) plan, for instance, that canreduce yourrecordkeeping costs by as much as 50%; provide enhanced benefit flexibility and service forparticipants and let your human resource people focus on human resource issues - not pensionplanmanagement.

Well, thetruth of the matter is, you can'tafford to delay. Early planning can help to maximize the power of time, and canhelp you reach yourfinancial goals. Time is on Your Side The concept of the power of time is a simple one: The sooner you begin to save foryour future financialneeds, the greater the wealth you can accumulate. Although the idea isstraightforward and logical,most people fail to recognize the enormous increase in value that can result frombeginning to saveearly. The best way to demonstrate the power of time is by way of example. Let'stake a look at thedifferent approaches to investing taken by twin brothers, Ken and Ray. Starting Early Ken, looking to build a large nest egg for his retirement, chose to invest $1,000per year in an IndividualRetirement Account (IRA), starting at age 30. He continued his payments for tenyears until age 40,earning an average of 8% per year on his investments 1. At age 40, he stoppedcontributing to the IRA,but left his $11,000 of contributions in the account, plus earnings, untilretirement at age 65. 1 8% interest is for illustrative purposes onlyand is not intended to predict nor guarantee the results of any security product. Starting Late Ray, the second twin, was a bright guy but a bit of a procrastinator. He too sawthe need to put moneyaway for his retirement but didn't begin his investment plan until age 41. At thatpoint he began investing$1,000 a year into an IRA. He also averaged an 8% annual return,1 but he continuedto make $1,000investments for 25 years until he retired at age 65. His contributions over theyears totaled $25,000. The Dramatic Difference Given the fact that Ken contributed $11,000 while Ray contributed $25,000, youmight expect that thesecond twin would have a significantly greater total for retirement at age 65.Surprisingly, just theopposite is true! Assuming the tax-deferred IRA of each twin earned 8% a year, at age 65 the accountbalance for thefirst twin would be $123,000, while the second twin would have $79,000. Thepreceding hypotheticalchart vividly illustrates the dramatic difference in the accumulated wealth for thetwo. The Cost of Waiting Ray was on the right track. He invested steadily and wisely, earning good returns -his only mistakewas getting a late start. Ray invested more than twice the amount his brother did,yet had less money toenjoy at retirement. By getting an earlier start, Ken benefited from more years ofcompounding. Left toaccumulate in his account, the earnings from his early years earned additionalreturns. In other words,"earnings earn earnings." The Impact of Time and Life Insurance Postponing the purchase of life insurance to a perceived "better time" can alsohave a definite cost ofwaiting. For example, let's take a look at Trish's quandary. She's identified theneed for $250,000 ofpermanent life insurance coverage. Trish is considering buying a $250,000 wholelife policy, whichwould provide immediate insurance protection, and offer guaranteed cash valueaccumulation thatcould, in the long term, be borrowed against to fund a child's college education orhelp supplementretirement income. At age 40, her annual premium would be $4,000, but she's debatingwhether or notto wait five years, at which point her premium would be $5,000. Looking at bothscenarios over the longterm, total premium paid would balance out by age 65 ($4,000 for 25 years, and$5,000 for 20 yearsboth equal $100,000). How Waiting Can Affect Cash Value, Death Benefit, andInsurability Waiting would have a negative effect on several key areas. A whole life policyoffers the benefit oftax-deferred accumulation of cash value. Generally speaking, the sooner you start,the faster your cashvalue will grow over the long term. These cash values can be accessed throughpolicy loans to helpmeet financial needs. In addition, a whole life policy is eligible to earn dividends, if and when theyare declared by thecompany. Unlike cash values, dividends are not guaranteed. Trish could use herdividends in a varietyof beneficial ways including using them to purchase additional insurance to enhanceher total deathbenefit. Waiting means missing five years of potential dividends and theopportunity to increase thebenefit paid to her beneficiaries. Waiting five years can also place Trish's insurability in jeopardy. She's insurableat age 40, but may beuninsurable due to a health condition at age 45. Perhaps the greatest risk inwaiting is if she were todie in the next five years. In that case, the cost would be the $250,000 deathbenefit her beneficiarieswould not be paid. Purchasing this policy now would cost no more than waiting five years. Cash valueand death benefit,however, should be higher. Most importantly, insurance protection would begin now.So why shouldTrish wait? It's Never Too Early to Start Although expenses like the kids' college tuition and your own retirement may seemlike distant images,it pays to face up to the future today. With college tuition rising at a rate of 6%to 8% a year (the CollegeBoard, September 1993), you'll need all the time you can muster to meet thosespiraling costs. Lookingfarther down the road, a company pension and Social Security payments may notafford the lifestyle youdesire in retirement. Your financial future is your responsibility, and with early,careful planning, you canmake for a brighter one. As Ray discovered, waiting just a few years can meanthousands of dollarsless waiting for you. Time can be an important investment ally. You should considerplanning andinvesting, and put the power of time on your side.

It provides an understanding of the principles of mechanical, fluid, electrical and thermal systems, and the mathematics associated with them. The full two-year course includes14 units of instruction focused on the principles that your students will need to understand if they want to compete in today's hightechnology job market. Technical Concepts is Energy Concepts' laboratory system of experiments and equipment to implement Principles of Technology This system solves problems relating to classroom management, such as size, inventory control and storage. From a technical point of view, the system assures accuracy and repeatability of each laboratory experiment. Energy Concepts called upon its 40 years of experience in developing systems for teaching technical subjects. ECI engineers developed new mechanical breadbording techniques that allow students to perform experiments on a bech top, and allows them to accomplish each experiment with accuracy, repeatability and speed. Most important, the ECI includes a clearly written and professionally illustrated laboratory manual. This manual provides the only specific laboratory setup and easy-to-use, step-by-step procedures abailable to implement Principles of Technology. ECI's laboratory manual is keyed to the Principles of Technology text and instructor's guide. More high schools, technical centers and colleges have chosen Energy Concepts' Technical Concepts lab system to implement Principles of Technology than any other lab system available (over 1000 labs have been installed). Our comprehensive lab manuals, supplementary computer math models, reliable laboratory equipment, and time-saving equipment management system provide a complete and unparalleled laboratory package for implementing Principles of Technology. Lab Manual ECI's Laboratory Manual is designed to supplement the Principles of Technology and help the student develop a thorough understanding of the subject matter.

Instructor's Guide and Instructor's Resource Manual A comprehensive Instructor's Guide and Instructor's Resource Manual are included to provide coordination and efficient equipment utilization. The Instructor's Guide includes sample data values for easy comparison to the students' results, plus answers to all quiz questions in the Lab Manual. The Instructor's Resource Manual provides an strategy for efficient use of the equipment, and gives supplemental information. Copy masters are provided to make overhead transparencies for classroom instruction. Computer-Aided Instruction Computer Math Models for Principles of Technology is a teaching and learning resource developed for use with ECI's Lab Manual and laboratory system. This computer program supplements the Principles of Technology curriculum, providing immediate feedback on data collected during labs, and correlating directly to the Lab and Instructor's Manuals. Students progress at their own pace, using onscreen help to answer questions related to lab setup, data collection, and calculations. In labs where data is used to plot a graph, the program automatically saves student data in a graph file that may be plotted to a compatible printer. Each experiment includes a set of 10 true/false questions. Laboratory Furniture ECI's modular design lab furniture allows a wide range of custom configurations. From free-standing, island-style workstations with convenient storage bases, to mobile units, this versatile lab furniture fits beautifully into every lab. Function always folows form with ECI lab furniture. Die-cut foam storage tray inserts organize your equipment and assist in component inventory.

Covert Channels in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite Craig H. Rowland; 14 November 1996; ASCII Text; 53k Original & Source Code This paper demonstrates several methods of encoding secret data into the headers of the TCP/IP protocol. Main topics of interest include: Encoding data into IP headers. Encoding data into TCP headers. Specific areas of focus allow encoding of data into the IP identification fields and TCP sequence number fields for clandestine transmission of data to a remote host. Packets of data appear normal to network sniffers and packet filters, yet can contain hidden messages in either plaintext or ciphertext. Other methods revealed include a new technique where forged packets can be "bounced" off any Internet connected site to establish a communication path that appears to originate from the "bounced" host. Additionally, several methods are discussed regarding bypassing of packet filters with encoded data for communication with hosts inside a protected network. This paper contains actual demonstrations as well as source code for Linux 2.x systems to allow encoded transmissions between sites to be tested. Cracking Shadowed Password Files Phrack Vol. 5 Issue #46 GZip'd Postscript; 19k A Phrack article describing how to use the system call password function to bypass the shadow password file. Firewall Performance Measurement Techniques: A scientific approach Marcus J. Ranum; V-ONE Corporation; HTML FIRST Security Documents Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams A High Speed Firewall Architecture for ATM/OC-3c James Hughes; Network Systems Corporation; 1996; GZip'd Postscript; 32k Original The goal of ATM is high-performance wide area connectivity both site to site and end-point to end-point. Moving ATM from the labs and LANs to the MANs and WANs is not possible for many because of a lack of data stream policy, audit, commercial privacy, data integrity, and authentication within existing ATM switches, end-points or network offerings. This paper describes a device whose intended purpose is to add these security features while maintaining the end-to-end high-performance nature of ATM and to create the general direction that high-performance network security may take in the future. How to pick an Internet Firewall Marcus J. Ranum; V-ONE Corporation; HTML Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into it Dan Farmer; Sun Microsystems; HTML; 52k Every day, all over the world, computer networks and hosts are being broken into. The level of sophistication of these attacks varies widely; while it is generally believed that most break-ins succeed due to weak passwords, there are still a large number of intrusions that use more advanced techniques to break in. Less is known about the latter types of break-ins, because by their very nature they are much harder to detect. Improving the Security of your Unix System David Curry; SRI International; 1990; GZip'd Postscript; 99k This is the somewhat well known SRI Report on Unix Security. It's a good solid starting place for securing a Unix box.

IP Security, Creating Secure Intranets over the Internet James Hughes; Network Systems Corporation; 1996; HTML Original The technology to create interoperable secure encrypted tunnels over the internet is now possible. Secure intranets over the internet is an intriguing cost savings solution to replace high cost leased lines or frame relay services while at the same time increasing the security of that traffic. Measuring Firewall Performance Andrew Molitor; Network Systems Corporation; HTML In this paper, we develop some terminology to describe performance measurements, and develop an experiment to compare packet filtering against a proxy approach. The single limited case of FTP transactions is our primary focus. The results suggest that the maximum rate at which FTP sessions can be set up and torn down is unaffected by packet filtering, but approximately halved by a proxy. The bulk data transfer throughput is a little worse than halved by the packet filter used, and cut to one-fifth by the proxy used. Thus, it appears that proxies to perform substantially worse than packet filters. However, the actual results also suggest that with reasonably available fast hardware, throughputs quite close to wire rate, at least for the tests conducted, would be perfectly possible with either approach.

Packet Filtering in Internet Firewalls by Derek LaBar Abstract Firewalls are becoming a popular method of protecting private networks that wish to connect to the Internet. Many firewalls feature screening routers with packet filtering measures as an important security mechanism. This paper briefly states the basic ideas behind security policies followed by firewalls. It then summarizes why firewalls are justified, what they protect, and what they do not protect. The discussion proceeds to emphasize packet filtering implementations, particularly filtering by IP addresses, TCP ports, and protocols. Specific examples of filtering services such as FTP, X11, DNS, Telnet, and NTP are examined. Then popular firewall architectures involving screening routers are discussed pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of each type. Finally, future filtering strategies such as dynamic filtering and non-linear filtering methods are addressed. Copyright © 1996 SandCastle Ltd. All rights reserved.

Glossaryof firewall related terms Contributors What is anetwork firewall? A firewall is a system or group of systems that enforces an accesscontrol policy between two networks. The actual means by which this isaccomplished varies widely, but in principle, the firewall can bethought of as a pair of mechanisms: one which exists to block traffic,and the other which exists to permit traffic. Some firewalls place agreater emphasis on blocking traffic, while others emphasize permittingtraffic. Probably the most important thing to recognize about a firewallis that it implements an access control policy. If you don't have a goodidea what kind of access you want to permit or deny, or you simplypermit someone or some product to configure a firewall based on whatthey or it think it should do, then they are making policy for yourorganization as a whole. Why would I want a firewall? The Internet, like any other society, is plagued with the kind ofjerks who enjoy the electronic equivalent of writing on other people'swalls with spraypaint, tearing their mailboxes off, or just sitting inthe street blowing their car horns. Some people try to get real workdone over the Internet, and others have sensitive or proprietary datathey must protect. Usually, a firewall's purpose is to keep the jerksout of your network while still letting you get your job done. Manytraditional-style corporations and data centers have computing securitypolicies and practices that must be adhered to. In a case where acompany's policies dictate how data must be protected, a firewall isvery important, since it is the embodiment of the corporate policy.Frequently, the hardest part of hooking to the Internet, if you're alarge company, is not justifying the expense or effort, but convincingmanagement that it's safe to do so. A firewall provides not only realsecurity - it often plays an important role as a security blanket formanagement. Lastly, a firewall can act as your corporate"ambassador" to the Internet. Many corporations use their firewallsystems as a place to store public information about corporate productsand services, files to download, bug-fixes, and so forth. Several ofthese systems have become important parts of the Internet servicestructure (e.g.: UUnet.uu.net, whitehouse.gov, gatekeeper.dec.com) andhave reflected well on their organizational sponsors. What can a firewall protect against? Some firewalls permit only Email traffic through them, therebyprotecting the network against any attacks other than attacks againstthe Email service. Other firewalls provide less strict protections, andblock services that are known to be problems. Generally,firewalls are configured to protect against unauthenticated interactivelogins from the "outside" world. This, more than anything, helps preventvandals from logging into machines on your network. More elaboratefirewalls block traffic from the outside to the inside, but permit userson the inside to communicate freely with the outside. The firewall canprotect you against any type of network-borne attack if you unplug it. Firewalls are also important since they can provide a single "chokepoint" where security and audit can be imposed. Unlike in a situationwhere a computer system is being attacked by someone dialing in with amodem, the firewall can act as an effective "phone tap" and tracingtool. Firewalls provide an important logging and auditing function;often they provide summaries to the administrator about what kinds andamount of traffic passed through it, how many attempts there were tobreak into it, etc. What can't a firewall protect against? Firewalls can't protect against attacks that don't go through thefirewall. Many corporations that connect to the Internet are veryconcerned about proprietary data leaking out of the company through thatroute. Unfortunately for those concerned, a magnetic tape can just aseffectively be used to export data. Many organizations that areterrified (at a management level) of Internet connections have nocoherent policy about how dial-in access via modems should be protected.It's silly to build a 6-foot thick steel door when you live in a woodenhouse, but there are a lot of organizations out there buying expensivefirewalls and neglecting the numerous other back-doors into theirnetwork. For a firewall to work, it must be a part of aconsistent overall organizational security architecture.Firewall policies must be realistic, and reflect the level of securityin the entire network. For example, a site with top secret or classifieddata doesn't need a firewall at all: they shouldn't be hooking up to theinternet in the first place, or the systems with the really secret datashould be isolated from the rest of the corporate network. Anotherthing a firewall can't really protect you against is traitors or idiotsinside your network. While an industrial spy might export informationthrough your firewall, he's just as likely to export it through atelephone, FAX machine, or floppy disk. Floppy disks are a far morelikely means for information to leak from your organization than afirewall! Firewalls also cannot protect you against stupidity.

Its purpose is to ensure privacy bykeeping the information hidden from anyone for whom it is not intended, even those who can see the encrypted data. For example, one may wish to encrypt files on a hard disk to prevent an intruder from reading them. In a multi-user setting, encryption allows secure communication over aninsecure channel. The general scenario is as follows: Alice wishes to send a message to Bob so that no one else besides Bob can read it. Alice encrypts the message, which is called the plaintext, with an encryption key; the encrypted message, called the ciphertext, is sent to Bob. Bob decrypts the ciphertext with the decryption key and reads the message. An attacker, Charlie, may either try to obtain the secret key or to recover the plaintext without using the secret key. In a secure cryptosystem, the plaintext cannot be recovered from the ciphertext except by using the decryption key. In a symmetric cryptosystem, a single key serves as both the encryption and decryption keys.Cryptography has been around for millennia; see Kahn [37] for a good history of cryptography; see Rivest [69] and Brassard[10] for an introduction to modern cryptography.1.2 What is authentication? What is a digital signature?Authentication in a digital setting is a process whereby the receiver of a digital message can be confident of the identity of the sender and/or theintegrity of the message. Authentication protocols can be based on either conventional secret-key cryptosystems like DES or on public-key systems like RSA; authentication in public-key systems uses digital signatures.In this document, authentication will generally refer to the use of digitalsignatures, which play a function for digital documents similar to that played by handwritten signatures for printed documents: the signature is an unforgeable piece of data asserting that a named person wrote or otherwise agreed to the document to which the signature is attached. The recipient, as well as a third party, can verify both that the document did indeed originate from the person whose signature is attached and that the document has not been altered since it was signed. A secure digital signature system thus consists of two parts: a method of signing a document such that forgery is infeasible, and a method of verifying that a signature was actually generated by whomever it represents. Furthermore, secure digital signatures cannot be repudiated; i.e., the signer of a document cannot later disown it by claiming it was forged.Unlike encryption, digital signatures are a recent development, theneed for which has arisen with the proliferation of digital communications.1.3 What is public-key cryptography? Traditional cryptography is based on the sender and receiver of a message knowing and using the same secret key: the sender uses the secret key to encrypt the message, and the receiver uses the same secret key to decrypt the message. This method is known as secret-key cryptography. The main problem is getting the sender and receiver to agree on the secret key without anyone else finding out. If they are in separate physical locations, they must trust a courier, or a phone system, or some other transmission system to not disclose the secret key being communicated. Anyone who overhears or intercepts the key in transit can later read all messages encrypted using that key. The generation, transmission and storage of keys is called key management; all cryptosystems must deal with key management issues. Secret-key cryptography often has difficulty providing secure key management.Public-key cryptography was invented in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie andMartin Hellman [29] in order to solve the key management problem. In the new system, each person gets a pair of keys, called the public key and the private key. Each person's public key is published while the private key is kept secret. The need for sender and receiver to share secret information is eliminated: all communications involve only public keys, and no private key is ever transmitted or shared. No longer is it necessary to trust some communications channel to be secure against eavesdropping or betrayal. Anyone can send a confidential message just using public information, but it can only be decrypted with a private key that is in the sole possession of the intended recipient. Furthermore, public-key cryptography can be used for authentication (digital signatures) as well as for privacy (encryption). Here's how it works for encryption: when Alice wishes to send a message to Bob, she looks up Bob's public key in a directory, uses it to encrypt the message and sends it off. Bob then uses his private key to decrypt the message and read it. No one listening in can decrypt the message. Anyone can send an encrypted message to Bob but only Bob can read it. Clearly, one requirement is that no one can figure out the private key from the corresponding public key.Here's how it works for authentication: Alice, to sign a message, doesa computation involving both her private key and the message itself; theoutput is called the digital signature and is attached to the message,which is then sent. Bob, to verify the signature, does some computation involving the message, the purported signature, and Alice's public key. If the results properly hold in a simple mathematical relation, the signature is verified as genuine; otherwise, the signature may be fraudulent or the message altered, and they are discarded.A good history of public-key cryptography, by one of its inventors, is given by Diffie [27].1.4 What are the advantages and disadvantages of public-key cryptography     over secret-key cryptography?}The primary advantage of public-key cryptography is increased security: the private keys do not ever need to be transmitted or revealed to anyone. In a secret-key system, by contrast, there is always a chance that an enemy could discover the secret key while it is being transmitted.Another major advantage of public-key systems is that they can provide a method for digital signatures. Authentication via secret-key systemsrequires the sharing of some secret and sometimes requires trust of a third party as well. A sender can then repudiate a previously signed message by claiming that the shared secret was somehow compromised by one of theparties sharing the secret. For example, the Kerberos secret-key authentication system [79] involves a central database that keeps copies of the secret keys of all users; a Kerberos-authenticated message would most likely not be held legally binding, since an attack on the database would allow widespread forgery. Public-key authentication, on the other hand, prevents this type of repudiation; each user has sole responsibility for protecting his or her private key. This property of public-key authentication is often called non-repudiation. Furthermore, digitally signed messages can be proved authentic to a third party, such as a judge, thus allowing such messages to be legally binding. Secret-key authentication systems such as Kerberos were designed to authenticate access to network resources, rather than to authenticate documents, a task which is better achieved via digital signatures.A disadvantage of using public-key cryptography for encryption is speed: there are popular secret-key encryption methods which are significantly faster than any currently available public-key encryption method. But public-key cryptography can share the burden with secret-key cryptography to get the best of both worlds. For encryption, the best solution is to combine public- and secret-key systems in order to get both the security advantages of public-key systems and the speed advantages of secret-key systems. The public-key system can be used to encrypt a secret key which is then used to encrypt the bulk of a file or message. This is explained in more detail in Question 2.12in the case of RSA. Public-key cryptography is not meant to replace secret-key cryptography, but rather to supplement it, to make it more secure. The first use of public-key techniques was for secure key exchange in an otherwise secret-key system [29]; this is still one of its primary functions.Secret-key cryptography remains extremely important and is the subject ofmuch ongoing study and research. Some secret-key encryption systems are discussed in Questions 5.1 and 5.5.1.5 Is cryptography patentable in the U.S.?Cryptographic systems are patentable. Many secret-key cryptosystems have been patented, including DES (see Question 5.1). The basic ideas of public-key cryptography are contained in U.S. Patent 4,200,770, by M.Hellman, W. Diffie, and R. Merkle, issued 4/29/80 and in U.S. Patent 4,218,582, by M. Hellman and R. Merkle, issued 8/19/80; similar patents have been issued throughout the world. The exclusive licensing rights to both patents are held by Public Key Partners (PKP), of Sunnyvale, California, which also holds the rights to the RSA patent (see Question 2.19). Usually all of these public-key patents are licensed together. All legal challenges to public-key patents have been settled beforejudgment. In a recent case, for example, PKP brought suit against the TRW Corporation which was using public-key cryptography (the ElGamal system) without a license; TRW claimed it did not need to license. In June 1992 a settlement was reached in which TRW agreed to license to the patents.Some patent applications for cryptosystems have been blocked by intervention by the NSA (see Question 7.3) or other intelligence or defense agencies, under the authority of the Invention Secrecy Act of 1940 and the National Security Act of 1947; see Landau [46] for some recent cases related to cryptography.1.6 Is cryptography exportable from the U.S.?All cryptographic products need export licenses from the State Department, acting under authority of the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), which defines cryptographic devices, including software, as munitions. The U.S. government has historically been reluctant to grant export licenses for encryption products stronger than some basic level (not publicly stated). Under current regulations, a vendor seeking to export a product using cryptography first submits an request to the State Department's DefenseTrade Control office. Export jurisdiction may then be passed to theDepartment of Commerce, whose export procedures are generally simple andefficient. If jurisdiction remains with the State Department, furtherreview, perhaps lengthy, is required before export is either approved ordenied; the National Security Agency (NSA, see Question 7.3) may become directly involved at this point. The details of the export approval process change frequently.The NSA has de facto control over export of cryptographic products. The State Department will not grant a license without NSA approval and routinely grants licenses whenever NSA does approve. Therefore, the policy decisions over exporting cryptography ultimately rest with the NSA.It is the stated policy of the NSA not to restrict export of cryptographyfor authentication; it is only concerned with the use of cryptography for privacy. A vendor seeking to export a product for authentication only will be granted an export license as long as it can demonstrate that the product cannot be easily modified for encryption; this is true even for very strong systems, such as RSA with large key sizes. Furthermore, the bureaucratic procedures are simpler for authentication products than for privacy products. An authentication product needs NSA and State Dept. approval only once, whereas an encryption product may need approval for every sale or every product revision.Export policy is currently a matter of great controversy, as many softwareand hardware vendors consider current export regulations overly restrictive and burdensome. The Software Publishers Association (SPA), a software industry group, has recently been negotiating with the government in order to get export license restrictions eased; one agreement was reached that allows simplified procedures for export of two bulk encryption ciphers, RC2 and RC4 (see Question 8.6), when the key size is limited. Also, export policy is less restrictive for foreign subsidiaries and overseas offices of U.S. companies.In March 1992, the Computer Security and Privacy Advisory Board voted unanimously to recommend a national review of cryptography policy, including export policy. The Board is an official advisory board to NIST (see Question 7.1) whose members are drawn from both the government and the private sector. The Board stated that a public debate is the only way to reach a consensus policy to best satisfy competing interests: national security and law enforcement agencies like restrictions on cryptography, especially for export, whereas other government agencies and private industry want greater freedom for using and exporting cryptography. Export policy has traditionally been decided solely by agencies concerned with national security, without much input from those who wish to encourage commerce in cryptography. U.S. export policy may undergo significant change in the next few years.2 RSA2.1 What is RSA?RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication;it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman[74]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq; n is called the modulus. Choose a number, e, less than n and relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1), and find its inverse, d, mod (p-1)(q-1),which means that ed = 1 mod (p-1)(q-1); e and d are called the public and private exponents, respectively. The public key is the pair (n,e); the private key is d. The factors p and q must be kept secret, or destroyed. It is difficult (presumably) to obtain the private key d from the public key (n,e). If one could factor n into p and q, however, then one could obtain the private key d. Thus the entire security of RSA is predicated on the assumption that factoring is difficult; an easy factoring method would ``break'' RSA (see Questions 2.5 and 4.4).Here is how RSA can be used for privacy and authentication (in practice, actual use is slightly different; see Questions 2.12 and 2.13):RSA privacy (encryption): suppose Alice wants to send a private message, m, to Bob. Alice creates the ciphertext c by exponentiating: c = m^e mod n, where e and n are Bob's public key. To decrypt, Bob also exponentiates: m = c^d mod n, and recovers the original message m;the relationship between e and d ensures that Bob correctly recovers m.Since only Bob knows d, only Bob can decrypt. RSA authentication: suppose Alice wants to send a signed document m to Bob. Alice creates a digital signature s by exponentiating: s = m^d mod n, where d and n belong to Alice's key pair. She sends s and m to Bob. To verify the signature, Bob exponentiates and checks that the message m is recovered: m = s^e mod n, where e and n belong to Alice's public key.Thus encryption and authentication take place without any sharing of private keys: each person uses only other people's public keys and his or her own private key. Anyone can send an encrypted message or verify a signed message, using only public keys, but only someone in possession of the correct private key can decrypt or sign a message. 2.2 Why use RSA rather than DES?RSA is not an alternative or replacement for DES; rather it supplementsDES (or any other fast bulk encryption cipher) and is used together with DES in a secure communications environment. (Note: for an explanation of DES,see Question 5.1.)RSA allows two important functions not provided by DES: secure key exchange without prior exchange of secrets, and digital signatures. For encryptingmessages, RSA and DES are usually combined as follows: first the message is encrypted with a random DES key, and then, before being sent over an insecure communications channel, the DES key is encrypted with RSA. Together, the DES-encrypted message and the RSA-encrypted DES key are sent. This protocol is known as an RSA digital envelope.One may wonder, why not just use RSA to encrypt the whole message and not use DES at all? Although this may be fine for small messages, DES (or another cipher) is preferable for larger messages because it is much faster than RSA(see Question 2.3).In some situations, RSA is not necessary and DES alone is sufficient. This includes multi-user environments where secure DES-key agreement can take place, for example by the two parties meeting in private. Also, RSA is usually not necessary in a single-user environment; for example, if you want to keep your personal files encrypted, just do so with DES using, say, your personal password as the DES key. RSA, and public-key cryptography in general,is best suited for a multi-user environment. Also, any system in which digitalsignatures are desired needs RSA or some other public-key system.2.3 How fast is RSA?An ``RSA operation,'' whether for encrypting or decrypting, signingor verifying, is essentially a modular exponentiation, which can be performed by a series of modular multiplications.In practical applications, it is common to choose a small public exponent for the public key; in fact, entire groups of users can use the same public exponent. This makes encryption faster than decryption and verification faster than signing. Algorithmically, public-key operations take O(k^2) steps, private key operations take O(k^3) steps, and key generation takes O(k^4) steps, where k is the number of bits in the modulus; O-notation refers to the an upper bound on the asymptotic running time of an algorithm [22].There are many commercially available hardware implementations of RSA, and there are frequent announcements of newer and faster chips. The fastest current RSA chip [76] has a throughput greater than 600 Kbits per second with a 512-bit modulus, implying that it performs over 1000 RSA private-key operations per second. It is expected that RSA speeds will reach 1 Mbit/second within a year or so.By comparison, DES is much faster than RSA. In software, DES is generally at least 100 times as fast as RSA. In hardware, DES is between 1,000 and 10,000times as fast, depending on the implementations. RSA will probably narrow the gap a bit in coming years, as it finds growing commercial markets, but will never match the performance of DES.2.4 How much extra message length is caused by using RSA?Only a very small amount of data expansion is involved when using RSA. For encryption, a message may be padded to a length that is a multiple of the block length, usually 64 bits, since RSA is usually combined with a secret-key block cipher such as DES (see Question 2.12). Encrypting the DES key takes as many additional bits as the size of the RSA modulus.For authentication, an RSA digital signature is appended to a document.An RSA signature, including information such as the name of the signer, is typically a few hundred bytes long. One or more certificates (see Question 3.5) may be included as well; certificates can be used in conjunctionwith any digital signature method. A typical RSA certificate is a few hundred bytes long.2.5 What would it take to break RSA?There are a few possible interpretations of ``breaking RSA''. The most damaging would be for an attacker to discover the private key corresponding to a given public key; this would enable the attacker both to read all messages encrypted with the public key and to forge signatures. The obvious way to do this attack is to factor the public modulus, n, into its two primefactors, p and q. From p, q, and e, the public exponent, the attacker can easily get d, the private key. The hard part is factoring n; the security of RSA depends of factoring being difficult. In fact, the task of recoveringthe private key is equivalent to the task of factoring the modulus: you can use d to factor n, as well as use the factorization of n to find d. See Questions 4.5 and 4.6 regarding the state of the art in factoring. It shouldbe noted that hardware improvements alone will not weaken RSA, as long asappropriate key lengths are used; in fact, hardware improvements should increase the security of RSA (see Question 4.5).Another way to break RSA is to find a technique to compute e-th roots mod n. Since c = m^e, the e-th root of c is the message m. This attack would allow someone to recover encrypted messages and forge signatures even without knowing the private key. This attack is not known to be equivalent to factoring. No methods are currently known that attempt to break RSA in this way. The attacks just mentioned are the only ways to break RSA in such a way as to be able to recover all messages encrypted under a given key. There are other methods, however, which aim to recover single messages;success would not enable the attacker to recover other messages encrypted with the same key. The simplest single-message attack is the guessed plaintext attack. An attacker sees a ciphertext, guesses that the message might be ``Attack at dawn'', and encrypts this guess with the public key of the recipient; by comparison with the actual ciphertext, the attacker knows whether or not the guess was correct. This attack can be thwarted by appending some random bits to the message. Another single-message attack can occur if someone sends the same message m to three others, who each have public exponent e=3. An attacker who knows this and sees the three messages will be able to recover the message m; this attack and ways to prevent it are discussed by Hastad [35]. There are also some ``chosen ciphertext'' attacks, in which the attacker creates some ciphertext and gets to see the corresponding plaintext, perhaps by tricking a legitimate user into decrypting a fake message; Davida [23] gives some examples.Of course, there are also attacks that aim not at RSA itself but ata given insecure implementation of RSA; these do not count as ``breakingRSA'' because it is not any weakness in the RSA algorithm that is exploited,but rather a weakness in a specific implementation. For example, if someone stores his private key insecurely, an attacker may discover it. One cannot emphasize strongly enough that to be truly secure RSA requires a secure implementation; mathematical security measures, such as choosing a long key size, are not enough. In practice, most successful attacks will likely be aimed at insecure implementations and at the key management stages of an RSA system. See Section 3 for discussion of secure key management in an RSA system.2.6 Are strong primes necessary in RSA?In the literature pertaining to RSA, it has often been suggested that in choosing a key pair, one should use ``strong'' primes p and q to generate the modulus n. Strong primes are those with certain properties that make the product n hard to factor by specific factoring methods; such properties have included, for example, the existence of a large prime factor of p-1 and a large prime factor of p+1. The reason for these concerns is that some factoring methods are especially suited to primes p such that p-1 or p+1 has only small factors; strong primesare resistant to these attacks. However, recent advances in factoring (see Question 4.6) appear to have obviated the advantage of strong primes; the elliptic curve factoring algorithm is one such advance. The new factoring methods have as good a chance of success on strong primes as on ``weak'' primes; therefore, choosing strong primes does not significantly increase resistance to attacks. So for now the answer is negative: strong primes are not necessary when using RSA, although there is no danger in using them, except that it takes longer to generate a key pair. However, new factoring algorithms may be developed in the future which once again target primes with certain properties; if so, choosing strong primes may again help to increase security. 2.7 How large a modulus (key) should be used in RSA?The best size for an RSA modulus depends on one's security needs. The larger the modulus, the greater the security but also the slower the RSA operations. One should choose a modulus length upon consideration, first, of one's security needs, such as the value of the protected data and how long it needs to be protected, and, second, of how powerful one's potential enemy is. It is also possible that a larger key size will allow a digitally signeddocument to be valid for a longer time; see Question 3.17.A good analysis of the security obtained by a given modulus length is given by Rivest [72], in the context of discrete logarithms modulo a prime, but it applies to RSA as well. Rivest's estimates imply that a 512-bit modulus can be factored with an $8.2 million effort, less in the future. It may therefore be advisable to use a longer modulus, perhaps 768 bits in length. Those with extremely valuable data (or large potential damage from digital forgery) may want to use a still longer modulus. A certifying authority (see Question 3.5) might use a modulus of length 1000 bits or more, because the validity of so many other key pairs depends on the security of the one central key. The key of an individual user will expire after a certain time, say, two years (see Question 3.12). Upon expiration, the user will generate a new key which should be at least a few digits longer than the old key to reflect the speed increases of computers over the two years. Recommended key length schedules will probably be published by some authority or public body. Users should keep in mind that the estimated times to break RSA are averages only. A large factoring effort, attacking many thousands of RSA moduli, may succeed in factoring at least one in a reasonable time. Although the security of any individual key is still strong, with some factoring methods there is always a small chance that the attacker may get lucky and factor it quickly.As for the slowdown caused by increasing the key size (see Question 2.3), doubling the modulus length would, on average, increase the time required for public-key operations (encryption and signature verification) by a factor of 4, and increase the time taken by private key operations (decryption and signing) by a factor of 8. The reason thatpublic-key operations are affected less than private-key operations is thatthe public exponent can remain fixed when the modulus is increased, whereasthe private exponent increases proportionally. Key generation time would increase by a factor of 16 upon doubling the modulus, but this is a relatively infrequent operation for most users.2.8 How large should the primes be?The two primes, p and q, which compose the modulus, should be ofroughly equal length; this will make the modulus harder to factor thanif one of the primes was very small. Thus if one chooses to use a 512-bit modulus, the primes should each have length approximately 256 bits.2.9 How does one find random numbers for keys?One needs a source of random numbers in order to find two random primesto compose the modulus. If one used a predictable method of generatingthe primes, an adversary could mount an attack by trying to recreate thekey generation process. Random numbers obtained from a physical process are in principle the best.One could use a hardware device, such as a diode; some are sold commercially on computer add-in boards for this purpose. Another idea is to use physical movements of the computer user, such as keystroke timings measured inmicroseconds. By whichever method, the random numbers may still containsome correlations preventing sufficient statistical randomness. Therefore,it is best to run them through a good hash function (see Question 8.2) before actually using them. Another approach is to use a pseudorandom number generator fed by a randomseed. Since these are deterministic algorithms, it is important to findone that is very unpredictable and also to use a truly random seed. There isa wide literature on the subject of pseudorandom number generators. SeeKnuth [41] for an introduction.Note that one does not need random numbers to determine the public andprivate exponents in RSA, after choosing the modulus. One can simplychoose an arbitrary value for the public exponent, which then determinesthe private exponent, or vice versa.2.10 What if users of RSA run out of distinct primes?There are enough prime numbers that RSA users will never run out of them.For example, the number of primes of length 512 bits or less exceeds10^{150}, according to the prime number theorem; this is more than the number of atoms in the known universe.2.11 How do you know if a number is prime?It is generally recommended to use probabilistic primality testing, whichis much quicker than actually proving a number prime. One can use a probabilistic test that decides if a number is prime with probability of error less than 2^{-100}. For further discussion of some primality testing algorithms, see the papers in the bibliography of [5]. For some empirical results on the reliability of simple primality tests see Rivest [70]; one can perform very fast primality tests and be extremely confident in the results. A simple algorithm for choosing probable primes was recently analyzed by Brandt and Damgard [9].2.12 How is RSA used for encryption in practice?RSA is combined with a secret-key cryptosystem, such as DES, to encrypta message by means of an RSA digital envelope. Suppose Alice wishes to send an encrypted message to Bob. She first encrypts the message with DES, using a randomly chosen DES key. Then she looks up Bob's public key and uses it to encrypt the DES key. The DES-encrypted message and the RSA-encrypted DES key together form the RSA digital envelope and are sent to Bob. Upon receiving the digital envelope, Bob decrypts the DES key with his private key, then uses the DES key to decrypt to message itself.2.13 How is RSA used for authentication in practice?Suppose Alice wishes to send a signed message to Bob. She uses a hashfunction on the message (see Question 8.2) to create a message digest, which serves as a ``digital fingerprint'' of the message. She then encrypts the message digest with her RSA private key; this is the digital signature, which she sends to Bob along with the message itself. Bob, upon receiving the message and signature, decrypts the signature withAlice's public key to recover the message digest. He then hashes the message with the same hash function Alice used and compares the resultto the message digest decrypted from the signature. If they are exactlyequal, the signature has been successfully verified and he can be confidentthat the message did indeed come from Alice. If, however, they are not equal, then the message either originated elsewhere or was altered afterit was signed, and he rejects the message. Note that for authentication, the roles of the public and private keys are converse to their roles in encryption, where the public key is used to encrypt and the private key to decrypt.In practice, the public exponent is usually much smaller than the private exponent; this means that the verification of a signature is faster than the signing. This is desirable because a message or document will only be signed by an individual once, but the signature may be verified many times.It must be infeasible for anyone to either find a message that hashes to a given value or to find two messages that hash to the same value. If either were feasible, an intruder could attach a false message onto Alice's signature. Hash functions such as MD4 and MD5 (see Question 8.3) have been designed specifically to have the property that finding a match is infeasible, and are therefore considered suitable for use in cryptography.One or more certificates (see Question 3.5) may accompany a digital signature. A certificate is a signed document attesting to the identity and public key of the person signing the message. Its purpose is to preventsomeone from impersonating someone else, using a phony key pair. If a certificate is present, the recipient (or a third party) can check the authenticity of the public key, assuming the certifier's public key isitself trusted. 2.14 Does RSA help detect altered documents and transmission errors?An RSA digital signature is superior to a handwritten signature in thatit attests to the contents of a message as well as to the identity ofthe signer. As long as a secure hash function (see Question 8.2) is used, there is no way to take someone's signature from one document and attach it to another, or to alter the signed message in any way. The slightest change in a signed document will cause the digital signature verificationprocess to fail. Thus, RSA authentication allows people to check theintegrity of signed documents. Of course, if a signature verificationfails, it may be unclear whether there was an attempted forgery or simply a transmission error.2.15 What are alternatives to RSA?Many other public-key cryptosystems have been proposed, as a look throughthe proceedings of the annual Crypto and Eurocrypt conferences quickly reveals. A mathematical problem called the knapsack problem was the basis for several systems [52], but these have lost favor because several versions were broken. Another system, designed by ElGamal [30], is based on the discrete logarithm problem. The ElGamal system was, in part, the basis for several later signature methods, including one by Schnorr [75], which in turn was the basis for DSS, the digital signature standard proposed by NIST (see Question 6.8). Because of the NIST proposal, the relative merits of these signature systems versus RSA signatures has received a lot of attention; see [57] for a discussion. The ElGamal system has been used successfully in applications; it is slower for encryption and verification than RSA and its signatures are larger than RSA signatures.In 1976, before RSA, Diffie and Hellman [29] proposed a system for key exchange only; it permits secure exchange of keys in an otherwise conventional secret-key system. This system is in use today.Cryptosystems based on mathematical operations on elliptic curves have also been proposed [43,56], as have cryptosystems based on discrete exponentiation in the finite field GF(2^n). The latter are very fast in hardware; however, doubts have been raised about their security because the underlying problem may be easier to solve than factoring [64,34]. There are also some probabilistic encryption methods [8,32], which have the attraction of being resistant to a guessed ciphertext attack (see Question 2.5), but at a cost of data expansion. In probabilistic encryption, the same plaintext encrypted twice under the same key will give, with high probability, two different ciphertexts.For digital signatures, Rabin [68] proposed a system which is provably equivalent to factoring; this is an advantage over RSA, where one may still have a lingering worry about an attack unrelated to factoring.Rabin's method is susceptible to a chosen message attack, however, in which the attacker tricks the user into signing messages of a special form. Another signature scheme, by Fiat and Shamir [31], is based on interactive zero-knowledge protocols, but can be adapted for signatures. It is faster than RSA and is provably equivalent to factoring, but the signatures are much larger than RSA signatures. Other variations, however, lessen the necessary signature length; see [17] for references. A system is ``equivalent to factoring'' if recovering the private key is provably as hard as factoring; forgery may be easier than factoring in some of the systems.Advantages of RSA over other public-key cryptosystems include the fact that it can be used for both encryption and authentication, and that it has been around for many years and has successfully withstood much scrutiny. RSA has received far more attention, study, and actual use than any other public-key cryptosystem, and thus RSA has more empirical evidence of its security than more recent and less scrutinized systems. In fact, a large number of public-key cryptosystems which at first appeared secure were later broken; see [13] for some case histories. 2.16 Is RSA currently in use today?The use of RSA is undergoing a period of rapid expansion and may become ubiquitous within a few years. It is currently used in a wide variety of products, platforms and industries around the world. It is found in many commercial software products and planned for many more. RSA is built into current or planned operating systems by Microsoft, Apple, Sun, and Novell. In hardware, RSA can be found in secure telephones, on Ethernet network cards, and on smart cards. RSA is also used internally in many institutions, including branches of the U.S. government, major corporations, national laboratories, and universities.Adoption of RSA seems to be proceeding more quickly for authentication (digital signatures) than for privacy (encryption), perhaps in part because products for authentication are easier to export than those for privacy (see Question 1.6). 2.17 Is RSA an official standard today?RSA is part of many official standards worldwide. The ISO (InternationalStandards Organization) 9796 standard lists RSA as a compatible cryptographic algorithm, as does the Consultative Committee in International Telegraphy and Telephony (CCITT) X.509 security standard. RSA is part of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) standard, the French financial industry's ETEBAC 5 standard, and the ANSI X9.31 draft standard for the U.S. banking industry. The Australian key management standard, AS2805.6.5.3, also specifies RSA.RSA is found in Internet's proposed PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) standard(see Question 8.7) and the PKCS standard for the software industry (see Question 8.9). The OSI Implementors' Workshop (OIW) has issued implementers' agreements referring to PKCS and PEM, which each include RSA. A number of other standards are currently being developed and will be announced over the next couple of years; many are expected to include RSA as either an endorsed or a recommended system for privacy and/or authentication. See [38] for a more comprehensive survey of cryptography standards.2.18 Is RSA a de facto standard? Why is a de facto standard important?RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptosystem today and has oftenbeen called a de facto standard. Regardless of the official standards, the existence of a de facto standard is extremely important for the development of a digital economy. If one public-key system is used everywhere for authentication, then signed digital documents can be exchanged between users in different nations using different software on different platforms; thisinteroperability is necessary for a true digital economy to develop.The lack of secure authentication has been a major obstacle in achievingthe promise that computers would replace paper; paper is still necessaryalmost everywhere for contracts, checks, official letters, legal documents,and identification. With this core of necessary paper transaction, it has not been feasible to evolve completely into a society based on electronic transactions. Digital signatures are the exact tool necessary to convert the most essential paper-based documents to digital electronic media. Digital signatures makes it possible, for example, to have leases, wills, passports, college transcripts, checks, and voter registration forms that exist only in electronic form; any paper version would just be a ``copy'' of the electronic original. All of this is enabled by an accepted standard for digital signatures.2.19 Is RSA patented? RSA is patented under U.S. Patent 4,405,829, issued 9/20/83 and held byPublic Key Partners (PKP), of Sunnyvale, California; the patent expires 17 years after issue, in 2000. RSA is usually licensed together with other public-key cryptography patents (see Question 1.5). PKP has a standard, royalty-based licensing policy which can be modified for special circumstances. If a software vendor, having licensed the public-key patents, incorporates RSA into a commercial product, then anyone who purchases the end product has the legal right to use RSA within the context of that software. The U.S. government can use RSA without a license because it was invented at MIT with partial government funding. RSA is not patented outside North America.In North America, a license is needed to ``make, use or sell'' RSA. However,PKP usually allows free non-commercial use of RSA, with written permission, for personal, academic or intellectual reasons. Furthermore, RSA Laboratories has made available (in the U.S. and Canada) at no charge a collection of cryptographic routines in source code, including the RSA algorithm; it can be used, improved and redistributed non-commercially (see Question 8.10).2.20 Can RSA be exported from the U.S.?Export of RSA falls under the same U.S. laws as all other cryptographicproducts. See Question 1.6 for details.RSA used for authentication is more easily exported than when used forprivacy. In the former case, export is allowed regardless of key (modulus)size, although the exporter must demonstrate that the product cannot beeasily converted to use for encryption. In the case of RSA used for privacy (encryption), the U.S. government generally does not allowexport if the key size exceeds 512 bits. Export policy is currently asubject of debate, and the export status of RSA may well change in thenext year or two.Regardless of U.S. export policy, RSA is available abroad in non-U.S.products.3 Key Management3.1 What key management issues are involved in public-key cryptography?Secure methods of key management are extremely important. In practice,most attacks on public-key systems will probably be aimed at the key management levels, rather than at the cryptographic algorithm itself. The key management issues mentioned here are discussed in detail in later questions.Users must be able to obtain securely a key pair suited to their efficiency and security needs. There must be a way to look up other people's public keys and to publicize one's own key. Users must have confidence in the legitimacy of others' public keys; otherwise an intruder can either change public keys listed in a directory, or impersonate another user. Certificates are used for this purpose. Certificates must be unforgeable, obtainable in a secure manner, and processed in such a way that an intruder cannot misuse them. The issuance of certificates must proceed in a secure way, impervious to attack. If someone's private key is lost or compromised, others must be made aware of this, so that they will no longer encrypt messages under the invalid public key nor accept messages signed with the invalid private key. Users must be able to store their private keys securely, so that no intruder can find it, yet the keys must be readily accessible for legitimate use. Keys need to be valid only until a specified expiration date. The expiration date must be chosen properly and publicized securely. Some documents need to have verifiable signatures beyond the time when the key used to sign them has expired.Although most of these key management issues arise in any public-key cryptosystem, for convenience they are discussed here in the context of RSA.3.2 Who needs a key?Anyone who wishes to sign messages or to receive encrypted messages musthave a key pair. People may have more than one key. For example, someonemight have a key affiliated with his or her work and a separate key forpersonal use. Other entities will also have keys, including electronic entities such as modems, workstations, and printers, as well as organizational entities such as a corporate department, a hotel registration desk, or a university registrar's office. 3.3 How does one get a key pair? Each user should generate his or her own key pair. It may be tempting within an organization to have a single site that generates keys for all members who request one, but this is a security risk because it involves the transmission of private keys over a network as well as catastrophic consequences if an attacker infiltrates the key-generation site. Each node on a network should becapable of local key generation, so that private keys are never transmitted and no external key source need be trusted. Of course, the local key generationsoftware must itself be trustworthy. Secret-key authentication systems, such as Kerberos, often do not allow local key generation but instead use a central server to generate keys.Once generated, a user must register his or her public key with somecentral administration, called a certifying authority. The certifying authority returns to the user a certificate attesting to the veracity of the user's public key along with other information (see Questions 3.5 and following). Most users should not obtain more than one certificate forthe same key, in order to simplify various bookkeeping tasks associatedwith the key.3.4 Should a public key or private key be shared among users?In RSA, each person should have a unique modulus and private exponent, i.e., a unique private key. The public exponent, on the other hand, can be common to a group of users without security being compromised. Some public exponents in common use today are 3 and 2^{16}+1; because these numbers are small, the public-key operations (encryption and signature verification) are fast relative to the private key operations (decryption and signing). If one public exponent becomes a standard, software and hardware can be optimized for that value.In public-key systems based on discrete logarithms, such as ElGamal,Diffie-Hellman, or DSS, it has often been suggested that a group of people should share a modulus. This would make breaking a key moreattractive to an attacker, however, because one could break everykey with only slightly more effort than it would take to break asingle key. To an attacker, therefore, the average cost to break a key is much lower with a common modulus than if every key has a distinct modulus. Thus one should be very cautious about using a common modulus; if a common modulus is chosen, it should be very large. 3.5 What are certificates?Certificates are digital documents attesting to the binding of a public key to an individual or other entity. They allow verification of the claim that a given public key does in fact belong to a given individual. Certificates help prevent someone from using a phony key to impersonate someone else.In their simplest form, certificates contain a public key and a name. Ascommonly used, they also contain the expiration date of the key, the name of the certifying authority that issued the certificate, the serial number of the certificate, and perhaps other information. Most importantly, it contains the digital signature of the certificate issuer. The most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the CCITT X.509 international standard [19]; thus certificates can be read or written by any application complying with X.509. Further refinements are found in the PKCS set of standards (see Question 8.9), and the PEM standard (see Question 8.7). A detailed discussion of certificate format can also be found in Kent [40].A certificate is issued by a certifying authority (see Question 3.7) and signed with the certifying authority's private key.3.6 How are certificates used?A certificate is displayed in order to generate confidence in the legitimacy of a public key. Someone verifying a signature can also verify the signer's certificate, to insure that no forgery or false representation has occurred. These steps can be performed with greater or lesser rigor depending on the context. The most secure use of authentication involves enclosing one or more certificates with every signed message. The receiver of the messagewould verify the certificate using the certifying authority's publickey and, now confident of the public key of the sender, verify the message's signature. There may be two or more certificates enclosed with the message, forming a hierarchical chain, wherein one certificate testifies to the authenticity of the previous certificate. At the end of a certificate hierarchy is a top-level certifying authority, which is trusted without a certificate from any other certifying authority. The public key of the top-level certifying authority must be independently known, for example by being widely published.The more familiar the sender is to the receiver of the message, the less need there is to enclose, and to verify, certificates. If Alice sends messages to Bob every day, Alice can enclose a certificate chain on the first day, which Bob verifies. Bob thereafter stores Alice's public key and no more certificates or certificate verifications are necessary. A sender whose company is known to the receiver may need to enclose only one certificate (issued by the company), whereas a sender whose company is unknown to the receiver may need to enclose two certificates. A good rule of thumb is to enclose just enough of a certificate chain so that the issuer of the highest level certificate in the chain is well-known to the receiver.According to the PKCS standards for public-key cryptography (see Question8.9), every signature points to a certificate that validates the public key of the signer. Specifically, each signature contains the name of the issuer of the certificate and the serial number of the certificate. Thus even if no certificates are enclosed with a message, a verifier can still use the certificate chain to check the status of the public key.3.7 Who issues certificates and how?Certificates are issued by a certifying authority (CA), which can be any trusted central administration willing to vouch for the identities of those to whom it issues certificates. A company may issue certificates to its employees, a university to its students, a town to its citizens. In order to prevent forged certificates, the CA's public key must be trustworthy: a CA must either publicize its public key or provide a certificate from a higher-level CA attesting to the validity of its public key. The lattersolution gives rise to hierarchies of CAs.Certificate issuance proceeds as follows. Alice generates her own key pair and sends the public key to an appropriate CA with some proof of her identification. The CA checks the identification and takes any other stepsnecessary to assure itself that the request really did come from Alice, and then sends her a certificate attesting to the binding between Alice and her public key, along with a hierarchy of certificates verifying the CA's public key. Alice can present this certificate chain whenever desired in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of her public key. Since the CA must check for proper identification, organizations will find it convenient to act as a CA for its own members and employees. There will also be CAs that issue certificates to unaffiliated individuals.Different CAs may issue certificates with varying levels of identification requirements. One CA may insist on seeing a driver's license, another may want the certificate request form to be notarized, yet another may want fingerprints of anyone requesting a certificate. Each CA should publish its own identification requirements and standards, so that verifiers can attach the appropriate level of confidence in the certified name-key bindings.An example of a certificate-issuing protocol is Apple Computer's Open Collaborative Environment (OCE). Apple OCE users can generate a key pair and then request and receive a certificate for the public key; thecertificate request must be notarized.3.8 What is a CSU, or, How do certifying authorities store their private keys?It is extremely important that private keys of certifying authorities are stored securely, because compromise would enable undetectable forgeries. One way to achieve the desired security is to store the key in a tamperproofbox; such a box is called a Certificate Signing Unit, or CSU. The CSU would, preferably, destroy its contents if ever opened, and be shielded against attacks using electromagnetic radiation. Not even employees of the certifying authority should have access to the private key itself, but only the ability to use the private key in the process of issuing certificates. There are many possible designs for CSUs; here is a description of one designfound in some current implementations. The CSU is activated by a set of data keys, which are physical keys capable of storing digital information. The data keys use secret-sharing technology such that several people must all use their data keys to activate the CSU. This prevents one disgruntled CA employee from producing phony certificates. Note that if the CSU is destroyed, say in a fire, no security is compromised.Certificates signed by the CSU are still valid, as long as the verifier uses the correct public key. Some CSUs will be manufactured so that a lost private key can be restored into a new CSU. See Question 3.10 for discussion of lost CA private keys.Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) currently sells a CSU, and RSA Data Securitysells a full-fledged certificate issuing system built around the BBN CSU.3.9 Are certifying authorities susceptible to attack?One can think of many attacks aimed at the certifying authority, which mustbe prepared against them.Consider the following attack. Suppose Bob wishes to impersonate Alice. If Bob can convincingly sign messages as Alice, he can send a message to Alice's bank saying ``I wish to withdraw $10,000 from my account. Please send me the money.'' To carry out this attack, Bob generates a key pair and sends the public key to a certifying authority saying ``I'm Alice. Here is my public key. Please send me a certificate.'' If the CA is fooled and sends him such a certificate, he can then fool the bank, and his attack will succeed. In order to prevent such an attack the CA must verify that a certificate request did indeed come from its purported author, i.e., it must require sufficient evidence that it is actually Alice who is requesting the certificate. The CA may, for example, require Alice to appear in person and show a birth certificate. Some CAs may require very little identification, but the bank should not honor messages authenticated with such low-assurance certificates. Every CA must publicly state its identification requirements and policies; others can then attach an appropriate level of confidence to the certificates.An attacker who discovers the private key of a certifying authority could then forge certificates. For this reason, a certifying authority must take extreme precautions to prevent illegitimate access to its private key. The private key should be kept in a high-security box, known as a Certificate Signing Unit, or CSU (see Question 3.8).The certifying authority's public key might be the target of an extensive factoring attack. For this reason, CAs should use very long keys, preferably 1000 bits or longer, and should also change keys regularly. Top-level certifying authorities are exceptions: it may not be practical for them to change keys frequently because the key may be written into software used by a large number of verifiers.In another attack, Alice bribes Bob, who works for the certifying authority, to issue to her a certificate in the name of Fred. Now Alice can send messages signed in Fred's name and anyone receiving such a message will believe it authentic because a full and verifiable certificate chain will accompany the message. This attack can be hindered by requiring the cooperation of two (or more) employees to generate a certificate; the attacker now has to bribe two employees rather than one. For example, in some of today's CSUs, three employees must each insert a data key containing secret information in order to authorize the CSU to generate certificates. Unfortunately, there may be other ways to generate a forged certificate by bribing only one employee. If each certificate request is checked by only one employee, that one employee can be bribed and slip a false request into a stack of real certificate requests. Note that a corrupt employee cannot reveal the certifying authority's private key, as long as it is properly stored.Another attack involves forging old documents. Alice tries to factor the modulus of the certifying authority. It takes her 15 years, but she finally succeeds, and she now has the old private key of the certifying authority. The key has long since expired, but she can forge a certificate dated 15 years ago attesting to a phony public key of some other person, say Bob; she can now forge a document with a signature of Bob dated 15 year ago, perhapsa will leaving everything to Alice. The underlying issue raised by this attack is how to authenticate a signed document dated many years ago; this issue is discussed in Question 3.17.Note that these attacks on certifying authorities do not threaten the privacy of messages between users, as might result from an attack on a secret-key distribution center.3.10 What if the certifying authority's key is lost or compromised? If the certifying authority's key is lost or destroyed but not compromised, certificates signed with the old key are still valid, as long as the verifierknows to use the old public key to verify the certificate. In some CSU designs, encrypted backup copies of the CA's private key arekept. A CA which loses its key can then restore it by loading the encrypted backup into the CSU, which can decrypt it using some unique information stored inside the CSU; the encrypted backup can only be decrypted using the CSU. If the CSU itself is destroyed, the manufacturer may be able to supply another with the same internal information, thus allowing recovery of the key. A compromised CA key is a much more dangerous situation. An attacker who discovers a certifying authority's private key can issue phony certificates in the name of the certifying authority, which would enable undetectable forgeries; for this reason, all precautions must be taken to prevent compromise, including those outlined in Questions 3.8 and 3.9. If a compromise does occur, the CA must immediately cease issuing certificatesunder its old key and change to a new key. If it is suspected that some phony certificates were issued, all certificates should be recalled, and then reissued with a new CA key. These measures could be relaxed somewhat if certificates were registered with a digital time-stamping service (see Question 3.18). Note that compromise of a CA key does not invalidate users'keys, but only the certificates that authenticate them. Compromise of a top-level CA's key should be considered catastrophic, since the key may be built into applications that verify certificates.3.11 What are Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)?A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of public keys that have been revoked before their scheduled expiration date. There are several reasons why a key might need to be revoked and placed on a CRL. A key might have been compromised. A key might be used professionally by an individual for a company; for example, the official name associated with a key might be ``Alice Avery, Vice President, Argo Corp.'' If Alice were fired, her company would not want her to be able to sign messages with that key and therefore the company would place the key on the CRL. When verifying a signature, one can check the relevant CRL to make surethe signer's key has not been revoked. Whether it is worth the time to perform this check depends on the importance of the signed document. CRLs are maintained by certifying authorities (CAs) and provide information about revoked keys originally certified by the CA. CRLs only list current keys, since expired keys should not be accepted in any case; when a revoked key is past its original expiration date it is removed from the CRL. Although CRLs are maintained in a distributed manner, there may be central repositories for CRLs, that is, sites on networks containing the latest CRLs from many organizations. An institution like a bank might want an in-house CRL repository to make CRL searches feasible on every transaction.3.12 What happens when a key expires?In order to guard against a long-term factoring attack, every key must have an expiration date after which it is no longer valid. The time to expiration must therefore be much shorter than the expected factoring time, or equivalently, the key length must be long enough to make the chances of factoring before expiration extremely small. The validity period for a key pair may also depend on the circumstances in which the key will be used, although there will also be a standard period. The validity period, togetherwith the value of the key and the estimated strength of an expected attacker, then determines the appropriate key size.The expiration date of a key accompanies the public key in a certificateor a directory listing. The signature verification program should check for expiration and should not accept a message signed with an expired key. This means that when one's own key expires, everything signed with it willno longer be considered valid. Of course, there will be cases where it is important that a signed document be considered valid for a much longer period of time; Question 3.17 discusses ways to achieve this.After expiration, the user chooses a new key, which should be longer than the old key, perhaps by several digits, to reflect both the performance increase of computer hardware and any recent improvements in factoring algorithms. Recommended key length schedules will likely be published. A user may recertify a key that has expired, if it is sufficiently long and has not been compromised. The certifying authority would then issue a new certificate for the same key, and all new signatures would point to the new certificate instead of the old. However, the fact that computer hardware continues to improve argues for replacing expired keys with new, longer keys every few years. Key replacement enables one to take advantage of the hardware improvements to increase the security of the cryptosystem. Faster hardware has the effect of increasing security, perhaps vastly, but only if key lengths are increased regularly (see Question 4.5).3.13 What happens if I lose my private key?If your private key is lost or destroyed, but not compromised, you can no longer sign or decrypt messages, but anything previously signed with the lost key is still valid. This can happen, for example, if you forget the password used to access your key, or if the disk on which the key is stored is damaged. You need to choose a new key right away, to minimize the number of messages people send you encrypted under your old key, messages which you can no longer read. 3.14 What happens if my private key is compromised?If your private key is compromised, that is, if you suspect an attacker may have obtained your private key, then you must assume that some enemy canread encrypted messages sent to you and forge your name on documents. The seriousness of these consequences underscores the importance of protecting your private key with extremely strong mechanisms (see Question 3.15).You must immediately notify your certifying authority and have your old key placed on a Certificate Revocation List (see Question 3.11); this will inform people that the key has been revoked. Then choose a new key and obtainthe proper certificates for it. You may wish to use the new key to re-sign documents that you had signed with the compromised key; documents that had been time-stamped as well as signed might still be valid. You should also change the way you store your private key, to prevent compromise of the new key.3.15 How should I store my private key?Private keys must be stored securely, since forgery and loss of privacy could result from compromise. The private key should never be stored anywhere in plaintext form. The simplest storage mechanism is to encrypt the private key under a password and store the result on a disk. Of course, the password itself must be maintained with high security, not written down and not easily guessed. Storing the encrypted key on a disk that is not accessible through a computer network, such as a floppy disk or a local hard disk, will make some attacks more difficult. Ultimately, private keys may be stored on portable hardware, such as a smart card. Furthermore, a challenge-response protocol will be more secure than simple password access. Users with extremely high security needs, such as certifying authorities, should use special hardware devices to protect their keys (see Question 3.8).3.16 How do I find someone else's public key?Suppose you want to find Bob's public key. There are several possible ways.You could call him up and ask him to send you his public key via e-mail; you could request it via e-mail as well. Certifying authorities may providedirectory services; if Bob works for company Z, look in the directory kept by Z's certifying authority. Directories must be secure against unauthorized tampering, so that users can be confident that a public key listed in the directory actually belongs to the person listed. Otherwise, you might send private encrypted information to the wrong person.Eventually, full-fledged directories will arise, serving as online white or yellow pages. If they are compliant with CCITT X.509 standards [19], the directories will contain certificates as well as public keys; the presence of certificates will lower the directories' security needs.3.17 How can signatures remain valid beyond the expiration dates of their    keys, or, How do you verify a 20-year-old signature?Normally, a key expires after, say, two years and a document signed with an expired key should not be accepted. However, there are many cases where it is necessary for signed documents to be regarded as legally valid for much longer than two years; long-term leases and contracts are examples. How should these cases be handled? Many solutions have been suggested but it is unclear which will prove the best. Here are some possibilities.One can have special long-term keys as well as the normal two-year keys. Long-term keys should have much longer modulus lengths and be stored more securely than two-year keys. If a long-term key expires in 50 years, any document signed with it would remain valid within that time. A problem with this method is that any compromised key must remain on the relevant CRL until expiration (see Question 3.11); if 50-year keys are routinely placed on CRLs, the CRLs could grow in size to unmanageable proportions. This idea can be modified as follows. Register the long-term key by the normal procedure, i.e., for two years. At expiration time, if it has not been compromised, the key can be recertified, that is, issued a new certificate by the certifying authority, so that the key will be valid for another two years. Now a compromised key only needs to be kept on a CRL for at most two years, not fifty. One problem with the previous method is that someone might try to invalidate a long-term contract by refusing to renew his key. This problem can be circumvented by registering the contract with a digital time-stamping service (see Question 3.18) at the time it is originally signed. If all parties to the contract keep a copy of the time-stamp, then each can prove that the contract was signed with valid keys. In fact, the time-stamp can prove the validity of a contract even if one signer's key gets compromised at some point after the contract was signed. This time-stamping solution can work with all signed digital documents, not just multi-party contracts.3.18 What is a digital time-stamping service?A digital time-stamping service (DTS) issues time-stamps which associate a date and time with a digital document in a cryptographically strong way. The digital time-stamp can be used at a later date to prove that an electronic document existed at the time stated on its time-stamp. For example, a physicist who has a brilliant idea can write about it witha word processor and have the document time-stamped. The time-stamp anddocument together can later prove that the scientist deserves the Nobel Prize, even though an arch rival may have been the first to publish.Here's one way such a system could work. Suppose Alice signs a document and wants it time-stamped. She computes a message digest of the document using a secure hash function (see Question 8.2) and then sends the message digest (but not the document itself) to the DTS, which sends her in return a digital time-stamp consisting of the message digest, the date and time it was received at the DTS, and the signature of the DTS. Since the message digest does not reveal any information about the content of the document, the DTS cannot eavesdrop on the documents it time-stamps. Later, Alice can present the document and time-stamp together to prove when thedocument was written. A verifier computes the message digest of the document, makes sure it matches the digest in the time-stamp, and then verifies the signature of the DTS on the time-stamp.To be reliable, the time-stamps must not be forgeable. Consider therequirements for a DTS of the type just described. First, the DTS itself must have a long key if we want the time-stamps to be reliable for, say,several decades. Second, the private key of the DTS must be stored with utmost security, as in a tamperproof box. Third, the date and time must come from a clock, also inside the tamperproof box, which cannot be reset and which will keep accurate time for years or perhaps for decades. Fourth, it must be infeasible to create time-stamps without using the apparatus in the tamperproof box.A cryptographically strong DTS using only software [4] has been implemented by Bellcore; it avoids many of the requirements just described, such as tamperproof hardware. The Bellcore DTS essentially combines hash values of documents into data structures called binary trees, whose ``root'' values are periodically published in the newspaper. A time-stamp consists of a set of hash values which allow a verifier to recompute the root of the tree. Since the hash functions are one-way (see Question 8.2), the set of validating hash values cannot be forged.The time associated with the document by the time-stamp is the date of publication.The use of a DTS would appear to be extremely important, if not essential, for maintaining the validity of documents over many years (see Question 3.17). Suppose a landlord and tenant sign a twenty-year lease. The public keys used to sign the lease will expire after, say, two years; solutions such as recertifying the keys or resigning every two years with new keys require the cooperation of both parties several years after the original signing. If one party becomes dissatisfied with the lease, he or she may refuse to cooperate. The solution is to register the lease with the DTS at the time of the original signing; both parties would then receive a copy of the time-stamp, which can be used years later to enforce the integrity of the original lease.In the future, it is likely that a DTS will be used for everythingfrom long-term corporate contracts to personal diaries and letters.Today, if an historian discovers some lost letters of Mark Twain, theirauthenticity is checked by physical means. But a similar find 100 yearsfrom now may consist of an author's computer files; digital time-stamps may be the only way to authenticate the find.4 Factoring and Discrete Log4.1 What is a one-way function?A one-way function is a mathematical function that is significantlyeasier to perform in one direction (the forward direction) than in the opposite direction (the inverse direction). One might, for example, compute the function in minutes but only be able to compute the inverse in months or years. A trap-door one-way function is a one-way functionwhere the inverse direction is easy if you know a certain piece ofinformation (the trap door), but difficult otherwise.4.2 What is the significance of one-way functions for cryptography?Public-key cryptosystems are based on (presumed) trap-door one-way functions. The public key gives information about the particular instance of the function; the private key gives information about the trap door. Whoever knows the trap door can perform the function easily in bothdirections, but anyone lacking the trap door can perform the function only in the forward direction. The forward direction is used for encryption and signature verification; the inverse direction is used for decryption and signature generation.In almost all public-key systems, the size of the key corresponds to the size of the inputs to the one-way function; the larger the key, the greaterthe difference between the efforts necessary to compute the function in the forward and inverse directions (for someone lacking the trap door). For a digital signature to be secure for years, for example, it is necessary to use a trap-door one-way function with inputs large enough that someone without the trap door would need many years to compute the inverse function.All practical public-key cryptosystems are based on functions that are believed to be one-way, but have not been proven to be so. This means that it is theoretically possible that an algorithm will be discovered that can compute the inverse function easily without a trap door; this development would render any cryptosystem based on that one-way function insecure and useless. 4.3 What is the factoring problem?Factoring is the act of splitting an integer into a set of smaller integers(factors) which, when multiplied together, form the original integer. For example, the factors of 15 are 3 and 5; the factoring problem is to find 3 and 5 when given 15. Prime factorization requires splitting an integer into factors that are prime numbers; every integer has a unique prime factorization. Multiplying two prime integers together is easy, but as far as we know, factoring the product is much more difficult. 4.4 What is the significance of factoring in cryptography?Factoring is the underlying, presumably hard problem upon which several public-key cryptosystems are based, including RSA. Factoring an RSAmodulus (see Question 2.1) would allow an attacker to figure out the private key; thus, anyone who can factor the modulus can decrypt messages and forge signatures. The security of RSA therefore depends on the factoring problem being difficult. Unfortunately, it has not been proven that factoring must be difficult, and there remains a possibility that a quick and easy factoring method might be discovered (see Question 4.7), although factoring researchers consider this possibility remote.Factoring large numbers takes more time than factoring smaller numbers.This is why the size of the modulus in RSA determines how secure an actual use of RSA is; the larger the modulus, the longer it would takean attacker to factor, and thus the more resistant to attack the RSAimplementation is.4.5 Has factoring been getting easier?Factoring has become easier over the last fifteen years for two reasons:computer hardware has become more powerful, and better factoring algorithms have been developed. Hardware improvement will continue inexorably, but it is important to realize that hardware improvements make RSA more secure, not less.This is because a hardware improvement that allows an attacker to factora number two digits longer than before will at the same time allow a legitimate RSA user to use a key dozens of digits longer than before; a user can choose a new key a dozen digits longer than the old one withoutany performance slowdown, yet a factoring attack will become much moredifficult. Thus although the hardware improvement does help the attacker, it helps the legitimate user much more. This general rule may fail in the sense that factoring may take place using fast machines of the future, attacking RSA keys of the past; in this scenario, only the attacker gets the advantage of the hardware improvement. This consideration argues for using a larger key size today than one might otherwise consider warranted. It also argues for replacing one's RSA key with a longer key every few years, in order to take advantage of the extra security offered by hardware improvements. This point holds for other public-key systems as well.Better factoring algorithms have been more help to the RSA attacker than have hardware improvements. As the RSA system, and cryptography in general, have attracted much attention, so has the factoring problem, and many researchers have found new factoring methods or improved upon others. This has made factoring easier, for numbers of any size and irrespective of the speed of the hardware. However, factoring is still a very difficult problem.Overall, any recent decrease in security due to algorithm improvement can be offset by increasing the key size. In fact, between general computer hardware improvements and special-purpose RSA hardware improvements, increases in key size (maintaining a constant speed of RSA operations) have kept pace or exceeded increases in algorithm efficiency, resulting in no net loss of security. As long as hardware continues to improve at a faster rate than that at which the complexity of factoring algorithms decreases, the security of RSA will increase, assuming RSA users regularly increase their key size by appropriate amounts. The open question is how much faster factoring algorithms can get; there must be some intrinsic limit to factoring speed, but this limit remains unknown.4.6 What are the best factoring methods in use today?Factoring is a very active field of research among mathematicians andcomputer scientists; the best factoring algorithms are mentioned below with some references and their big-O asymptotic efficiency. O notation measures how fast an algorithm is; it gives an upper bound on the number of operations (to order of magnitude) in terms of n, the number to be factored, and p, a prime factor of n. For textbook treatment of factoring algorithms, see [41], [42], [47],and [11]; for a detailed explanation of big-O notation, see [22].Factoring algorithms come in two flavors, special purpose and generalpurpose; the efficiency of the former depends on the unknown factors, whereas the efficiency of the latter depends on the number to be factored. Special purpose algorithms are best for factoring numbers with small factors, but the numbers used for the modulus in the RSA system do not have any small factors. Therefore, general purpose factoring algorithms are the more important ones in the context of cryptographic systems and their security. Special purpose factoring algorithms include the Pollard rho method [66], with expected running time O(sqrt(p)), and the Pollard p-1 method [67], with running time O(p'), where p' is the largest prime factor of p-1. Both of these take an amount of time that is exponential in the size of p, the prime factor that they find; thus these algorithms are too slow for most factoring jobs. The elliptic curve method (ECM) [50] is superior to these; its asymptotic running time is O(exp (sqrt (2 ln p ln ln p)) ). The ECM is often used in practice to find factors of randomly generated numbers; it is not strong enough to factor a large RSA modulus.The best general purpose factoring algorithm today is the number field sieve [16], which runs in time approximately O(exp ( 1.9 (ln n)^{1/3} (ln ln n)^{2/3}) ). It has only recently been implemented [15], and is not yet practical enough to perform the most desired factorizations. Instead, the most widely used general purpose algorithm is the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve (mpqs) [77], which has running time O(exp ( sqrt (ln n ln ln n)) ). The mpqs (and some of its variations) is the only general purpose algorithm that has successfully factored numbers greater than 110 digits; a variation known as ppmpqs [49]has been particularly popular.It is expected that within a few years the number field sieve will overtake the mpqs as the most widely used factoring algorithm, as the size of the numbers being factored increases from about 120 digits, which is the current threshold of general numbers which can be factored, to 130 or 140 digits. A ``general number'' is one with no special form that might make it easier to factor; an RSA modulus is a general number. Note that a 512-bit number has about 155 digits. Numbers that have a special form can already be factored up to 155 digits or more [48]. The Cunningham Project [14] keeps track of the factorizations of numbers with these special forms and maintains a ``10 Most Wanted'' list of desired factorizations. Also, a good way to survey current factoring capability is to look at recent results of the RSA Factoring Challenge (see Question 4.8).4.7 What are the prospects for theoretical factoring breakthroughs?Although factoring is strongly believed to be a difficult mathematicalproblem, it has not been proved so. Therefore there remains a possibility that an easy factoring algorithm will be discovered. This development, which could seriously weaken RSA, would be highly surprising and the possibility is considered extremely remote by the researchers most actively engaged in factoring research. Another possibility is that someone will prove that factoring is difficult.This negative breakthrough is probably more likely than the positive breakthrough discussed above, but would also be unexpected at the current state of theoretical factoring research. This development would guarantee the security of RSA beyond a certain key size.4.8 What is the RSA Factoring Challenge?RSA Data Security Inc. (RSADSI) administers a factoring contest with quarterly cash prizes. Those who factor numbers listed by RSADSI earnpoints toward the prizes; factoring smaller numbers earns more points thanfactoring larger numbers. Results of the contest may be useful to those who wish to know the state of the art in factoring; the results show the size of numbers factored, which algorithms are used, and how much time was required to factor each number.

There are other, more general, formulations as well.Like the factoring problem, the discrete log problem is believed to bedifficult and also to be the hard direction of a one-way function. For this reason, it has been the basis of several public-key cryptosystems,including the ElGamal system and DSS (see Questions 2.15 and 6.8). The discrete log problem bears the same relation to these systems as factoring does to RSA: the security of these systems rests on the assumption that discrete logs are difficult to compute.The discrete log problem has received much attention in recent years; descriptions of some of the most efficient algorithms can be found in [47], [21], and [33]. The best discrete log problems have expected running times similar to that of the best factoring algorithms. Rivest [72] has analyzed the expected time to solve discrete log both in terms of computing power and money.4.10 Which is easier, factoring or discrete log?The asymptotic running time of the best discrete log algorithm isapproximately the same as for the best general purpose factoringalgorithm. Therefore, it requires about as much effort to solvethe discrete log problem modulo a 512-bit prime as to factor a 512-bit RSA modulus.  One paper [45] cites experimental evidence that the discrete log problem is slightly harder than factoring: the authors suggest that the effort necessary to factor a 110-digit integer is the same as the effort to solve discrete logarithms modulo a 100-digit prime. This difference is so slight that it should not be a significant consideration when choosing a cryptosystem.Historically, it has been the case that an algorithmic advance in either problem, factoring or discrete logs, was then applied to the other. This suggests that the degrees of difficulty of both problems are closely linked, and that any breakthrough, either positive or negative, will affect both problems equally.5 DES5.1 What is DES?DES is the Data Encryption Standard, an encryption block cipher defined and endorsed by the U.S. government in 1977 as an official standard;the details can be found in the official FIPS publication [59]. It was originally developed at IBM. DES has been extensively studied over the last 15 years and is the most well-known and widely used cryptosystem in the world. DES is a secret-key, symmetric cryptosystem: when used for communication,both sender and receiver must know the same secret key, which is used bothto encrypt and decrypt the message. DES can also be used for single-userencryption, such as to store files on a hard disk in encrypted form. Ina multi-user environment, secure key distribution may be difficult; public-key cryptography was invented to solve this problem (see Question 1.3). DES operates on 64-bit blocks with a 56-bit key. It was designed to be implemented in hardware, and its operation is relatively fast. It workswell for bulk encryption, that is, for encrypting a large set of data. NIST (see Question 7.1) has recertified DES as an official U.S. government encryption standard every five years; DES was last recertified in 1993, by default. NIST has indicated, however, that it may not recertify DES again.5.2 Has DES been broken?DES has never been ``broken'', despite the efforts of many researchers over many years. The obvious method of attack is brute-force exhaustive search of the key space; this takes 2^{55} steps on average. Early on it was suggested [28] that a rich and powerful enemy could build a special-purpose computer capable of breaking DES by exhaustive search in a reasonable amount of time. Later, Hellman [36] showed a time-memory trade-off that allows improvement over exhaustive search if memory space is plentiful, after an exhaustive precomputation. These ideas fostered doubts about the security of DES. There were also accusations that the NSA had intentionally weakened DES. Despite these suspicions, no feasible way to break DES faster than exhaustive search was discovered. The cost of a specialized computer to perform exhaustive search has been estimated by Wiener at one million dollars [80]. Just recently, however, the first attack on DES that is better than exhaustive search was announced by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir [6,7],using a new technique known as differential cryptanalysis. This attack requires encryption of 2^{47} chosen plaintexts, i.e., plaintexts chosen by the attacker. Although a theoretical breakthrough, this attack is not practical under normal circumstances because it requires the attacker to have easy access to the DES device in order to encrypt the chosen plaintexts. Another attack, known as linear cryptanalysis [51], does not require chosen plaintexts.The consensus is that DES, when used properly, is secure against all butthe most powerful enemies. In fact, triple encryption DES (see Question 5.3) may be secure against anyone at all. Biham and Shamir have stated that they consider DES secure. It is used extensively in a wide variety of cryptographic systems, and in fact, most implementations of public-key cryptography include DES at some level. 5.3 How does one use DES securely?When using DES, there are several practical considerations that canaffect the security of the encrypted data. One should change DES keys frequently, in order to prevent attacks that require sustained data analysis. In a communications context, one must also find a secure way of communicating the DES key to both sender and receiver. Use of RSA or some other public-key technique for key management solves both these issues: a different DES key is generated for each session, and secure key management is provided by encrypting the DES key with the receiver's RSA public key. RSA, in this circumstance, can be regarded as a tool for improving the security of DES (or any other secret key cipher).If one wishes to use DES to encrypt files stored on a hard disk, it isnot feasible to frequently change the DES keys, as this would entail decrypting and then re-encrypting all files upon each key change. Instead,one should have a master DES key with which one encrypts the list of DESkeys used to encrypt the files; one can then change the master key frequently without much effort.A powerful technique for improving the security of DES is triple encryption, that is, encrypting each message block under three different DES keys in succession. Triple encryption is thought to be equivalent to doubling the key size of DES, to 112 bits, and should prevent decryption by an enemy capable of single-key exhaustive search [53]. Of course, using triple-encryption takes three times as long as single-encryption DES.Aside from the issues mentioned above, DES can be used for encryption in several officially defined modes. Some are more secure than others. ECB (electronic codebook) mode simply encrypts each 64-bit block of plaintext one after another under the same 56-bit DES key. In CBC (cipher block chaining) mode, each 64-bit plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted with the DES key. Thus the encryption of each block depends on previous blocks and the same 64-bit plaintext block can encrypt to different ciphertext depending on its context in the overall message. CBC mode helps protect against certain attacks, although not against exhaustive search or differential cryptanalysis. CFB (cipher feedback) mode allows one to use DES with block lengths less than 64 bits. Detailed descriptions of the various DES modes can be found in [60].In practice, CBC is the most widely used mode of DES, and is specified in several standards. For additional security, one could use triple encryption with CBC, but since single DES in CBC mode is usually considered secure enough, triple encryption is not often used.5.4 Can DES be exported from the U.S.?Export of DES, either in hardware or software, is strictly regulated by the U.S. State Department and the NSA (see Question 1.6). The government rarely approves export of DES, despite the fact that DES is widely available overseas; financial institutions and foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies are exceptions. 5.5 What are the alternatives to DES?Over the years, various bulk encryption algorithms have been designed as alternatives to DES. One is FEAL (Fast Encryption ALgorithm), a cipher for which attacks have been discovered [6], although new versions have been proposed. Another recently proposed cipher designed by Lai and Massey [44] and known as IDEA seems promising, although it has not yet received sufficient scrutiny to instill full confidence in its security. The U.S. government recently announced a new algorithm called Skipjack (see Question 6.5) as part of its Capstone project. Skipjack operates on 64-bit blocks of data, as does DES, but uses 80-bit keys, as opposed to 56-bit keys in DES. However, the details of Skipjack are classified, so Skipjack is only available in hardware from government-authorized manufacturers.Rivest has developed the ciphers RC2 and RC4 (see Question 8.6), which can be made as secure as necessary because they use variable key sizes. Faster than DES, at least in software, they have the further advantage of special U.S. government status whereby the export approval is simplified and expedited if the key size is limited to 40 bits. 5.6 Is DES a group?It has been frequently asked whether DES encryption is closed undercomposition; i.e., is encrypting a plaintext under one DES key andthen encrypting the result under another key always equivalent to a single encryption under a single key? Algebraically, is DES a group?If so, then DES might be weaker than would otherwise be the case; see [39] for a more complete discussion. However, the answer is no, DES is not a group [18]; this issue was settled only recently, after many years of speculation and circumstantial evidence. This result seems to imply that techniques such as triple encryption do in fact increase the security of DES.6 Capstone, Clipper, and DSS6.1 What is Capstone?Capstone is the U.S. government's long-term project to develop a setof standards for publicly-available cryptography, as authorized by the Computer Security Act of 1987. The primary agencies responsible for Capstone are NIST and the NSA (see Section 7). The plan calls for the elements of Capstone to become official U.S. government standards, in which case both the government itself and all private companies doing business with the government would be required to use Capstone.There are four major components of Capstone: a bulk data encryptionalgorithm, a digital signature algorithm, a key exchange protocol, anda hash function. The data encryption algorithm is called Skipjack (see Question 6.5), but is often referred to as Clipper, which is the encryption chip that includes Skipjack (see Question 6.2). The digital signature algorithm is DSS (see Question 6.8) and the hash function is SHS (see Question 8.4 about SHS and Question 8.2 about hash functions). The key exchange protocol has not yet been announced. All the parts of Capstone have 80-bit security: all the keys involvedare 80 bits long and other aspects are also designed to withstand anything less than an ``80-bit'' attack, that is, an effort of 2^{80} operations. Eventually the government plans to place the entire Capstone cryptographic system on a single chip.6.2 What is Clipper?Clipper is an encryption chip developed and sponsored by the U.S. government as part of the Capstone project (see Question 6.1).Announced by the White House in April, 1993 [65], Clipper was designed to balance the competing concerns of federal law-enforcement agencies with those of private citizens and industry. The law-enforcement agencies wish to have access to the communications of suspected criminals, for example by wire-tapping; these needs are threatened by secure cryptography. Industry and individual citizens, however, want secure communications, and look to cryptography to provide it.Clipper technology attempts to balance these needs by using escrowedkeys. The idea is that communications would be encrypted with a secure algorithm, but the keys would be kept by one or more third parties (the ``escrow agencies''), and made available to law-enforcement agencies when authorized by a court-issued warrant. Thus, for example, personal communications would be impervious to recreational eavesdroppers, and commercial communications would be impervious to industrial espionage, and yet the FBI could listen in on suspected terrorists or gangsters. Clipper has been proposed as a U.S. government standard [62]; it would then be used by anyone doing business with the federal government as well as for communications within the government. For anyone else, use of Clipper is strictly voluntary. AT&T has announced a secure telephone that uses the Clipper chip.6.3 How does the Clipper chip work?The Clipper chip contains an encryption algorithm called Skipjack (seeQuestion 6.5}), whose details have not been made public. Each chip also contains a unique 80-bit unit key U, which is escrowed in two parts at two escrow agencies; both parts must be known in order to recover the key. Also present is a serial number and an 80-bit ``family key'' F; the latter is common to all Clipper chips. The chip is manufactured so that it cannot be reverse engineered; this means that the Skipjack algorithm and the keys cannot be read off the chip.When two devices wish to communicate, they first agree on an 80-bit``session key'' K. The method by which they choose this key is leftup to the implementer's discretion; a public-key method such as RSA orDiffie-Hellman seems a likely choice. The message is encrypted withthe key K and sent; note that the key K is not escrowed. In addition to the encrypted message, another piece of data, called the law-enforcement access field (LEAF), is created and sent. It includes the session key K encrypted with the unit key U, then concatenated with the serial number of the sender and an authentication string, and then, finally, all encrypted with the family key. The exact details of the law-enforcement field are classified.The receiver decrypts the law-enforcement field, checks the authenticationstring, and decrypts the message with the key K. Now suppose a law-enforcement agency wishes to tap the line. It uses thefamily key to decrypt the law-enforcement field; the agency now knows theserial number and has an encrypted version of the session key. It presentsan authorization warrant to the two escrow agencies along with the serialnumber. The escrow agencies give the two parts of the unit key to thelaw-enforcement agency, which then decrypts to obtain the session key K.Now the agency can use K to decrypt the actual message.Further details on the Clipper chip operation, such as the generationof the unit key, are sketched by Denning [26].6.4 Who are the escrow agencies?It has not yet been decided which organizations will serve as the escrowagencies, that is, keep the Clipper chip keys. No law-enforcement agencywill be an escrow agency, and it is possible that at least one of theescrow agencies will be an organization outside the government.It is essential that the escrow agencies keep the key databasesextremely secure, since unauthorized access to both escrow databases could allow unauthorized eavesdropping on privatecommunications. In fact, the escrow agencies are likely to be oneof the major targets for anyone trying to compromise the Clippersystem; the Clipper chip factory is another likely target.6.5 What is Skipjack?Skipjack is the encryption algorithm contained in the Clipper chip; it was designed by the NSA. It uses an 80-bit key to encrypt 64-bit blocks of data; the same key is used for the decryption. Skipjack can be used in the same modes as DES (see Question 5.3), and may be more secure than DES, sinceit uses 80-bit keys and scrambles the data for 32 steps, or ``rounds''; bycontrast, DES uses 56-bit keys and scrambles the data for only 16 rounds.The details of Skipjack are classified. The decision not to make the details of the algorithm publicly available has been widely criticized. Many people are suspicious that Skipjack is not secure, either due to oversight by its designers, or by the deliberate introduction of a secret trapdoor. By contrast,there have been many attempts to find weaknesses in DES over the years, since its details are public. These numerous attempts (and the fact that they have failed) have made people confident in the security of DES. Since Skipjack isnot public, the same scrutiny cannot be applied towards it, and thus a corresponding level of confidence may not arise. Aware of such criticism, the government invited a small group of independent cryptographers to examine the Skipjack algorithm. They issued a report [12] which stated that, although their study was too limited to reach a definitive conclusion, they nevertheless believe that Skipjack is secure.Another consequence of Skipjack's classified status is that it cannotbe implemented in software, but only in hardware by government-authorizedchip manufacturers.6.6 Why is Clipper controversial?The Clipper chip proposal has aroused much controversy and has been thesubject of much criticism. Unfortunately two distinct issues have become confused in the large volume of public comment and discussion. First there is controversy about the whole idea of escrowed keys.Those in favor of escrowed keys see it as a way to provide secure communications for the public at large while allowing law-enforcement agencies to monitor the communications of suspected criminals. Thoseopposed to escrowed keys see it as an unnecessary and ineffectiveintrusion of the government into the private lives of citizens. Theyargue that escrowed keys infringe their rights of privacy and freespeech. It will take a lot of time and much public discussion for societyto reach a consensus on what role, if any, escrowed keys should have.The second area of controversy concerns various objections to thespecific Clipper proposal, that is, objections to this particularimplementation of escrowed keys, as opposed to the idea of escrowedkeys in general. Common objections include: the Skipjack algorithmis not public (see Questions 6.5) and may not be secure; the key escrow agencies will be vulnerable to attack; there are not enoughkey escrow agencies; the keys on the Clipper chips are not generatedin a sufficiently secure fashion; there will not be sufficient competition among implementers, resulting in expensive and slow chips;software implementations are not possible; and the key size is fixedand cannot be increased if necessary.Micali [55] has recently proposed an alternative system that also attempts to balance the privacy concerns of law-abiding citizens with the investigative concerns of law-enforcement agencies. Called fair public-key cryptography, it is similar in function and purpose to the Clipper chip proposal but users can choose their own keys, which they register with the escrow agencies. Also, the system does not require secure hardware, and can be implemented completely in software.6.7 What is the current status of Clipper?Clipper is under review. Both the executive branch and Congress areconsidering it, and an advisory panel recently recommended a fullyear-long public discussion of cryptography policy. NIST has invited the public to send comments, as part of its own review.6.8 What is DSS?DSS is the proposed Digital Signature Standard, which specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and is a part of the U.S. government'sCapstone project (see Question 6.1). It was selected by NIST, in cooperation with the NSA (see Section 7), to be the digital authentication standard of the U.S. government; whether the government should in fact adopt it as the official standard is still under debate. DSS is based on the discrete log problem (see Question 4.9) and derives from cryptosystems proposed by Schnorr [75] and ElGamal [30]. It is for authentication only. For a detailed description of DSS, see [63] or [57].DSS has, for the most part, been looked upon unfavorably by the computer industry, much of which had hoped the government would choose the RSA algorithm as the official standard; RSA is the most widely used authentication algorithm. Several articles in the press, such as [54], discuss the industry dissatisfaction with DSS. Criticism of DSS has focused on a few main issues: it lacks key exchange capability; the underlying cryptosystem is too recent and has been subject to too little scrutiny for users to be confident of its strength; verification of signatures with DSS is too slow; the existence of a second authentication standard will cause hardship to computer hardware and software vendors, who have already standardized on RSA; and that the process by which NIST chose DSS was too secretive and arbitrary, with too much influence wielded by NSA. Other criticisms were addressed by NIST by modifying the original proposal. A more detailed discussion of the various criticisms can be found in [57], and a detailed response by NIST can be found in [78].In the DSS system, signature generation is faster than signature verification, whereas in the RSA system, signature verification is faster than signature generation (if the public and private exponents are chosen for this property, which is the usual case). NIST claims that it is an advantage of DSS that signing is faster, but many people in cryptography think that it is better for verification to be the faster operation. 6.9 Is DSS secure?The most serious criticisms of DSS involve its security. DSS was originally proposed with a fixed 512-bit key size. After much criticism that this is not secure enough, NIST revised DSS to allow key sizes up to 1024 bits. More critical, however, is the fact that DSS has not been around long enough to withstand repeated attempts to break it; although the discrete log problem is old, the particular form of the problem used in DSS was first proposed for cryptographic use in 1989 by Schnorr [75] and has not received much public study. In general, any new cryptosystem could have serious flaws that are only discovered after years of scrutiny by cryptographers. Indeed this has happened many times in the past; see [13] for some detailed examples. RSA has withstood over 15 years of vigorous examination for weaknesses. In the absence of mathematical proofs of security, nothing builds confidence in a cryptosystem like sustained attempts to crack it. Although DSS may well turn out to be a strong cryptosystem, its relatively short history will leave doubts for years to come.Some researchers warned about the existence of ``trapdoor'' primes inDSS, which could enable a key to be easily broken. These trapdoor primesare relatively rare however, and are easily avoided if proper keygeneration procedures are followed [78].6.10 Is use of DSS covered by any patents?NIST has filed a patent application for DSS and there have been claims that DSS is covered by other public-key patents. NIST recently announced its intention to grant exclusive sublicensing rights for the DSS patent to Public Key Partners (PKP), which also holds the sublicensing rights to other patents that may cover DSS (see Question 1.5). In the agreement between NIST and PKP, PKP publicly stated uniform guidelines by which it will grant licenses to practice DSS. PKP stated that DSS can be used on a royalty-free basis in the case of personal, noncommercial, or U.S. government use. See [61] for details on the agreement and the licensing policy.6.11 What is the current status of DSS?After NIST issued the DSS proposal in August 1991, there was a period in which comments from the public were solicited; NIST then revised itsproposal in light of the comments. DSS may be issued as a FIPS and become the official U.S. government standard, but it is not clear when this might happen. DSS is currently in the process of becoming a standard, along with RSA, for the financial services industry; a recent draft standard [1] contains the revised version of DSS.7 NIST and NSA7.1 What is NIST?NIST is an acronym for the National Institute of Standards and Technology,a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce; it was formerly known asthe National Bureau of Standards (NBS). Through its Computer SystemsLaboratory it aims to promote open systems and interoperability thatwill spur development of computer-based economic activity. NIST issuesstandards and guidelines that it hopes will be adopted by all computersystems in the U.S., and also sponsors workshops and seminars. Official standards are published as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) publications.In 1987 Congress passed the Computer Security Act, which authorized NIST to develop standards for ensuring the security of sensitive but unclassified information in government computer systems. It encouraged NIST to work with other government agencies and private industry in evaluating proposed computer security standards.7.2 What role does NIST play in cryptography?NIST issues standards for cryptographic routines; U.S. government agenciesare required to use them, and the private sector often adopts them as well.In January 1977, NIST declared DES (see Question 5.1) the official U.S. encryption standard and published it as FIPS Publication 46; DES soon became a de facto standard throughout the U.S.A few years ago, NIST was asked to choose a set of cryptographic standardsfor the U.S.; this has become known as the Capstone project (see Section 6). After a few years of rather secretive deliberations, and in cooperation with the NSA, NIST issued proposals for various standards in cryptography, including digital signatures (DSS) and data encryption (the Clipper chip); these are pieces of the overall Capstone project.NIST has been criticized for allowing the NSA too much power in setting cryptographic standards, since the interests of the NSA conflict with that of the Commerce Department and NIST. Yet, the NSA has much more experiencewith cryptography, and many more qualified cryptographers and cryptanalysts,than does NIST; it would be unrealistic to expect NIST to forego such available assistance.7.3 What is the NSA?The NSA is the National Security Agency, a highly secretive agency of the U.S. government that was created by Harry Truman in 1952; its very existence was kept secret for many years. For a history of the NSA, see Bamford [2].The NSA has a mandate to listen to and decode all foreign communications of interest to the security of the United States. It has also used its power in various ways (see Question 7.4) to slow the spread of publicly available cryptography, in order to prevent national enemies from employing encryption methods too strong for the NSA to break.As the premier cryptographic government agency, the NSA has huge financial and computer resources and employs a host of cryptographers. Developments in cryptography achieved at the NSA are not made public; this secrecy has led to many rumors about the NSA's ability to break popular cryptosystems like DES and also to rumors that the NSA has secretly placed weaknesses, called trap doors, in government-endorsed cryptosystems, such as DES. These rumors have never been proved or disproved, and the criteria used by the NSA in selecting cryptography standards have never been made public. Recent advances in the computer and telecommunications industries have placed NSA actions under unprecedented scrutiny, and the agency has become the target of heavy criticism for hindering U.S. industries that wish to use or sell strong cryptographic tools. The two main reasons for this increased criticism are the collapse of the Soviet Union and the development and spread of commercially available public-key cryptographic tools. Under pressure, the NSA may be forced to change its policies.7.4 What role does the NSA play in commercial cryptography?The NSA's charter limits its activities to foreign intelligence. However,the NSA is concerned with the development of commercial cryptographybecause the availability of strong encryption tools through commercial channels could impede the NSA's mission of decoding international communications; in other words, the NSA is worried lest strong commercial cryptography fall into the wrong hands. The NSA has stated that it has no objection to the use of secure cryptographyby U.S. industry. It also has no objection to cryptographic tools used forauthentication, as opposed to privacy. However, the NSA is widely viewed asfollowing policies that have the practical effect of limiting and/or weakeningthe cryptographic tools used by law-abiding U.S. citizens and corporations;see Barlow [3] for a discussion of NSA's effect on commercial cryptography.The NSA exerts influence over commercial cryptography in several ways. First, it controls the export of cryptography from the U.S. (see Question 1.6); the NSA generally does not approve export of products used for encryption unless the key size is strictly limited. It does, however,approve for export any products used for authentication only, no matter how large the key size, so long as the product cannot be converted to beused for encryption. The NSA has also blocked encryption methods from being published or patented, citing a national security threat; see Landau [46] for a discussion of this practice. Additionally, the NSA serves an ``advisory'' role to NIST in the evaluation and selection of official U.S. government computer security standards; in this capacity, it has played a prominent, and controversial, role in the selection of DES and in the development of the group of standards known as the Capstone project (see Section 6), which includes DSS and the Clipper chip. The NSA can also exert market pressure on U.S. companies to produce (or refrain from producing) cryptographic goods, since the NSA itself is often a large customer of these companies.Cryptography is in the public eye as never before and has become the subjectof national public debate. The status of cryptography, and the NSA's rolein it, will probably change over the next few years.8 Miscellaneous8.1 What is the legal status of documents signed with digital signatures?If digital signatures are to replace handwritten signatures they must have the same legal status as handwritten signatures, i.e., documents signed with digital signatures must be legally binding. NIST has stated that its proposed Digital Signature Standard (see Question 6.8) should be capable of ``proving to a third party that data was actually signed by the generator of the signature.'' Furthermore, U.S. federal governmentpurchase orders will be signed by any such standard; this implies thatthe government will support the legal authority of digital signaturesin the courts. Some preliminary legal research has also resulted in theopinion that digital signatures would meet the requirements of legallybinding signatures for most purposes, including commercial use as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). A GAO (Government AccountingOffice) decision requested by NIST also opines that digital signatureswill meet the legal standards of handwritten signatures [20].However, since the validity of documents with digital signatures has never been challenged in court, their legal status is not yet well-defined.Through such challenges, the courts will issue rulings that collectively define which digital signature methods, key sizes, and security precautions are acceptable for a digital signature to be legally binding.Digital signatures have the potential to possess greater legal authoritythan handwritten signatures. If a ten-page contract is signed by hand onthe tenth page, one cannot be sure that the first nine pages have notbeen altered. If the contract was signed by digital signatures, however, a third party can verify that not one byte of the contract has been altered.Currently, if two people wish to digitally sign a series of contracts, they may wish to first sign a paper contract in which they agree to be bound in the future by any contracts digitally signed by them with a given signature method and minimum key size.8.2 What is a hash function? What is a message digest?A hash function is a computation that takes a variable-size input and returnsa fixed-size string, which is called the hash value. If the hash functionis one-way, i.e., hard to invert, it is also called a message-digest function,and the result is called a message digest. The idea is that a digest represents concisely the longer message or document from which it was computed; one can think of a message digest as a ``digital fingerprint'' of the larger document. Examples of well-known hash functions are MD4, MD5, and SHS (see Questions 8.3 and 8.4).Although hash functions in general have many uses in computer programs, in cryptography they are used to generate a small string (the message digest) that can represent securely a much larger string, such as a file or message. Since the hash functions are faster than the signing functions, it is much more efficient to compute a digital signature using a document's message digest, which is small, than using the arbitrarily large document itself. Additionally, a digest can be made public without revealing the contents of the document from which it derives. This is important in digital time-stamping, where, using hash functions, one can get a document time-stamped without revealing its contents to the time-stamping service (see Question 3.18). A hash function used for digital authentication must have certain properties that make it secure enough for cryptographic use. Specifically,  it must be infeasible to find a message that hashes to a given valueand it must be infeasible to find two distinct messages that hash to the same value. The ability to find a message hashing to a given valuewould enable an attacker to substitute a fake message for a real messagethat was signed. It would also enable someone to falsely disown a message by claiming that he or she actually signed a different message hashing to the same value, thus violating the non-repudiation propertyof digital signatures. The ability to find two distinct messages hashing to the same value could enable an attack whereby someone is tricked into signing a message which hashes to the same value as another message with a quite different meaning. The digest must therefore be long enough to prevent an attacker from doing an exhaustive search for a collision. For example, if a hash function produces 100-bit strings, exhaustive search would take 2^{100} attempts on average to match a given value, and approximately 2^{50} attempts on average to find two inputs producing the same digest. A digital signature system can be broken by attacking either the difficultmathematical problem on which the signature method is based or the hash function used to create the message digests. When choosing an authentication system, it is generally a good idea to choose a signature method and a hash function that require comparable efforts to break; any extra security in one of the two components is wasted, since attacks will be directed at the weaker component. Actually, attacking the hash function is harder in practice, since it requires a large amount of memory and the ability to trick the victim into signing a special message. With 2^{64} operations, an attacker can find two messages that hash to the same digest under any of the MD hash functions; this effort is comparable to that necessary to break 512-bit RSA; thus MD5 is a good choice when using RSA with a 512-bit modulus. However, those with greater security needs, such as certifying authorities, should use a longer modulus and a hash function that produces a longer message digest; either SHS (160-bit digest) or a modified version of MD4 that produces a 256-bit digest [71] would suffice.8.3 What are MD2, MD4 and MD5?MD2, MD4 and MD5 (MD stands for Message Digest) are widely used hash functions designed by Ron Rivest specifically for cryptographic use.They produce 128-bit digests and there is no known attack faster than exhaustive search.MD2 is the slowest of the three; MD4 [71] is the fastest. MD5 [73]has been dubbed ``MD4 with safety belts'' by Rivest, since it has a more conservative design than MD4; the design gives it increased security against attack, but at a cost of being approximately 33% slower than MD4. MD5 is the most commonly used of the three algorithms. MD4 and MD5 are publicly available for unrestricted use; MD2 is availablefor use with PEM (see Question 8.7). Details of MD2, MD4, and MD5 with sample C code are available in Internet RFCs (Requests For Comments) 1319, 1320, and 1321, respectively. No feasible attacks on any of the MD algorithms have been discovered, although some recent theoretical work has found some interestingstructural properties [24,25].8.4 What is SHS?The Secure Hash Standard (SHS) [58] is a hash function proposed by NIST (see Question 7.1) and adopted as a U.S. government standard. It is designed for use with the proposed Digital Signature Standard (see Question 6.8) and is part of the government's Capstone project (see Question 6.1}). SHS produces a 160-bit hash value from a variable-size input. SHS is structurally similar to MD4 and MD5. It is roughly 25% slower than MD5 but may be more secure, because it produces message digests that are 25% longer than those produced by the MD functions. SHS is currently the only part of Capstone that has been officially adopted as a government standard.8.5 What is Kerberos?Kerberos is a secret-key network authentication system developed at MIT[79]; it uses DES for encryption and authentication. Unlike a public-key authentication system, it does not produce digital signatures: Kerberos was designed to authenticate requests for network resources rather than to authenticate authorship of documents. Kerberos provides real-time authentication in a distributed environment, but does not provide for future third-party verification of documents.In a Kerberos system, there is a designated site on the network, called the Kerberos server, which performs centralized key management and administrative functions. The server maintains a database containing the secret keys of all users, generates session keys whenever two users wish to communicate securely, and authenticates the identity of a user who requests certain network services. Kerberos, like other secret-key systems, requires trust in a third party, in this case the Kerberos server. If the server were compromised, the integrity of the whole system would fall. Public-key cryptography was designed precisely to avoid the necessity to trust third parties or communication lines (see Question 1.4). Kerberos may be adequate for those who do not need the more robust functions and properties of public-key systems. 8.6 What are RC2 and RC4?RC2 and RC4 are variable-key-size cipher functions designed by Ron Rivest for fast bulk encryption. They are alternatives to DES (see Question5.1) and are as fast or faster than DES. They can be more secure than DES because of their ability to use long key sizes; they can also be less secure than DES if short key sizes are used.RC2 is a variable-key-size symmetric block cipher and can serve as a drop-inreplacement for DES, for example in export versions of products otherwiseusing DES. RC2 can be used in the same modes as DES (see Question 5.3), including triple encryption. RC2 is approximately twice as fast as DES, at least in software. RC4 is a variable-key-size symmetric stream cipher and is 10 or more times as fast as DES in software. Both RC2 and RC4 are very compact in terms of code size. An agreement between the Software Publishers Association (SPA) and the U.S. government gives RC2 and RC4 special status by means of which the export approval process is simpler and quicker than the usual cryptographic export process. However, to qualify for quick export approval a product must limit the RC2 and RC4 key sizes to 40 bits; 56 bits is allowed for foreign subsidiaries and overseas offices of U.S. companies. An additional 40-bit string, called a salt, can be used to thwart attackers who try to precompute a large look-up table of possible encryptions. The salt is appended to the encryption key, and this lengthened key is used to encrypt the message; the salt is then sent, unencrypted, with the message. RC2 and RC4 have been widely used by developers who want to export their products; DES is almost never approved for export. RC2 and RC4 are proprietary algorithms of RSA Data Security, Inc.; details have not been published.8.7 What is PEM?PEM is the Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail standard, designed, proposed, but not yet officially adopted, by the Internet Activities Board in order to provide secure electronic mail over the Internet. Designed to work with current Internet e-mail formats, PEM includes encryption, authentication, and key management, and allows use of both public-key and secret-key cryptosystems. Multiple cryptographic tools are supported: for each mail message, the specific encryption algorithm, digital signature algorithm, hash function, and so on are specified in the header. PEM explicitly supports only a few cryptographic algorithms; others may be added later. DES in CBC mode is currently the only message encryption algorithm supported, and both RSA and DES are supported for the key management. PEM also supports the use of certificates, endorsing the CCITT X.509 standard for certificate structure. The details of PEM can be found in Internet RFCs (Requests For Comments) 1421 through 1424. PEM is likely to be officially adopted by the Internet Activities Board within one year. Trusted Information Systems has developeda free non-commercial implementation of PEM, and other implementations should soon be available as well.8.8 What is RIPEM?RIPEM is a program developed by Mark Riordan that enables secure Internet e-mail; it provides both encryption and digital signatures, using RSA and DES routines from RSAREF (see Question 8.10). RIPEM is not fully PEM-compatible; for example, it does not currently support certificates. However, future versions will include certificates and will be fully compliant with the PEM standard. RIPEM is available free for non-commercial use in the U.S. and Canada. To get RIPEM, obtain an ftp account at ripem.msu.edu.8.9 What is PKCS?PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) is a set of standards for implementation of public-key cryptography. It has been issued by RSA Data Security, Inc. in cooperation with a computer industry consortium, including Apple, Microsoft, DEC, Lotus, Sun and MIT. PKCS has been cited by the OIW (OSI Implementors' Workshop) as a method for implementation of OSI standards. PKCS is compatible with PEM (see Question 8.7) but extends beyond PEM. For example, where PEM can only handle ASCII data, PKCS is designed for binary data as well. PKCS is also compatible with the CCITT X.509 standard.PKCS includes both algorithm-specific and algorithm-independent implementation standards. Specific algorithms supported include RSA, DES, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It also defines algorithm-independent syntax for digital signatures, digital envelopes (for encryption), and certificates; this enables someone implementing any cryptographic algorithm whatsoever to conform to a standard syntax and thus preserve interoperability. Documents detailing the PKCS standards can be obtained by sending e-mail to pkcs@rsa.com or by anonymous ftp to rsa.com.8.10 What is RSAREF?RSAREF is a collection of cryptographic routines in portable C source code,available at no charge from RSA Laboratories, a division of RSA Data Security,Inc. It includes RSA, MD2, MD5, and DES; Diffie-Hellman key exchange will be included in a forthcoming version. It includes both low-level subroutines, such as modular exponentiation, and high-level cryptographic functions, such as verification of digital signatures. The arithmetic routines can handle multiple-precision integers, and the RSA algorithm routines can handle variable key sizes. RSAREF is fully compatible with the PEM and PKCSstandards.RSAREF is available to citizens of the U.S. or Canada and to permanent residents of the U.S. It can be used in personal, non-commercial applications but cannot be used commercially or sent outside the U.S. and Canada. The RSAREF license contains more details on the usage allowed and disallowed. RSAREF is available on the Internet by sending e-mail to rsaref@rsa.com or by ftp to rsa.com.9 AcknowledgementsI would like to thank the following people, who have provided information and helpful suggestions: Burt Kaliski, Jim Bidzos, Matt Robshaw, Steve Dusse, Kurt Stammberger, George Parsons, John Gilmore, Stuart Haber, Dorothy Denning, and Dennis Branstad.

I think this approach would permit a fairly scientific evaluation of the load a firewall is capable of bearing, by modelling its performance against a scaled number of measured loads. Monitor a firewall for a month and store its logs Observation:this gives some idea of a load through a firewall, whether it's packet or application level. If the firewall is an application level firewall like a toolkit-based one this is pretty easy. If it is a packet-level firewall like a router, some kind of log-reduction will be necessary using something like tcpdump or NNstat. Sort the logs into "quanta" by time of day, per hour. Observation: some hours of the day have higher peaks than others (3:00am versus 11:00am) and will exhibit different load characteristics. Sorting the logs by quanta of one hour will prove or disprove this assumption Tabulate the quanta by services, yielding values like: Number of email messages during that quantum Average size of email messages during that quantum Average time between arrival of email during that quantum Number of web hits during that quantum Average size of retrieved web objects during that quantum Average time between web accesses during that quantum Number of FTP retrieves during that quantum Average size of FTP objects retrieved during that quantum Average time between FTP retrievals during that quantum Number of TELNET sessions during that quantum Maximum concurrent TELNET sessions during that quantum Amount of NNTP traffic in during that quantum Amount of NNTP traffic out during that quantum Average time between NNTP sessions during that quantum Note the peak load in any one quantum for each service wherever it occurs Observation: if we tried to put ALL that load through the firewall in one quantum's worth of time, we'd have a simulation of the worst-case load we have yet observed Implementation: Tools to generate these loads from existing logs would be pretty straightforward and could be run at any site wishing to perform this test. Presumably the values would be different for each site but maybe not very. A number of expect scripts or PERL scripts, using static file data could simulate the load through the firewall without having to actually do the work. We have a characteristic "workload by quantum" for the organization, including peaks and a worst case scenario Assumption: we have a characteristic "rate of load increase" by watching what happens to the rate of service requests between busy hours and non-busy hours. Observation: We know that the "workload by quantum" value is sustainable by the firewall because we measured it. :) the question is how far from the doable load level is the load level at which the firewall topples? This is the point of the exercise. :) Write a test harness that invokes the emulators in a way that will develop the same load model. Values that the test driver will need to control are: Number of concurrent loads for service X Size of accesses for service X Interval between accesses for service X Run the test harness with the load configured to match the loadout at a given time that is not peak but someplace near it. Compare the run times for the near peak load with the actual measured near peak load. Observation: they should be about the same!! Run the test harness to emulate the peak load Compare the run times for the peak load with the run times for the actual measured peak load. Observation: they should be about the same!! NOW we can start to see what happens to the firewall when we increase the load above real measured values!! Observation: To "increase" the load beyond a real measured value we need to plot the increase rate we observed AND the rate at which service invocations increased. The goal here is to generate test loads that *should* fit through the firewall within our time quantum. Run the test harness with the fictional worst case load (the one where everything runs at its observed peak at once) Observation: This represents the *observed* worst case. If the firewall handles it OK that's an interesting fact. Assumption: The firewall will have "topped out" when it can no longer run the generated load within a time quantum. I.e., as soon as it takes longer than an hour to run the load it has peaked out. Keep adding a load quantum factor until the firewall topples OR the firewall cannot manage the load within a time quantum. Publish some results. :) WT02-B31-265IA020-000210-B034-60http://sandcastle-ltd.com:80/Papers/INET.html 199.35.141.30 19970107121937 text/html 9958HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Tue, 07 Jan 1997 12:21:02 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 9787Last-modified: Sun, 29 Sep 1996 19:20:44 GMT IPSecurity, Creating Secure Intranets over the Internet. James P. Hughes Network Systems Corporation Abstract The technology to create interoperable secure encrypted tunnels over theinternet is now possible. Secure intranets over the internet is an intriguingcost savings solution to replace high cost leased lines or frame relay serviceswhile at the same time increasing the security of that traffic. The concept of an Intranet is a private network "Intra" a corporation or insidea corporation using the Internet as the underlying media. This concept is notnew, but is just now becoming possible. The enablers for this technology hasbeen the commercialization of the Internet backbone, the proliferation of WWWand IP security. Now that every company needs a WWW connection to the Internet,it is logical to overlap that use with other office to office traffic,especially when that network is significantly cheaper than buying leased oreven frame relay services. IP security is another enabler for the Intranet. The Internet is a scary "freefor all" that allows any to any connectivity. If you are building a networkspecialized to carry private company information the last thing you want is anyto any connectivity where the any can be your competitors. In addition tokeeping the competitors out, you also need to make sure that there thecompanies proprietary data is indeed unreadable to your competition when it isbeing transferred over the Internet. The IP security standards suite uses encryption technology. Encryption is morethan just the scrambling of bits so that the data can not be seen. Encryptiontechnology, as envisioned by the IPsec working group, includes capability notonly to create private transmissions, to provide authentication of parties to aconversation and to provide data integrity so that you know that the trafficwas from the original sender and was not modified in transit by an attacker.These mathematical transformations can be implemented at several places in anIP network and can be used to protect data from host to host, site to site orany combination. Creating secure tunnels is one issue, but another issue is how do people agreeon secrets (session keys) even if there are eavesdroppers listening in. TheIPsec Oakley key management protocol provides the ability to privatelynegotiate a key while also ensuring that the key you negotiated was indeed tothe intended source. The authentication of the initial source and the creationof (two party) shared secret keys is the prime motivation. When to negotiate a key is also another issue. The ISA/KMP protocol allows keysand traffic parameters to be negotiated before they are needed. Finally, a way to reliably undeniably know that an endpoint that you may havenever heard of is who they say they are even in the event that keys are stolen,compromised or simply revoked is part of yet another protocol defined by theDNSsec working group. DNSsec can send the authenticated credentials to validatethat an end point is who they say they are. These mathematical transformations can be implemented at several places in anIP networks that have or do not have firewalls. Packet formats for IPsec compatible encapsulations will be shown as well asfuture challenges such as public key certificates. Capabilitiesof Encryption Encryption is a set of mathematical transformations. It is a tool. This toolcan be used to create several important capabilities when applied to theprotection of private data on public networks. Technically an integrity, key exchange and authentication are not encryptionper-se, they do, however, use the same properties of irreversibility that makeencryption possible. Privacy Privacy is the ability to keep data private on networks where others may belistening. This is where the common "symmetric ciphers" such as DES, 3DES(pronounced triple-DES), CDMF (40 bit DES), IDEA, RC4 and others. There aremany ciphers that can be used. The IPsec standard is mandating a conservativestandard of DES. DES is a well understood and royalty free algorithm, and hassuccessfully withstood 20 years of public scrutiny[1]. Integrity Integrity is the method of ensuring that the data has not been modified intransit from the source to the destination. Typically, in networks and oncomputer disks, the protection used ensure that data is not modified usesCyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs). These are very good at catching random events,but to the attackers, CRCs are very predictable and easily reversed. Inaddition the sizes of CRCs 16, 32 or 64 bits are all too small to stop abirthday attack[2]. The integrity function is usually performed by a hashing function. The twocurrently in use today are MD5 and SHA. Hashing algorithms can also be used tocreate authenticated hashes. These hashes are used to both ensure that the datahas not been changed and it is from the correct source. IPsec uses both MD5 anda keyed variant of MD5, HMAC. ReplayPrevention This capability ensures that data is received at most, once, and never again.In an IP network, traffic is not guaranteed to arrive in order and it is alsonot guaranteed to arrive at all. Replay prevention provides a means of ensuringthat data, once received can not be recorded and played back later. Replayattacks can be useful even if the data is never decrypted. KeyExchange How does one create and communicate a secret when there are others listening?There are two basic algorithms that do this, one is Diffie-Hellman and theother is Elliptical curves. The mathematics of Diffie Hellman are simple andeasy to follow. First a x is chosen from random bits. The sender then calculates g^x and sendthat to the other side. In the mean time the receiver chooses its own y andcalculates g^y and sends it to the other side. The sender then calculates(g^y)^x and the receiver calculates (g^x)^y. In both cases, they havecalculated G^(xy). (All of these calculations are performed using modulararithmetic) What makes this elegant is that. Even if the eavesdroppers listento the conversations, and knows g, g^x and g^y, unless they can performdiscrete logarithm over a finite field, then G^(xy) will remain a mystery. Ifthe numbers are large enough, then the reversal is not possible. Another aspect Diffie Hellman is that, if the bits are calculated new and notreused in any way, the keys generated will be completely unrelated and if onekey is cracked, the attacker knows nothing about any other keys that has beenused or will be used in the future. Authentication The method of ensuring that the data received is from the expected source.While it is possible to create a key with someone and use it, there is apossibility that the caller is not who they say they are. In that case, thedata will be protected while on the network and sent to the wrong destination.To solve this authentication protocols and algorithms are used. Most privacysystems use RSA to authenticate a party to a conversation. RSA has the abilityto publish your public key and if you keep your private key private, then it istheoretically impossible to impersonate you. These public keys, when combined with a certification authority, provides meansof not only storing and sending out public keys to callers, it also providesfor the integrity of the keys as well as to allow the certifying authority theability to revoke a key so that if a key is lost, then it can be made useless. IPsec IPsec is a family of RFCs that can be used to create secure communications.They are the data encapsulation, key exchange algorithm and key exchangeframework. These RFCs represent the minimum implementation that can be called"IPsec". draft-ietf-ipsec-arch-02.txt This is the overall architecture. This can be used to define the variousencapsulations. draft-ietf-ipsec-hmac-md5-00.txt This contains the creation of a secure keyed MD5 operation. This allows the MD5packet integrity check to be keyed so that the source can authenticate itspacket. draft-ietf-ipsec-esp-des-md5-00.txt Is the actual implementation of the tunnel. This transform contains privacy(DES) integrity and authentication (HMAC) and replay protection. draft-ietf-ipsec-oakley-00.txt This is a key management protocol that is going to be used to both exchangekeys and authentication. draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-04.txt This is the framework that the key management protocols work under. Others There are several other RFCs and may more to come. Status Many vendors are working towards these standards, but the current stickingpoint is the wide deployment of the key management and the integration of thekey management system with DNSsec or other Certificate servers. Conclusion This paper has discussed the networking, security and standards aspects ofcreating a secure Intranet over the Internet. You can not buy this exact suiteof interoperable algorithms and protocols, but they will become real in thenear future.

The single limitedcase of FTP transactions is our primary focus. The resultssuggest that the maximum rate at which FTP sessions can be set upand torn down is unaffected by packet filtering, butapproximately halved by a proxy. The bulk data transferthroughput is a little worse than halved by the packet filterused, and cut to one-fifth by the proxy used. Thus, it appearsthat proxies to perform substantially worse than packet filters.However, the actual results also suggest that with reasonablyavailable fast hardware, throughputs quite close to wire rate, atleast for the tests conducted, would be perfectly possible witheither approach. 1. Firewall Performance Measurement First, some basic definitions. In order to get anywhere, weneed a notion of a transaction. This is just a singleatomic "thing to do", it might be to set up a TCPconnection, move one byte of data, authenticate a login, or FTP asingle file from host A to host B. Throughput is themaximum number of transactions a system can process in a unittime. Things like `bytes per second' or `transactions per hour'are statements of throughput. Latency is the time requiredby a system to complete a single transaction, from start tofinish. From these definitions, we develop a couple more useful ideas. Servicetime is the reciprocal of throughput. Think of it as how muchactual processing time it takes the system to handle atransaction. The part of the latency that's not the service timeis the queuing time. So queuing time is, roughly, theamount of time a transaction spends waiting on the wire or in aqueue. Most networking transactions are latency insensitive, withinreason. A few milliseconds here and there is fine. What generallymatters is throughput. However, for some networking protocols(such as LAT or IPX) latency is most certainly an issue. 2. Types of Transactions We'll be looking at a couple of different notions of`transaction.' * FTP session setup + GET + teardown * FTP get bulk data, `transaction' is reallythe fetch of a single byte * send a UDP echo request, receive a response These tests are described in greater detail below. For each,we'll try to understand both the latency and the throughput. 3. Types of Firewalls There are several firewall types out there to compare: * Routers/Bridges (packet filtering) * Stateful packet filters * Application proxies , with various styles ofauthentication. For this paper, a packet filtering bridge and the ftp-gw fromthe TIS firewall toolkit were compared. Stateful packet filtersand `various styles of authentication' are left to otherexperimenters. 4. Problems There are various problems inherent in testing firewalls forperformance. The testing described herein has tried to accountfor many of them, in order to provide a useful comparison, but indoing so has diverged from the real world substantially. Platform Many firewalls will run on a variety of different hardware,some slow, some fast. Inevitably, comparisons between real-worldconfiguration of product A and real-world configuration ofproduct B will be rendered useless because either A or B is usinghardware that's 6 months ahead of the other. The solution forthese experiments was to use identical, and very slow, hardware.This slow hardware has the additional effect of bringingperformance into a range where differences can be seen (ifeverything does wire rate, it's hard to compare). Noise It is often hard to eliminate stray noise in timing. This canbe caused by other traffic on the networks, various and sundryservice protocol requests and so on. The networks used in thisseries of experiments were constructed entirely ofcrossover-wired ethernets connected point to point, so thenetworks involved were noise-free. In order to reduce theextraneous service request traffic, all hosts were named only byIP addresses, and all users were to be found in the passwordfile. In fact, no nameservice or NIS was possible, since therewere no nameservers of NIS servers available. 5. Measurements In general, one wants to measure both latency and throughput. Latency can be measured relatively simply, by doing a bunch oftransactions in a row, single-threaded and synchronously (startthe next one when the previous one completes). Divide the totaltransaction count by the elapsed time. Throughput can be measured by running many threads oftransactions, as fast as possible, for some interval of time.Divide elapsed time by the total number of transactions tocompute the Observed Service Time. Note that the real servicetime may be less than the observed one. It is necessary to try toget as many transactions as possible going simultaneously to tryto permit all the queuing time for transactions to be used forservice time on other transactions. In practice, there is a`sweet spot' a certain number of parallel transactions thatyields the highest throughput. For the purposes of this paper, alittle tinkering was done to locate the sweet spot, and theobserved throughput there was taken as the actual throughputfigure. 6. The Lab In order to establish baselines, the tests will also be runwith the two suns directly connected. This is the Null Firewall.The underpowered Linux box is a) what was available and b) somuch smaller than the Suns that it was easy to overpower it, andthereby get real numbers. That is, it will make the firewall theactual bottleneck, and avoid nasty problems with bottleneckselsewhere obscuring the truth. 7. Predictions FTP session transaction throughput for ftp-gw will besubstantially less than the Null Firewall, but not measurablydegraded for the packet filters. Latency through the packetfilters will be slightly higher. Byte throughput will be substantially the same for the packetfilters and ftp-gw, each being substantially worse than the NullFirewall. 8. The Experiment Where applicable, a UDP echo tool was used to get moderatelyhigh-precision round trip times for packets (the overhead ofsending and receiving such a packet dominates the times, but thedifferences in round trip times for different configurations areinteresting). In addition, several tests using FTP transactions were carriedout to further characterize performance. Many short sessions arerun in sequence, to measure total session setup and teardowntimes (latency), and many short sessions are run in parallel tomeasure `session level' throughput. Finally, several bulktransfer sessions (fetching a 1.7M file from the server to theclient) are executed, both in sequence, and then several inparallel, so get the bulk data transfer characteristics(bytes/sec throughput). To accomplish these goals, a tool called workload is used tosynthesize the desired workload. See Appendix A for details. The use of FTP in scripts was greatly simplified by using asingle line .netrc with the right things in it for the context athand. Ping tests The round trip time of packets with 8 and 1000 bytes of UDPpayload (respectively) were measured. In all cases thedifferences between the average time and the lowest time werequite small, probably well within any error bounds. These testsare conducted with a tool which sends a series of UDP packets tothe echo port on the destination host, and displays results, notunlike standard ping. This tool exists to permit a higherresolution timestamp to be used. FTP session tests The following input files to workload were used: 	sequential 30 {		command "ftp-session"	}	parallel 6 {		sequential 5 {			command "ftp-session"		}	} which will run the script 30 times, in sequence, and start 6parallel jobs each running the same script 5 times in sequence,respectively. The number 6 for parallelism was chosen byexperiment as the number leading to the best throughput in theNull Firewall case (possibly related to the default length oflisten queue of 5?). These two inputs measure, respectively, thetotal latency to set up a session, and the maximum possiblethroughput, in terms of sessions set up and torn down per unittime. In each case, 30 sessions are built and torn down. In thecase of the ftp-gw based firewall, a parallelism of 8 yieldedslightly better throughput. The "ftp-session" script is a trivial shell scriptto log in to the server, fetch a single small file (the passwdfile, in fact) and exit. FTP bulk transfer tests For this test, the workload tool was again used. The two inputfiles were: 	sequential 10 {		command "ftp-bulk"	}	parallel 3 {		sequential 3 {			command "ftp-bulk"		}	} to do 10 bulk transfers (of vmunix to /dev/null) in a row, andthen to do 3 parallel jobs, each doing 3 such transfers in a row.In the first case, 10 sessions occur, in the second, 9. The filetransferred in approximately 1.7 megabytes in length. 9. Results and Analysis Null Firewall Results Ping (8 bytes)                      3.1msec (average)      Ping (1000 bytes)                   5.3ms (average)        Sequential FTP sessions             41.3sec                Parallel FTP sessions               13.2sec                Sequential FTP bulk transfer        29.8sec                Parallel FTP bulk transfer          20.6sec                It is worth noting at this time that the FTP session latencyworks out to about 1.38 seconds (41.3seconds / 30sessions), andthe throughput of sessions is 2.3 sessions/second (30sessions/13.2seconds). Based on this, the sequential transfer in 10 sessions spent13.8 seconds on session overhead, and 16 seconds on datatransfer, while the parallel set of 9 sessions spends only 3session overheads (due to 3x parallelism, more or less) for 16.46seconds of transfer. The Null Firewall can push 17 megabytes ofdata in about 16 seconds, for just about wire rate, discountingthe various session overheads. Packet Filtering Firewall See Appendix C forthe actual text of the packet filters used and some informationabout the packet filtering software itself. Apart from verifyingthat the filters did in fact block the right packets and permitthe right packets, the same tests were run. Ping (8 bytes)                     5.3msec (average)       Ping (1000 bytes)                  11.8msec (average)      Sequential FTP sessions            41.3sec                 Parallel FTP sessions              11.4sec                 Sequential FTP bulk transfer       57.5sec                 Parallel FTP bulk transfer         44.2sec                 Several things are worthy of note here. First, the packet filter did add per-packet latency, 1.1msecfor the little packets, and 3.25msec for the bigger ones. Thelarger packets take approximately 1.7msec just to receive fromthe wire to the NIC and to transmit from the NIC onto the wire at10Mbps (there's an additional hop with the firewall in place).The smaller packets transmit/receive overhead is very low, lostin the noise. Thus, the packet filter is taking 0.55msec longerto process a large packet, in the sense of service time. Notethat we are assuming that the time spent actually moving a packetbetween the wire and the NIC is free, it is not charged toservice time, since the CPU is presumably free while the NIC doesthis work. Guessing, for the moment, that the `per byte' costs of thesmaller pings are negligible, we guess it takes essentially allof that 1.1msec to do the `per packet' processing. The 0.55milliseconds to process the additional 992 bytes of data in thelarge packets suggests a `per byte' overhead of about half amicrosecond per byte. In short, we're guessing that the servicetime for a packet is 1.1msec, plus 0.55 microseconds for eachbyte in the packet. This analysis is all very well, but theresulting estimates are very sensitive to experimental error,minor changes in the input data change the results substantially.The FTP throughput tests show that, at least under load, thepacket service time is closer to 2.5msec. The FTP numbers are perhaps more useful. The session rates arevirtually identical to the Null Firewall, TCP session setup andteardown seems to be completely dominated by the end-hostoverheads in this case. Indeed, the parallel version seems tohave done slightly better, which is probably experimental noise,but might be due to the presence of an ethernet bridge (thefirewall) improving some arcane ethernet phenomenon. Finally the FTP bulk transfers, after the same computations asthe Null Firewall case, shows about 40-44 seconds spent on datatransfer. The parallel form appears a little better, but againthis is most likely to be experimental noise. The actualthroughput in bytes/second is, then, 17 megabytes in 42 seconds,or a little over 400 kilobytes/second. Since (by observingcounters on the firewall) we observe that about 3 packets travelper kilobyte transferred (2 x 1500 bytes data and 1 ACK per 3000bytes of data), we get a packet rate of about 424 packets/second. This suggests that the packet service time is something like2.4 milliseconds (1000/424). This is in stark contrast to ourguesses about service times in the analysis of the UDP pings.However, if we guess that one of the ethernet transmit andreceive times are not free, that is, that it must be included inthe packet service time, the numbers start to look much morereasonable. A short perusal of the NE2000 drivers suggests that,at least sometimes, the CPU does indeed busywait while the cardclocks an earlier frame onto the wire. This suggests a realservice time for a 1500 byte packet of 1.1msec packet overhead,plus 1.2msec to clock the 12000 bits onto the wire at 10Mbps, fora total of 2.3msec. The lesson to learn here is that you cannot easily extrapolatefrom little workloads to bigger ones. While the detailed analysesmay have worked out, more or less, they still contain manyguesses. The calculations may work out only because multiplegross errors have more or less cancelled one another out. ftp-gw Firewall The ftp-gw daemon was modified slightly for some minorperformance tuning. Buffer sizes were made adjustable to get thebest bulk data throughput possible. See Appendix B for the details. Ping (8 bytes)                     N/A                     Ping (1000 bytes)                  N/A                     Sequential FTP sessions            77.8                    Parallel FTP sessions              17.9(but see note)      Sequential FTP bulk transfer       112.8                   Parallel FTP bulk transfer         88.5                    NOTE: The parallel FTP sessions were slightly faster at 8parallel sessions, each of 4 sequential jobs than at the 6 by 5configuration used for the previous tests. This configurationyielded a throughput of 1.78 sessions per second. This isprobably some artifact of the Linux TCP/IP stack, which getsexercised heavily here. The FTP session latency here is 2.6 seconds, just about doublethe latency in the previous tests. This is not surprising, sinceftp-gw essentially doubles the amount of session establishmentwork by mirroring everything out the other side. The FTP sessionthroughput is 1.78 sessions per second, a little better thanthree-quarters of the two earlier results. The FTP bulk throughput results are a little surprising. Evensubtracting off 26 seconds of session overhead, the sequentialversion still spends 87 seconds transferring data, about the sametime the parallel version does in total. Presumably there aredetails of the TCP implementations in question that make theparallel version just plain work better. Perhaps the kernel canreceive many more packets between context switches? It iscertainly nice to see performance improve under load, as opposedto degrade. The absolute byte rate seems to be about 200kilobytes per second, less than half that of the packet filteringgateway, and 1/5 wire rate. 10. Conclusions Neither packet filtering nor proxying does a great deal ofharm to the ability to start up an FTP session through a thefirewall. If the major load should happen to be this (perhapsmoving lots of email about by FTPing each message in a separatesession), the proxy will collapse first, given identical CPUpower. However, the observed throughput of the ftp-gwconfiguration is substantially less than the Null Firewall,suggesting that 1.78 sessions per second is an upper bound. Incontrast, the packet filtering firewall performed approximatelyas well as the Null Firewall, so may well be able to achievebetter throughputs with a client and server (or several clientsand servers) capable of generating a higher aggregate sessionrate. Both packet filtering and proxying do interfere noticeablywith bulk data throughput, the proxy substantially moreso. Thislast is somewhat surprising to the author, as he predicted thatthe two would perform roughly equally. Since both performedsubstantially worse than the Null Firewall, it is reasonable tosuppose that the observed bulk transfer rates are fairly close tothe maximum rates the firewalls are capable of. Both approaches can, realistically, perform perfectly well inlower speed (common) environments. Even the little PC achievedsomething close to a full (half-duplex) T1's worth of bandwidthwith the slower firewalling technology. With a sufficientlypowerful machine, either approach could saturate an ethernet, atleast in this simplified test configuration. 11. Future Directions There are several fairly obvious tests to run in future. Theseare outlined, along with predicted outcomes. * Multiple clients, multiple servers. The FTPsession rates are fairly clearly dominated by host costs in theNull and Packet Filter case. In order to get a real understandingabout just how much real work a firewall can do in thisdimension, multiple hosts are needed. The proxy firewall willprobably not perform much better, since it is an end-host withall the end-host costs, but the other scenarios should showmarked improvement. * Bidirectional tests. All the bulk trafficwas unidirectional in this experiment, which may affect theperformance in some way. This author would not care to venture aprediction here. * ttcp tests. This is a performance analysistool that allows a variety of TCP parameters to be adjusted, andprovides detailed output. This would be valuable forhigher-resolution information that the FTP bulk transfer testsherein can only approximate. Probably the results will be similarto the FTP bulk transfers, but verifying this would be valuable. * Other protocols. The FTP session rates arenot tremendously interesting in the real world, but a similartest for http probably would be of great interest. Probably theresults would be similar to those for FTP but, again,verification would be valuable. * Tests with synthetic workloads derived fromreal workloads. Work is proceeding on tools to generatespecifications for the workload tool from actual log files. Suchspecifications can then be used to drive various firewallconfigurations, and can be easily modified to simulatestatistically similar but higher or lower absolute loads. 12.

Appendix A Workload Performance Tool The workload generator tool creates a synthetic workload ofuser commands to be executed. The workload might be `do this 1000times in a row' or `do 100 of these all at the same time' or morecomplex constructions. These constructions are specified in aformal input language, defined as follows. The version of this tool used for these tests can be found inthe archives of the firewalls-performance mailing list, onftp.greatcircle.com, in 	/pub/firewalls-performance/digest/v01.n011.Z The language read by workload allows for comments, any textfollowing an octothorpe (# character) on a line is discarded. Theremainder is parsed, ignoring newlines and other whitespace(except as needed to separate keywords from one another), into ajob description. The notion of a job is defined recursively. The simplest jobis: 	command "<string>" The string is split into tokens, at white space, and theresulting vector is used as arguments to execvp(3). No filenameglobbing or metacharacter handling is done. There are alsocomplex job specifiers for doing a set of jobs in sequence, inparallel, or in a (deterministic) pseudo random order. A set of jobs can be carried out in sequence by using thesequential keyword. The first form carries out each of thespecified jobs, in the order specified. Each job must concludebefore the next one is started. The second form does the samething a specified number of times, as specified by the repeatcount. 	sequential {		<1 or more job specifiers>	}	sequential <repeat count> {		<1 or more job specifiers>	} The parallel keyword has exactly the same syntax as thesequential keyword, but the semantics are different. Rather thanwaiting for each job to conclude, all are started in the sameorder as with the sequential form, but as fast as possible. Theparallel construct then waits for all of the jobs to completebefore it is itself complete. The last job type is random. This has only one form:  	random <repeat count> <seed> <low> <high> {		<1 or more job specifiers>	} This is intermediate between the sequential and the parallelconstructs. The repeat count is not optional, and there are threeadditional numeric arguments which determine the pseudo-randomintervals between job starts. The jobs are started as in the twoother constructs, except that the interval between job starts isdetermined by successive calls to random(3). The output ofrandom(3) is used to select a uniformly distributed numberbetween <low> and <high> to start the next job insequence. The seed value is used to as the argument tosrandom(3), to provide repeatable results. When all the jobs have been started, workload waits for all tocomplete before the job is complete. Some examples: 	sequential 1 { command "ls -l" } will cause the command `ls -l' to be executed once.  	parallel 5 { command "ls -l" } will launch 5 copies of `ls -l' at once, and wait for them allto terminate.  	sequential 3 { parallel 5 { command "ls -l" } } will run 5 copies of `ls -l' in parallel, wait for them to allterminate, and then do it again 2 more times. Finally:  	sequential 3 {		random 5 42 1 3 {			command "test-script"		}	} Will start 5 copies of `test-script' at pseudo-randomintervals between 1 and 3 seconds (srandom() used to seed thestandard library random number generator with 42), and then waitfor them all to terminate. Then it'll do it twice more, for atotal of 3 sequential instances of the pseudo-random job. Naturally, job specifications can be nested more deeply(indeed, as deeply as you like). Appendix B ftp-gw This is the standard ftp-gw from the TIS firewall toolkit(version 1.3). Early results were slow enough to prompt modifyingthe server to accept a `shovel' parameter in the configurationfile, which specified how large of a block size to use in readingand writing on data connections. This made it easy to find the`sweet spot' in the space of possible buffer sizes. Notsurprisingly, the bigger the buffer, the better the throughput.At a buffer size of about 16K, the performance seemed to be veryclose to maximum, so the tests were run at this setting. Theoverall performance improvement was (for large bulk transfers)from about 160Kbytes/sec with the default 2K buffer, to about200Kbytes/sec with the 16K buffer. At the suggestion of the toolkit author, the peername()function was also modified. This function normally attemptsseveral nameservice lookups, looking up the name belonging to theaddress and the address belonging to that name, cross-checkingthe DNS databases. This is somewhat standard practice, andsomewhat expensive. The resulting speedups in sessionestablishment were measurable, but not dramatic. Do recall,however, that the lab network had no nameservice, so whilepeername() may have been attempting to do nameservice, it was notsucceeding, which probably sped these checks up (though renderingthem somewhat pointless). A further suggestion to modify the receive and send buffersizes of the TCP sockets used by ftp-gw was not taken, as kernelsources suggested that these default to the largest possiblesizes. There is not much else to say here, except that it iswonderful and that it built seamlessly, right out of the box. Thedesign of the configuration system made the modificationsdescribed essentially trivial. This author was highly impressedby the entire firewall toolkit. The entire firewall toolkit is available via anonymous FTPfrom ftp.tis.com, in /pub/firewalls/toolkit. The hardware and operating system used to run the server isdescribed in the next section. Appendix C Packet Filters Used The packet filtering software is an in-kernel bridge, builtinto Linux 1.1.95. It uses a fairly sophisticated compiler toproduce native code to do the packet filtering, and inserts thatinto a simple ethernet bridge module. The input filteringlanguage is very similar to Network Systems' Packet ControlFacility, though the output is substantially different. Thepacket filtering software used in these tests is unavailableoutside of Network Systems at this time. The hardware is a 386SX25 PC, equipped with 2 NE2000compatible ethernet cards. These cards do not do DMA, so themachine spends a fair bit of its time copying packets in and outof the device buffers. Better cards would probably help out, tosome extent. Other experiments have suggested strongly that thisdevice is limited by the device driver overhead, and generalkernel overhead, the packet filtering is essentially free. The actual packet filters used are as follows. They provide apretty fair set of rules, this author believes. # Apply on 10.0.0.2's interfacefilter nospoof_one	ip_sa in (10.0.0.1) fail;	ipfrag in (1..8) fail;end# Apply on 10.0.0.1's interfacefilter nospoof_two	ip_sa in (10.0.0.2) fail;	ipfrag in (1..8) fail;end# Log anything with a SYN, FIN or RST# apply on firstfilter audit	tcpflags/0x02 = 0x02 log 10.0.0.1;	tcpflags/0x01 = 0x01 log 10.0.0.1;	tcpflags/0x04 = 0x04 log 10.0.0.1;end	filter c_to_s	# Permit UDP echo requests	ip_protocol in (17) udp_dp in (7) succeed;	# If it's not originating on a 'safe' user port, dump	tcp_sp in (0..1023, 6000..6010) fail;	# If it's not going to ports 20 or 21, dump it	tcp_dp in (0..19,22..65535) fail;	# if it's trying to do connection setup to data port, dump	tcpflags/0x12 = 0x02 tcp_dp in (20) fail;	# if it's trying to do connect response to control port, dump	tcpflags/0x12 = 0x12 tcp_dp in (21) fail;endfilter s_to_c	# Permit UDP echo replies	ip_protocol in (17) udp_sp in (7) succeed;	# if it's not going to a 'safe' user port, dump	tcp_dp in (0..1023, 6000..6010) fail;	# If it's not coming from ports 20 or 21, dump it	tcp_sp in (0..19,22..65535) fail;	# if it's trying to do connection setup from control port, dump	tcpflags/0x12 = 0x02 tcp_sp in (21) fail;	# if it's trying to do connect response from data port, dump	tcpflags/0x12 = 0x12 tcp_sp in (20) fail;endapply audit on first;apply nospoof_one on eth1 incoming;apply nospoof_two on eth2 incoming;apply s_to_c on 10.0.0.2/255.255.255.255 to 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255;apply c_to_s on 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 to 10.0.0.2/255.255.255.255;WT02-B31-267IA020-000210-B034-250http://sandcastle-ltd.com:80/Papers/skey_white_paper.html 199.35.141.30 19970107122235 text/html 13226HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Tue, 07 Jan 1997 12:24:00 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 13054Last-modified: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 14:29:41 GMT              Vulnerabilities in the S/KEY one time password system			[s/key is a trademark of Bellcore]                                 Author: Mudge              Organization: L0pht Heavy Industries (aka l0pht.com)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This may be redistributed as long as proper credit is maintained. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------This paper is still under revision and modification. If you have any commentsor feedback please e-mail me.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This text attempts to touch upon several vulnerabilities found in OneTime Password (OTP) implementations such as S/Key. It is organized in thefollowing manor:	Introduction	   brief overview of OTP's and what security issues they	   attempt to fix.	Dictionary Attacks	   brute force OTP hacking	Spoofing Attacks	   presenting different iteration counters	Race Attacks	   multiple people going in under the same OTP	Hi-Jacking	   taking over established OTP sessions	Outro-------------------------------------------------------------------------------				Introduction-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Being sniffed is the sys-admins / security analysts worst nightmare (well,not really but humor me). For those that aren't aware, sniffing is slang for placing a network card into promiscuous mode so that it actually looks at all of the traffic coming along the line and not just the packets that are addressed to it. By doing this one can catch passwords, login names, confidential information, etc. Of course there are good sides to being able to place a card into promiscuous mode such as traffic analysis, debugging drivers and network applications, and testing router configurations to name just a few. In promiscuous mode anything that goes by in plaintext is fair game. Each time you telnet to a machine, ftp to another machine, connect to the smtp port or POP port, read news, off of a different machine, or issue Remote Procedure Calls you hand your password and other private information to anyone who wants to sit on the lines and listen in. There are several ways of protecting oneself. DESLogin provides completely encrypted telnet sessions, there is a kerberized POP server available, and there are hardware and software utilities to do encryption on different OSI layers. Many of these suffer from either being commercial products or simply being too difficult to administer.A wonderful security tool was presented to the network community that providesa seeming solution to having your password sniffed. The theory behind it is tonever use the same password. This is accomplished by a challenge responsesystem. The system you are contacting issues you a unique challenge. You go offand compute your response and then send back that unique response to the host.The next time you are presented with a different challenge and thus come backwith a different response. Sounds great doesn't it? What's even better is thatthe software for the server side and the client side are free and widelyavailable. Here's an example of what it looks like:	madwand.l0pht.com> telnet some.host.somewhere	Trying 199.99.99.99... Connected to some.host.somewhere.	Escape character is '^]'.	login: jdoe	s/key 99 k113355	Password:	[at this point the user either issues the following in another	 window or else suspends the current session]	^]	telnet>^Z	madwand.l0pht.com> key 99 k113356	Reminder - Do not use key while loged in via telnet or dial-in.	Enter secret password:[passwd doesn't echo]	FLY ACE TIDY BURR CON CADY	madwand.l0pht.com> fg	Password:FLY ACE TIDY BURR CON CADY	Welcome back jdoe!	bash%What has happened here is a telnet to a machine where S/KEY is in use. Afterlogging in with the username of jdoe, a challenge is issued. jdoe computes hisresponse on a local machine and uses that as input for the password prompt.Let's take a look at this and figure:	s/key 99 k113355	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	s/key - text so the user knows what is going on.	99 - number of iterations through MD4	k113355 - seed	Assuming jdoe provided a valid response, the next time he would try to log inthe iterations counter would be decremented [i.e. s/key 98 k113355] and theresponse that would be computed would be different. Thus anybody who sniffedthe above [i.e. user: jdoe - Password: FLY ACE TIDY BURR CON CADY] would not beable to gain access to the machine with this information as the same password is not valid for the next session.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                               Dictionary Attacks-------------------------------------------------------------------------------One of the first vulnerabilities is that all of the information is broadcast inplaintext. What this means is that it is trivial to take the challenge andresponse and compare this with the result of the challenge applied to words outof a dictionary.Remember, in the above example, when the user escaped to a local shell andentered the following:        madwand.l0pht.com> key 99 k113356        Reminder - Do not use key while loged in via telnet or dial-in.        Enter secret password:[passwd doesn't echo]        FLY ACE TIDY BURR CON CADYSince people will pick easy to remember words or phrases this works in to the cracker's advantage. Granted, users can now choose phrases instead ofa single word... however, how many people are likely to choose: k35jsX/ O0l3f ffdg99999d as opposed to something like: mary had a little lamb.The dictionaries used for this sort of attack will simply start to encompassphrases.[example]username: jdoe				# here we have the information	challenge: 99 k113355			# that we capturedresponse: WELD GUY CHIMP SWING GONE	jdoe's real password: ????dictionary word 1: love			# here we start the dictionarychallenge: 99 k113355			# attackresponse: BAD LOST CRUMB HIDE KNOT(well that's not it...)dictionary word 2: sexchallenge: 99 k113355response: FORT HARD BIKE HIT SWING(not it either...)dictionary word 3: secretchallenge 99 k113355response: WELD GUY CHIMP SWING GONE(bingo! )We now know that jdoe's real password is 'secret'. With this information we cangenerate a valid response no matter what the challenge.This is particularly important since in the current implementations of the skeypackage neither the client or server side does any sort of sanity check on thesecurity of the chosen password. This means there is no failsafe to try toprevent you from choosing your login name as your password or other silliness.Another source for dictionary attacks come from the /etc/skeykeys file. Thenumber of sites that have skey set up that have the improper permissions set onthis file is quite surprising (although this is to be expected as the codefrom both Bellcore and Weitse Venema's logdaemon set it up this way. A quickfix is to simply change the mode to 600). This file should not be set world readable.  While the 'keyinfo' program would like it to be so, the harm outweighs the good. The skeykeys file looks like this:root 0072 k113357          12afaa8be65f0502  Jun 29,1995 12:40:48jdoe 0099 k113355       c7f42dfd84914af3  May 30,1995 16:20:19[etc...]What we have here is the username, iteration counter, seed, and a hexrepresentation of the five word response we saw before. The other three fieldsare simply date and time information which isn't of much interest right now.The exact same sort of dictionary hack can be made with this information. Justto bring the point home, let's pretend you have a large user base of say, 200users, and since you are security conscious you have a shadow password systemand are using s/key. The average user will not be able to look at thereal password file since it is shadowed, they will not be able to do a standarddictionary attack on it. He will, however, be able to see the skeykeys fileand do a dictionary attack on it if the permissions are set improperly, thusdefeating the benefits of a shadowed password file.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                Spoofing Attacks-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since the iteration counter is transmitted along with the seed, one possibilityis to masquerade as the server. This could be done by setting up a bogusgateway or whatever. Who we are really spoofing is the user. Let's take thefollowing scenario...login: jdoe[jdoe telnet's to his machine]s/key 55 k113355password:[what jdoe should have seen was a challenge of 98 k113355 but instead we have sent a lower challenge of 55 k113355.]password: MY SPIT LOFT HEAD TEAR[jdoe calculates the response for 55 k113355 based upon his secret password]Login incorrectlogin:[we tell jdoe that his login was incorrect and forward the rest of the connection to the actual machine he really wanted to talk to in the first place]With the response we have for the 55 k113355 challenge all we have to do is runit through more iterations of md4 for the subsequent responses. For example,with the information we have now, if we want to figure out the response for thechallenge 60 k113355 we need to run it through 5 more iterations of md4. If wewere looking for the response to the challenge of 97 k113355 we would need torun it through 42 more iterations of md4. etc. etc.We can now telnet to the machine and, as long as the iteration counter in thechallenge is above 55 k113355, we can compute the proper response without everhaving to know the secret password.There are many variations on the above theme...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Race Attacks-------------------------------------------------------------------------------There seems to be a problem with s/key that allows two simultaneous logins tooccur with the same key. If I am in a position to capture-look-at-modify jdoe'sresponses as they go by (i.e. we're a bogus gateway or something again), wecan open up another telnet session to the same machine and, since he hasn'tlogged in yet the iteration counter hasn't been decremented. As the program has to work this way as to avoid denial of service attacks we get the samechallenge. When we receive jdoe's response we simply send the same informationover to our other processes as well as his original login. With a little luck alocking problem will occur with the skeykeys file and we will both be let inunder the same challenge and response (but wait you say, there can't be alocking problem as s/key does not do real file locking. Instead it jumps through a bunch of hoops to do a similar thing... get the idea?). This should be easily fixable in the source but I have not yet investigated this fully.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                               Hi-Jacking Attacks-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is not a problem with s/key but simply a reminder of your vulnerability.Remember that once a connection has been established and jdoe has successfullyanswered the challenge with the appropriate response, there are no more checksdone on the s/key side of things. It is not designed to re-check the validityand authorization of a user once he is logged in. It is not kerberos.People are too often lulled into false senses of security, as in the choosingof easily guessed passwords, when they use the s/key system. Once in, the sameIP Hi-jacking and monitoring tricks can be used on jdoe's session as can beused on non-s/key sessions.Along with Hi-jacking, think of the administrator who logs in with hisOTP and the proceeds to enter new accounts. The passive sniffer will stillsee all of the passwords and sensitive information that the administratoris entering.Don't be lulled into a false sense of security.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Outro-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I like s/key. I think s/key is a very usefull utility and a great asset to thecommunity in general. This paper should not dissuade anyone from using s/key.It is simply meant to point out certain vulnerabilities. The worst thing thatcan happen to the security conscious is thinking they are secure when theyreally aren't. While s/key does provide added security, neither it nor any other product currently out on the market is the be-all end-all to security. If this paper has helped to remind anyone of this then it has done its job.-Mudgemudge@l0pht.comWT02-B31-268IA020-000210-B034-297http://sandcastle-ltd.com:80/sun_security_bulletin_136.html 199.35.141.30 19970107122315 text/html 42308HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Tue, 07 Jan 1997 12:24:29 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 42136Last-modified: Sat, 12 Oct 1996 16:55:14 GMT Sun Security Bulletin #136 =============================================================================	 SUN MICROSYSTEMS SECURITY BULLETIN: #00136, 9 Oct 1996=============================================================================BULLETIN TOPICSIn this bulletin Sun discusses the TCP-based "SYN flood" denial-of-service attack.

What has Happened, Who is Affected, What to Do    A. What has Happened    Late this summer, an electronic "hacker journal" published complete    source code for a program to mount a so-called "TCP SYN flood"    attack, in which a targeted system is bombarded with requests for a    certain kind of network connection. Such an attack cannot    compromise the security of a targeted system--no one can "break in"    using it--but it can tie up the system, making it unavailable to    respond to legitimate users. Some systems may even crash, if key    system resources are exhausted.    Within a few weeks after the release of the source code, several    Internet service providers had been victimized by this "denial-of-    service" attack. To date, published reports indicate that several    dozen such attacks have been carried out, not only against    commercial service providers but also popular non-profit sites,    such as the Internet Chess Club.    Because the complete source to the program, with instructions for    use, was published, it takes little technical knowledge to mount    the attack.  Further, because the program takes steps to conceal    which system is sending the packets, it's proved difficult (though    not impossible) to trace an attack to its source. For these    reasons--and although relatively few sites out of the Internet's    tens of millions have been affected--Sun, along with many other    software makers and computer security experts around the world, has    worked hard since the day the attacks were announced to evaluate    both the attack and the many countermeasures which have been    proposed.    This bulletin summarizes what we have learned, and gives the best    advice we have today about which Sun customers may be vulnerable    --and what those sites can do to protect themselves.    B. Who is Affected    The only systems which are vulnerable to this attack are those    (such as Web servers, FTP servers, or mail servers) which directly    accept TCP connection requests from other systems on the Internet.    Most systems behind firewalls are safe. However, some firewalls are    configured to pass through connection requests on particular ports    to server systems behind the firewall. In such cases the server    could well be vulnerable to a SYN flood attack.    If you are not sure whether your systems accept TCP conection    requests directly from systems on the Internet, check with your    Network Administrator.    C. What to Do    If your Solaris/SunOS systems are vulnerable to the TCP SYN flood    attack, there are several immediate steps you may be able to take    to protect them.    1. Apply the parametric adjustments and other changes described in       our "Technical Recommendations" section as soon as possible.       (Note that some of the changes require access to source code.)       When patches become available, as described under "Plans and       Schedules", obtain and install them.    2. Consider adding additional physical memory to any systems which,       as described in section II.D.3, would benefit from it.    3. If your system is running one of the older versions of the SunOS       operating system, such as SunOS 4.1.3, 4.1.3_U1, or 4.1.4, or       5.3 (Solaris 2.3), consider upgrading to a later release.       Solaris 2.4, 2.5, and 2.5.1 systems stand up to this attack much       better than earlier releases, especially after tuning, because       of the cumulative effect of several TCP-related improvements.       The earlier releases can withstand only very light attacks, if       any. Some details are provided under "Understanding the       Vulnerability".    4. Review which incoming ports your system services. Pare that       list down to essentials. One way to determine which ports your       system is currently listening to by executing a command such       as:          netstat -a -f inet | grep LISTEN       On Solaris 2.4 and later systems, you can obtain much the same       information with the simpler command:          ndd /dev/tcp tcp_listen_hash       To reduce the number of ports listened to by inetd, edit the       file /etc/inetd.conf and comment out any unneeded entries.    5. Consider installing--especially if you are a 4.1.x customer--a       firewall, or a hardware filter, or one of the new third-party       software packages. (Sun has not tested and does not currently       endorse any of the new products, such as Checkpoint's       "SYNDefender", now being marketed to defend against this       attack.)II.  Understanding the Vulnerability    A. How the SYN Flood Attack Works       The attack exploits a basic design element of the "TCP       protocol", a set of rules developed many years ago to govern a       certain class of conversations between computers. Here is a       description, extracted from the recent CERT advisory CA-96.21.	  When a system (called the client) attempts to establish a TCP	  connection to a system providing a service (the server), the	  client and server exchange a set sequence of messages. This	  connection technique applies to all TCP connections--telnet,	  Web, email, etc.	  The client system begins by sending a SYN message to the	  server. The server then acknowledges the SYN message by	  sending SYN-ACK message to the client. The client then	  finishes establishing the connection by responding with an	  ACK message. The connection between the client and the server	  is then open, and the service-specific data can be exchanged	  between the client and the server. Here is a view of this	  message flow:                Client                  Server                ------                  ------                SYN-------------------->                   <--------------------SYN-ACK                ACK-------------------->                     Client and server can now                     send service-specific data	 The potential for abuse arises at the point where the server	 system has sent an acknowledgment (SYN-ACK) back to the client	 but has not yet received the ACK message....	 The attacking system sends [a flood of] SYN messages to the	 victim server system; these appear to be legitimate but in	 fact reference a client system that is unable to respond to	 the SYN-ACK messages.                Bombarding a system with, say, dozens of falsified connection       requests a minute can seriously degrade its ability to give       service to legitimate connection requests. This is why the       attack is said to "deny service" to the system's users.    B. How To Tell If Your System Is Under Attack       1. Checking for Connections in the "SYN_RCVD" State       A system under attack may appear to be running normally in most       respects. Outgoing connections, for example, and logged-in users       may be serviced normally. The symptoms of the attack will most       likely be noticed when someone attempts an incoming connection       --for example, by trying to reach a Web site on the target       system.  Depending on the rate of attack (and how resistant it       is), the system will react sluggishly, or not at all, to such       incoming connection requests.       One way a system administrator can check to see whether an       attack is in progress is to monitor the number of TCP       connections in the "SYN_RCVD" state, via a command such as the       following.                 netstat -an -f inet | grep SYN_RCVD | wc -l       Comparing the value returned by this command to a known-normal       value will give a good indication of whether the system is under       attack.       2. Using TCP Transaction Statistics       The above check for the "SYN_RCVD" state will work for all       Solaris/SunOS systems. More refined tools are available under       Solaris 2.x systems, which maintain TCP transaction statistics.       Display the TCP transaction statistics with a command such as:          netstat -s -P tcp       The "tcpTimRetransDrop" parameter shows the number of aborts       since boot time due to abort timer expirations. This count       includes both SYN requests and established TCP connections.       The "tcpListenDrop" parameter, introduced in Solaris 2.5.1,       shows the number of SYN requests that have been refused since       boot time due to "backlog full" conditions.       You may see occasional "tcpListenDrop" incidents on a normal,       busy 2.5.1 system. (This can happen, for example, when the       loaded system is not able to schedule the server daemon soon       enough to service incoming SYN requests, so that they fill up       the daemon's backlog queue.) But if you see the "tcpListenDrop"       count going up very quickly, with "tcpTimRetransDrop" events       following that rise, your system may well be under a SYN       attack.    C. Our Testing       The first incidents were announced a few weeks ago. Since then       Sun has obtained several versions of SYN flood attack software,       and tested the most effective of them against every supported       SunOS version.  A complex mix of hardware configurations were       included in the testing, being combined with the different       operating system releases to produce a test matrix with dozens       of combinations.       Basing our trials on publicly and privately obtained information       about the rates and durations of the attacks, we reproduced in       our testing two common modes. The "light" attack consisted of a       few falsified SYN requests a second. The "heavy" attack       consisted of hundreds (even thousands) such packets per second.    D. How Sun Systems Stand Up       Our testing indicates that even a light SYN flood attack will       often succeed against Solaris/SunOS systems which have not been       either shielded from it or hardened against it. After such steps       have been taken, newer and larger systems can generally       withstand even a heavy attack; systems running older releases of       SunOS--especially those with relatively small amounts of memory,       say 64 MB--still succumb.       We have seen the following regularities apply.       1. Faster hardware does better than slower hardware. The CPU	  time required to handle the flood of connection requests	  represents less of a resource drain.       2. Newer versions of SunOS react much better than older	  versions.  Specifically, we have found that Solaris 2.5.1,	  2.5, and 2.4 (SunOS 5.5.1, 5.5, and 5.4) perform better under	  attack than SunOS 5.3, 4.1.4, 4.1.3_U1, and 4.1.3.       3. Systems with plenty of physical memory react better than	  systems with less memory, so long as the operating system is	  able to make use of the extra memory to create and manage a	  sizable queue. Systems with only 64 MB of memory may well	  benefit from an increase. Systems already at 128 MB or above          might not. See appendix A for a formula you can use to help	  make this determination.	  SunOS 4.1.x systems cannot effectively make use of more than	  2 MB of memory for queue entries, because of a systemic	  limitation in the management of "mbufs". For this reason	  adding extra memory will not help harden a 4.1.x system to	  this attack.	  SunOS 5.3 (Solaris 2.3) also fares little better under this	  attack with "extra" memory, though for different reasons.	  The capacity to cope with memory demands dynamically was one	  of the features improved in Solaris 2.4. It shows.       4. Systems which do not need to service legitimate connection	  requests over slow asynchronous lines fare much better than	  those which do. This is because setting a very low timeout	  value for connection requests helps the system clean up fake	  requests quickly, but may cause an unacceptably high timeout	  rate for legitimate connections over slow links.       Our conclusion after testing: without adjustment, no version of       Solaris/SunOS can be relied upon to withstand a heavy (hundreds       of packets a second) SYN flood attack. After parametric tuning,       Solaris 2.4 and later releases stand up very well. Earlier       versions, including Solaris 2.3, may withstand a very light       attack but remain susceptible to moderate and heavy ones.III. Technical RecommendationsThe two most effective adjustments which you can make quickly toprotect your Solaris/SunOS systems against the SYN flood attack are to(1) shorten the value of the abort timer, and (2) lengthen the backlogqueue for those TCP ports which might be bombarded. On Solaris 2.xsystems, these changes can be made using the ndd program. Rebuildingthe kernel is required to adjust the behavior of 4.1.x systems.The two changes each increase the capacity of the system to queue andprocess all TCP connection requests, whether valid or invalid.Increasing the length of the backlog queue will have no effect unlessyou also make an adjustment involving the listen() call on the affectedport(s). You will need to either rebuild from source the listenerapplications your systems use, or patch the binaries.  See paragraph Cbelow for some more information.Lowering the abort timeout is a very effective measure to take againstSYN attacks.  Changing this parameter, however, will have a side effectthat some sites may find unacceptable: outgoing connection requests,initiated by users already on the adjusted system, will time out inless time than before. This side effect occurs because the system usesthe same abort timer for both incoming and outgoing connections.Will adding physical memory improve your system's ability to withstandthe attack? It's possible; the answer depends on how much memory yoursystem has now, how many ports service incoming connections, how lowyou can set the abort timer value, and which version of the operatingsystem (see section II.D.3) your system is running.See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion of the relationship betweenthe effects of queue length, abort timeout, and available memory. For information about more sophisticated, design-level approaches weare working on (which all involve source code changes), see sectionIV.    A. Decreasing the Abort Timeout Value       Solaris/SunOS systems are distributed with timeout values set       either to four minutes (SunOS 5.3 and earlier 5.x) or three       minutes (SunOS 5.4 and later). For 4.1.x the timeout is 75       seconds. These values were selected to ensure reasonable       performance over slow asynchronous lines, which can incur very       long delays.       Lower values allow the system to purge falsified connection       requests faster. In our testing, values in the range of ten       seconds gave the best results in configurations which did not       include asynchronous lines. However, setting the abort timer to       such a low value may very likely cause unsatisfactory results if       connections involving asynchronous lines must be serviced. In       those cases, a value in the range of one minute may give more       satisfactory results.       1. Instructions for Solaris 2.x systems.          On Solaris 2.x systems, you can set the abort timer value with a          command similar to:	  ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_ip_abort_cinterval 10000          The timeout value, here ten seconds, is given in milliseconds.          To make the change permanent, add the command to the file          /etc/init.d/inetinit.          Note that, as described above, this new value will also affect          outgoing connections.       2. Instructions for SunOS 4.1.x systems.	  We list here two possible approaches. Each involves rebuilding	  the kernel.	  Note that because the value is interpreted here as being in	  half-second units, you must change the parametric value to	  20 to reduce the timeout to, for example, 10 seconds.	  a. Place the value of the abort timer in a variable, so that	  it can be changed with adb. This approach is the one we	  expect to take in an upcoming 4.1.x kernel patch.	  Here are diff files (the example is taken from our 4.1.4	  source) showing one way to effect that change.             tcp_input.c:             > /* adjustable variable to replace TCPTV_KEEP_INIT */             > int tcptv_keep_init = TCPTV_KEEP_INIT;             444c446             <               tp->t_timer[TCPT_KEEP] = TCPTV_KEEP_INIT;             ---             >               tp->t_timer[TCPT_KEEP] = tcptv_keep_init;	  After editing the file, you would need to put the modified	  tcp_input.c file in /sys/netinet and rebuild a kernel.	  b. Change the abort timer value parameter, TCPTV_KEEP_INIT,	  and rebuild the kernel. The parameter is defined in the	  header file /sys/netinet/tcp_timer.h.           This approach is slightly simpler but has the side effect          on outgoing connections discussed earlier.	  After editing the header file, you would need to rebuild          a kernel, ensuring that the tcp_input.c was re-compiled.    B. Lengthening the Per-Port Backlog Queue       Solaris 2.4 and 2.3 systems, and 4.1.x systems, are distributed       with a maximum backlog queue length of 5. For Solaris 2.5 and       2.5.1, the value was increased to 32. To harden your system       against SYN flood attacks, you probably need a value in the       thousands.       In the examples below we show how to set the actual per-port max       value to 8,192. During our testing the number of queue entries       never exceeded this number, no matter how fast we bombarded the       system with SYN requests.                    1. Instructions for Solaris 2.x systems.	  Lengthening the backlog queue is a two-step process. Before	  increasing the value of the parameter which controls how many	  connections may be queued per port, it is necessary to change	  the maximum value the system will range-check the new setting	  against.          a. First, change the upper limit the system will enforce. This          can be done with adb. One approach is to effect the change in          a startup file, then reboot the system. To change the upper          limit to a value of 10,240, append the following line to the          file /etc/init.d/inetinit:	  echo "tcp_param_arr+14/W 0t10240" | adb -kw /dev/ksyms /dev/mem	  b. Next, change the system parameter specifying the per-port	  backlog queue length. This can be done with the ndd program.          ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 8192          The parametric value you specify must be less than or equal to          the upper limit set in the previous step (as in this case the          value of 8,192 is less than the upper limit of 10,240).          	  After executing the ndd command, you will need to restart the	  listener daemons for the change to tcp_conn_req_max to have	  any effect. The queue data structures are created at the time	  the listen() call is handled.          To make the change permanent, add the command to the file          /etc/init.d/inetinit.       2. Instructions for SunOS 4.1.x systems.	  We list here three possible approaches. The first two are	  equivalent. All involve rebuilding the kernel.	  What is the best value for SOMAXCONN, the maximum per-port	  backlog queue value parameter? The answer will vary,	  depending on how your system is used. Values between 100-500	  are good places to start. Just how high a value can safely be	  used depends primarily on how many ports are likely to be	  attacked.	  In SunOS 4.1.x systems only 2MB of memory can be allocated	  for mbufs. A heavy attack into a long queue can exhaust the	  system's supply of mbufs quickly.	  Since SOMAXCONN is used to limit the queue length for each	  port, a value of 1,000 may be safe if connections to only one	  port (to a Web server,for example) are passed through by a	  packet-filtering firewall or router.	  A conservative approach, then, might be to mininimize the	  number of incoming ports serviced (N), then set SOMAXCONN so	  that	     N * SOMAXCONN < 1000          Since each queue entry consumes about 600 bytes of memory,          the total amount of memory dedicated to queue entries when          the system was under attack would then be 600,000--more than          one-fourth the total mbuf allocation.          a. Change the maximum per-port backlog queue value parameter,          SOMAXCONN, and rebuild the kernel. The parameter is defined          in the header file /sys/sys/socket.h.	  b. Place the value in a variable, so that it can easily be	  changed with adb. This more flexible approach is the one we	  expect to take in an upcoming 4.1.x kernel patch.	  Here are diff files (again from 4.1.4) showing one way to	  effect that change.             uipc_socket.c:             > /* adjustable variable to replace SOMAXCONN */             > int somaxconn = SOMAXCONN;             >              119c122             <       so->so_qlimit = MIN(backlog, SOMAXCONN);             ---             >       so->so_qlimit = MIN(backlog, somaxconn);          After editing the files, you would need to put the modified          uipc_socket.c in /sys/os and the modified tcp_input.c in          /sys/netinet and rebuild a kernel.	  Note that since so_qlimit (the receive queue limit) is the	  MIN() of the application-specified backlog value and	  somaxconn, listening applications must be restarted after a	  change to the new variable somaxconn is made.	  c. Modify the kernel code which uses SOMAXCONN, causing it          to disregard the application-specified backlog and substitute          the same (presumably higher) value for each port. We have          not tested this approach under production conditions and          stop short, at this point, of recommending it.             uipc_socket.c:             > /* adjustable variable to replace SOMAXCONN */             > int somaxconn = SOMAXCONN;             >              119c122             <       so->so_qlimit = MIN(backlog, SOMAXCONN);             ---             >       so->so_qlimit = somaxconn; /* NOT RECOMMENDED */    C. Increasing the Number of Connections the Listener Processes Can Service       As stated earlier, increasing the length of the backlog queue       will have no effect unless you also make an adjustment involving       the listen() call on the affected port(s). That is, listening       applications will need to be rebuilt to increase the requested       backlog value, so that the new SOMAXCONN value is reflected in       so_qlimit.       Three listening applications found on most UNIX systems are       in.named, sendmail, and inetd. (Many sites also run their own       customer applications.) So one example of a listener program       which will need to be changed is inetd, which issues the       listen() call on behalf of the daemons for which it watches       ports.       We expect to issue a patch for inetd in the near future (see       section IV.D). That patch is likely to add to inetd the ability       to specify on the command line the number of connections to       which inetd will listen on a particular port.       Until such a patch is available, customers with source licenses       may want to rebuild inetd, implementing either the new feature       described above or the following, simpler change. The change       is once again shown with reference to SunOS 4.1.4 source.             inetd.c:             656c656             <               listen(sep->se_fd, 10);             ---             >               listen(sep->se_fd, 1000000);             705c705             <               listen(sep->se_fd, 10);             ---             >               listen(sep->se_fd, 1000000);             1247c1276             <                       qlen = 10;             ---             >                       qlen = 1000000;             1324c1353             <                       listen(sep->se_fd, 10);             ---             >                       listen(sep->se_fd, 1000000);             1365c1394             <                       qlen = 10;             ---             >                       qlen = 1000000;             1433c1462             <               listen(sep->se_fd, 10);             ---             >               listen(sep->se_fd, 1000000);       The effect of these edits would be to cause inetd to always       specify in the listen() call that it could handle 1,000,000       simultaneous connections. The effective value would thus be       the system's upper limit.       IV.  Plans and SchedulesThe parametric adjustments we have discussed can bring aboutsignificant improvement. But they do not represent a complete solutionto the problems posed by the SYN flood attack.  The principal drawbacksare:1. Lowering the abort timer value to small values (on the order of tenseconds) is not practical when slow asynchronous lines must beserviced. Service providers may find this dilemma particularlydifficult to resolve--unless all access to their systems is via slowlines, in which case the attack rate will be low, and long timeoutsvalues may be acceptable.2. Increasing the backlog queue to very large (on the order of 10K)means that, when the system is under attack, falsified requests willconsume several megabytes of memory. This memory, and the CPU cyclesneeded to handle the requests and operate the timeouts, are resourceswasted when the system must treat every request in the same way.3. Modifying system parameters to allow a larger maximum backlog queuelength has no effect without other changes. The kernel will only insertinto a port's queue however many connection requests the servicingapplication announced it could handle at the time it issued thelisten() system call. In some applications, the listen backlog size isconfigurable. In others, the size is hard-coded. Unfortunately, forinetd (a program which itself serves as a listener on behalf of otherprograms) the value used for the backlog size is hard-coded. So inetdmust be re-compiled in order for a change in the system maximum to haveany effect on ports on which inetd is listening.Better solutions require algorithmic re-design at the source level.    A. Design-Level Changes Being Considered       Sun is currently testing several possible new algorithms to deal       with SYN flood and similar attacks. Many of these possible       changes were suggested and analyzed in the informal discussions       that have arisen amongst experts worldwide seeking defensive       countermeasures.       Some of the methods being considered for inclusion in some       Solaris/SunOS releases are:       1. Implement an algorithm (perhaps a combination of "random          drop" and "oldest drop") to drop queue members when the backlog          queue is full.       2. Tune the networking code to handle large numbers of SYN	  requests more efficiently by (for example) changing the	  listener queue to use more efficient data structures, such as	  hash tables.       3. Give priority to requests which originate from sources	  with which successful handshakes have already been concluded	  in the past.       In addition, many of the above methods might be combined with an       adaptive approach to produce behavior which varies depending on       whether or not the system seems to be under attack.    B. OS Versions For Which Algorithmic Changes Are Being Developed       Sun will develop and adopt defensive techniques, similar to       those outlined above, in a future release of Solaris/SunOS. Some       of these techniques are already being tested in our development       labs for possible inclusion in the next release.       In addition, Sun commits to producing patches representing an       appropriate subset of such techniques for the following versions       of Solaris/SunOS: Solaris 2.5.1, 2.5, and 2.4 (SunOS 5.5.1, 5.5,       and 5.4 respectively). Patches will be supplied for all       supported hardware platforms.    C. OS Versions For Which No Algorithmic Changes Are Planned       No design-level algorithmic changes are planned for the       following versions of Solaris/SunOS: 5.3 (Solaris 2.3), 4.1.4,       4.1.3_U1, and 4.1.3. This decision was reached after careful       study of several engineering options and their concomitant       benefits, resource commitments, and risks.       Sun will produce patches for these releases in the near future,       however, which make it possible for customers without source       code to implement the parametric adjustments described in the       Technical Recommendations section.       We also encourage all customers who may be affected by this new       attack to investigate third-party solutions such as those       alluded to earlier.       Note that the SYN flood attack is not the result of any system       bug, defect, or flaw, nor any error in implementing the TCP       protocol.  Rather, it represents the stark difference between       the world in which TCP was designed and the Internet environ-       ment we work in and live in today. The decision to not develop       algorithmic changes for these older releases does not represent       any change in Sun's commitment to provide fixes, free of charge,       for all security bugs in supported releases.    D. Schedule of Upcoming Patches       Sun will produce patches in the near future to facilitate the       application of parametric changes to SunOS 4.1.x systems.  We       expect that these patches, which will appply to the kernel and       to inetd, will be available in two weeks or less.       Sun will also produce inetd patches for all supported Solaris       2.x releases.  We expect these patches to be available within       three weeks.       As described earlier, Sun will also release kernel patches for       Solaris 2.4 and later releases which implement design-level       changes. We will give these changes an extremely high priority       in the development and patch processes. Official patches may       take as long as two or even three months to produce, as a result       of the testing required of every kernel patch; but preliminary       patches should be available within 30 days for testing by       interested customers.       All of the patches described above will be announced via our       usual methods. In addition, we will issue within 30 days a       supplemental Sun Bulletin detailing the algorithms we have       selected and the exact dates we expect the patches to be       available. APPENDICESA.   Queuing Capacity Vs. Attack Rates    1. The arithmetical relationships    The relationship between the effects of queue length, abort timeout,    and available memory is shown by the following calculations. Each    entry in the backlog queue takes up roughly 600 bytes. Let:       T = the setting of the abort timer, in seconds;       L = the backlog limit of the listener queue, per port, in bytes;       N = the number of ports which must service SYN connections;       R = the rate of all incoming SYN requests on a given port; and       RTT = Round-trip-time between the client and the server.    Then we can calculate the total amount of memory potentially consumed by    a full-out SYN attack on all ports, filling all queues, as:       N * L * ~600    So the total for, say, 25 ports with queues 8,192 entries long would be       25 ports  *  8,192 entries  *  ~600  bytes/entry    or about 120MB. This calculation shows why an increase from 64 MB to    128 MB may help your system cope with an attack, and also why it is    important to determine and reduce the number of listening ports.    2. Memory limits    On Solaris 2.x systems, the memory the system allocates to the    queues comes from the kernel heap. Adding physical memory beyond 64    MB may not increase the size of the heap, which is itself allocated    from the virtual address space available to the kernel. The maximum    memory available to the kernel varies depending on the hardware    platform.  Some common values are 100MB for sun4m machines,    240-250MB for sun4d machines, and more than 2GB for sun4u    processors.    On SunOS 1.x systems, of course, the allocation must come from the    2MB mbuf limit.    3. Queue overflow and timeouts    If a port is under attack, and the queue is filling up, then all    incoming SYN requests (good or faked) will continue to be queued so    long as       L/T > R    When the SYN arriving rate R is greater than L/T, however, then    R - L/T packets/sec will be dropped. At that point, therefore,    a legitimate SYN request may be lost in the flood of fakes.    Of course, for any request, if RTT > T, the request will time out.B.   How to obtain Sun security patches    1. If you have a support contract    Customers with Sun support contracts can obtain any patches listed    in this bulletin (and any other patches--and a list of patches)    from:       - SunSolve Online       - Local Sun answer centers, worldwide       - SunSITEs worldwide    The patches are available via World Wide Web at    http://sunsolve1.sun.com.    You should also contact your answer center if you have a support    contract and:       - You need assistance in installing a patch       - You need additional patches       - You want an existing patch ported to another platform       - You believe you have encountered a bug in a Sun patch       - You want to know if a patch exists, or when one will be ready    2. If you do not have a support contract    Customers without support contracts may now obtain security    patches, "recommended" patches, and patch lists via SunSolve    Online.    Sun does not furnish patches to any external distribution sites    other than the ones mentioned here. The ftp.uu.net and ftp.eu.net    sites are no longer supported.    3. About the checksums    So that you can quickly verify the integrity of the patch files    themselves, we supply in each bulletin checksums for the tar    archives.    Occasionally, you may find that the listed checksums do not match    the patches on the SunSolve or SunSite database. This does not    necessarily mean that the patch has been tampered with. More    likely, a non-substantive change (such as a revision to the README    file) has altered the checksum of the tar file. The SunSolve patch    database is refreshed nightly, and will sometimes contain versions    of a patch newer than the one on which the checksums were based.    In the future we may provide checksum information for the    individual components of a patch as well as the compressed archive    file. This would allow customers to determine, if need be, which    file(s) have been changed since we issued the bulletin containing    the checksums.    In the meantime, if you would like assistance in verifying the    integrity of a patch file please contact this office or your local    answer center.C.   How to report or inquire about Sun security problemsIf you discover a security problem with Sun software or wish to inquireabout a possible problem, contact one or more of the following:   - Your local Sun answer centers   - Your representative computer security response team, such as CERT   - This office. Address postal mail to:         Sun Security Coordinator         MS MPK17-103         2550 Garcia Avenue         Mountain View, CA 94043-1100	 Phone: 415-786-5274         Fax:   415-786-7994         E-mail: security-alert@Sun.COMWe strongly recommend that you report problems to your local AnswerCenter. In some cases they will accept a report of a security bug evenif you do not have a support contract. An additional notification tothe security-alert alias is suggested but should not be used as yourprimary vehicle for reporting a bug.D.
